A really nice surprise!,"I think too many people compare this to Monsters' Inc and Shrek in terms of animation quality. I also think that this film would have been a lot more successful, had it not been released too soon to Monsters' Inc. I thought it was a well-written film and in some case sweet too. The animation is spot on, and when I saw it at the cinema, the whole room were in hysterics in the first five minutes, because of Scrat, who was one of the funnier characters. The voice work is highly commendable, especially Ray Romano as Manny and Denis Leary as Diego. John Leguizamo has his moments as Sid. The script was well written, very funny, but sometimes especially towards the end, when the humour could have been more focused. I actually liked the sentimentality brought into the story. The baby, is one of those characters you love or hate, I warmed to him, but i never empathised with him. Although, I was really moved by the bit where Manny is seen staring at the drawing with the hunters killing mammoths. Anyway, the music score was perfect. All in all, a funny and sometimes touching picture, that had a tendency to get a bit slow, but overall this is misjudged by people. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great fun for everyone that has a sense of humour.,"With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat.The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the most enjoyable family films in the past years,"It always seems to be with these computer animated movies, to have a charm all it's own, humor that usually works all around, and (a flaw to be sure) the same plot elements fitted into different settings (notice how friendship, betrayal and a climax involving kids in some way fit into every animated movie in the past 7 years outside of Antz).  Ice Age follows that tradition being the first 20th Century Fox computer animated movie from Bunny director Chris Wedge, and it has an undeniable sweetness that can strike young and old alike.  This also goes with the laughs too.Manfred (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) join together, obvious un-wantingly at first, to return a baby to it's father. That's the plot-line and it works in it's typical way, borrowing from the two good computer flicks from last year as well (Monster's Inc. and Shrek). But what keeps young and old and inbetween alike in their seats is not the story but rather the good natured and silly humor, convinving if not always realistic surroundings and splendid voice work by the three leads.  A fine movie.One more note: while Leary, Romano and Leguizamo show off their capabilities, I jest to forget who steals a good chunk of the movie- a little squirrel chasing after an all important acorn nut throughout the pan of the movie.  Truth be told, he deserves his own TV show. A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Wish All Animated Films Were This Good!,"I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tigerThis isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A time in history when animals could talk, but humans couldn't yet!","In what amounts to a throw-back to the early, manually-animated cartoons, ""Ice Age"" chooses a very simple story around which is wrapped clever and exciting animation. Highly intelligent sabre-tooth tigers want to get revenge for the killing of one of their pack, so plot to steal the baby son of the human tribe leader. A goofy sloth (Lugiezamo) and a kind wooly mammoth (Ray Romano) rescue the child and attempt to find his parents, joined by a sly tiger (Denis Leary) who at first is planning to lead all of them into a corner so his tiger friends can help get the child back and eat the mammoth. But a series of events, and the tiger's being saved by the mammoth, causes all of them to ""bond"".The DVD is flawless. The Dolby surround sound is remarkably good, truly surrounding you with sound. The direct digital to DVD video transfer is as good, colorful, and sharp as the other recent ones like ""Toy Story 2"", ""Shrek"", and ""Monsters Inc.""  There is a whole second disk of ""extras"" which take you through the whole animated film-making process. Also a short animated film ""Bunny"" which won an oscar in 1998. Plus another ""short"" which shows the little squirrel, 20,000 years later, in an ice block drifting onto a deserted island, and his pounding of a coconut into the ground triggering the continental drift which resulted in the present day continents!  Very inventive and funny.Watching ""Ice Age"", my wife and I noticed that much of the action and pratfalls reminded us of the old ""Roadrunner"" cartoons. In the DVD extras the director mentions that those old cartoons of Chuck Jones were the insriration of many of the scenes. Yes, a throw-back to the old manually-animated cartoons, and a worthy tribute.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A great warm, funny movie in the golden age of 3D animation.","I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very nice looking pic!,"Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film. The story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour. Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality. Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
CGI fun for all.,"This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but is different in its less cartoony feel (despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures). The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end (its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different ""animals."" You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in.The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think.The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts. I came out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the sloth toy, only to be disappointed the next day when I couldn't find anything vaguely related.Which, strangely, makes the movie all the more pure.Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Charming,"I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too.

Diego (Denis Leary) is a sabertooth tiger sent to track down the baby, but he must decide which side he's on.Sid and Manfred have a great bromance. Leguizamo is especially funny as the annoying sloth. Manfred is always bothered by Sid's antics. Diego starts off with questionable motives, but eventually the three form their own special herd.This is much more for the smaller kids. There isn't the constant modern referencing.

Much better than it seems,"From the commercials and trailers, this movie looked pretty good. When I saw it at the theater, it was really good, much better than I ever would've expected.The animation is quite stunning. The story is good too, with plenty of good points about working in a team and overcoming hardships together as one.This is often compared to Shrek, while I think that Shrek is an entirely different type of movie. Even though the sloth in this movie does kind resemble the chatterbox donkey in Shrek, the two films are much different. Both films have great animation. The animation in Shrek is more colorful, while in Ice Age there is snow everywhere, so the main ground color is white.I'm sure most kids will enjoy Ice Age, even the 13 year olds will probably enjoy it too. People in the age area between 14 and 16 might think other wise.This is great, it is thrilling, enjoyable, and has a good meaning deep inside. This is one that, unlike many children's films, will probably entertain the whole family, and yes that does include teenagers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The best Ice Age film by miles,I liked Ice Age. I thought it offered a nice change to the films of Pixar (which don't get me wrong I love but everyone needs a change sometimes) and to play on the buddy comedy idea between the creatures worked well.It's a good film that works on many levels and is one that both adults and kids can enjoy. The voice talents aren't as well known to people in the UK as perhaps they are in the US with Ray Romano being the only one I knew from his great sitcom.However while I like this film I feel it could have worked much better as a stand alone film because the standard was so good and has only been cheapened by the many sequels it has now produced. Perhaps studios need to understand that not everything needs to be a franchise.,5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Oh So Very Cool.,"Excellent computer-generated animated feature that makes a case for one of the finest films of 2002. It is the frozen era and prehistoric animals try to find their way to land that is warmer and drier. An early group of human hunters become the hunted themselves as a group of sabertooth tigers begin to plot revenge. As an attack occurs, a small infant child is taken out of harm's way. Enter a kind wooly mammoth (voiced by the priceless Ray Romano) and a silly sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) who find the young child and decide to return it to the humans. It appears that a sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary) is helping the duo, but his motives are devious as he is trying to lead them all into a trap of other sabertooth tigers. The film is another great animated piece of film-making that has important messages for the youngsters and is also highly entertaining for all audiences. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Nostalgic and sweet,"It's hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old. We would watch it whenever we went over to a certain family friend's house, as I think it was the only kid's movie he owned. That wonderful friend is dead now, so I guess this movie holds a special place for me.Is it stupid sometimes? Yes. Is the humor a bit cringey sometimes? Yes. But this is a movie about feeling lost and out of place. Each of the characters is lonely, in their way. 3 band together to make sure 1 no longer has to be lonely, and along the way, they become a 'herd'.Manny's eyes are what make it so amazing; his eyes when he silently looks at the human mother, asking him to save her baby.

Mildly Entertaining,"Keeping up with the standard Disney fair, heartstrings are pulled, comic side kicks abound, and funny looking computer animated characters are created once again.. Is it any good?  Well It seems to be fairly good for kids and adults alike..Take a tree sloth, a wooly mammoth, and a sabertooth tiger who end up adopting a child in hopes to return it to some humans tribe.  While the animation looks great and some of the voices are a perfect match (particularly Ray Romano as the Mammoth), there is still a lot of formulaic plotting meant to sheepishly tug at your heartstrings..  The animation is quite good, particularly a running repeating montage involving a squirrel like character and his desire to crack an acorn throughout the film.  There are also some pot shot humour that is clearly aimed at kids, (gags involving doo doo) and adults alike (We have to be the most screwed up herd in history)..So I guess all in all it turns out ok, but not a good picture, yet not a bad one eitherRating 6.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Could have been much better,"This movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average funny units, but it did not have any parts that were really bad either.

There were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better.  This is a good movie for kids. It has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"cute, clever, entertaining","`Ice Age' emerges as one of the better animated films of recent years, cleverly designed and even more cleverly written.  Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.`Ice Age' is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, `Ice Age' derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.The animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.   Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.  One could wish, perhaps, for a bit less sentimentality at the end, but that is a minor quibble in a film that works so well for both children and adults.  The kids will revel in the cuteness of the animals and the clever action sequences, while adults will savor the sly knowingness of the evolutionary and historical in-jokes.  Not bad in an era when most films can't find a way to please even ONE audience demographic.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
The best Non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels of Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon,"Generation after generation, Pixar and Dreamworks Animation has started to become very successful CGI animation companies creating such great hits like Toy Story (1995) a story about toys who come to life and face many villains and many dangers in lost of their adventures and Shrek (2001) about an ogre who is sent on a mission with his donkey friend to rescue a princess in an epic tale of pop culture references, but before they continue making more groundbreaking movies, Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox Animation, seems to be facing those two companies as they make their first debut in the CGI animation genre by making this their very first masterpiece from the past ten years, ""Ice Age"", a story about three Paleolithic animals named Manny, a mammoth, Diego, a saber-tooth tiger, and Sid, a sloth on an adventure to return a baby to the human tribe.Considering that I watched this a few times on video when I was little child after it's release in theaters in 2002 and still loved it even as a young adult, this film is the best non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels as Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon which also became a masterpiece in 2010 after this one.The story is very original with likable characters and includes touching and emotional scenes where Manny discovers that his kind were killed by the humans and I actually felt sorry for him seeing how we humans had done such a terrible thing in killing animals in terms of live-action and animation. It also has hilarious dialogue and laugh-out-loud comedy including where Diego and Sid try to cheer the baby up with Sid getting hit by Manny causing him to make a weird face which caused me to laugh my head off.The strongest aspects of the film are the animation and the voice cast. The visuals are lovely with the impressive look of the mountains and the look of the ice glaciers while having great character animation with the animation on the animals as the best. The voice actors are great. Ray Romano did a good job as Manny, Denis Leary did great as Diego, but I think John Leguizamo as Sid and the evil saber-tooth tiger named Soto (which is, in my opinion, the best non-Disney villain in an animated film since Rasputin from Anastasia due to his dark nature and intent on killing the baby) voiced by Goran Visnjic steal the show.The orchestra score from David Newman is also the strongest aspect of the film with a great opening sequence and a great song ""Send Me On My Way"" while having a mixture of drama, suspense, and emotion.Since this film became so popular it spawned two sequels with a fourth one coming this year, but not only that. It became a start of Blue Sky Studios' career in making other CGI films including Robots, Horton Hears A Who, and Rio and although not as compelling as this film, they were both enjoyable and fun. Since I still loved it, Ice Age will remain one of the greatest masterpieces of computer animation since Toy Story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Uneven, But Still Fun in a Cutesy Way","Millions of years ago (or thousands, depending on your religious beliefs) a squirrel-rat forced an acorn into a crack in the ice, causing an avalanche that kicked off the Ice Age.At least, that's what this silly diversion of a movie would have you believe.And the comic relief provided by that squirrel-rat character (known as Scrat) as he repeatedly tries to find a hiding place for that acorn is the highlight of an otherwise uneven but sporadically funny, though at times mean-spirited family movie.After the Ice Age hits, herds of prehistoric mammals start migrating towards warmer temperatures.  A sloth named Sid (voiced by a lisping John Leguizamo) gets left behind by his family (not surprising, considering how annoying this odd-looking little creature is) and takes up with a brooding woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano).Meanwhile, a pack of sabre-tooth tigers led by the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic) attacks a tribe of primitive humans.  One human mother manages to get away with her baby, but is chased down by Soto's second-in-command Diego (Dennis Leary).  Soto commands Diego to bring the baby back at all costs.And wouldn't you know, the baby is found by Sid and Manfred, who decide to guard him and get him back to his family.Essentially a road movie without cars, the rest of the plot follows the adventures of Sid, Manfred and Diego in their trek across the tundra played mostly for laughs.  Which is why the occasional lapses into dramatic territory (such as the revelation of what happened to Manfred's family, and the rather violent end that comes to one of the villains) seem to come in from another movie altogether.The animation is good, but noticeably inferior to the similarly plotted MONSTER'S INC; but then I don't think they were going for realism here.  All of the characters look like three-dimensional cartoons.Overall, it's a passable time-killer with a few good laughs, and a storyline that's just predictable enough to keep you comfortable.Sort of like a comfy old coat that's been worn a few too many times.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Overall review,"I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says ""Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!"" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the ""tigers""...""Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..."" or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind ""putting sloths on the map"" and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is ""Brother Bear"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Ice Age (2002),"I've missed this animated movie when it was out in Singapore a few years back. Since the sequel is hitting our shores real soon, I thought I'd better get myself up to speed with the original movie, lest I miss out on some references used in the sequel. You see, must do homework mah? It has been 4 years since this movie was released, but I am marveled at the level of animation detail that was already incorporated - the ice never looked as white or as menacing, and the scenes of water in this movie, could have been the real thing. It really is that good. Which is quite surprising, considering that Ice Age was only Fox Animation Studios' attempt after their initial offering of Titan AE.The beginning of Ice Age comprised of that extra long trailer featuring Scrat (the part squirrel part rat animal) trying to bury its acorn into the ice. Yes, it's the same one, which lead directly to a scene which looked straight out of A Land Before Time. The prehistoric animals are making their way down south, but somehow, Manny the Mammoth decides to leave the herd, and head up north instead. He meets Sid the Sloth, and they begin an uneasy alliance - you know, the usual bored character meets witty-but-irritating character routine.At the same time, some sabre-tooth tigers have ambushed some early-humans (they don't speak), and their prized target, a human baby, escapes. Diego gets appointed by the pack to hunt the baby down and deliver it, so that they can exact revenge. But alas the baby gets saved rather reluctantly by Manny and Sid, and Diego has to use its cunning to infiltrate the group, and complete its mission.It's a simple movie with mature themes, infused with madcap comedy. I especially enjoyed the crazy sequence with the dumb dodo birds - after watching this, you'd think that they deserve to be extinct! But anyhow, central to the themes is that of sacrifice and friendship. It got played out really well, since you have a double agent amongst the group of unlikely friends. And it is precisely this that the sequel can be born.As with most animation flicks these days, look out for some spoofs, especially in the cave (with the UFO), and pay close attention to the dialog - lots of gems to listen out for. It's an interesting caper, and the sequel, yes I'm awaiting.This Code 1, two-discs special edition comes with features filled to the brim. The first disc contains an audio commentary, interactive games, both widescreen and fullscreen formats, and the usual audio selection and subtitles. The second discs comes with an animated short Scrat's Missing Adventure, an HBO behind the scenes special, a making-of documentary, 6 deleted scenes, 6 production featurettes, trailers, and a clip from Blue Sky Studio's Oscar winning film ""Bunny"".

Animation of the Year - Don't Miss It!,"Ice Age is not only Animation of the Year (in my eyes) it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen!The teaser excited me last year and I've spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat is cool! And so are the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes.The animation is superb. Your heart really goes out to the characters in this film. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to say which one really steals the picture.I experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing was forced or over done. The emotion was genuine, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film to affect me this deeply was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988.

If you were to compare ICE AGE to SHREK, the Mammoth takes the part of Shrek, while the Sloth takes the part of the won't-stop-talking Donkey. The squirrel you've seen in the trailers is actually a transitional character added mostly for comic relief between scenes. He adds a Road Runner style to the film.Filmed in three-dimensional computer animation (similar to SHREK) the film is visually quite good.

Although it may not be Original we are Won Over by the Great Characters and Humor,"Around the early 21st century computer animated family films had really taken off. Through the recent hits of Shrek and Monster's Inc, people started seeing money in this business. So in Blue Sky's first ever animated film they may have not been very original but the film known as Ice Age has enough charm and laughs to be very acceptable.The film takes place in the Ice Age when a sabertooth cat, a sloth and a mammoth take in the care of a lost baby and attempt to return it to the humans who have lost it.Now the story is really a cross between Shrek and Monsters' Inc. In Shrek we have the lonely character (in this film is Manny) getting crossed in the path of a lovable idiot (Sid the Sloth) that is faced with a quest and in this film it's returning the baby. Returning the baby part is just like Monster's Inc. where the characters have to return a little girl back to her room. So really story wise the film isn't that original and it's not like a good homage, it feels a little too noticeable in places. Usually when a film does this it takes me right out of the movie but because of the characters and the funny stuff they get themselves into I can't help but ignore this ""big"" problem.The characters are the best part of the film. Manny the Mammoth is the lonely character that would rather be left alone then be bothered by anyone else. He doesn't like people (or the other animals) and he really doesn't want to deal with stupid things. Yet for an animated film he has a rather deep character with a dark past that is explored in more detail later in the film. But also he is really funny making the sarcastic remarks and other smaller jokes that is really funny. Ray Romano really shines in this part and makes a mark as a different character and doesn't play Raymond Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond.The next character is the stupid and lovable and funny Sid the Sloth. He isn't that deep of a character but he really doesn't need to be. All we need to know is that he cares a great deal about the rest of the characters and just wants to be accepted. Other than that he really is ""the funny guy"" and he is really funny. John Leguizamo creates a very memorable character filled with great jokes and gags and memorable lines.The final character out of the main ones is Diego the sabertooth cat (tiger)and he is another fantastic character. He is at first set up as the villain and throughout the film you can never tell whose side he is on but you can tell that he starts to care for the other characters. Denis Leary voices him and is a great talent and a great voice. He can be serious and funny at the same time and just like the rest gives us a great show.As a bonus we get a side character named Scrat. He is the Wild Coyote of our times. He presents us with no dialogue but a good dose of some fantastically funny slapstick humor that will always make you laugh. The character has nothing to do with the story and he is just there to give a few extra laughs and the character works.The humor is the film is very well done. It may not be ground breaking by any means and some jokes are recycled from other films but really the rest of it works completely. We get slapstick humor, smart humor and some plan old good old fashion jokes. All work well and should be enjoyable for every age group.There are also some good animated action sequences, some of them really fun (like the ice cave sequence) and some of them very tense and exciting. All of them of course have jokes in there even the more serious sequences with the exception of the fight at the end. These sequences are great for people of all ages and will be enjoyed by people of all ages.Another thing the film has is a lot of heart. Throughout the film you get this theme of family and love and even loyalty along with friendship. Parts where Manny's Character is explored more is very touching and might even come as a surprise. Also near the end where we finally see Diego as he true self is also very touching and well done. Also where the characters first save the baby after the rest of the humans lose it is also very well done. In fact this film was originally supposed to a Drama instead of a family animated film but Fox would not accept it as a Drama and wanted it to be a family film. But I think a lot of the Drama Elements still carried over to the final film without being in your face about it. The film has a lot of themes and really a lot of heart which is something that is missing is a lot of recent non-computer animated films.The animation on the film is really good too. It might not be as good as Pixar or DreamWorks buts it wasn't trying to be. The film has animation that looks very good and state of the art but it maintains a more classic animated film. So the animation is good but it's nothing grand and I think it works for a film like this.The Bottom Line is this is a very funny animated film that has some great animated characters and is very well drawn out and funny and even though the film sometimes feels like a copy of other films the film has enough charm and touching moments to make us forget about it.Final Score8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Predictable and Annoyingly Stupid; Pixar Wannabe,"After all the stuff I'd heard about this film being above average, I was disappointed. The jokes are lame and puerile, the story predictable, the characters annoying, and the animation is surprisingly poor quality. It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's obviously trying to be as smart as a Pixar film and it fails miserably. If you haven't seen it, you haven't missed much.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
You're an embarrassment to nature...,"This was great. I liked it better than I did Shrek, by far. 'Manfred' and the Squirrel really take the cake here-excellant voice work, nice animation of the character faces, Denis Leary was a hoot too....with just the right amount of an edge, as is usual for him.Some of the vignettes-the Dodos, (You've got three melons), etc are right up there with anything Pixar has done. I also thought that the little montage of Mannfred's parent's(cave drawings come to life) were done well too.As for the messages-'Non-trad families are okay too-', people can work together, etc.-well, all are pretty obvious and all that-but it's not hammered home ala Disney, and you also don't have anyone breaking out into song, either.See it for the Mammoth and the squirrel, though the Sloth is fun too.

Ice Age: The only 2002 film that is not Sylvialess,"""Ice Age"" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge, AND PLEASE NOTE: the sound of Scrat's screams is the sound of Tom's screams from the ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons), a woolly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano of ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), a sloth named Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo of ""Titan A. E.""), and a saber toothed tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"").The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that, he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). Sid comes out of his cave yawning, and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately, he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), a female orange sloth, who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny, and they became friends.Meanwhile, nearby a human tribe, Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic), an evil saber toothed tiger, wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son, Roshan, away from him. In the morning, he, Diego, and Soto's henchmen, Lenny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), Oscar (voiced by Diedrich Bader), and Zeke (voiced by Jack Black) attacked the tribe, but the leader's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after. Eventually, Diego joins them, and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe, who are also looking for him as well. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? Besides Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, Sylvia, and Roshan, the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan's tribe are using, and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer (voiced by Jane Krakowski), and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel (voiced by Lorri Bagley), to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit. Incidentally, the two rhinos, Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI's ""Madagascar""), and Frank (voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo""), who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff, are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos, who are using melons as their food supply.The gags in this movie are very funny. For instance, Manny talks through his trunk saying, ""I'M NOT GOING!"" When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit, Sid asks Jennifer ""What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens?"" Jennifer then responds to him, ""What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT!?"" Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist. Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth, then she asks Sid if he's holding his breath, tells Diego to eat him, and promptly walks off.Since ""Ice Age"" is not only a success, but it has 2 sequels: the first one was ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", which was released in 2006, and the other was ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" will be like.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A good addition to the CGI genre,"At the dawn of a new ice age, three mismatched creatures have been thrust together by fate. They stumble upon a human baby and decide that they will take it back to its family, and so begins their journey, where they have to learn to trust and respect each others species if they are to survive and succeed.Ice Age is 20th Century Foxes answer to already well established works from Disney/Pixar and Dreamworks, and i'm happy to say that this film is a strong competitor, although it isn't as good as Shrek, Finding Nemo or the Toy Story films.Ice Age has plenty of funny characters, bags of humour and a nice sprinkle of charm and sentiment, which helps to make it an appealing movie for the whole family.7/10 It's not the greatest, but its definitely worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the best cartoons from the early 2000's,"A true classic from my childhood. The characters are fun and charming, with their own individual personalities and unique traits. The animation is bright and colorful, and the story is engaging and exciting. The comedy is also on point, making The Ice Age a fun and entertaining movie for all ages. In comparison to the original, the sequels to The Ice Age suffer from a lack of cohesive plot, reduced quality of animation, and weaker comedic timing. They also fail to capture the charming simplicity and wonder of the original film. The plot lines lack depth and focus, and the characters feel one- dimensional and underdeveloped.

"A film I watched countless times, which I then re-watched years later only to find it less enjoyable than I remembered.","Ice Age is a good movie, there is no doubt about that. As with most popular animation flicks, it appeals to all ages and has a decent enough mix of humour to keep all the family entertained. I loved Ice Age growing up and have memories of it being one of the favourite animated movies of all time. Having re-watched it at weekend, 7 or 8 years after previously viewing it, I felt a little flat. Sid seriously carries the film, many of the jokes and the majority of the dialogue comes through him. The supporting cast all do a pleasant job, Manny is entertaining and they do share some good chemistry but the film relies heavily on Sid's presence.I couldn't help but compare Ice Age to two very famous animated movies. The relationship between Sid and Manny and the unlikely relationship that they develop is reminiscent of Shrek and Donkey. The way they take care of the baby, taking him into their tribe, naming him Pinky and looking after him and getting emotionally attached as they search for his parents, reminded me too much of Monsters Inc. I don't know how I didn't see these comparisons in the past but upon recent viewing they were far too blindly obvious.With a run time of less than 1 hour 20 minutes, Ice Age really struggles with the pacing. It takes 20 or so minutes to introduce all the characters and get the plot in order then it flies through the next hour! We see scenes which could have added a little more depth - the drawings of Mammoths on the cave wall for example, this was brushed aside very quickly which I thought was a shame. I personally think Ice Age could have benefited with being 15-20 minutes longer.With the negatives that I have mentioned above being considered, I still think Ice Age is a very good film! It is funny, feel good, caring and creative. An aspect that I especially liked was that the animals didn't have a home, they weren't based anywhere, it was essentially a road trip. They moved from place to place, out of their comfort zone with only each other for support and guidance. I appreciated the message behind the story and enjoyed how the movie panned out as it progressed. The on screen relationship between Sid and Manny is very well done and Diego is a decent enough addition to the group. The story is pleasant if not a little clichéd and the comedy is a decent mix of slapstick and subtle humour. This is certainly the strongest film in the Ice Age franchise and certainly worth a watch!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
the only person in the world to dislike this? Probably,"I disliked Ice Age from the time I first saw the trailer. So when I finally went to see it with my girlfriend to avoid taking her to Blade II, I was not looking forward to it but hoped for the best. Unfortunately my worst fears came true : I didn't like this movie one bit. The main reason is the character design, which I find to be hideous to such a degree that I cannot identify with any of the characters. Sid the Sloth looks yucky (like a really filthy plush toy), the sabre tooth tigre's facial features are just wrong, etc. Only the baby is appealing. I did find myself wondering whether I would have enjoyed the film if I had felt the character design was more attractive, but I doubt it somehow (I liked Shrek's designs but found that to be a big disappointment too, though still better than this). The plot is very predictable, the baby's mother dies but no one cares, the drama is wonky (the sabretooths cannot defeat a single human in their raid on the encampment - which makes them weak as villains - yet the immensely powerful Manny the Mammoth seems to be helpless before them in the finale though he can throw giant brontotheriums through the air with the greatest of ease), the emotional arc doesn't make sense (Manny has lost his wife and child to human hunters - so he finds closure by saving a human baby??? Very noble, but does this make sense? Saving the offspring of those who destroyed your life?), the creation of the bonds between the mismatched 'herd' never really gells, and the humour is to my mind very often forced. And I do not find Scrat's being picked on by fate to be funny in the slightest.However, I know I'm in an absolute minority with this one. I just had to vent... :-)",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The best film in the series.,"""Ice Age"" is undoubtedly one of the best movies in the franchise and probably the deepest. It's impressive how the film develops such layered, meaningful characters. Manny, the mammoth, brings an emotional weight rarely seen in animated movies: he's a sorrowful character, haunted by the loss of his entire family, hunted by humans. Beside him is Sid, the sloth, who adds humor and lightness, balancing Manny's seriousness with his carefree, impulsive personality, making their duo truly memorable. The dynamic is rounded out by Diego, the saber-tooth tiger, who initially joins the group to betray them but ends up transformed after Manny saves his life, making him reconsider his motives.This character development is what makes ""Ice Age"" so special, exploring themes of friendship, redemption, and empathy in a lighthearted yet impactful way. Unlike the sequels, which often focused more on comedy and exaggerated adventures, the first movie strikes a unique balance between humor and emotion, giving depth to each character and making the story captivating and meaningful. For me, this emotional richness and character transformation make it the best film in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best animation of 2K first decade (screen) (DVD),"This is simple: this feature has all: great characters, original story, excellent design, matching score! A lot of animations try to be funny but fail: here's i laugh from the beginning to the end, thanks to Sid, Scrat and his nut. Next, the other animations want also to move the audience but fail to carry the message in an easy way: here, the friendship between the trio and the family values are depicted simply and directly: no boring dialogs, through painted cavern for example! At last, this animation is superb with his close ties to Nature: the environment is stunning: simple and soft colored! The animals, even the heroes, stay animals: they don't try to fake humans.

silly and entertaining,"This was a fun movie. It's perhaps more ""silly"" and kid oriented than some other recent computer animated films like Shrek or Monsters Inc. which work on 2 levels.  The majority of humor here is physical, reminiscent of early Looney Toons cartoons or even Three Stooges style violence-as-humor horsing around.  The kids in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it.  The only concession to adult-level humor appeared to be a Pumbaa & Timon inspired possibly-gay rhino couple.The message is pretty basic, involving standing by your friends, but that still didn't stop it from being fun.  And despite the carnivore vs. plant eater premise, and the humorous violence, the actual level of violent threat was minimal, with only one real death and that being off screen.The animation style was interesting, looking more like claymation than computer. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. The surfaces looked smooth and realistically 3D. Like it was a physical object, but the blockiness made it clear it wasn't ""real."" But the look worked for the film. It certainly never looked computer created, however it also lacked that level of realism seen in movies like ""Dinosaur.""  These creatures and this world were highly stylized, from the sloth's wide set eyes, to the sabre-tooth's almost disembodied lower jaws.The voice talents of the leads were quite well done, with each actor essentially playing himself (or his well known persona).  Ray Romano, plays the large wooly mammoth Manfred with an arrogance and attitude appropriate for his size, but with an underlying vulnerability and pathos.  John Leguizamo has the enviable role of motormouth sloth, Sid, essentially the comic foil to Romano's straight man (mammoth).  Dennis Leary is rather sedate as Sabre-tooth tiger Diego, toning down his usual hyperactive vocal mannerisms to a more kid-friendly level. His seems to be the only character who's appearance was modeled directly from actor.A minor complaint is that aside from a brief opening ""migration"" sequence featuring a number of humorous prehistoric mammals, strange enough in appearance to rival any dinosaur (my personal favorites are the glyphodons, early ancestor's to modern armadillos), there are no female characters. This is a story for the boys, again reinforcing the Three Stooges style silliness.A film the kids will love and parents will be able to sit through without squirming.  Depending on your tolerance for silliness, you may even enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This Would've Been Better Off Stand-Alone,"Just like Home Alone, Ice Age is another one of the perfect examples of a movie that's better off stand-alone instead of a franchise. But it was not only a good start for Blue Sky, it's also one of my favorite movies from them next to Peanuts. I know this is from the early 2000s and this is how the animation looked, but some of the animation can be dated. But it still looks good on its own. The rest of the film is fun to watch that's both funny and heartwarming, especially with Manny's connection to the baby. The story is solidly written. And there may be a few characters, but that's actually what the other films should've done. Add a few characters that feel relative to the plot and they can have good development. If you're in to get both a good laugh and something to feel, this is the kind of film for you. In fact, this is a good example of what a stand-alone film should've been.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Fun and entertaining but perhaps a tad overrated,"'Ice Age' was hugely popular when I was growing up and has remained a fan-favourite after all these years. It gets the balance between being a kids movie while also appealing to older audiences just about right, which would explain why it is such at hit with people of all ages.This is certainly a good, fun family film and I remember getting a lot of enjoyment out of it as a kid. However, when comparing it to some of the other main animated family films of the 2000s, I can't agree with the ratings that put it among the best. For me, 'Ice Age' isn't in the same league as classics like 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles'.'Ice Age' is a good animated film that works for all ages, but I can't help but feel it is a little overrated. It doesn't have that special something that all the best animated family films have, but what that is I'm not quite sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

This animal bunch entertains all ages,"This is the first of what was to become a series of animated films with animal characters living in the ice age. Ostensibly for children, it carries a PG rating. It could be because of some of the mild violence that's shown, and some of the scary characters – notably the lions. But more than likely, it's because of the humorous dialog that at times is adult. Indeed, I think ""Ice Age"" and it's follow-up films were made more for adults than for kids.It is funny and entertaining, and I think suitable for the whole family. It's one of a small field of films that all ages will sit still for. The little tykes like the fuzzy, cute and bug-eyed animal characters. The young kids and teens will like the action and antics. And adults mostly will enjoy the dialog.This one was a big hit and the sequels continue to draw the crowds.

"Ice Age may not have the glamor of classic Disney productions or Shrek's acid sarcasm, but even so, it's one of the best and most entertaining animations","With the advent of computer graphics, animations have been one of the most profitable sectors of the film industry, with some products even reaching close to 1 billion at the worldwide box office. But for a long time that slice was only in the hands of Pixar / Disney and DreamWorks. Given this, Fox even tried to develop its own animation with the weak Titan A. E., which did not get the desired result by the producers. Therefore, Ice Age was launched with the studio's expectation to change this economic scenario, but was the quality of the film also prioritized?When we finish watching Ice Age, we get the feeling that we could have received more and we get that strange feeling when the credits go up, and this is due specifically to the script, too simple in its ambitions, without much news. However, this is the typical animation that is gradually conquering its audience, more because of the elements it brings together - like the characters, absolutely charismatic - rather than the set presented. And a more careful review is enough to see how strong its effect is today, so long after its debut.The story takes place 20 thousand years ago, when thousands of animals must migrate towards the south due to the beginning of the glacial period. Parallel to this, a tribe of Eskimos also needs to flee, but halfway through it ends up losing a baby. Luckily (or unlucky) for him, the grumpy mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and the sloth who, with pardon the pun, are too lazy to think, Sid (John Leguizamo), find him. Like Shrek and the Donkey (released a year earlier, by the way), the two create a friendship by leaps and bounds until the arrival of the saber-toothed tiger Diego (Dennis Leary), who, at first, becomes the villain of the story. Of course, even the boy's surrender to the human tribe takes place in various amusing situations, from the teasing between the main trio to the disastrous attempts of the most neurotic squirrel in the world to get away with his nut. Scrat, by the way, is the poster boy for Ice Age to this day. It is impossible not to associate it when we think of the film.When we talk about imagination, the best way we have to release it is through cartoons. It's a run there, run here, supernatural jumps, stretches of body parts beyond normal, animals talking, a sloth making snowboard, a squirrel falling off a gigantic cliff and then being trampled by countless animals, like the little mouse on the leaf... and why not try to imagine a mammoth falling into a river of lava and then being thrown up by a jet of hot air? This way, it is easy to make children laugh and even some adults.With a simple reading of the synopsis it is possible to notice that the script, written by Michael Berg, does not have originality as a positive point, since, other films have already had premise stories where characters with differences need to stay together for a greater reason, such as those already mentioned Toy Story (with Woody and Buzz) and Shrek (with Shrek and Burro). In the case of Ice Age, there is Manny, extremely serious; and Sid, extremely chatty, with the mammoth constantly trying to get rid of the sloth, which insists on staying together and achieves its goal through insistence, becoming even more like Shrek's plot.Can we notice that the first act uses resources to unite the characters that end up being left without answers, as, for example, because Manny was going to the north while all the other animals migrated to the south? Or, why did Sid's family abandon him and travel without him? To make matters worse, the tigers, which can be considered villains of the plot, at no time really transmit fear, right in the first scene in which they are presented they fail to try to attack a small village of humans, showing themselves, from the beginning, incompetent in your pretensions.However, the story has merits, getting it right by developing a family relationship between the characters, using a narrative that can be considered surprisingly modern, with an outcome that shows how family does not always have to be blood, but who creates and cares, since all the protagonists are alone (for various reasons) and find support in animals of other species. But the story is not limited to that and even has an anti-conservative line, as in the moment when Diego meets Sid and Manny to try to capture the baby and says ""You are a strange couple. Oh I see, they want to adopt because they can't have one"", that is, even if in a subtle way, the film addresses the existence of same-sex couples.Another positive point of the script is the humor, developed not only through the dialogues that highlight the difference between the protagonists, but also in the moments when Scrat appears. In addition to serving as a good comic relief, the squirrel scenes move the plot, such as, for example, the cold period that begins because he breaks a glacier while trying to bury his nut, that is, in addition to being funny, his moments do not are in the feature for no reason.The Ice Age stands out nobly, even in the face of recent projections, which show considerable technological advancement. At the time, FOX invested heavily in the scenes; true paintings, such a richness of their colors and the perfection of the built landscapes. In addition, all this adapted to an agile script, with simple characters, but that are kept in our memory for a long time. Perhaps because of the simplicity of the plot, it is very easy to admire the qualities of his characters. The fact helps them to be well explored in their personalities. Not to mention the technical qualities, the look in which animals are really believed to live in that prehistoric period, to the perfection of their textures. Even the detail of the characters' hair is incredible, such a dedicated work by the filmmakers.The best thing about the drawing is that it was not ashamed of being short. Perhaps even as a strategy, because if it were soon, it would possibly become tiring. Many films of the genre are ashamed of not exceeding the 90-minute barrier and create situations that are of little use or curl up to solve some plot outcome. ""The Ice Age"" is not succumbed to this evil. The design has an impressive synthesis power, helping to maintain a dynamic rhythm.To give you an idea, during most of the film, we realized that the Manfred mammoth has some trauma in its past, but we don't know what it is about. When the time comes to show this trauma, the director does not call for a long and monotonous flashback. Instead, it uses an extremely simple feature that has a poetic beauty - also used in the animations of Clone Wars (cartoon made to show an excerpt from the Star Wars trilogy that was not explored in the films, which was shown on the Cartoon Network). Using the paintings that the men left on the wall of a cave, we learned in a few seconds what happened. And the scene still imparts an almost human dimension to the character Manny, by showing his attempt to do exactly what his executioners were unable to accomplish for him.Analyzing the English dubbing, I feel completely satisfied. Ray Romano makes Manny fit his voice perfectly, or vice versa. I ask: Would you imagine another voice for that gigantic, yet affectionate, mammoth? I could not. Okay, we can imagine several other voice actors for Diego, so we have many actors with bold voices for the character. In such a way, Denis Leary was chosen, who fulfilled his role perfectly. Diego's band also boasted well-framed voices, such as those of Jack Black (""School of Rock"") who brought the vocal chords of the character Zeke and Goran Visnjic (""Elektra"") to life, for those of Soto. In turn, Chris Wedge voices Scrat. Chris already had the experience of being a voice actor in the animated film ""Robots"". As for Sid, we see that behind every great animation character, we have a great voice actor. This is John Leguizamo. Stupendous is the lazy creature and even better his voice, which by itself, can already cause some laughs.A great success by Fox, which at the time only got along with animations (despite the good Anastasia, 1997, and Titan A. E., 2000). Not only was the box office surprising (almost $ 400 million worldwide), but the name of Brazilian co-director Carlos Saldanha was raised to stardom, giving him the opportunity to direct two more sequels of this saga (in 2006 and 2009), in addition to Rio (2011). As it is aimed at children, the film calls for some easy jokes, trying to force a laugh from the viewer. This feature works very well among children, who prefer a more visual joke, but which is lost when seen by a more mature audience. Ultimately, Ice Age may not have the glamor of classic Disney productions or Shrek's acid sarcasm, but even so, it's one of the best and most entertaining animations today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
THREE MAMMALS AND A BABY?  Exactly.,"I didn't think much ICE AGE. Never mind the drab visual look or the predictable plot.  What annoyed me was its unrealized premise.I dunno, but why do these animals need to speak? Disregard, as I have, the fact that English wasn't around when the movie was set. What bothered me was the laziness of the scriptwriters. Wouldn't the movie be more creative if the animals didn't speak at all? How about telling the story through their own means - with body language and grunts and whatnot. What's the point in making a movie about animals if all you're gonna do is supply them with recognizable human characteristics? Sure, it'd be terribly difficult to make this movie without dialogue, but it'd be possible right? Think of all the money to be saved without hiring B-list actors to supply the voices.This would also eliminate another gripe I had - the anachronistic dialogue. At one point Manfred spoke of a ""petting zoo."" Would zoos have been in existence at the time the movie takes place, much less the petting variety? Another quip had to do with a slalom; I don't believe any form of sport exist back then, especially not a sophisticated zigzag skiing type.I guess I'm too hard on these kiddie movies. I still haven't figured out exactly what Stuart Little is (a mouse, or a boy who looks like a mouse? And why doesn't his family treat him as such? Are they blind, or just stupid?), so maybe I should stop watching them.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...""","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The animation (while not as polished as that of PIXAR; it resembles a really advanced PS2 offering) is loose and energetic.But the best thing about ""Ice Age"" is the humor.  I swear, this is the best movie for people who are going into ""Far Side"" withdrawal pangs.  That said, this might not be the best choice for really little kids.As for the rest of us, enjoy the movie ""Dinosaur"" had mad delusions of being.

Sub-zero heroes on an adult-humoured adventure,"I've been having a bit of an animation treat lately with films such as Robots, Finding Nemo, Shrek II and Ice Age and while I may have had my favourite all along, this viewing cemented ""Ice Age"" as the best of the bunch. It holds up amazingly well since its primary focus is not meticulous animation (like DreamWorks focus on), but story and humour. Sure, you could probably find an animated film with more heartfelt messages and substance than this (Finding Nemo), but I dare you to find a funnier one. This film remains completely unrivaled in the laugh-department.Its sequel, Ice Age: The Meltdown, rode largely on this humour advantage throughout and unsurprisingly suffered a few pitfalls when it attempted to 'get serious' by adding morals and messages. Thankfully, Ice Age does not have this problem because it knows it is mostly funny and it makes no pretense about it. Make no mistake however; it was originally written as a drama and therefore still has a lot of story to fall back on  the story of three outcasts turned Sub-Zero heroes (Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger) joining up to return a human baby to its herd  and all the detours, diversions and conflicts that this journey entails, pinning the stunningly hilarious prehistoric rodent-squirrel Scrat somewhere in between, collecting his acorns. No words can describe how funny this character is but the special short on him on the DVD extra material should give you some idea.So if there is just this one template story and humour, without heartfelt messages á la Disney/Pixar and meticulous fluent animation á la DreamWorks, then how does it manage to be such a great film? I don't know, but it is likely that its success stems from the fact that it lacks these very aspects of its peers. For example, it does not indulge in homages and references to the same extent as DreamWorks (except one little Star Trek joke squeezed in) and it never falls prey to predictable sappiness in the same way that Disney does. Without these things it therefore NEEDS a great backstory and fun characters to fall back on  and it truly does.It is a bit more adult-humoured, too. There is a continuous gay joke with the rhinos Carl and Frank, for example. It never resorts to fart or pee jokes (ok - fine, there is a poop-joke, but so what?). There is an hilarious joke about modern architecture  Manny walking past Stonehenge and remarking on how ""it'll never last."" There is subtle use of irony in all the animals being able to express themselves eloquently while no humans talk in the film. It's insightful. The children's side of things is best tended to by John Leguizamo as Sid, who has clearly done something very cool with his character which ends up catering just as much to adults as its target audience  which is probably true for the whole film.8 out 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Short, simple and fairly straightforward yet extremely well-executed, entertaining and surprisingly emotional.","It's a short, simple story with a strong structure and three somewhat stereotypical yet superbly crafted central characters, set against a unique backdrop of prehistoric permafrost that's, strangely, not often explored on film despite its interesting inhabitants and splendid scenery (not to mention the artistic licence inherent with a narrative that takes place so very long ago). The animation (and general graphic) style is rough around the edges but ultimately snappy, lively and aesthetically pleasing. 'Ice Age (2002)' paints a stylistic yet consistent world full of envelope-pushing environmental effects (ala snow and water) that ground the cartoon-esque physics and give them a proper weight. It's really the interplay of the main players that marks this piece as a cut above the rest; each of them arise as distinct individuals with believable arcs and interesting dynamics. Plus, the feature is much more emotionally affecting than you'd expect and is pretty funny, too (especially in a couple of stand-out set-pieces, most notably a dodo debacle). 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Age of the 'Blue Sky Studios',"'Ice Age' was the break which introduced Blue Sky Studios to the world; in other words it was their own lower class version of Pixar's 'Toy Story' and Dreamworks' 'Shrek'.It cannot be compared to the original 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' due to the fact they were and still are some of the finest movies to hit the big screen. They both have incredibly strong and likable story-lines as well as better characters with more developed personalities. However, 'Ice Age' is able to stand on its own two feet more than comfortably with numerous features such as its humour, its emotional presence and its strong visuals. Impressively, these fine features are consistent throughout the first three films although the fourth appears to be an anomaly in what was an entertaining franchise.When Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) makes an unlikely partnership with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), they attempt to return a lost child to its family. Sly sabre tooth Diego (Denis Leary) secretly pretends to join forces with the duo however his actual intentions appear to be with his herd.As the audience, you will develop feelings for the characters and bond with them as the duration unfolds. Romano, Leguizamo and Leary provide fantastic voice works for the main trio of characters as they provide good on-screen chemistry as well as bags of enthusiasm.Certainly one of the stronger animation collections out there, the original is awarded seven thumbs up!",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Ice Age: The Film that Jump Started Blue Sky,"When Ice Age was released in 2002, computer animation was still pretty new, but it was one of the best visual films. Starring Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo as Manny, Diego and Sid, respectively. The story was different, and it wasn't Disney, so it was kind of slow at first, but still a fairly good family film. The animation and settings were beautifully done.Even sixteen years later, Ice Age is still a popular film that has spawned a franchise, including four sequels so far. Ice Age was also the first feature film from Blue Sky Studios, who later brought us Rio, Epic and Ferdinand. Ice Age was also honored with being nominated for best animated film at the Oscars, but lost to Spirited Away.For the voice acting, Denis Leary stood out as the best of the cast. Ray Romano, who had mostly done stand-up and Everybody Loves Ray, was okay in his first voice over. And Leguizamo could have done better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Heartwarming. Brilliant animation & characters.,"While most 3D films (""Toy Story"", ""Shrek"" for example) have left me cold due to the emphasis on visuals or tasteless humour, Ice Age matches the warmth of ""The Land Before Time"" the best 2D ever made. The hyperactive, unfortunate, Scrat sets the tone right at the start. Then we meet the melancholy Manny, the irresponsible Sid, the scheming Diego & the charming Roshan (or Pinkey as they call him.) They're all uniquely lovable & you root for them to succeed. The animation itself is awe inspiring. I especially liked the cave painting sequence, Scrat's intro & the lava bridge. There are some real tear jerker moments & others of pure comedy. The supporting characters, especially the rhinos & dodos, flesh out the story nicely. There's no offensive humour & is clearly aimed to entertain, whatever your age. The soundtrack was unfortunately not released but that's great too. The casting couldn't be better. I look forward to the sequel. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""Licensed to chill""","Dream works keeps coming, hitting, but then missing. I have a hate/love relationship with their animations, but once in a while they'll hit the mark; hence Ice Age. Now this film takes the setting of the ice age and very cleverly executes it with a hint of wittiness and even a hint of emotion. The movie adventures through all these events that happened back then, and makes it funny. We even get the hilarious scene of the Dodo bird extinction. This is what makes the film for me, because they executed this setting very cleverly.The voice acting was pretty good, and the jokes were hit well. But instead of my praising of the film, I have to give it a dosage of my complaints. The characters, although funny, seemed very bland. I know that's saying a lot, because I know lots of people love these characters and their antics, but me? I don't know. They were new and original but I think they could've done something more with them. Maybe it was the plot, where they kind of took a shortcut by placing a baby in there to insert some clichéd jokes. Maybe it was the atmosphere they chose. Or maybe it was the mood I was in when I watched it. Whatever it was, I still enjoyed it and found it to be a great and original animation film, especially for the hit and miss Dream works.Nevertheless, I recommend watching Ice Age. Although I found something about it offbeat, the movie still delivers a great amount of wit and fun. I reckon the kids will enjoy it more though, and it would make out to be a great weekend movie.

Carefully timed and executed references to things that adults would recognize elicited well deserved giggles and chuckles from the moms and dads, leaving children wondering what the fun is all about.

Well, there *are* two instances involving ""poop"" but these are by no means gratuitous and have a lot to do with the development of the characters; moreover, they are actually quite funny.

I was hoping for jokes and scenarios that would appeal to both adults and children, but any attempts at more adult humor by the movie didn't go over too well. Perhaps the worst mistake that Ice Age made was casting the monotonous Ray Romano as the voice of the main character. Normally, cartoon characters need a voice with range and variety, and Romanos voice was lacking in both. The only scenes that I partially enjoyed were the ones with the squirrel, but the running-gag of the squirrel never getting the nut got old quickly.

"A mammoth, sloth and saber toothed tiger escort a human baby back to its father in the ice age. Pleasant children's film that will please most adults. 3 Flys Out Of Five","Ice Age is the latest of the 3D animated features aimed at that magic demographic  the children's movie adults can be dragged along to. Shrek, The Toy Story Double and Monster's Inc. have been huge successes in recent years.  Ice Age will do pretty well.Ice Age is less sophisticated than the others though, with a story line less likely to excite the intelligence of older viewers.Still Ice Age has its more cerebral moments. It's set while animals are migrating to beat what looks to be at least pretty harsh winter. Three youngster mammals are playing in a tar pit or mud hole. Their mother tells them to hurry up and join the herd. `You can play extinction later.'In a fun sequence the creatures are walking through an ice cave and enclosed in the walls are the entombed bodies of previously extinct animals. Then we see evidence of alien visitors from millenniums past. The anti evolutionists will be tutt tutting to the max.But the star of the show is a creature you'll see in the shorts for the feature. It's a desperate, jerky squirrel trying  to bury his acorn. He pops up throughout the film and is a fascinating show stopper.Ice Age mainly concerns three animals trying to return a baby human to its species. A wooly mammoth, a sloth and a saber toothed tiger unite in an uneasy alliance and test the odds trying to get baby home.The animation is of course astounding but seems sadly lacking when the humans hove into view. We seem to be able to move a mammoth more realistically than a human. Perhaps the animators haven't put the energy yet into animating people.

Falls Behind the Pack,"Ice Age is an example of the more slapstick, less satirical animated movie. Not too long ago this would have been regarded as a decent enough cartoon.

"More rodents; less humans, please!","This film has some good moments, most of which are clearly derivative of some of the best of Chuck Jones. The scenes with the shrew-like character (shown in the long early trailer and several other scenes in the film) were the best parts.

"Funny, serious, and heartwarming","This movie, about a woolly mammoth, a saber-toothed tiger, a sloth and a prehistoric combination of a squirrel and rat, is a great animal-adventure movie!It is such a fantastic experience for the whole family because it offers the whole package. The movie is both funny, serious, and heartwarming, making it entertaining from start to finish. It can feel slightly slow at times, but never too much. What I love most is the amount of humor.

"Funny, but does not reach greatness","This was a nice film, it was funny and so on but it had a major flaw: It embraces many classic Hollywood clichés. At points it is almost too much with all the classic plot evolution that can be found in a not insignificant number of other titles, mostly found in the adventure and action genres.The dialog was witty in a very characteristic Hollywood manner and if you don't like that this film might get a little annoying but not impossible to watch.The animation is surprisingly cubistic for a film made in 2002 and that could be allright if it were a stylistic move but that is not obvious from the film. If you compare it to such resent computer animated films as ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" and ""Shrek"", both are by the way made before Ice Age, you will probably be disappointed if you wanted a brilliantly animated film.With this I want to say that this is a nice film, worth the time to watch but does not give much more than an average Hollywood production.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Still one of my favorite animated films!,"Oh wow, this was simply awesome! From the animation to the great premise, this was an exciting and funny action adventure ride. This beautiful film has it all: humor that is really funny, thrilling action and adventure, wonderful characters and voice overs. The humor is brilliantly original and never really slapstick.The film also features much darker elements like double crossing, scheming, and evil plans of revenge. There are also very sincere and emotional moments, like a mother willing to sacrifice everything to save her child, a mammoth longing for a family, and a villain becoming a hero. The cute factor is evident throughout the film, and the characters steal your heart every step of the way. The squirrel, Scrat, is just lovable and adorable!!

no Toy Story or Shrek - but kids loved it!,Well we just came back from this movie and it met our expectations - the kids loved it but not a classic like Toy Story or Shrek.

This is especially true with a running gag where this squirrel is trying to bury an acorn - Hilarious!

Why not call it the Big Chill or the Nippy era?,"I'm just sayin', how do we know it's an ice age? Because of all the ice!There's no deny that ice age is one of the biggest animated franchises of the 21st century. And this year it's first installment is turning 20 years old. Back then, a small company called Blue sky tried to compete with Dreamworks and Pixar by making an animated film set 20,000 years ago during an ice age. Sounds like an ambitious project, right? Originally it was planned to be a 2D film directed by Don Bluth (Who's also responsible for another prehistoric movie Land before time), but due to CGI dominating the Hollywood movie industry and the hand drawn animation department of 20th Century fox shutting down, the idea moved to Chris Wedge. Now that we know about it's brief production history, let's talk about the plot itself.Three animals: Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary) have to return the human baby back to the tribe while avoiding other tigers that want to hunt the baby down. It may sound like a very simple plot, where the characters have to go through obstacles to achieve their goal, while also dealing with each other, learning their mistakes and slowly, but surely becoming friends along the way. However, what makes the film memorable is the humour. I laughed a lot of times throughout the movie, especially when Scrat the squirrel was on screen, chasing his acorn around and the scene with the dodos where they have to protect the watermelons at all cost or else there will be doom and they'll attack others karate style. I also liked the ice slide scene, where the characters had to catch the child while sliding on ice in a cave like in a water park. But it's not just laughs, it also has a lot of emotional scenes like with the cave paintings or the intense final battle between the tigers and the main characters.Speaking of the cast, there isn't a lot of characters on screen, but each one of them is memorable and likeable. Starting with Sid, he's a goofball kind of character who would always be in some kind of trouble, and when he tries to solve it, he somehow fails. After he ruined the rhinos dinner, Sid ran into Manfred, that he started to annoy after the mammoth rescued him. At first Manny may seem grumpy and dislike his new companion a lot, but once we learn why he's like this, we realise that he had a dramatic moment of his life, which made him lonely. And after saving the baby, he became more friendly and open minded and realising that not all humans and tigers are evil. Diego used to be cunning villain that wanted to trick the duo in order to bring the infant to his tribe to eat him up, but as the plot progresses, the feline realises that just because he's a carnivore, doesn't mean he should be a menacing animal, and he decided to join the good side with his new friends. I feel like Manny and Diego had a major development, and it's all thanks to Sid and his plan of saving the kid. And we also have the main villain Soto, who is the leader of tigers that wants Diego to bring the infant in order to eat him. He doesn't appear much, but when he does, you know that the heroes are in peril, and the audience can feel it as well, especially during the finale. But I simply can't talk about the ice age without mentioning one more character, he may seem minor, but when he's on screen, he immediately steals the spotlight. And it's no other than Scrat! He's such a hilarious character, where he keeps chasing the acorn, and something wrong would happen. Even though he doesn't speak at all, his screams were provided by the director himself Chris Wedge, and he did a great job. I also like his half Squirrel half rat design, I don't know whether the saber tooth squirrels were real or not, he definitely fits in the prehistoric environment.Despite all the positives I've said, it has a couple of downsides. First the animation. It's not terrible! The characters look good and creative, especially due to the fact that most animals were never animated before, which gives them it's own identity. But the rendering and textures look average for 2020s standards, so before watching it, you have to keep in mind that this animation is outdated. Some people may argue that it looks worse then Shrek and Monsters inc, despite being realised later then the others, but considering the fact that this is the studio's first film, you must give Blue sky credit for at least trying their best with the software they had back then. Another problem that I have is that it's short. It only lasts for 80 minutes and it doesn't feel like a lot. But at least it didn't add too many distracting elements and was well written, so it's not really a big issue.I can say with confidence that this movie is worth your time, regardless of your age. Both kids and adults will fall in love with the movie with it's likeable characters, heartwarming and funny story and great scenes with Scrat. Even with outdated animation, it's still a great film. This is a must watch for all animation fans out there. If you haven't seen it yet, then go check it out! As for the sequels, it depends on how you enjoyed the movie. If you think it's fine as a stand-alone one, then you can ignore them, but if you want to see how the story continues, then you can give them a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A fun and heartfelt start to one of my favorite animated franchises,"Although it's beginning does feel like a bit of a stumble to find the films tone, Ice Age manages to be a quite funny, irreverent, and heartwarming little animated flick that does manage to speak out and stand on its own against the rest of the classic early CGI films of the 2000's. If there ever was a film more perfectly cast than Ice Age, I would honestly be surprised. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary are absolutely perfect in their respective roles and truly give the life to this franchise that it truly wouldn't be able to live throughout (yes, i'm giving you some shade Disney). I did enjoy the animation style of the film, even though many may say it hasn't aged well, I thought it was a very unique look for the characters and world at hand- and honestly made it really stand out in my mind- especially as a youngun. The soundtrack is delightful, and the screenplay allows for a lot of depth for our main characters throughout the film- especially Diego and Manny who they largely do more to than the standard archetypes they represent. In the end, Ice Age may not be as sharp as Shrek or Toy Story but it stands as a good header for an iconic franchise that was a truly signature part of my childhood. I may like certain elements of the sequels better, but for a first film in a now deceased animation studio, Ice Age was a great first step.My Rating: 8.3/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Star rating: 3 out of 5,"Ice Age is the next amusing chapter in the computer-animated family film genre.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it is a rehash of the previous chapters.  It is certainly a fun film, with witty word play and some exciting action sequences, including an ice-slide ride which every child (and probably most adults too) would love to try out.  But one can't help feeling that the story is a little tired through previous overuse.  A group of unlikely acquaintances - this time comprised of a mammoth, a sloth and a sabre-toothed tiger - set out on a quest to return the obligatory lost-but-cute child to his family.The animation is adequate, but nowhere near the high standard set by Monsters, Inc.  This is particularly noticeable with regards to the various animals' fur, which is disappointingly static.  Additionally the background landscapes are very basic and the snow is somehow just too pristine.  Having said that however, the film does have some nice attention to detail, such as the eye tic in Scrat - the acorn-obsessed and incredibly unlucky squirrel. The misadventures of Scrat are the best parts of the movie, and made more impressive by the fact that, as he doesn't speak a single word of dialogue, the humour is entirely visual.There are also nice character touches evident in Manny the mammoth (who has amazingly emotive eyes), and a sequence in which a cave painting comes alive and depicts a tragic scene from his past is very effective.  While an emotional sequence like this gives the movie a heart, its descent at the finale into saccharine sentimentality is somewhat cloying, but will probably satisfy the kids (and anyone else who requires a film to have a happy ending).",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Great,"The first ice age is probably the best of the franchise. The first ice age is the best of the bunch from the reasons below:The writing does lack a bit. It is predictable and unoriginal. But, in order for the movie to be good, the story spice things with vomedy, action and a pretty clever way. The comedy comes in two diffrent ways. First, the slapstic, and second is the dialougue. The slapstic is mostly funny becuase of the execution of the animation and the dialougue is very clecer and one of the films strongest aspects. The movie may not offer much with the script, but the execution does make it good. It also not afried to show some dark themes in order to develop the main characters. Like the sadness when we intruduce to Manny's backstory, the intensity of the action, and the comedy of Sid.The animation is not the best of its time... the animation does look dated and not the best of its time. The textures are weak, the lightning sucks, the rendoring is not strong and the movements can be akward, but this film is from 2002, and even if not the best of its time, it does look good. The animators succeed on capturing the ice age feeling, the overall movements are solid, and the designs are creative and unique in a more animated look that makes them appealing. It may not look good for today, but it is well done for its time.The characters are highly enjoyable, and likeable as well. As Manny is the straight man that his goal might be to get rid of Sid, but still has enough of heart to know what is the right thing to do. Sid is more of a comedy relief, that doesn't always hit its mark, but he is mostly really funny. Diego is actualy kind of a villain, but after a while, he does show some heart to help the group. The characters has a lot of depth either, looking into thier backstory and rules in the film. Scrat doesn't have a rule here, but he is pretty funny. The characters are very likeable and well developed.Ice age is one of the best comedy animated film out there. With a very strong script that is both funny, dark, emotional, and has a very likeable characters. The only thing that drags it down is the animation, which is pretty dated. But other than that, I highly recommend you to check the first, and only the furst one out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
So charming!,"What a wonderful movie. Has its animation aged poorly? Absolutely. Has the heart that's permeating through it aged poorly? Not at all. I have seen this movie so many times. It's one of the most important films of my childhood, and yet it's still absolutely hilarious, no matter how many times I see it. I still feel deep emotion everytime I see it. All the characters are so loveable. There's of course the baby, absolutely adorable. The saber-tooth tiger pack which is filled with idiots. There's Sid the sloth, a total idiot who pretty much serves as the movies punching back and also is the main focus of the funniest scene in the movie (playing football against the dodo's) and his lactation joke is absolutely hilarious. Diego, the hunter who is supposed to kill Manny the Mammoth and the baby who is a true adventurer and has some of the best moments in the film. Manny who has been through a lot, is jaded, and wants rid of Sid, and is the master of name-calling and insulting others. Finally, who could forget Scrat? The cause of just about every problem in their world who is incapable of hiding his acorn. It's honestly a perfectly paced movie. Few films pace everything out as well as this movie does. Nothing overstays it's welcome or feels too short. They never overload you on jokes, despite the jokes seemingly coming a million miles per minute at points. If you want a charming movie that will entertain anyone, old or young, watch Ice Age. I highly recommend.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"A sheer, smooth slice of comic ice","In Ice Age, a wooly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano); a dull-witted, chatty sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), and a fierce saber-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) join to bring a lost human infant back to his father. What peril over yon hill awaits these merry travelers?Manny is the linchpin of the trio. He's a lone mammoth, staying put when all others of his kind (as well as of any other kind) begin their yearly migration to a more arid climate. Manny is morose and a little bitter, but this is quickly recognized as a facade for a warmhearted mammal. He initially wants to stay a lone mammoth, but he's soon joined by the ever-jabbering Sid, who's a little short on both brain and brawn power. When a baby human is left behind by his dying mother, Sid convinces the immovable Manny to help transport the tyke back to his family.The two are joined by Diego, a saber-tooth tiger who was in on the attack on the family and tribe of the young human. Diego's been ordered to retrieve the baby by the head tiger, who wants to do all sorts of nasty and unspeakable things to the infant. Diego's plan is to ingratiate himself with Sid and Manny, offering to take them to the area where they can meet up with the human tribe. Which is fine with Manny, who just wants to be rid of the kid - and Sid.Ice Age, then, is a good old-fashioned buddy pic. The three disparate animals, each outcast in very subtle ways, form a bond that has a common goal. Along the way, they face dangers more of the nature type than of the predator type, and each saves and is saved. But this isn't a movie about great moral lessons; it's a damn hilarious laugh-a-minute cartoon. It's aimed at kids, of course, although the style of animation (it looks a little closer to Toy Story than, say, Looney Toons) can be appreciated by adults, too.But what makes this such a cool movie is that the writing and the timing of the humor - and it's heavy into physical comedy - are impeccable. Sure, it's easier to do this with animation than with live action, but any movie at which I can laugh out loud, unprompted, at a near-constant rate is a surefire winner. Of course, at this point most kids have seen this - pardon me for being one of the last - but if you can still spot it in the theater, please do go.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Enjoyable and well done animated film,"A very enjoyable animated feature, whose plot is loosely based on 1948's classic western from John Ford Three Godfathers. Set during (of course) the last Ice Age, the story has a mammoth called Manny, an annoying sloth named Sid and a duplicitous saber tiger called Diego finding a dying human mother along with her baby. They decide to return the infant to their tribe, against all odds, and facing a series of predators (especially saber tigers, who count on Diego on helping them on the inside). Punctuating the plot, a squirrel tries to save an acorn in a series of very funny vignettes. And a running joke is that the only species that do not talk during the movie are human beings. Unfortunately, the graphics are a bit below standard (they are no match for Pixar's works).

"Well produced, but criminally short on content and originality.","Computer animation is merely a tool. Like all tools the tool actually creates nothing without human intervention and while they may be key to getting something done (this sort of  3D technique is relatively new) they are not a force by themselves. Only a new genre. Here a (talking) comic sloth, a stern mammoth and a slick mountain tiger work together to return a lost baby to its tribe. Well sort-of, but don't let me spoil one of the few lines of plot development for you!Boy is this thin and well trodden stuff. When two people can't stand each other in films you can be sure that ten minutes down-the-line they will be the best of pals, ready to die for one another. Shame real life isn't like that!Cliches are not cliches for nothing and the script writers haven't left anything obvious out - bar maybe a musical number, which would have at least been some light relief.I am reminded of a well known gag that Woody Allen once quoted in a movie about two old women in a restaurant. One says ""isn't the food here terrible."" And the other says ""yes, and such small portions."" This is far from terrible - indeed it is not at all bad - but the portions are too small: Character introduction - journey - climax.There should have been far more, but in this type of animation every second counts and every extra second shaves a point off the box office income!Glad I didn't pay for it though and anyone seeing it at a cinema better get a small popcorn or they will be still  eating it on the way home.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Jon Monsarrat review:  great, not just for kids","""Ice Age"" doesn't have the intricate story arc of ""Toy Story"". In fact, the big picture story is fairly generic. A short, annoying but lovable pipsqueak who's always in trouble. A big ""straight man"" who cleans up the mess. Sound familiar, from ""Monsters, Inc"", ""Shrek"", going all the way back to Abbott & Costello?But buried within the generic plotting are tons of hilarious little skits. The film is as funny as ""There's Something About Mary"", and is the most funny 3D graphics animated film to date. The setting and the variations on the ice age are clever and original.Being somewhat cartoony, Ice Age does not shoot for the ultimate high-end in realism, but the animation is good (except for the human characters) and the animal fur is a special treat -- one of the hardest things to do well in computer graphics.Who should see this film:-- All kids over 6 (the film is PG but it's very mild)-- Adults who like comedies, won't mind a little bit of""it's just for kids"" in what is basically an accessible filmfor adults, and aren't overly arty.

Maybe one of the main reasons I went to see it was the previews for Spirit and Star Wars Episode II, but those are different matters.Ice Age follows a trio of buddies out to save a child, even though he is the human son of a hunter.The plot is not bad, but poorly develops as we are led into the life of Sid the Sloth, a slow, annoying, yet likeable character who is left behind during migration.  He pals up with Manfred the Mammoth after the big wooly creature saves his life from two angry rhinos.The characters are pretty well-developed except for Diego and the humans in the clan.  But the humans play a minor role, so we don't need to know much about them.The execution of the movie is great.  Sid and Manfred team up with Diego to get through the ice and find the human clan, but Diego has his own plans.  I won't go any further.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes animated movies and can overlook some childish flaws.  The humor is satisfying in most (but not all) areas, the characters are deep, the plot isn't bad, and the storyline follows a solid stream of events that will entice you to continue watching.Also, the music isn't bad in some places.  Especially in the ice cavern when they're racing along on the ice... hilarious!",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
My favorite childhood cartoon,"Ice Age is my favorite childhood cartoon. In my opinion, this is the best cartoon of all recently released on screens. Funny and meaningful. The characters of the characters are just super. Scrat (squirrel) is the most philosophical character. Such a small creature that becomes the cause of global problems. As in life. Shrek is certainly wonderful. A hybrid of Shrek, Monster Corporations and Mowgli... there's even a direct quote from their Shrek, you're my problem... this is when a sloth bothers a mammoth... and a sloth making its way through a crowd of feathered misers is a pure parody of colorful and stupid American action comedies, when the hero shoots 376 times from a six-shooter pistol... well, something like that... or without both legs runs to save a girl of questionable behavior... so... I was distracted... after this movie, Shrek somehow went into the shadows, and there's nothing to say about the Monster Corporation... I adore this sloth, I love the mammoth, I love the squirrel... and I praise the tiger... for adults it's a parody, for children it's a cartoon... and I advise everyone. Especially for those who have not forgotten how to think at least a little.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Still Good! Despite Living in the Shadows of its Early-2000's Competition,"Released in 2002, Ice Age, became the eighth CGI feature-length film to be released at that time and was directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha; the film tells the story of a misfit prehistoric group made up of a mammoth, ground sloth and sabre-toothed tiger undertaking the task to return a missing baby to its tribe. Ice Age was met with fairly positive reception from both audience and critics alike and performed well enough at the box office to spawn four sequels and catapult the success of the studio Blue Sky.I grew watching the Ice Age series however after not seeing the films for several years now, I decided to check out the series starting with where it all began. Returning to Ice Age was both nostalgic and interesting to see how this film has aged, with it using technology that hadn't had been perfected at the time much of the animation (though I am sure was good for 2002) has definitely shown its age. Ice Age is by no means unwatchable or ugly to look at, however, it is rough around the edges. One thing that has stayed constant is the humour both due in part to the writing and good voice acting.Starting with the latter, Ice Age primarily features the voices of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary who voice the characters of Manny, Sid and Diego. All of which do a good job in their role, helping to bring some charisma and emotion to their sometimes stiffly animated characters. Without that charm, much of this could have been bogged down and been a product of its time. Although most of the voice acting is serviceable and helps to elevate this film, the overarching story featured in Ice Age is one that is pretty standard for a family movie. However, with the setting of the film, the filmmakers were able to craft some entertaining sequences and touched on moments that I was not expecting for this type of film, with themes of death and loss. Although those moments are surface level and have nothing more to add beyond what is presented on screen, it does provide a layer to Ice Age that helps it to stand out even if it remains in the shadow of its competitors (at the time) like Toy Story or Shrek.In conclusion, it was fun returning to Ice Age and with a runtime under ninety minutes, made it a film that was brisk to get through. Although the animation may be dated and I am unsure how entertaining a film like this would be to today's youth, there were still aspects to Ice Age that I liked. It is a film that, for the most part, has stood the test of time, even if the story is tired and animation isn't as pretty as some CGI films today. If you are someone who is new to the series, the first Ice Age may be a tough sell and I have a hard time flat out recommending it, however, if you are someone, like me, looking to feel some nostalgia Ice Age will definitely provide that; and for that reason, I am giving Ice Age a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ice Age Review by Matt Staples,"Ice Age is a great animated film with an amazing voicing cast. Ray Ramano as Manfred the mammoth is instantly recognizable. To hear the voice of Ray Barone as an ancient elephant is a lot of fun. Also to have Denis Leary is amazing as the saber toothed tiger Diego. He throws you off because you often hear a swear word laced in his speech. Sid the sloth is also a stand out character voiced by John Leguizamo. So the movie takes you on a journey in a time before people could talk and the concept of fire is pretty much a new thing. While all the animals are migrating north Manfred an outcast is heading south. On his way Manfred is joined company by Diego and Sid. They encounter a women swept on a river bank trying to get her baby out of the freezing water. Manfred and Sid make it their mission to return the baby to ""its own herd"". So we are brought on a fun journey as they return the baby. Manfred and Sid come across Diego who pretends to be friends with the two, while holding an agenda that will will betray Manfred and Sid. I was really impressed by how much I enjoyed this movie. Everything from the way the characters were created and who they were voicing them. The story is unique and will make you smile.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ice Age is a solid family movie most intended for children 6 and up.,"Ice Age is just one a slew of computer generated films aimed for young children and families that came out in the early 2000s. It centers around three friends; a woolly mammoth named Manny who is voiced by Ray Romano, a saber-toothed tiger called Diego who is voiced by Denis Leary, and a smooth-talking, dimwitted sloth named Sid, who is voiced by John Leguizamo. Together the three friends face the destruction of their home by impending glaciers brought on by a coming ice age, all the while trying to return a human baby back to his village.As with most family friendly movies, this one centers around friendship, trust and togetherness as the three reluctant friends face many hardships such as lava pits, glaciers, and ice caverns all to accomplish their goal.Though this film is solid, it doesn't rank with the powerhouses of family films such as Shrek, mostly because of the pacing and lack of thrill. The movie is funny, but not because of the usually reasons, such as the characters finding themselves in zany predicaments, but rather the characters themselves add to the majority of the humor. Manny, the mammoth is boorish and slow, Diego is slick and somewhat devilish, while Sid is fast talking but not fast thinking. The character combination is what makes the film generally enjoyable. However, the most enjoyable character is one that does not get equal billing with the others, and that is Scrat. Scrat is a saber-toothed squirrel, who wants nothing more than to secure his fortune that comes in the form of an elusive acorn. Throughout the film the camera will cut to Scrat chasing the acorn and finding himself in some hilarious situations. Yes, the bulk of the comedy focuses mainly on Scrat, and most adults would find his scenes more entertaining than watching the rest of the animals on their adventure.This is most likely because the pacing is as slow as Manny lumbering up a hill. As you watch the movie, you find it obvious that the pacing is set more for children than adults, which is okay, except that there are some rather scary scenes in which most young children shouldn't watch it alone without adults their to reassure them.As far as the artistic styling of the film, the lighting, and camera angles, and colors are all brilliant and vibrant throughout the film, and they tie in well with the overall attitude of the movie being of a light and airy sort. The theme does well to show kids that friendships can be made and challenges overcome with teamwork. For the most part, Ice Age is a solid family movie most intended for children 6 and up.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Skip this movie,"I read through the comments, immediately after FORCING myself to watch this film...this was without a doubt, the most boring cartoon I have ever sat through. I did not care at ALL about the characters...they had no personalities, no character traits to make you excited when they begin a line, or begin a joke. I agree the squirrel creature with it's acorn was a little amusing..but I'd already seen it 40 times in the movie trailer.I think Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo did the best they could with the script...but I bet they were picturing better graphics. I thought the creatures were all LESS than lifelike..especially the humans. They looked exactly like characters in PC video games..which are mass produced, and I'm sure with LESS budget than Fox decided to spend on this movie.Kids might enjoy it..but not many kids I know. If you  need to amuse children....try Monster's Inc...or any disney flick. If you are an adult looking for a great, moving film...try Shrek or Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. This DVD rental was a waste..thank goodness I used a coupon!Rating: 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Best one of the franchise (and possibly the only one worth seeing),"Story: Manfred (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Dennis Leary) are returning a baby to it's tribe. It's not really big on plot, but it's what's on the adventure that counts.
Characters: Manny's a lonely and bitter mammoth who lost his family to humans and he hates humans now, Sid may be annoying to some, but I liked his moments, Diego's a pretty interesting character arc, turning from bad to good, and Scrat's moments are funny.
Animation: Jeez, it's pretty dated, like the textures being off and humans being unnatural looking, but good for 2002.
Overall: Not really as good as Blue Sky's Peanuts Movie, but basically the best of the franchise. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Worth watching.,"Ice Age is an enjoyable family film with something for everybody. I don't think it's something spectacular, but what we get is enjoyable.This is a buddy comedy story we've seen before, but it is executed well with each character providing their own sense of humour ranging from the mostly goofball slapstick of Sid to the deadpan from Manfred and the similar style from Diego.But it's not only fun and gags, because these characters are actually pretty well made. Even though Sid primarilly plays the role of the socially inept one whom nobody wants he is both kind and brave when he needs to. Manfred may seem grumpy and stern, but their is a sad reason to that (no spoilers). Diego gets into their trip with a completely different agenda than when he pretends to have and that makes some good tension between the three of them.My only little issue with Ice Age is that the animation hasn't aged very well. Even compared to other animated features of its time it is not that great which is shown best in the human characters' unnatural look. You can't blame it for that, because it's a first from Blue Sky Studios and they did a great job.Even though it's been milked with pointless sequels which went in a completely different way than I had hoped, people seem to like it, because the box office performances sure don't lie. It all started with this enjoyable feature with good humour, good characters and some powerfull moments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Funny and well made, but not one of the best animated movies.","I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin'), or reality  ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the most underrated and best movies i ve ever seen,"Ice Age has a very unique direction going for it. It follows the amazing journey of 3 animals who find a baby and they need to bring it to his parents. The charetersare all well written and amazing. Diego the sarcastic tiger, manny the good hearted mammoth and Sid them comic and sometimes annoying 3 finger lazy. I really like the humor of the movie as it is at the right amount and very well done. The voice acting is very good and the design of the world is amazing. What makes this movie so great is how emotional it is. There are 2 scenes in particular that made my cry bad, and for a movie to make someone like me cry it shows how amazing it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Fun, albeit predictable, family entertainment","""Ice Age"" falls into one of those vague areas of film criticism. The animated movie makes you want to like it so much, despite not being perfect. The film pours out creative energy and slapstick high jinks for the entire 90 minutes. This computer animated movie doesn't miss a beat in terms of visual style. A ice sliding sequence is especially impressive. The story, meanwhile, revolves around a sloth (John Leguizamo) named Sid, Manfred the mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego (Dennis Leary) a tiger. The group of animals are trying to return a baby to its tribe after he ends up away from them following a Sabertooth tiger attack. ""Ice Age"" reminds one of the classic Warner Brother's Wile E. Coyote cartoons. Scrat, a wide-eyed, prehistoric squirrel provides some truly funny moments in a desperate attempt to open up a nut. Despite, the strengths of some funny slapstick comedy and solid voice characterizations, the film does feel tad too familiar. Computer animation provided cinema with some terrific films the past two to three years including: ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"". The animation, while still impressive, does have that ""been there, done that"" touch to it. The film contains moments of obvious sappiness and overall is not quite as original as the wide range of humor displayed in ""Shrek"". Yet, all that being said, ""Ice Age"" delivers the goods. It's a solid family film, even if the style and script reek of familiarity. A 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"This is a simple yet entertaining film that children, along with parents will all enjoy.","This is a simple yet entertaining film that children, along with parents will all enjoy. This film is set back 20,000 years ago where three eccentric characters team up for an unexpected adventure. This is a story about Manfred (Ray Romano), a woolly mammoth, Diego (Denis Leary), a saber tooth tiger, and Sid (John Leguizame), a sloth. These three cross paths as Manfred the sad and lonely mammoth decides not to migrate south with the rest of the animals where he runs into the stuttering and fast-talking Sid the sloth. As also seen in the movie Shrek, Sid becomes a follower of the loner. The two together run into a lost child. To Sid and Manfred he is a lost child but to Diego the child is prey. Diego was ordered to bring this child back to his pack as the pack sought revenge on the humans. Diego deceptively offers help in returning the child back to his family and their journey begins across mountains of ice. This awkward combination of characters brings humor and comedy to the screen. Not to forget one of the most humorous and speechless characters alone, Scrat, a half squirrel, half rat that has set out on a mission of his own. In doing so, each character learns to work together and eventually become friends. Their differing personalities mixed together provide for a mission full of laughs and giggles. This films simplicity allows watchers to just sit down and be entertained.The voices of all the characters were impeccable. From the stutter of Sid to the grave tone of Diego. These animated voices brought these characters to life and provided personality. This personality contributed to the adventures of this team's journey.This film reaches out to children as well as the adults. The simplicity of the film plot allows for children to easily follow these lively characters throughout their journey. This film also shows depth as it looks brings details to the characters. From the beginning of the film Manfred was seen only as a loner deciding to travel north alone. His character was expanded with reasoning as he viewed the art within the cave. This brought great continuity to the film as each of the characters brought their contributions to the team. Ice age was simple and entertaining enough for children pleasure and added enough depth and emotions for adult interests. Entertainment for the whole family!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The weirdest herd I've ever seen,"""You're the embarrassment to nature, do you know that?""A pack of saber-toothed tigers is trying to get hold of the human baby, while the silly sloth and lonely mammoth are trying to save him and return him to the human tribe. It reminds a little of ""The Lion King"" and Mammoth and Sloth are quite similar to Shrek and Donkey, who premiered a year earlier. But regardless of questionable originality, the story is very emotional with lots of gags and witty remarks and 80 minutes will fly by in a jiffy. Animation and sound are excellent, the story of friendship, devotion, and self-sacrifice is universally susceptible to both children and adults, and along the way, you will learn how dodo birds became extinct, the origins of the continents and, of course, what squirrel is capable of in order to preserve her acorn.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good.. But with a few flaws.,"Had fun watching this film.. despite the feeling I got a lot of the time, that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc.

The animation is terrible for the most part and it just isn't very clever, funny or witty - at least not as much as it should be.If you've seen any Pixar films you'll instantly realize why they're vastly superior to DreamWorks' animated department - comparing ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" to ""Ice Age"" and ""Shark Tale,"" for example, proves to be a laughable comparison.Unfortunately a sequel is coming out to this quite soon and judging from the trailer it's going to be a horrendeous cash-in.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Completely endearing.,"The Looney Tunes spirit is kept alive and well in this likable computer animated feature, that also continues the tradition started by ""Toy Story"" in having humour for younger and older viewers. It's also got real heart and soul, and characters that are never less than entertaining. It can often bring a lump to ones' throat, just as much as it elicits chuckles with its one liners and visual gags. Set during the title time in Earths' history, it brings together three very unlikely comrades - a solitary mammoth named Manfred (voice of Ray Romano), a goof ball sloth named Sid (voice of John Leguizamo), and a sabre toothed tiger named Diego (voice of Denis Leary). Their mission is to return a human baby to its tribe, although Diegos' motive has nothing to do with wanting to do the ""right"" thing. Punctuated by the misadventures of a prehistoric squirrel named Scrat (voice of director Chris Wedge), just as terminally unlucky as Wile E. Coyote himself, ""Ice Age"" is hard to resist, right from start to finish. The characters are wittily and inventively realized visually, especially Sid, the kind of character who can be seen as annoying but who is also very likable in his way. Leguizamo is a standout in this role, getting most of the big laughs. Other talents providing voices are Goran Visnjic as Soto, and Jack Black as Zeke, as well as Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, and Jane Krakowski. Some scenes of peril may indeed be too much for the very young to take, but for others there is a deliciously dark edge to some of the humour, especially in regards to the dodo birds. There's also a very nice message in here about looking out for others, as well as one about redemption. All in all, a fine family feature, one that charms and amuses for a well paced 81 minutes.

Certainly a hit for families out there,"In ""Ice Age"", the criteria for a successful family movie are met: laughs, charm, and adventure. It is not perfect though; the narrative execution is partially choppy and the main antagonists never leave a mark or come across as posing any significant danger. The story of an odd duo - here a mammoth and a ground sloth - taking care of a human child surely has a lot of heart and some emotional moments, even though it was superiorly conveyed in ""Monsters, Inc."".

Good for kids AND adults alike,"The movie was good.  This visuals were outstanding.  Only people are still hard to draw with computers, and it shows.  The story, albeit simple, was entertaining.  But jumping from Yellowstone (Old Faithful) to England (Stonehenge) to France (Lascaux) seems a stretch, even if the world was one big continent at the time.  Not good for a children's movie...no wonder we don't know geography in America.Character voices were good.  Ray Romano didn't have to stretch too much, and was effective as the Manfred the Mammoth.  Supporting cast was good as well. Goran Visnijic (Dr. Kovac, ER) as Soto, the alpha-male sabre-tooth?  I didn't even recognize the voice until the credits.  But in my humble opinion, John Leguizamo WAS Sid.  He did an excellent job voicing the character, and making Sid his own.  John has talent, I just wish he did more (maybe it is the To Wong Foo... curse.)One last thing.  Sid bears an awfully big resemblance to the donkey in Shrek.  Sid is saved by a big scary Mammoth; the donkey, by ugly looking Shrek.  Sid makes the Mammoth his friend; the donkey, Shrek...well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  I hope next time Pixar comes up with something completely new.I thought the little sabre toothed mouse (or whatever it was) would be the Jar-Jar of the movie, and ruin it.

Puts Shrek on Ice.,"It's unfourtunate that every computer animated family friendly flick will have to be compared to the likes of the overrated Shrek from now on. On that note I will review Ice Age to Shrek. Yes, Shrek has better character models and a more realistic look to it, but the movement of those characters were stiff and rigid. Ice Age has a more simplistic style, a pretty basic look, almost like a cave painting with a little more detail and color (and it works). And the characters in this film bring back the classic nostalgia of the American slap-stick cartoon, which is slowly becoming extinct. I had a grin from ear to ear watching Sid the Sloth and the sabertooth squirrel flop, squash, and bump their way through the movie. The squirrel and Sid provide the physical humor (along with a bunch of Dodos) while the rest of the cast provides witty dialouge, common in most computer animated flicks. So get the kids, and go chill out at Ice Age, and watch some slap-stick and be happy.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Fun, fresh, engaging - and the best trailer I've seen","'Ice Age' is a fresh and original animation taking place among animal misfits in the ice age. The unlikely animals band together to form a friendship based on returning a human baby to its parents and avoiding the evil sabre-toothed tigers from stealing the baby. Hilarious events take place on their journey, and it is a deeply engaging and fresh film. Children and adults both can enjoy this film.I remember catching the trailer for this film in 2000 - several times. The trailer itself was a work of art. As soon as the little squirrel came on the screen with his acorn, the audience was immediately hushed and wrapped up in the unfolding action. I have never seen an audience react so intensely on a film trailer. I think that they did a very good job putting the trailer together, and it is - by far - the most effective trailer I have ever seen. Watching the audience's response to this trailer time and time again was wonderful.I was amazed at how good the animation was. It's not totally realistic animation, but they did a good job at keeping it simple and not letting it distract from the action. The 'feel' of the film reminded me of 'The Lion King', but this story was much better; I was also not annoyed with the sloth character, but I was annoyed with Timon and Pumba from 'The Lion King'. I thought that all of the characters, including the secondary ones, were quite charming in their own individual aspects.

"Fun for the Whole Family, but More so for Kids,","Ice Age is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's certainly a very original animated film, focusing around a group of animals as the ice age begins, it's quite funny and the characters are very likable, it also has a lot of heart and the ending of the film is very sweet, I also really loved Scrat's scenes, being my favourite parts of the entire franchise. It's a fun movie, but it's definitely much more entertaining for kids, I loved it when it first came out, I probably would have rated it ten back then, but now I'm giving it a seven as it just dosen't hold up as well when you're older, it dosen't have enough humour for adults to laugh, something that is evident in all the best animated films, such as Monsters Inc and Shrek, it's understandable that it wanted kids to be its target audiences but there should have been more in it for an older viewer. The ending is very anti-climatic, as the story finishes, we are left feeling there should have been more, it definitely could have been at least ten minutes longer, to give us a better idea where the characters were headed, how their relationship has changed over the course of this movie and give them more closure with the child. It's certainly not the finest animated film, but Ice Age is still sure to entertain and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film.As the ice age begins, three animals discover a lost human infant, they must travel far and wide to find his tribe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

perfect cartoon for kids,"I remember watching this as a kid, and still do not have different perception. It is almost perfect, except that now as grown up man, I can say it is for kids, meaning too simple or shallow, and can't give it 10 stars rating. 15 years ago I would. Graphics is perfect, somewhere between ordinary cartoon and 3d animation like Shrek. Topic is the best, then characters. Scientific, shows us a lot about Ice Age. Funny, emotional, moral. Shows us that other beings too, just like animals and possibly extraterrestrial species may have some emotions and intelligence, just like we, if not even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The settings are cold, but the movie isn't.","Twentieth Century Fox hasn't had the best of luck with animated movies -""FernGully: The Last Rainforest"" is best forgotten, ""The Pagemaster"" was patchy, ""Anastacia"" wasn't bad but was unmemorable, and ""Titan A.E."" was a misfire (in addition to helping shut down Fox Animation Studios). ""Ice Age"" finally delivers the goods through Blue Sky.This is well animated than Walt Disney Pictures's own prehistoric trek ""Dinosaur"" but a better movie all told, because it has characters on its side - a sloth and mammoth trailing behind in the annual migration to get away from the winter discover a human baby (given to them by his mother, who dies in escaping a tiger attack) and take it on themselves to return the child to his people before the snow sets in and closes the only route available. If dave-hart is reading this, the reason they're joined by a sabretooth tiger called Diego is that he's been sent by the leader of his group to get the baby from Sid the sloth and Manfred the mammoth (""I see - can't have kids of your own, so you want to adopt"") and bring him back, so that his revenge can be complete; the tigers attacked the humans because the baby's father hunted the tigers. As Mrs Loman put it, ""Attention must be paid.""The storyline won't win any awards for originality, but the movie has plenty of points of interest (the mute human characters - ""You know humans can't talk!"" - in accordance with the true first settlers of America, have distinctly Native American looks), and enough humour and genuine appeal to win over most viewers; the flock of survivalist dodos preparing for the imminent Ice Age are my favourites among the subsidary characters, but the three main characters all get to share the spotlight. As the one who's the most nebbishy, Sid could have been truly annoying, but he stays the right side of amusing throughout (kudos to the writers and John Leguizamo); Manfred is good enough to suggest another look at ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" may be in order, and as for Denis Leary as Diego... well, when is he NOT worth the time?It is a bit predictable, and it's not Pixar admittedly, but it's not as self-satisfied as DreamWorks either; it's just a movie. But it's a good one - entertaining from the running joke of Scrat and his nut to the final scene. ""Ice Age"" is the best prehistoric cartoon since ""The First Bad Man,"" though not quite up to Tex Avery level... but then again, what is?And please note the absence of dinosaurs (and singing). Already this is more accurate than some live-action movies.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Very good,"The first adventure in the animation of the Brazilian Carlos Saldanha. Despite having always worked in this area, Saldanha has something great in his hands.

The animation has a beautiful story of survival, which enchants those who watch. With characters that guarantee fun with your grand adventure.

"""you know humans can't talk""","I saw this one when it was brand new back in 2002. Yesterday I saw the new Ice Age, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and in my comment of Dawn of the Dinosaurs I wrote this: ""I was pretty much a fan of the first Ice Age, right now I have one adjective to describe each: for the first one (released in 2002) the adjective is great and for the first sequel (released in 2006 and called The Meltdown) the adjective is boring"". So today I decided to watch again Ice Age and it wasn't the same, it wasn't like in 2002. And I wasn't a very little kid back in 2002 but still 7 years are 7 years and certainly I remembered a much better movie, I remembered a much funnier squirrel but now I can say this isn't even better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs, of course this doesn't looks as good as ""Dinosaurs"" (still it is a good-looking movie) and well this is just an OK movie, entertaining at least.It's very simple, simple elements: three different animals, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber tooth tiger, will have a common goal which is returning a lost baby to his people. The saber tooth tiger while at first with a different goal will end being good, you know it is basic. The squirrel works a bit better here than in ""Dinosaurs"", it feels that it is a bit more stick with the main story. But still apart of that scene when the main characters ask it about the humans and of its very last expression (that happens 20, 000 years later of the events in the movie) the squirrel is never hilarious.So, yesterday I was thinking ""the first one was much better than its sequels"" but now I'm not, this is far from being a great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Blue Sky Studios' Animation Debut Is Still Its Finest Work To Date.,"Establishing Blue Sky Studios as the new player in the computer animation arena after both Pixar & DreamWorks Animation had made their mark, Ice Age is a sensibly crafted, delightfully humoured & wonderfully narrated adventure comedy that packs in an interesting set of pre-historic characters, manages to be surprisingly touching on few occasions & is thoroughly amusing from start to finish.The story of Ice Age takes place during the advent of the titular global phenomenon and follows a woolly mammoth named Manny, a ground sloth named Sid & a saber-toothed cat named Diego who, after coming across a human child & ultimately deciding to return him to his tribe, embark on an exciting adventure while braving the harsh conditions & unexpected challenges of the worsening weather.Directed by Chris Wedge & Carlos Saldanha, Ice Age sets its lighthearted tone right within the opening segment that follows a squirrel's obsession with acorn and this side story keeps recurring throughout the movie to provide the comic relief. The main plot itself is brilliantly narrated, the characters are introduced without swaying from the main premise, and it has plenty of laughs in store for everyone.The relationship between the characters develops naturally, the computer animation appears a bit dated today yet it's top-notch for its time, the pre-historic animals are nicely designed & rendered on the screen, the cold colour palette, smooth camera-work, fine editing & adventurous score also helps in uplifting the experience while Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary chip in with fitting voice work.On an overall scale, Ice Age marks a promising start for Blue Sky Studios and delivers the goods in sufficient doses to succeed as an enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying picture that will appease the appetite of both kids & adults. Wonderfully balancing its moments of comedy with sincere drama, further strengthened by terrific chemistry between its three characters, and exploring the theme of friendship with genuine warmth, Ice Age is definitely worth a shot.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"An enjoyable, if tonally uneven, family adventure.","When a gruff stand offish mammoth, Manny (Ray Romano) saves clumsy talkative sloth, Sid (John Leguizamo), he finds himself traveling with him much to his annoyance. The two eventually stumble across a wounded human who in her dying moments gives Manny the baby. While Sid wants to return the baby to the humans, Manny has no interest. When a Sabretooth tiger, named Diego (Dennis Leary) meets them claiming to know where the human's have migrated Manny reluctantly accepts Diego's help unaware his pack has plans for the baby and Manny.Released in 2002, Ice Age was the first feature film from Fox's Blue Sky Studios who up to that point had been primarily a visual effects house with notable projects such as the cockroaches from Joe's Apartment and the Penguin scene from Fight Club. Initially intended as a more dramatic 2D animated film for Don Bluth and Gary Goldman the project was scrapped with the closure of Fox Animation Studios after the failure of Titan A. E. but was salvaged by Blue Sky Studios as a project to test the viable of the studio in feature CGI animation. The movie became a smash hit upon release become the 8th highest grossing film of 2002 and launching an enduring franchise that has ingrained itself in popular consciousness. The movie itself is a familiar story, but well told even if its balance of humor and pathos isn't quite as surehanded as it wants to be.In terms of story the movie is essentially a reworking of the 1913 novel Three Godfathers which itself has inspired notable films ranging from the John Wayne adaptation to the 80s comedy hit 3 Men and a Baby (and its French source film). The movie's ragtag trio who set out to bring the baby back to civilization are well done with John Leguizamo's Sid playing a well meaning but clumsy and unaware doofus, Ray Romano's Manny who plays the emotionally distant curmudgeon harboring quiet sadness, and Denis Leary as the sinister but conflicted Diego who plays the moral ambiguity of his character quite well with some really good scenes both humorous and character based that play well with the character. The interactions between the core trio are pitch perfect in timing with rapid fire exchanges well complemented against the animation.The animation in Ice Age is quite impressive. While the film doesn't try to go for the realistic aesthetic of Shrek, the movie uses a more stylized approach going for more exaggerated designs that play well with the world established. The work on fur and water in particular is quite impressive as the fur will get matted or wet and react accordingly in some impressive texture work.The story is pretty thin clocking in at about 73 minutes not including credits. The movie never feels rushed and plays at a good pace, but there are moments where the comedy feels like it outweighs the more dramatic moments and it feels like a very ""post Shrek"" movie with a number of anachronistic gags and jokes that aren't as well integrated here and do call attention to themselves. There's also a fair number of scenes with an undercurrent of tragedy to them that feel like leftovers from when this was a more dramatic project and while the scenes are well done (including a cave painting sequences that is as beautiful as it is tragic) they do find themselves somewhat at odds with over the top visual gags, slapstick, and reference humor that the film keeps focusing on.Ice Age isn't a great film, but it's a good well made one. With likable characters, well timed animation, and a fun if familiar adventure, Blue Sky's debut feature showed they were an animation house that could play on the same level as Dreamworks and Pixar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Heart-warming film,"This film have some sort of warmth. One great point about this film is the beauty of the animation.

There are hardly any female characters, but you do not really realize that until after you watch it, a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film.The story id simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what shines is the digital set design. It is family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"In spite of the title, this is very much a warm film; whether it's one for the ages is another matter, but it's affirming and exciting enough to recommend.","Ice Age is a three way buddy pic set in the pre-prehistoric era unfolding as a modern day road movie of sorts, in spite of taking place at a time many millennia before roads would even exist; a neat comedy driven by the rocky relationships between a trio of hapless creatures of ancient times gone by running on some good interplay and wily writing as we observe them negate a long, relatively hostile, terrain rife with the elements; sight gags and the fleeting pop culture reference. The film, a sort of two way riff on the likes of Shrek and Monter's Inc., is a workable and often exciting excursion into animation; made more impacting by the real lack of this era in planet Earth's long existence ever really being put to screen, particularly in the animated format. Where Ice Age is nothing above and beyond, it is quaint and timely; its attitude to what it essentially represents never more than evident during a more-dramatic-than-we-expect denouement, something which sees directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha exude an offbeat idea that primitive humans and plentiful mammals may actually co-exist peacefully in this unremitting world of food-chains and strife – it is somewhat nonsensical, and more than fanciful, but you've oddly swayed with it.The film begins with a short skit, within which we observe a small squirrel-like character speaking to us in agonised squeaks and offering us pained reactions to his pratfalls. His unfortunate exploits linked to never quite knowing what to do with a small nut he's managed to get his hands on are what follows, with an attempted burying of it in the snow causing a huge rift in the ground, a rift formulating into a crack and then causing a huge glazier to break off seemingly dooming all the creatures within the realms of this world. Those of whom it will affect the most dwell in the valleys and the forests below this mountainous locale; here, a large but seemingly downcast mammoth named Manfred (Romano) is, in a literal sense, heading counter to the tide as he walks against the mass exodus of animals fleeing this glacier rift and looming ice age. It isn't long until he bumps into Sid, or rather Sid bumps into him; a character who has to be one of the more talkative sloths ever devised and of whom is voiced by John Leguizamo - Sid's scenario seeing him left behind by that of his close family prior to disembarkment: for reasons that become clearer. The dynamic of Sid and Manfred's relationship feeds off the animated film of 2001 of equally good value in Shrek; specifically, Eddie Murphy's Donkey character literally running into that of the hulking titular lead following a mix up with those out to get at him: the nature of their later bond a clear riff on the said pairing in their ""little-and-large"" double act plus easily wound up nature clashing with the smaller element of the pairing's talkative nature.Away from these proceedings lie a pack of sabre tooth tigers led by that of Soto (Visnjic), who employs the services of one of his more competent aides, Diego (Leary), to swipe an infant from a camp of early-human Neanderthals amidst the chaos of a surprise attack; early-human Neanderthals of whom look suspiciously drawn from 1995's Pocahontas and its respective homo-sapiens. Soto has preordained this attack out of spite for the mass slaughters implemented upon the tiger clan that have transpired at the discretion of the Neanderthals. The tigers, with their predominantly Hispanic sounding Christian names and evident subscription to gang culture, allude to a greater extent of misrepresentation, but a misrepresentation of which isn't prominent enough to sag the film into a messy trough of any kind. Indeed, Soto puts it very clearly to the rest of us that it is a guided idea born out of a desire for retribution; a veering of the characters away from stock villainy sort and perhaps doing well to draw the more younger members of the targeted audience into identifying the politics of the two sides before having them take their own stance.The raid is a success but Diego looses the baby down a nearby river, only for it to end up in the laps of Manfred and Sid further on down the stretch of water; Diego's angling for it back clashing with Manfred's ignorance out of Diego's true intent as he strives to return it to the humans. Principally, the duality in Manfred and Diego's attitudes towards the primitive humans in regards to specific tragedies that have come to affect either their lives or existences is what's at the forefront here; later revelations linked to Manfred reveal certain truths that do not do enough to sway him onto the ill-guided tract of blood-lust and destruction that drove Diego pre-crucible. What unfolds is an often exciting, albeit reasonably routine, adventure film about these grossly differing animals connecting and repelling at various stages, with a neat framework concluding with quaint epiphanies we do not necessarily have much of a problem with no matter how channelled they may be. The film has fun with that post modern approach to animation contemporary American animations usually feed off, a tract reading something along the lines of ""real life in a world not entirely true to life""; the stopping for a mock-level crossing occurring shortly after we're made aware of the trio's travelling ought to resemble a holidaying family separate examples of this. We enjoy the film's sense of adventure, its grandiose feel in spite of it being a little over 80-odd minutes in length, as well as its core politic pitched solely towards its target demographic that teamwork persistently wins out in the end, and that when prejudices and such are put aside, things can more often than not come off for the much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Amazing, heartwarming, clever, hilarious, everything you could possibly want.","Many critics and snobs say that this movie is adequate but doesn't compare with Monsters Inc and Shrek. Ice Age is much too under-estimated. It's better than Monsters Inc and just as good as Shrek. Perhaps the concept for the film may be familiar to the other two, but they were all in production at about the same time so you can't blame them for that.It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and is always consistently entertaining. The visual gags and the wit should appeal to adults and children of all ages. While in Toy Story 2, serious scenes dragged the film down and made it lose momentum, in Ice Age moments of sentamentality are heartwarming and engaging. But if you have problems with your inner-child, thats not my problem.The cast may not be as well known as the vocal talents in Shrek, they still work perfectly together. Ray Romano exceeds Mike Myers (whose evident flaws were overlooked) as being the loner-like but lovable mammoth (Shrek was an ogre) and was highly appropriate for the part. No one will EVER match Eddie Murphy as the talking donkey, but John Lequizamo is a good contender as the comical sloth. Denis Leary is also very good. ER's Goran Visnijc is more of a Gene Hackman in ""Antz"" than a John Lithgow in ""Shrek"", and gives the film a darker mood instead of more comedy, which is fine in its own way.It follows a familiar outline, but Ice Age is always entertaining and definitely the best animated movie of 2002. 8.1 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Iceberg Ahead!,"From the realm of digital animation, this is a film that is geared to the younger set, but one that most adults will find pleasantly entertaining, as well.  Heavy on visual humor, with a few one-liners thrown in for good measure, `Ice Age,' directed by Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge, is a fairly pedestrian, family comedy that is viewer friendly and has a heart as big as it's main character, who just happens to be a mammoth named Manfred.It's the Ice Age, and the migration is on; but as the mammals begin to move, three very distinct individuals are about to be thrown together by circumstances of fate:  Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) insists on going against the tide of the migration movement (literally), and it brings him in touch with Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), who awakens from his slothful slumber to find that he's been left behind by the other sloths.  Meanwhile, a pack of Sabertooth Tigers, led by the ruthless Soto (Goran Visnjic), is about to exact revenge on the humans, the hunters he feels are responsible for the decimation of his pack.  An attack is planned, with Soto especially intent on claiming a human baby as his prize.  But during the attack, one of Soto's pack, Diego (Denis Leary), fails to prevent the baby's mother from escaping with her child.  Outraged that the baby has escaped his grasp, Soto charges Diego with the task of locating the baby and bringing him back, alive.  What Diego does not know, however, is that the baby has ended up in the care of one of the most unlikely duos imaginable, Manfred and Sid, who have joined forces in an attempt to locate the humans and return the baby to it's herd.  When Diego realizes what has happened, he decides that his best shot at getting ahold of the baby is to join Manfred and Sid in their quest, which he does by convincing them that they need him-- a tracker by nature-- if they are to succeed in finding the humans, who are also on the move.  And so they begin their journey, with Manfred and Sid unaware of the treachery at hand, lying hidden in their very midst.Unlike other prominent films of this genre, such as `Shrek,' or even `Monster's Inc.,' `Ice Age' is not terrifically clever or witty; nor does it try to be.  The strength of this film, in fact, lies in the very straightforward manner in which it is presented, and the filmmakers obviously made some very deliberate choices as to what they wanted to do with their film, and what exactly they wanted it to be.  Rather than go for the hip and hilarious, they chose warm and funny-- and it works.  There is some subtle humor, but for the most part the jokes are what they are; Saldanha and Wedge do not employ the double entendre, for example, so you don't have to go looking for what they're trying to say.  It's a matter of what you see is what you get.What they do give you are some engaging characters (especially Manfred and Sid) and a number of things that visually stimulate the funny bone, beginning with the hapless squirrel who mugs his way through the opening frames with a nut in tow (and who pops up occasionally throughout the film), whose bug-eyed looks and frantic antics are enough to start you chuckling and take you right on into some full-blown gales of laughter.  And it's all tempered so that it never goes too far over the top into `Road Runner' type slapstick, relying instead on some imaginative touches (such as the stages of evolution of the sloth preserved frozen in ice, with Sid falling into frieze briefly at the end of the tableau) and a basic story that's involving enough to sustain interest.Anyone familiar with the TV show `Everybody Loves Raymond' will know what to expect as far as the Manfred character, whom Ray Romano infuses with the same wry persona as his Raymond TV character.  But Romano does it well, his Manfred is quite likable, and he even manages to create a couple of truly poignant moments with him.  Simply put, he gives you a mammoth to whom you can actually relate.  And that's a pretty good piece of acting.As Sid, John Leguizamo gives a distinct voice to the film, creating a personality that definitely fits the wall-eyed looks of the sloth.  Like Romano, Leguizamo has a unique comedic style, and the contrast between the two works beautifully for their respective characters and the way in which they play off of one another.  And when you add Denis Leary to the mix-- which offers yet another distinct style of comedy (a bit more on the caustic side)-- the result is quite an interesting and diverse combination that in the end works extremely well.  It should be noted, too, that Leary is comparatively subdued with his character, while Leguizamo gives a stream-of-consciousness type performance, though he manages to stay just this side of Robin Williams territory (which is a positive within the context of this film and this particular character).  Most importantly, all three create characters that succeed in effectively telling the story, and they do it in a way that is not only inoffensive, but which enables the audience to embrace them, as well.The supporting cast includes Jack Black (Zeke), Tara Strong (Roshan), Stephen Root (Rhino), Diedrich Bader (Saber-tooth Tiger) and Jane Krakowski (Jennifer the Sloth).  Entertaining, feel-good family fare, `Ice Age' is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and provide you with a satisfying cinematic experience.

Not overly sentimental but not quite as sharp as I wanted,"As the ice age approaches, the majority of animals are heading south to the heat and survival.

But can they trust Diego?Someday I'm sure we will tire of CGI animated tales of creatures that all have famous voices and sharp wits, but so far that day has yet to come.  Ice Age doesn't totally stand out in the field of really enjoyable films within the genre (I'd say Shrek, Monsters Inc, Toy Story) but it is funny enough to be worth watching.The plot doesn't matter all that much suffice to say that a quest is undertaken and lessons are learned about friendship  so far nothing new. What it does allow is plenty of comedy set pieces and jokes that, as usual, are aimed at adults as much (if not more so) than the children themselves. Ranging from quick visual gags to longer physical stuff for kids it is all quite enjoyable.  The only weakness I felt it had was the lack of a really sharp edge  most of it is quite average rather than being imaginative and hilarious.The cast do pretty well.  As much as I dislike him as an actor (too many bad performances!) Leguizamo does a really good job as Sid and carries a lot of the film.  Romano is a solid Manny while Leary never really gets to use his comedy skills as Diego  although thinking of his old acts, maybe that's for the best here!Overall I didn't feel that Ice Age stood out as one of the better of the recent genre but it is still funny and worth a watch.

This is because when Sid was following Manfred around, I immediately thought of when the Donkey kept following Shrek around. I could clearly tell that the writers of Ice Age thought through every single detail of the characters and the storyline itself and that is what is lacking in some films today. That extra bit of thought made this film to be one of the best animated films I have seen which is why I gave this film a 10. Overall, the characters made me laugh, the storyline was very unique and I enjoyed watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ice Age beats Shrek !,"For the lovers of Shrek there is now a new challenge on the market. I just saw Ice Age 3 times already and I must say : they've done it. A great animated film situated in the Ice Age, when poor Scrat tries to save his food for worse time. All the animals are going south except a small group that tends to go the other way for various reasons. A mammoth, a sloth, a tiger and a foundling discover what a herd really means and who their real friends are.

Chill Thrills and Frozen Frills: 'Ice Age' Unleashes a Blizzard of Laughter and Adventure,"The computer-animated family movie ""Ice Age"" from Twentieth Century Fox tells a touching story set in prehistory. It's not as cerebral as ""Shrek"" or the Pixar movies, but it's still a strong second choice for both adults and kids.The exodus of extinct animals bears similarities to ""Dinosaur,"" ""Monsters, Inc."", and ""The Lion King."" In the movie, Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Diego all give outstanding vocal performances. Ray Romano plays a clever and patient character, while John Leguizamo plays jive Sid. Denis Leary's voice sounds like a switchblade.

Beats Dreamworks,"In contrast to Dreamworks, Fox try to follow the Disney recipe in their first CGI attempt. And they do so with great success. Where Dreamworks have failed, Fox succeeds straight away to make a film with great warmth and fabulous humor. The animation is not as good as Pixar's and the story is not as well-plotted as Disney's, but other than that this is great fun. I think it also contains the first gay couple (prehistoric rhinos) in animated children's film history. The sabre squirrel is worth the ticket alone.Rating - 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""For a second there, I actually thought you were gonna eat me.""","The computer animation revolution took off after Shrek broke box office records in 2001, prompting all studios to produce their own pop culture rich computer animated features of their own. The first Fox Studios entry was this one, Ice Age, a funny movie following Manfred the Mammouth (Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) as they go the wrong way during the seasonal migration. Manfred has always been an outcast in this chilly society, and Sid just annoys everyone to the point that he's out there by himself as well. The plot takes off when Manfred and Sid find a baby human after saber-tooth tigers attack an early man settlement. Manfred and Sid decide to take the baby back to the humans. One problem is that one of the attacking saber-tooths, Diego (Denis Leary), travels with them, his motivations unclear. The movie follows the traveling party in mainly good cheer and with outstanding animation. The scene where the party slides through an ice shield is especially effective. Ice Age is a good movie that has funny moments, lead mostly through the comedic chemistry that exists between Romana, Leguizamo, and Leary. However, when compared to the Shrek movies, the overall laugh-out-loud humor just does not measure up. However, that is not to say Ice Age is a bad movie, it's just not as good as the contemporary gold standards. The animation, however, is top notch, even the humans, though have their own style, look good enough to do well. Ice Age is quality entertainment, just not to the level of Shrek.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
One of the funniest animated movies ever!,"Totally unaware of what awaited me in the theatre I went to see Ice age, with a rebate coupon and a pretty funny trailer, it couldn't be that bad... At first I was afraid that the funny sequences from the two trailers would be the best clips from the movie cut into a nice teaser, but it didn't take long to get rid of that fear, as the fun just kept going & going for the whole film through!The characters are extremely funny and really nicely animated, it's hard to believe this was not a Dreamworks or a Disney picture but for me at least a total newcomer in the animated movies genre not having seen Titan AE yet (even though this movie has certainly made me put it up in queue).I do not get the criticism this movie has got from some of the early user comments. ""Ray Romano boring and depressed as the mammoth"" - A. Well, the mammoth was a depressed and sad character in the movie, so that shouldn't be such a surprise?! B. He did a very good job with the voice IMHO and was also really funny at times. C. This movie would hardly need any more energy than it already has, thank you very much!Also, just because a few of the scenes reminds me of other movies (Shrek comes to mind at about 2 short scenes) doesn't make it any worse! All movies takes ideas and inspiration from other movies in the same genre and this one can definitely stand on its own!Monsters has nothing compared to this movie, which is right now doing a major struggle in my mind for first place with Shrek.

A Cool Tale of Friendship and Fun,"""Ice Age"" is a fun and heartfelt animated movie that combines humor, adventure, and emotion to deliver a family-friendly experience. Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, the film takes us back to the prehistoric era, following a mismatched group of animals-Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, Diego the saber-toothed tiger, and the ever-chaotic Scrat-as they embark on a journey to return a human baby to its tribe.The movie shines with its simple yet touching story about unlikely friendships and the importance of working together despite differences. The characters are well-defined and likable, with Manny's stoic demeanor, Sid's goofy charm, and Diego's morally conflicted personality creating a dynamic trio. Scrat's hilarious antics with his acorn add a layer of comic relief that appeals to viewers of all ages.The animation, though not as polished as later productions, holds up surprisingly well for its time. The icy landscapes are beautifully rendered, and the character designs are memorable and expressive. The humor is a blend of slapstick and witty banter, ensuring both kids and adults find something to enjoy.However, the movie doesn't push many boundaries and feels relatively safe in its storytelling. The plot is straightforward and predictable, lacking the emotional depth or innovation seen in some other animated films. While it has heartwarming moments, it doesn't leave a lasting emotional impact.Overall, ""Ice Age"" is an enjoyable and lighthearted adventure that remains a nostalgic favorite for many. While it may not reach the heights of some animated classics, its charm and humor make it a solid view experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
shrek in a ice age setting.,The movie can only be summed up as a poor attempt to try to reap the success of Shrek and turn the same story around and manipulate it so that the characters are different but their quests and perils are just the same.

A charming movie for everyone,"Kids, adults, seniors, teens...everyone should like ""Ice Age."" It was funny, it had a good story, it was visually impressive, the voice cast was talented...what else do I need to say here? When an animated movie can feature the development of numerous characters only through the actors' vocal performances, I think that is a great accomplishment. Denis Leary especially, as Diego the sabertooth-tiger, goes through so much development. As a villain helping the heroes, its impossible to see which way he will turn when the climax comes. And when it does come, you feel as if you have just watched something amazing happen. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo also give immense emotional contributions to the story. All the actors gave this movie a charming element that is not encountered often on film. When the movie was over, I wanted for there to be more. But I'll be okay; ""Ice Age"" is a tremendously good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Part of the Herd,"Director Carlos Saldanha's animated feature ""Ice Age"" starts ordinarily, then half way through it finds it's voice and says something remarkable about communities or ""herds"". This is a good surprise, and a welcome one.""Ice Age"" is 20th Century Fox's entry into cutting edge animated feature market. Techincally, it is not on par with some of the Disney or Dreamworks entries, though what makes it promising is that it has a worthwhile story to tell much like ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" Note that ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters"" are better movies. For one thing the story by Michael Wilson and the screenplay by Wilson and Michael Berg wastes time wandering in the first half, without really providing a context for what they really want to say.Our hero Manny, the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Ramano), is migrating south, though curiously alone. He is suffering over his family from his past. He saves a goofy sloth, Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) from a curious pair of male Rhinos-- a friend and I ""wondered"" about the nature of their relationship. The reluctant Manny agrees to take on Sid as a traveling bud.Along the way Manny and Sid become involved in the dark plot of a Sabertooth Tiger pack to kidnap a human child. Manny rescues the child in the failed attempt, and the child joins their herd. Sabertooth Diego (voiced by the always edgy Denis Leary) is the Judas who joins Manny's herd, pretending to help lead the child back to safely-- he is really following the orders of his leader, the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic). However, Manny saves Diego's life. Diego asks why Manny risked his own life for his. Manny says ""... That's what you do when you're part of a herd."" Now does Manny trust Diego, who is out to betray him? The ""Part of the herd"" or this community conversation saves ""Ice Age"", and offers value. Heroes and leaders can emerge from communities that are very diverse. And these are communities simply because they declared themselves to be--""Our herd"". Heroes and leaders emerging unexpectedly from communities are touching and inspiring-- what is cool that it is also expansive. Ultimately, ""Ice Age"" along with Ramano, Leary, and Leguizamo gets the job done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Animation and entertainment at its best,"I saw this movie in a preview screening in Vienna and was absolutely delighted. It is incredibly funny and the computer animation is great and more realistic than in other CGI films like Shrek. Compared to Monsters Inc. which I saw a week ago this was definitely funnier and did not have this sweet and tame Disney style. The story itself may not be the innovation of the year but the characters are so lovely - especially the unlucky squirrel which is so funny that it deserves a leading role.To sum up, Fox hit it big with that movie and (in my opinion) even tops all the other great animated features like Toy Story, Antz or Shrek. Ice Age is entertainment at its best!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Left me cold,"'Toy Story' is widely acclaimed for being the first film to rely entirely on computer animation; but in fact, it also had qualities that make it quite special among animated films. The ploy about obsolesce - a thinly disguised metaphor for human death - was amazingly dark for a ""childrens'"" film. The humour - centred on a toy spaceman who thinks he's a real spaceman - was incredibly sophisticated. And the metaphysic was entirely consistent throughout: every action the toys undertook was entirely in character, which meant that an adult could stay engaged throughout it's feature length. Many computer-animated movies since then have received similar rave reviews, but they haven't possessed these special qualities - and 'Ice Age' has none of them, just a bunch of annoying comedy animals and a by-numbers, episodic plot. There are other features of this film that also seem strange: the absence of any significant female characters, for example, and the unhappy contrast between the nicely rendered central characters and the static backdrops - it's like watching an old film where (human) actors pose in front of painted cardboard. It's also very strange to make the hero a hyperactive sloth with no slothful characterises at all. The best animated films have the same qualities as the best non-animated films, but I didn't find them in this film. And if you really want to watch a film where dinosaurs and humans roam the earth simultaneously, 'One Million Years B.C.' was actually more fun",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie!,"I thought this was a really good movie.  It's got an interesting story (nothing terribly original though, but hey it's a kid's movie), it's got great comedy, great voice-talents, great visuals and more.  There were a few scenes were I found myself laughing pretty hard.  I loved all the voice actors in the movie, Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Goran Visnjic, and Jack Black.  I have to say that I wasn't terribly fond of John Leguizamo's lisp thing in the film, but I can deal with it and won't make too much of a big deal of it.  It was kind of funny for about a minute, then it just got annoying.  But like I said after a while you get used to it and just live to deal with it.  I really liked the little rodent that kept appearing throughout the movie, he was a great little tid-bit in the film. Overall, I liked the movie very much and found it to be very enjoyable.

Fun for the children,"No day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age I felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.But it's because I am a Big Guy now, and I am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the ""actors"" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour. Even the ""evil"" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. And apart from some fights nobody dies (not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoony feeling.The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. [Which means lots of work nevertheless!]There were some gags which made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.Overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche.

Ice Age,"""Manfred"" the mammoth is heading north just as just about every other critter is migrating the other way to avoid the harsh winter. Unfortunately for him, he encounters the sleepy-head sloth ""Sid"" whom he rescues from a pair of rhinos, only to bitterly regret his kindness as this pesky mammal is soon getting on his nerves. Meantime, a pride of sabre-toothed tigers are plotting revenge on a human village whose hunting parties have taken their toll on their now dwindling numbers. Their target is a baby - but luckily it's mother manages to plunge it off a waterfall where, drenched, it is rescued by our two squabbling travellers. The tigers still haven't given up hope of securing their rather meagre lunch, and ""Diego"" - a sort of wily and menacing character is charged with luring the party to an ambush at ""half peak"" where their trap will be sprung.... This is all fairly predictable fayre, to be honest. You just know that the initial hostilities will all mellow and that teamwork, resilience and loyalty will prevail. It's not without it's humour though, and there are some fun animated action scenes that use well the surrounding snowy scenarios. Personally I found it better when it was just the beasties, the human angle was a little dull and didn't really add much. Some good scoring mixing modern with classical styles, a bit of fun ice skating and ""Diego"" did rather enjoyably remind me of ""Scar"" from the ""Lion King"" (1994). I saw it on my own at a cinema this morning which was a shame - it's a solid story with some reasonable characterisations and the animation is efficient rather than ground breaking.

A good airplane movie,"I just saw this on a flight back from Hawaii, and, as a way to kill time on a crowded airplane, this fit the bill nicely.

This plot gimmick is, for grown-ups anyway, rather contrived, but who cares? This is, first and foremost, a kid's movie, and it borrows heavily from the classic Disney animated films in that it features a veritable menagerie of interesting and offbeat animal characters whose interactions manage to transcend an otherwise implausible story.

Funny but brutally straightforward,"Much like Monsters, Inc., I had a really good time watching this movie but felt that something had gone wrong somewhere.First let's start with the good. The jokes are funny and clever and never let up. They're a good combination of the typical verbal humor and the not so typical sight gags. This movie also has one of the longest running gags I've ever seen in an animated movie. The characters are colorful and really know how to tickle your funny bone.Now the bad. The characters fall prey to unconvincing conventions later on in the movie. The story doesn't have the minor plot nitpicks that Monsters, Inc. had, but it's also much more brutally straightforward. Unlike Monsters, Inc., there's really not much point to Ice Age's story. It's there and back again, and you're left wondering ""Um. Yeah.""Even still, Ice Age is a fun knee-slapper that has enough charm and humor to elevate it above Dinosaur. But it lacks the gentle charm combined with zaniness found in The Emperor's New Groove or the craftiness of Chicken Run or Shrek.

Even the drawing style had a certain skewed idiosyncracy that was enjoyable.And the required-by-law tearjerking heartstring-pulling scene was done with a subtlety, delicacy and tastefulness that was nothing short of great, in addition to passing over the heads of the tiniest audience members so as not to give them existential angst beyond their ability to handle.Really well done.

Now THIS is a family film,"There has been a lot of bad kids films in the past decade which relied on tired jokes, predictable story lines and fart humour but this show is n't like that and really can be enjoyed by everyone in the family.The plot starts with Sid the sloth, who, after being abandoned by his family after migration, finds Manfred, a depressed mammoth who just wants to be left alone. Together, they find a baby and decide to take him to his tribe to be with his family. While this is going on, a gang of saber toothed tigers hunt for the baby and send fellow tiger Diego to find the baby, but when he finds the baby in the care of Manfred and Sid he decides to lead them, acting as a tracker right into an ambush. Here begins the humour.The plot is more balanced and the characters more likable then in your ordinary kid film. In this film we see more then just the usual fart and slapstick humour and begin to see jokes about their actual situation and while it does have most of the jokes aimed at kids, the jokes are fresh enough that adults will respect the experience as well.Second, this film has a great back up of not only a good storyline and animation but all the voice actors support each other beautifully and help add quite a style to this movie that also adds to its enjoyability.Overall, the film is funny and has many enjoyable moments. I definitely recommend it for the whole family from the kids to the adults. This is (As usual) the best film in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A little story,"After an attack by a pack of saber-toothed cats (Soto, the leader, with Diego, Zeke and another) a camp of Neanderthal humans try to protect their women and children. Jumping into a raging river with her baby, one woman is dragged downstream. She manages to place the infant on an embankment but is too drained to climb out of the water herself. Soto orders Diego to find the baby and bring it to him alive. Meanwhile the animals are all trying to avoid the coming ice age by retreating to warmer climates. Left by his family, Sid, a clumsy Sloth, is rescued from two rhinoceroses by Manfred, one of the last remaining mammoths. Not wanting to be alone Sid follows Manfred, much to the mammoth's annoyance. Sid and Manfred spot the baby on the side of the river and decide to return it to its tribe, but when they get there the humans have already left. Diego, still trying to pinch the baby, convinces the pair that he knows where the humans are going and begins leading Sid and Manfred to find them. Over the course of their adventures Diego realizes that it would be wrong to harm the child and works with Sid and Manfred to return it to the tribe. At one point he even fights off his former pack. Eventually finding the humans, the trio return the child and say an emotional goodbye to the baby they had gotten somewhat attached to. A subplot involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed prehistoric squirrel who defends his beloved acorn with paranoid fervor, is continued in the follow-up short film ""Gone Nutty"". Alert viewers will notice the plot has some similarity to Disney's animated version of The Jungle Book (1967). Great Movie: ICE AGE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Humour, touching moments, action, and great animation make this a worthwhile CGI film","After Pixar and DreamWorks Animation had made successful CGI animated movies, Blue Sky Studios, another computer animation company, made their feature-length debut with this 2002 blockbuster, ""Ice Age"". Even though this was apparently both a critical and box office success, and has spawned two sequels since then, it took me years to finally get around to seeing it. I'm not exactly sure why, since I've been aware of its existence for a few years now and saw ""Robots"" nearly four years ago and ""Horton Hears a Who"" last year. However, despite how long it took me to finally watch it after all these years, I now have seen it. Aware of its popularity beforehand, the movie did not fail to meet my reasonably high expectations.The story takes place many thousands of years ago. An ice age is coming, and animals are migrating south to escape the increasingly cold weather. A goofy, motormouth sloth named Sid wakes up to find that his family has migrated without him, and he is alone. As he tries to migrate on his own, he meets two rhinos and accidentally angers them. They want to kill him, but as he runs from them, they are fought off by a woolly mammoth named Manfred, whom Sid calls ""Manny."" Sid begins to follow Manny, even though the mammoth finds him annoying and wants him to go away. Nearby, saber-toothed tigers invade the camp of a human tribe in an attempt to eat an infant as an act of revenge! The mother of this infant runs away with him and jumps into a river, leading her to Sid and Manny. Manny saves the baby just before his mother drowns, and the mammoth and sloth must attempt to get him back to his father. Diego, one of the tigers who attacked the camp, helps the two, but what they don't know is that he is leading them to a trap!The animation here is amazing, which is often the case in these CGI films. They developed some beautiful imagery of frozen land. I didn't like the way the humans were animated as much as the way the animals were, but animation-wise, I definitely can't complain about anything else. There's a lot of humour in the film, often thanks to the goofy antics of Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo (though other characters can also be very funny as well), and the comical situations and conflict the main characters get into on their adventure. The subplot with a squirrel named Scrat trying to bury his acorn in various places is also pretty funny, if you like physical humour. Around the beginning, it may look like the film relies mainly on the animation and laughs for entertainment value, but as it goes on, it proves this isn't quite the case. There are some good action sequences, and eventually some touching moments and good morals, which it wouldn't be the same without. Of the three main cast members, Leguizamo was the only one I wasn't familiar with, and he does a nice job with his voice-over. There's also good voice acting from comedians Ray Romano (Manny) and Denis Leary (Diego).Since they started making full-length computer animated movies in the 90's, I've seen many that have come out over the years, and have found that some are masterpieces while others are basically average (haven't seen any terrible ones, though it takes a lot to make a movie terrible to me). Like a number of others I've seen, this one comes somewhere in between, but fortunately comes closer to the former. I guess I can see why this 2002 release doesn't have appeal as wide as several Pixar efforts do, but can also see why it is quite popular nonetheless. ""Ice Age"" was a good way for Blue Sky Studios to make their feature-length debut, and they have since gone on to do more good stuff. This movie has a simple but effective plot, plus a lot more to entertain viewers of different ages, making it another example of good family entertainment. Regardless of your age, if you like computer animation, this particular film probably isn't one to miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Lame, twee and ugly characters....","The movie is lame, twee and characters are ugly. Plot is non-existent. Ok so it is a kiddies movie (this seems to be a popular cry). Fair enough - but compare this with Disney's classics, like Robin Hood or Sword in the Stone and you will see how pale this is in comparison. The characters are not particularly likeable either.Scientifically it is on dodgy ground - yes it is for kids, but the point is that kids believe what they see and why feed them scientifically inaccurate material when it is not necessary.The only saving grace is Scrat the squirrel, which is amusing.My kids thought it was average.Wasted opportunity - for me the first lame movie in its genre (of computerised feature films)",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Very tight, witty and worth watching. Never a boring moment.","Lately I have been a bit let down by the story content of the animated offering which don't seem to be keeping up with the soaring technology that showcases these stories. ""Ice-Age"" is an exception as it is concise and interesting and is over so fast I found myself wishing it would just go on. While the technology is impressive as seen in the remarkable fire, moving water and smoke filled scenes, the technology is used sparingly which is good as it lets the story shine and it does. In addition to a neat and clever story the voices of the characters fit and the plot really books avoiding getting bogged in songs that don't further the plot [like some of Don Bluth's epics].I have not yet seen the special DVD features, but I did watch the film twice on our first showing on DVD. This film compares very well to the Lion King but has less music and a faster cleaner plot. 4.5 Stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Another well done 3D animation film,"Ice Age proves to be a very well thought out, very well voice acted film with a good story. During the last Ice Age, Manny, a wholly mammoth, Sid, a sloth, and Diego, a saber tooth tiger, have become what they call a herd. Trying to survive the ice age, the three come upon a human child thought too be lost by his own kind. Being the good animals the three are they decide to bring the child back too his tribe who is heading for the America's. The adventure that follows is enjoyable and conveys a powerful message.The theme of the film is brotherhood and friendship. Throughout the film many aspects of the characters lives come forth and you witness how the other characters must unite to help one another. Some wonderful voice acting is put into play also. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary all give excellent performances in the leads and help keep the smiles coming.What many must remember is that Ice Age is a kids film and some adults may not find the witty humor as funny as children. I guarantee though that children will fall in love with the characters of Sid, Manny, and Deigo and have some pretty good laughs while watching.3 1/2/5 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Stunning animation, great story","Probably the best animated feature film I've seen. The animation is astounding. The expression of the characters through their movement and faces is amazing. Definitely the best out of everything I've seen before. So realistic. It's the subtlety that does it.The story is a relatively straight-forward adventure/return to home type thing. What makes this stand above other films of this type is the interaction between the characters. Using animals means that they can be physically very different from one another alongside their personality differences, and this works very well indeed. There's some great humour in there and some really touching moments as the main characters overcome their differences and bond into their herd.I really can't fault it. I'd recommend it to anybody. I just hope that they make a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
3 stars,"The humans have (unseen, before the film opens) killed a sabertooth tiger, and the tigers want revenge, so they plot to kidnap a human baby. Diego (voice by Denis Leary) is charged with this task, and he partially succeeds, but finds himself sharing three-way custody of the baby with a woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), who rightly don't trust Diego alone with the baby. Manny and Sid want to return the baby to the humans and Diego agrees, although he secretly has other plans. All of this occurs as the ice age is beginning and almost all animals are migrating south. Interspersed with this main story we occasionally see a hapless sabertooth squirrel thingy trying valiantly (and painfully) to find somewhere to hide the acorn he has found. Besides the squirrel there are a number of other very fun bits, such as dodo birds performing ""Tae Kwon-Dodo"" and showing why they became extinct, as well as references to Star Trek and Titanic.The animation is not as polished or flashy as in Shrek or Monsters, Inc., but it might be a little more human. On the whole, I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend it, but the story which holds the brilliant bits together is pretty obvious and a little too precious to let it measure up to the high standards set by other recent animated films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Cute, but it's no Pixar","There's a pleasant charm to Ice Age that reminds me of when I was young and enjoyed watching The Land Before Time. I think they created some humorous characters and do a decent job of developing all their stories as they journey on a road trip to return a human baby to her family. It's a little annoying that my grown-up mind can't shut out the thought that the entire thing is futile. I mean, we're introduced to a series of creatures who will soon be extinct, so it just feels like they're on a slow march to their doom. That aside, it's a cute film, and I can see why kids would enjoy it and these characters would continue to live through a multitude of sequels. The comedy worked OK for me, but there's nothing about this story that is transcendent like you might expect from other modern animated films. Ice Age has enough heart to keep an adult entertained, but not enough interesting story elements to keep me coming back to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Blue sky first film,"Great animation for 2000s standards (despite looking rather dated by today's standards), considering how CGI animation was a new style at the time and not as developed as it is today. Not to mention much harder it was to animate than it is nowadays.The voice acting is pretty good.Well developed characters with an extraordinary amount of depth:Manny is introduced as an anti-social and uncaring woolly mammoth to those around him, but he's not a total killjoy and gets better, eventually becoming quite friendly and kind. And even before that, he still knew and meant well in spite of his sometimes short-tempered and careless nature.Sid is a clumsy, fast-talking and unpopular, but very optimistic and friendly ground sloth, even though most of the characters misjudge him for being a screw-up most of the time. And his acts of clumsiness and silliness provide tons of comic relief in a charming way. His goofiness is also less annoying here than in the sequels, despite him still being a likable character in those films (excluding the last two).Diego is a smilodon with a sarcastic personality, although it's usually not intended as maicious. He was sent by his pack to retrieve baby from a human tribe as revenge for them killing nearly half of their pack; when he found the baby in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, after discovering Manny's past and the latter saving his life, Diego had a change of heart, confessing about the pack and sacrifices himself to help them escape. He was left for dead when the pack's leader, Soto, wounded him in an attack meant for Manny, but he survived and joined Mamny and Sid on their travels.Scrat is a lonely, non-speaking and hyperactive saber-toothed squirrel who is constantly trying to find a place to store acorns for the winter season, even putting his life in danger to obtain and defend them. He has his own stories in the films which are mostly independent of those of the main trio, though the two plots dointersect at times.A great story about a trio of misfits setting out to reunite a baby with his family after his mother entrusted her son's safety to Manny before she died (following her plunge down a waterfall in order to save her and her son from Soto and his tribe) as they learn more about each other and Manny comes to terms with traumatic events from his past.Speaking of Manny's past, in the middle of the film, we find out why Manny was so cynical and grouchy in the first place. Since he was once a devoted father and husband, Manny loved his wife and child dearly, protecting them well until a band of humans on the hunt came between them. Manny attempted to fend them off but was unsuccessful as his wife and child were killed, causing him to also develop a hatred for them. This also left Manny embittered with the world at large, being cold and indifferent towards other creatures. But even after what the humans did to him, he was still able to forgive them enough to return Roshan to them near the end.You can also clearly see the pain in Diego's eyes in that scene as well, as he realizes how much Manny has been through, and Diego is leading him right to his doom. He feels guilty, as he realize how noble Manny is, as he never held a grudge against the humans for taking his family from him. He was hurt and yet still found it in him to help the one race that harmed him the most. This is what makes Diego realize that Soto's plans for revenge are wrong, as the humans were just trying toprovide for themselves, and revenge won't bring the dead sabers back to life despite satisfaction.While the franchise' villains aren't really known for being particularly memorable, this movie featured the best ones: Soto and the rest of Diego's old pack. As they're the most developed, interesting, and memorable villains in the franchise. As Soto actually has an established motive for his actions (his desire for revenge on a human tribe for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan, alive). They also serve as a legitimate threat towards the main trio and their quest, which is what a good villain should do.Tons of emotional moments, like Sid and Mannyencountering Nadia struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge, only having enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water, the aforementioned cave paintings scene where we discover Manny's past, Diego's apparent death (even if it later turns out he survived) and the trio returning Roshan to Runar and giving their goodbyes to him, while promising to never forget him. There are also some tense moments, like the saber-toothed tigers' raid on the human camp, and Manny nearly dying to save Diego from falling into the river of lava, along with the final battle between the main trio and Diego's old pack. Out of all the movies in Blue Sky Studios' collection, this is easily the one that feels the most like a Pixar film.The meaning of the word ""herd"" also changes in ameaningful way over the course of the story. The first use of ""herd"" is in reference to the human tribe the main trio must return Roshan to, suggesting that ""herd"" simply means of your own kind. However, the next time the movie mentions a ""herd"" is when Manny dramatically saves Diego from falling into a river of lava. When Diego is confused as to why Manny would do this, his response is affecting, ""That's what you do in a herd. You look after each other."" Here, the meaning of the word ""herd"" is changing with Manny and makes the viewers think about what it means to be part of a family regardless of individual differences, which is a wonderful message.Funny moments like Sid collapsing from exhaustion on top of a geyser that goes off after Manny and Diego count down ""3, 2, 1."", the gang's encounter with the dodo birds, and just about any of the cutaway scenes involving Scrat.The soundtrack is incredible, consisting of music like Opening Travel, Fighting Over the Melons, Send Me On My Way, Checking Out the Cave (the latter of which happened to play over what was, without a doubt, the saddest scene in the entire franchise). The background music itself is also very good.Fantastic ending: Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life, changes his mind about handingRoshan over to Soto and confesses to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego pleads for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto and his associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego jumps in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharpicicles to fall onto Soto, killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

But what about mammals?Neanderthal Man, Austrolopithicus, Saber-Toothed Tiger and of course Wooly Mammoth. Werethe only well known ones that roamed the screen. This film introduces us to lesser known mammals that prehistoric animal fans (like me) heard and read about, like the freaky Macrauchenia, the short rotund Moeritherium, the armadillo ancestor Glyptodon and a pair of tough Borntotheriums. Now this film is as funny as SHREK, the first part is copying SHREK, except the rest of the film involves bringing a Baby Neanderthal back to it's family. It mixes drama with action and comedy, but all the comedy dominates the movie.

The formula at work,"They're an odd team, so they have problems; yet, after a while, they belong and learn about themselves. Yeah, that old chestnut. Then there's the other chestnut (or acorn) which provides us with what is the best that this has to offer. Sadly, the greatest sequence is indeed the utterly irrelevant epilogue (though it is of course wisely placed in the end). The whole has a half-baked air to it, thanks and no thanks in part to the animation.Sure, it was aimed at kids, but even they deserve better.One of the low-points of the film perfectly represents the rest of the writing and voicing (animation-wise and movement-wise, the moment is better): the ""shlalom"" exclamation (whether semi-improvised or not). Leguizamo, who reportedly didn't quite know how to voice Sid at first, decided to go with a lisp. How hilarious, the sloth's got a lisp. Ray Romano fails as well, but in the opposite way. These aren't total failures, but even if they were, the almost witless dialogue would still be the same. (Unfortunately, I can only discuss the English voicing, but perhaps I'll update this if I for some reason feel the need to see this for the third time.)There's pseudo-energy, which is bad.In addition to the at-times grotesque-looking fauna (the female sloths look almost as disturbing as that lass next door, and that, I'm telling you, is saying something), the humans look atrocious, as I'm sure you already know. The surfaces, too, are too artificial-looking, which becomes apparent because the landscapes are, and had to be, so vast and, you know, monotonous. (So much so that they rival Romano's voice. Drums.) The film does, I must admit, look very nice at times. In fact, the water looks too nice in these surroundings.I know it seems as if I despised the film, but such is not the case. This does not make me want to pay for the upcoming sequel, but there's good to it. It's concise, and there's still the occasional good quip in the dialogue and the occasional lively moment in the animation. All the recycling is quite competently realised, which saves this from being a complete failure. Come to think of it, it's only a minor failure, a routine effort. Could've done without the obligatory montage sequence to a bad song, though.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Good for kids,"I wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. That doesn't make it bad, just not something I'd go far.It is a little saccharine, so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this.However, all of that goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on-screen. His time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey, could you stick in a little more squirrel?' every time it's getting intolerably dull. That doesn't save the movie, but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where I couldn't stop laughing.'And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all of their stuff, I'd put this at the bottom...but that isn't in itself bad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"To this day, this is one of my top ten all-time favorite CGI animated films. How does it hold up? Check out my review below!","""Ice Age"" (2002), when I went into the theater to see this movie, I had next to no clue of what to expect. Sometimes that makes the original viewing experience better, and sometimes it doesn't. However, in the case of this film, it made it that much more fun and intriguing to watch. I remember very anxiously awaiting it to be released on VHS! After a while, I did get it on DVD. The more I saw it, the more I enjoyed it with each viewing. Eventually, it found a spot on my top ten all-time favorite CGI animated movies list! ""Ice Age"" has a perfect story, perfect voice acting, beautiful animation and a great soundtrack. The plot is, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger find a lost baby and try to bring him back to his parents, while overcoming the harsh conditions of the Ice age. Right off the bat, that sounds like an adventurous storyline. Sure enough, the writers take every advantage that they can to make it as exciting and interesting as possible. There's even a side character named Scrat, who is a saber-toothed squirrel trying to keep a hold of his acorn. Occasionally, he pops in throughout the film and he also gets involved with the main characters from time to time. In my opinion, he steals the show and each scene with him in it makes me laugh and laugh hard. That's another thing that makes this movie shine, the humor. It's not overbearing, or obnoxious at all. For me, it only comes when the moment(s) call for it and make the film all the more enjoyable. The movie is also exciting and adventurous as well! It's a perfect blend of adventure, comedy and action. There's even a surprise twist that comes in later on, but I won't reveal it here or go into any extra details about the plot. However, let me assure you, it's a story you'll remember forever. There is also a lot of heart and soul in this film, much more than in the sequels of the franchise! ""Ice Age"" may only be 81 minutes long, but no second is wasted. It's one of the fastest 81 minutes you will ever spend watching a movie. The ending especially touches my heart, which is a rare feat for any film, let alone a CGI movie! 2D animated films may be superior in my opinion, but the greatness of this story will always hold a place in my heart. As for the voice acting, it's just as sublime as the plot. The whole cast nails their respectable characters! This, in my opinion, is one of the most wild card voice casts in any movie. You have Ray Romano playing a mammoth, John Leguizamo as a sloth, Dennis Leary as a saber-toothed tiger, etc. Interesting choices! Right? That being said, those voices really do work for these characters. I can't imagine any other actors doing their voices. Had someone else did them, it may not have worked at all. Props to the casting agents! As for the animation, it's stunning. This film was animated in the now shut down Blue Sky Studios, and it's easily one of their best movies they've made. It's beautiful to look at, and it's intriguing to view on the screen. You really feel like you've set foot into that world! Finally, the soundtrack composed by David Newman is outstanding. His film score for this movie sets the absolute perfect tone for the storyline. Most of his film scores are normally well written and composed, and this one here is no different. My personal favorite song in the soundtrack, is ""Send Me on My Way"" by Rusted Root. Whenever I hear that song, I immediately think of this movie. That's the mark of a perfect film score. You do hear it a few times in the movie, but the repetition is what makes it all the more memorable, which is a difficult feat. Props to you, David Newman! ""Ice Age"" is a CGI animated marvel, and one of the best 3D animated films of all-time. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're interested in the history of the original Ice age, prehistoric animals, or just simply adventure, then this is the animated film for you. Go check it out today, or else look out for the saber-toothed tigers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Animation,"I first saw this movie in theaters when I was a kid. Since then I have probably watched this movie 6 times. It was worth it each time. This movie is so much fun. Ice Age is great for kids but should not be watched by them only. It has a charm that can appeal to older audiences unlike some animated movies. These other animated movies are still good but don't always hold the interest of the older folks. Ice Age is fun for the whole family! It also has a fairly speedy pace, and the movie is not filled with the main characters singing the soundtrack constantly. The sequel was also very good!

IIIIICCCCEEEE,I'm sick and tired of all the bad reviews about this movie. This is the best animated movie of the year and everyone should treat it with respect. -you can't comment on bad animation on humans becose that was made on purpuse -the graphics are great and no one can deny it -people are complaining about it being childish... it's made for kids so you can't blame anyone for that This is a simple (at least it seams so) movie that everybody will enjoy (except for the people that lost their inner child and are now bi**ing other people about more things than animated pictures),10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
nice way to spend an hour and a half,"I just got back from watching Ice Age and I found it to be fairly entertaining but aimed to a younger audience.  Most of the jokes involved sight gags that, albeit amusing, did not require much thought to understand. Although there were some jokes that older people would catch onto, such as the gay rhinos (don't worry it's clean).  The characters and plot were very similar to Monsters Inc (they find a human baby they don't care for but grow to love etc), but one does not go to a movie like this for the plot really. All and all it was entertaining and fun",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"""We are definitely the weirdest tribe I've ever seen...""","Ice Age was a very entertaining movie, with broad appeal for viewers mature and young. Right from the beginning, when we chuckle at Skrat's futile attempts to crack his prized acorn, we are hooked.The actors chosen to play the main characters' voices played their parts to the hilt, most notably John Leguizamo as the (extremely) goofy-looking but lovable sloth Sid. How could you not laugh at one of his opening lines... ""They migrated without me... they do this EVERY YEAR!!"" Sid is joined by Manfred (Ray Romano) and Diego (Denis Leary) as three beasts very atypical of their species, and sure enough, they start to gel as a group when faced with the daunting task of returning a human baby to it's tribe after it's mother dies while fleeing a pack of saber-toothed tigers.I won't go into great detail about the rest of the story; it is not difficult to predict. The good guys win and there is a happy ending; but hey, this is an animated movie aimed at kids, what other kind of ending could there be? Still, putting that aside, the 75 minutes between start and end are extremely entertaining.My score: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A fun animation adventure,"Rating-7/10Ice Age is an animation which people still enjoy today, with some quick jokes and fun characters to be around the story truly lifts off and the plot is a fun one too any many cases. With a lovely voice cast to guide us through and it's running time being perfect, we can now truly say that Ice Age is not just a film aimed at 3 year olds. My personal feeling with this was that it is a strongly good movie and worth a watch, and so well here below is why I think it is a movie you should watch.The story is nicely paced and as said the running time doesn't drag it, it actually makes it better. The plot is fun and not icy at all with some fun jokes but with a sweet centre that can at times pull at the heart strings(well enough to say this is animation and extinct animals). I did love the characters to and I will get onto them in a little bit but they contribute massively to the story and make it flow even nicer. Maybe not superbly funny, the film I feel is meant to be just a big old adventure and if you enjoy that, then give it a go and see where it takes you.Now on to the characters, I particularly liked all three together as Ray Romano(Manny), John Leguizamo(Sid) and Denis Leary(Diego) work well and really make this film even more fun. Everyone talks about Scrat the little saber toothed squirrel who does make this film even more higher up in the world of animation with a performance that will be remembered for years, and everyone will remember he just couldn't get that acorn out. Finally on Cast I felt the voices were good and varied and I liked the way that the Saber toothed tigers sounded the same as each other, and things like the Dodo's also sounded similar.Animation isn't the top thing about this and I didn't feel it moved flowingly to be fair, although a fair point is that it was made in 2002 so I guess not to much can be expected of it in that department if made then. I loved the effect used though and some lovely looking things like snow falling and even fire are done well, but on the technical side of the film there isn't too much to talk about so best move on.It isn't that funny and maybe a point why this isn't a great film, the humour is there but sometimes it feels as if it is aimed too much at kids and that the adults taking there children there, just won't be in the cinema with them. I also said about the animation being a bit poor and well at times it can be very plain the movie scenery wise but in all fairness the animation was never a point I dragged this down on.I could just tell you that kids will enjoy this, but I also feel adults can too and if your up for an animated adventure then this is for you, especially also that isn't too long a film either. Those who want a really funny film don't watch and people who dislike more slapstick ""type"" humour also don't watch, but I would also like to say that I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't always watch things like this.Overall a 7/10 from me as I felt it was Strongly a Good film, quite near to being very good but what I put in criticisms just didn't allow it. Either watching this with children, or watching by your yourself Ice Age has a little something for everyone, you won't be crying with laughter but I do think this film will leave a little warm feeling in you, and you may want to see more of it, of which there is plenty.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

wonderful animation,"The most striking feature about Ice Age is the animation, which was created using a new method.  It combines the nice motion of claymation, with the texturing, lighting, and color of CGI.  That and good artistic direction gives this film a very ""pure"" look to it.  By comparison, the animation in Monsters Inc. looks too way busy with its emphasis on physics, shadows, and hair.  The animation in Ice Age uses the technology so well, that you don't notice the technology -- you only notice the artistry and simplicity of the animation.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Good, not great","I saw this film with five, eight, eleven and forty year old children. Between us, we've seen almost every animated film made in the last twelve years, in most cases multiple times. (We deliberately missed ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""El Dorado"" after reading early reviews.)  The general consensus was that, while not up to the best of the computer-animated genre, it was entertaining and amusing.  (I especially liked John Leguizamo's voice for Sid the Sloth.)  We rated it as better than ""Monster's Inc."" but not as good as ""Shrek"" or either of the ""Toy Story"" films.  Roughly equivalent to ""Jimmy Neutron"".  Or as, my husband pointed out, he wouldn't pay to see it in a theater a second time,  but he wouldn't be driven crazy by the kids playing it over and over once we got the DVD, either.And the more players in the animation field, either traditional or computer-generated, the better, for those people like me who feel that animated films are generally underappreciated as an art form.

Defines animation at it's best,"Finally - A family movie worth seeing!  I have been itching for 'Ice Age' to come out since the unforgettable teaser was released in Spring of 2001.Overall, the movie was great...while the performances (given by Romano, Leguizamo, Leary) were just so-so.  They had great parts to work with, and they just didn't give it enough 'oomph' to top it all off.  But of course, my favorite character 'Scrat' was wonderful.  Every scene was just hilarious with him in it.Animation wise, it was breath-taking.  Definitely a different feel than Monster's Inc, and Shrek.  Not saying that it was bad - not at all! Just, well, DIFFERENT in a 'cool' sort of way.At some points, it seemed like it took off from Disney's 2000 dud ""Dinosaur"".  For example: the teaser trailer.  But, it worked great anyways.Only TWO bad thing:  TOO SHORT!  I say it ran for about 1 hour and 20 minutes only, and they could've extended the story longer.  Oh, and Scrat needed more appearances!

I loved this film!,"What I think is a testament to this animated film is the fact that I forgot it was an animated film while watching it.The artwork is beautiful and captivating, but the antics and cameraderie of the cast are what take it to a higher level.  The storyline is not unique, but how many films are these days?  What is unique is how well the writer, producer, director and cast all work together.Despite the superficial resemblance to ""Three Men and a Baby,"" this is a buddy film in all respects. The characters continually play off each other in subtle ways lacking in such other films as ""Monsters, Inc."" and even ""Shrek.""Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary work so well together that it's hard to believe this was their first, joint project.  The only flaw I found in this trio was Romano's voiceover of Manny (which was no different from his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" character).  As plain, bland, and easily recognizable as Ray's voice was, it was more than compensated by Leguizamo's quirky-sounding Sid and Leary's cool-cat rendition of Diego.From the moment the movie begins, the gags flow fast and furious, thanks to the addition of the adorable Scrat (voiceover by Director, Chris Wedge). Scrat is the Pleistocene's answer to Wile E. Coyote, but much funnier. There are other throwbacks to previous animated fare (such as Tarzan and Lion King), but, for the most part, Ice Age avoids the strictly formulaic approach to toon films that Hollywood seems to lazily adopt.  Sure, there are those intentionally sentimental moments you have come to expect in every Disney film ever made. Yet, they are not so weighty as to put a drag on the comic continuity of the film.There are also moments in the film where you can see homage being paid to the great animator and gagster, Fred Avery, as when all the characters make their imprint on a snow bank as they crash into it at high speed.This is a film that has something for all age groups. It has silly toon humor for the kidlets, and sly innuendoes for the adults.  I cannot wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Well, what do you know? 20th Century Fox DID it!","I went to see ""Ice Age"" out of curiosity and boredom only. I thought, ""What the heck, let's go see it."" I didn't have terribly big hopes for it and just thought it would be merely a slightly passable hit which would be mildly successful because of the lack of animated films otherwise out in theaters at the time of this writing.But what do you know? The great news is that 20th Century Fox has managed to pull a winner out of its bag on their very first outing!Although the plot won't win any huge awards for originality, it's beside the point: the fun here is with the wildly zany, energetic direction that the film takes in getting from A to B. Unlike the horrendous ""Shrek"", which was basically a bunch of childish gross-out jokes attached to an extremely juvenile attempt to mock Disney (which was so limp that it ended up being the motion picture equivalent of scribbling dirty pictures and wisecracks all over a bully's photo in his high school yearbook), this one is guaranteed to appeal to ALL ages and not just those who haven't yet outgrown the buttcrack/fart stage. This is because ""Ice Age"" is written with a very adult, sly and sophisticated sense of humour that hasn't really seen much of the light of day since the original Looney Tunes creations, gags which grow out of situations and personality as well as clever animation--NOT just cheap laughs.The film is blessedly free of the trendy gross outs that prevails excuses for modern family comedy today. There are only three gags here (which I won't give away) which mildly approach that area--but they work because of the attitude behind them. Let me give you an idea by saying this: the stupid gross outs in ""Shrek"" were created by people would thought that the offensive bodily actions THEMSELVES were funny. By sharp comparison, the three in this film are funny not because of what they are, but because of the identifiable situations they are PLACED in. There's a huge difference, one that frat crowds tend to be all too late to realize until they hit the emotional equivalent of puberty.I'd be tempted to say that it was created as a tribute to the now-late Chuck Jones if it weren't for the fact that it's been in the works since long before his death. I say this because it pays such a huge and loving tribute to the classic WB studio. It's no coincidence that the little squirrel-like character who spends all his time trying to hide an acorn is created with a facial structure and expressions which are almost identical to Wile E. Coyote's.And speaking of facial expressions...well, the ones here put ""Shrek"" to shame. They are wild, cartoony and even manage to outdo the emotions expressed in even Pixar's creations. This film KNOWS it's a computer-animated cartoon as opposed to a computer-animated ""feature film"", so it goes for broke with fantastic exaggerations that would do the Old School proud. Even its gorgeous backgrounds refuse to take themselves too seriously, sporting a cartoonish surrealism that echoes Maurice Noble.My only complaint is that, as with ""Shrek"" and the Pixar films, the people STILL tend to look awfully plastic. But that's such a minor quibble concerning this film, because its only main concern is to provide audiences with the best time watching a comedy that they've seen all winter. And it succeeds terrifically.Take the kids, take your parents--heck, take your grandmother. Everyone will get a kick out of this gem.(NOTE: Why slap a PG rating on a film that has virtually nothing any more objectionable in it than Disney's current G-rated animated features?)",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Fun With Fossils,"If you want a showcase presentation for your big-screen Blu-Ray TV, ""Ice Age"" is a good way to go. It's brilliantly animated, with amazing texture and detail. As a story, it's more than a bit sloppy, and the humor is hit-and-miss, but it does get better as it goes and makes for painless companion viewing with the little 'uns.Long before the dawn of modern man, we join a migration of prehistoric mammals – heading north instead of south. For Manfred (Ray Romano), a mammoth, and Sid (John Leguizamo), a giant sloth, it's less a marriage of convenience than the fact they have no one else. They meet an abandoned Neanderthal baby and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) with an unhealthy interest in taking the kid for himself. The three work out a deal to deliver the kid to its missing father. Diego's true motives are just the start of their trouble.Basically an animated, kid-friendly version of the John Wayne cowboy flick ""3 Godfathers,"" ""Ice Age"" presents a harsh winterscape of high imagination. An early example of a fully computer-animated movie produced not by Pixar or Dreamworks but the smaller Blue Sky Studios, ""Ice Age"" is remarkable for its tactile depiction of snow and water as well as the strange beasts long extinct that make up its cast.It's not all that funny or engaging on its own. The banter is merry but tends to be unmemorable.""How do we know it's the Ice Age,"" we hear one critter ask.""Because of all the ice!"" answers another.The best things about the movie, beyond the sheer spectacle of it, are the voice work of the main actors and David Newman's infectious musical score. Co-directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha seem more amused by the plight of ""Ice Age's"" luckless critters than they have a right to be, particularly a poor sabre-tooth squirrel named Scrat whose attempts at securing an acorn unleash a lot of Chuck- Jones-style mayhem without the twisted joy of those classic cartoons of yore. Any time the action shifts to Scrat, I wince a little, but the kids will like it if they are anything like the twisted brats I know.The film does get better as the relationships between the characters develop. The Diego story arc, as predictable and hokey as it is, pays off rather well. To enjoy ""Ice Age,"" you have to believe in the threat behind the story, and Diego provides much of that. Leary is very good at working the menace into the jokes, and vice versa, though Leguizamo is easily the funniest of the trio, while Romano makes for a solidly enjoyable center.Some things are not well explained, like the reason Manfred is so determined to journey north in the first place and why he puts up with the annoying Sid for so long. The film moves a bit too slow, even after it brings together our core foursome but especially before that. An emphasis on sentimentality, like multiple close-ups of the spritely Neanderthal baby and Manfred's backstory as revealed in some cave drawings, give ""Ice Age"" a weightiness it doesn't really earn. You just know the directors want to get the theater sniffling, as they admit in their DVD commentary.The best scenes do have the power to bring out the kid in anyone. If Blue Sky ever opens their own Magic Kingdom, I hope they offer an ice-tunnel ride or Sid Slalom of the kind we get to enjoy here. The film plays too much to its core demographic that way, but I found it preferable at times to the more adult sensibility of snarky Shrek or the Pixar factory.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Roshan & his tribe are good too.,"Since this is my favourite animation I'm going to comment on it again.Although the animals have more screen impact than the humans, this does not mean Roshan & his tribe are badly done. On the contrary I liked the way they were animated. Several people have remarked that they are unrealistic but I don't see the problem. Photo realism is not what I'm looking for in animation. In any case they look better than the humans in Toy Story.Roshan is cute and I love watching him interact with Sid, Manny & Diego. Sid falls for him immediately and they treat each other like siblings, sometimes fighting, sometimes just having fun. Manny is like a grumpy uncle at first but is soon won over by the baby's charms. The scene where Roshan hugs him is adorable. Even Diego gradually weakens. It is these relationships that make the film such a success.Roshan's parents and tribe only have a small part to play, but an important one too. The ending is beautifully done and no one can fail to be moved. It's just a shame that such a magnificent film wasn't longer. (The same is true for The Land Before Time.

The writers were in desperate need for new material. The storyline wasn't that bad. But wasn't too interesting either. The idea of a group having to return a baby to its rightful home has been done many times. If you're going to make a movie with a cliché concept, you're gonna have to make it GOOD. Make it original.

"Great movie, bring the kids (or the kid in you)","Okay, first things first, this is NOT on the level of Shrek or even Monsters, Inc. in terms of the storyline nor the subtle (or not so subtle) modern references.  TONS of cliches abound. But don't let that get in the way of your enjoyment.  Watch it without being a grumpy cynic and you will come away satisfied for the $8 ticket you just paid.  It's a film that will make you smile along the way and maybe sniffle at the end.  This wasn't meant to be an astract masterpiece.  It was meant as a fun for all ages film and it definitely succeeds. Basic storyline of 3 mammalian misfits coming together to save a baby boy. The voice casting was perfect.  John L. is especially fitting as the clumsy sloth.  The others barely have lines.  The small rodent/squirrel is also good for some short comic relief along the way as he tries hard to bury its acorn.  It was nice to see how they kept Manny's reason for being a loner mysterious until the (almost) very end. What made this movie enjoyable for me were the fantastic job the animators did with the whole body expressions.  This is like watching a CG muppets/Sesame street.  The fur and fat undulates, muscles stretch and contract conveying a very comical feel. Manny's fur and Sid's belly were especially well done. Unfortunately, they focused so much on the animals the humans were left as an afterthought; too robotic but you don't see much of them anyway.  I also love how there were very little saccharine songs (ahem, Disney) to revolt you.  It's wonderful to see how well CG (and people talent) is coming along.  This presents a much more level playing field for the movie studios.  Disney definitely doesn't own this joint which is a great thing since their stuff has been uninspired of late. I can easily (and heartily) recommend this film seeing as how the competition the last 4 weeks have been utter garbage.  So go on, watch it and bring the kids!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Manny's reluctant heroism, Sid's comedic antics, and Diego's inner conflict create a compelling and entertaining trio. The film balances humor and emotion effectively, ensuring that the audience is both amused and moved.Visually, the animation, though dated by today's standards, was impressive for its time, capturing the frozen landscapes and prehistoric creatures with creativity and detail. The movie also benefits from a memorable soundtrack that complements its adventurous spirit.While ""Ice Age"" may follow a somewhat predictable plot, its execution is what makes it stand out. The film's blend of humor, adventure, and heartfelt moments make it an enjoyable experience for audiences of all ages, earning it a solid place in the realm of animated classics.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Cool ICE AGE gets a warm reception.,"Fox has had a hard time with animated features.  ANASTASIA did moderately well; TITAN AE did not.  But with ICE AGE, they may finally have their foot firmly in the door.The animation:  Okay, maybe Blue Sky won't dethrone Pixar or PDI anytime soon.  But make no mistake, ICE AGE is a visual marvel still.  It fits the story perfectly:  alternately cartoonish and detailed when it needs to be. (It's not ALWAYS necessary to see every strand of hair on a creature's body.)Voices and characters:  One of the best things about the film.  The characters are quite memorable, and the vocal performances are great. Others have objected to Ray Romano's performance as Manfred the mammoth, but I felt that his deadpan delivery was just right to portray the strong, yet emotionally wounded loner.  Denis Leary makes Diego a cool cat, whether he's bad or good.  But the best vocal performance goes to John Leguizamo, who is simply hilarious as Sid.  He makes Sid immediately endearing rather than irritating.And then there's Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel whose antics with an acorn open, close, and serve as the transitional elements of the film. He's a miniature Wile E. Coyote to his acorn's Road Runner.  You know he's gonna get it, but you just gotta cheer for--and laugh at--the guy.But the success of a film ultimately comes down to its script.  The trailers make this film out to be hilarious, and it is.  But what a nice surprise to find out there is more to it than mere comedy.  It's a testament to the talents of director Chris Wedge and the writers that you will laugh hard one minute and have a tear in your eye the next.  They also know when dialogue is not needed, which is commendable.ICE AGE has the potential to be a big hit.  It's got one of the best ad campaigns in years, no Disney competition on opening weekend, and on top of that, it has a solid story with endearing characters.  I hope it will be a film for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Great animation, funny, some bad characters","The character of the sloth was absolutely hilarious. He brung this otherwise dull movie up to a seven rating out of ten.  The lion's character was very boring, and the rest of the lions didn't scare me at all, since they didn't harm one living creature. They should have been ferocious, killing some other animal. The mammoth was a character that I also didn't care for.  He was just a lazy lop that complained the whole movie.  And what did that little weasel in the beginning have to do with anything? This movie could have been much better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Entertainment that will stand the test of time,"I'll let others retell the tale and describe the details point for point, I just want to recapture the mood and relate its effect on the audience of the screening I attended.What a delightful surprise. Ice Age is loaded with well crafted characters, an excellent accessible script, and great visual slapstick. Inside the theater where I saw the movie, the audience laughed loudly and often. So did I. Everyone left the theater smiling.Unlike many other recent big budget animation pictures, the voice acting matched the characters personalities perfectly and did not take me out of the movie in the least.But in the end, it was the simplicity of the movie that make me believe that it will stand the test of time, which is why I gave it a 10.Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The animated Ice Age has more than a couple of visually exciting sequences.  Well done story, but just not quite Toy Story quality.","A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible.The movie traces two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but Diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end.There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek. Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age, while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `All the great guys are never around. The sensitive ones get eaten.' Throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. Also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating.'The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. There is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties. The animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Really good comedy.,"I really liked this one.  The affects are first rate and are a really asset to the film.  This give the a bit of realism to it.  The chemistry between the characters is also very good.  The interaction between Manfred and Sid are very good.The comedy of the film was very refreshing.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I found myself laughing with my kids in the theater.

What future 3D animated pictures are supposed to be.,"What can I say. I just saw this film today and God, I LOVE it!! Fox people finally got the hang of it; I liked 'Anastasia' pretty much though. I don't understand why 'Ice Age' is NOT in the IMDb #200 list! This should be in it. What are you thinking, people?!? I've seen a lot of animations so far in my life and this is it. 'Shrek'? No way. 'Toy Story 2'? Close but not enough inspiration as this one has. No offense though- I basically like all well-made animations. Probably the FOX image came under a shadow. What if this was made by Disney?-while it is not possible whatsoever. They became too complacent to produce this kind of gem.Anyhow,""Ice Age"" is THE first animated picture that made me laugh a hearty laugh(TRUE!) and also made me naturally sob at the end. I was not forced at all. All the characters are great-they acted very well together. My sis dotes on the baby and the tiger. Denis Leary did a fine job,by the way. John Leguizamo especially. I didn't even know the voice was him!I got so excited and I don't know if I'm writing this down correctly but PLEASE! Folks who like clean & slick animation and give you laughs&tears, GO SEE THIS!

Familiar tale with some great voice-work,"When a group of sabre-toothed cats led by Soto (Goran Visnjic) attack a group of humans that have been hunting their pack, a mother of a new- born baby escapes, inadvertently leaving the baby with the giant mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and his clumsy, clueless tag-a-long friend Sid (John Leguizamo), a sloth. Soto puts his lieutenant Diego (Denis Leary) in charge of finding the baby and bringing it back to him alive, so Diego befriends Manny and Sid, who are returning the baby to the humans, in an attempt to mislead them into the path of Soto and his savage pack. But they have treacherous caves and a group of idiotic dodo's in their path, amongst other things.With a relatively microscopic budget (of around $60 million) in terms of modern funding, 20th Century Fox have managed to create a lovely-looking (although it suffers in comparison to the likes of WALL-E (2008)) piece of animation with a host of talented voice actors. Of course, due to its massive popularity, the Ice Age films have now produced three sequels, a Christmas special, and a rather impressive profit. I was interested to see why this was so popular, given the massive amount of CGI animated films being churned out these days that are of mainly poor quality. Although the film isn't exactly a classic, the well realised characters (and the voices behind them) and its genuine heart raises it above the rest.This kind of story has been done before, for instance it was bettered in Pixar's Monsters, Inc. (2001) that came out a year before, and although it would be harsh to call the film unoriginal, Ice Age does suffer somewhat because of this. But whoever's idea it was to cast Hollywood misfit John Leguizamo as the idiotic Sid deserves a firm pat on the back. He is the comic relief to the film, and if mishandled could have come across as annoying, yet Leguizamo's voice (coming across as Louis Spence crossed with Mort from Family Guy) and some impressive facial capturing makes him a very funny and endearing character. And every time the story seems to be heading into predictable territory (which is does often), a clever running joke involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed squirrel, trying to smuggle an acorn to be frequently interrupted, makes the film fun again. Hardly anything breakthrough, but there's much fun to be had and I will be watching the sequels.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Childhood Favorite,"This film and ""Shrek"" were two animated movies that I watched a lot growing up. These two films were part of the burgeoning movement of animated films throughout the late 90s and early 2000s. Gone were the days where Disney dominated the genre. We now had Pixar, Dreamworks, and Blue Sky to provide movies that could captivate audiences of all ages. While I believe ""Shrek"" to be a far superior film to ""Ice Age"", this 2002 animation has a lot of things going for it.The 3D computer animation is very dated by today's standards, but so are most movies from that era. What stands out to me are the Scrat sequences which incorporate a ""Looney Tunes"" style of humor, and also the performance of John Leguizamo as Sid the Sloth. Both characters provide a lot of comic relief.The story is pretty basic but it provides adults enough to run off of and is a pretty good thematic message for kids: the power of teamwork, friendship, and family. And the importance of not always needing to be what the rest of the world may see you as.All in all, a cute movie from the early era of computer animation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ice Age melted me,"Adorable, witty, playful, sweet - what's not to like about Ice Age?

Three Animals and a Baby,"This is my first CG animated film that I've ever seen. Usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. Not Ice Age.

The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years in the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals.

A visual spectacle that is a must see,"I'll admit that when I saw the trailer for Ice Age in the theater, I thought it was extremely comical but it didn't spark my interest to go and see the movie.  Some of this reluctance is due to my love of the CG animated film Shrek.  But I wish now that I had seen this film on the big screen as it is a really magnificently done film, considering it was a first effort by Blue Sky Studios and Fox.The acting was brilliant and very very believable.  The animation was some of the best CG stuff that I have seen yet.  The story was well written and contained a very good and solid plot that never left the audience feeling that the movie had bogged down.  The movie contains many scenes which have double entendres and inuendos that are definitely geared for a mature audience but are so well disguised that the average young viewer is not going to pick up on them in the double meaning in which they were intended.Two very emotional and touching moments occurred in the film that were much warmer than hardly any film I have seen live action or animated in a long time.  All in all, I would have to say that this is one of the best films that I have seen come out in a long time.In addition, since I saw the film for the first time on a DVD format, I would also have to comment on the content of the DVD.  Absolutely breathtaking and in many ways as funy and entertaining as the film itself. There is even two animated short films on the DVD which in and of themselves are amazing with their fluid clean crisp CG graphics.Congratulations to the animators, director, studio and producers for generating an instant classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Now I know why this was originally intended to be a drama.,"Ok, at the beginning it looked like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Leguizamo does a great job in this movie, and lends himself nicely for most of the humor relief. Scrat, the little nut hunting squirrel thing was more of a nuisance than a funny anecdote for the film, and it could have done without him.

"Heartwarming, comical ""Ice"" is one for the ages","""Ice Age,"" which could have been alternatively titled ""Three Mammals and a Baby,"" is the smartest and most entertaining animated movie since 2000's ""Chicken Run."" It's an intellectual winner that will prove gratifying for both children and adults, and it's the first great film of a year otherwise marred by rubbish like ""All About the Benjamins"" and ""Resident Evil."" There's just something about small-studio-produced, anthropomorphized animals that does the trick every time.Then again, considering my name, I probably would've been hard-pressed to dislike this movie in the first place.Manfred, a huge, aloof woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), is clearly uninterested in tagging along with an assembly of prehistoric creatures who are migrating south to escape the oncoming Ice Age. Before he knows it, he is thrust into an unexpected and unwelcome position of playing bodyguard to a good-natured yet incompetent sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), when the latter angers a pair of rhinos after inadvertently ruining their dinner in a most unpleasant manner. Meanwhile, Diego (Denis Leary), a revenge-minded sabertooth tiger, has the task of kidnapping a human baby from a tribe who have killed and reduced his pack to the brink of extinction, but his plan of attack fails and the baby disappears from the fracas. Later, Manfred and Sid are shocked to see this little pink thing wash up at their feet on a riverbank, still alive. Though distrustful of one another, the threesome reluctantly put their agendas aside and join forces in order to try to return the child to his family. It's a race against time as they try to succeed in their quest before the Ice Age destroys them all.Considering that this is a computer-generated film, there's no element of surprise in the animation. But ""Ice Age,"" directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has something that sets it apart from its brethren. It's oddly reminiscent of the immortal Looney Tunes cartoons, due to its old-school slapstick. Throughout the picture, a feisty little critter named Scrat (so called because he's part squirrel and part rat) tries constantly in vain to bury his beloved acorn. His first attempt - pounding it into solid ice - sets off one heck of an avalanche. Scrat's continuous failed attempts to bury that darned acorn resemble Wile E. Coyote's vain pursuits of the Roadrunner. The aforementioned avalanche scene, in which two icy mountain ranges collide with each other and nearly crush our diminutive protagonist, is a blast. The resulting ""uh-oh"" expression on his little face, upon realizing his grave mistake, is priceless; you almost expect him to whip out that tiny umbrella and cower beneath it. (He also features in a hilarious tag scene at the film's conclusion.) When characters go flying into a snowbank, they leave their silhouette-shaped imprints in their wake. Diego and Manfred continuously knock Sid on the noggin simply for the baby's amusement. ""Ice Age"" even contains a unique and spectacular take on the chase scene, courtesy of what looks like a frozen waterslide hidden deep in a cave.As was the case with ""Chicken Run,"" this film's centerpiece is its superb voice acting. With a trio of venerable comedians cast in the leading roles, the chance was there for them to ham it up and try to outdo each other. Instead, their performances are considerably restrained and they mesh together well, resulting in near-impeccable comic timing. Romano brings the right touch of endearing grouchiness as Manfred, but without becoming a completely miserable sourpuss. Leguizamo's high-pitched voice, coupled with a Cindy Brady-type lisp, is perfect for the cowardly and lovable Sid, while Leary, one of the greatest - and most ribald - stand-up comics ever, is all easygoing attitude as shady Diego, who may or may not have something to hide. Their voices fit the characters in the tradition of Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd; it's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles.It doesn't hurt that their bestial counterparts are so darn cute and well developed either. Sure, Diego's mission is to abduct the baby and bring him to the leader of his pack (voiced by Goran Visnjic), but viewers will discover that it's near impossible to feel any animosity towards him. His character is hurt slightly by predictability, but that doesn't make him any less enjoyable. Manfred is pretty much a Neanderthal Lou Grant in terms of his take on the familiar surly-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside disposition, but he doesn't whine constantly about it. He doesn't expect anyone's sympathy. The oddly proportioned Sid steals the show, from his funny backside-swinging strut to his personality as a timid little sloth with a heart of gold; no one is more dedicated to returning the baby safely back to his home. There is a hysterical scene where poor Sid sits in the pouring rain while trying futilely to build a fire, or when he entertains some girlfriends in a prehistoric Jacuzzi (in this case, a tar pit). But while ""Ice Age"" succeeds at tickling the funny bone, it's not all mindless fun and games. There is one emotional moment when our three heroes look at a series of cave paintings, including one featuring a mammoth family - mother, father, and child - which transforms into a beautifully animated yet melancholy sequence showing a horrible human slaughter of the family, as seen through Manfred's perspective. He feels a spiritual connection to the baby after the death of his own. Not since Gandalf's demise in ""Lord of the Rings"" have I teared up during a movie, which, needless to say, is something I don't do very often. It's a rarity when a film causes viewers to believably experience different emotions without feeling forced to do so.""Ice Age"" succeeds in various ways where ""Shrek,"" to which it has drawn many comparisons to, fails. How remarkable is this film? It may mark the first time that the toilet humor contains actual humor. The stiff partnership between Manfred and Sid is parallel to the relationship between Shrek and Donkey, only it's much more amusing. There's no juvenile or crude humor, nor are there any unnecessary potshots aimed at its competition or hypocritical morals preached to the audience, such as the rampant don't-judge-someone-until-you-know-them ethics in ""Shrek"" that were wedged in between the short jokes. The film's only real weakness is an insignificant sequence involving an army of dodo birds, but it's no more abhorrent than watching frogs and snakes being grossly inflated into balloon animals. And, there are no bloody ""Matrix"" spoofs to be seen anywhere.After a string of disappointments like ""Anastasia"" and ""Titan A.E.,"" Fox's beleaguered animation department has finally broken the jinx with this comic delight, and you can do likewise with ""Ice Age"" if you've already lost hope for the 2002 movie season. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It's average...and immoral,"Maybe a bit below. For me, ""Ice Age"" is what defined the decline of inventive story-telling in the new cgi era. I remember seeing this in theaters. I was thrilled to see it because I was mentally inclined to think that cgi = greatness thanks to the likes of Pixar. Aside from the incorporation of several ""Scrat"" sequences, the film was average average average. I had the thought process of the film fully envisioned in my head after viewing it. The creators needed a unique environment with some animals and chose the ice age. They then invented a very 'Shrek'-esque formula: a tetchy large protagonist is accompanied by a underdog who for no apparent reason insists on joining in on the journey to complete the task that is the conflict of the film. It is however less inspired than ""Shrek"" and the laughs are more sporadic. Well, for me anyway. I must admit that the audience is always driven to giggles over the annoying 'sabre tooth' squirrel thing that suffers in his many pursuits for nuts. I hate it, it's a Looney Tunes rehash. But if the crowd likes, fine. That is actually a merit for the film. The other characters, ""Manny"", ""Sid"" and ""Diego"" are average characters when it comes to personality. Diego is the soon-to-be-redeemed for his evil meat eating ways (as long as he's not human) character who will learn to befriend the annoying sloth and the stubborn Mammoth. Manny will learn to love and respect the small child that falls into his care despite the fact that the child will grow to cause the extinction of Manny's species. Too bad he can't learn to respect the tigers for attempting, like the humans, to live. Nope, the tigers are evil demons. Moving on.Sid is the irritating sidekick. Dorry, Donkey, Mike from ""Monster's Inc"" all come to mind, although most likely it wasn't plagiarized from any of those. He did garner the most laughs aside from ""Scrat"", the infamous squirrel and his nut. The story overall is not very interesting or creative. Some animals find a human child and must return it, finding laughter along the way. The attention is gained from the character's antics (which many have grown to love). If you aren't interested in the characters you'd hate the movie. The overall theme of the film is that meat-eaters should give up meat and magically live while befriending the prey. Also, that animals are reprehensible for causing any kind of discrepancies to the human race in an effort to not be killed for their fur, and that the animals should deal with it. Indeed, a watermelon is ""hilariously"" stolen from some dodo birds for the human and we laugh at the stupid soon-to-be-extinct birds as our heroes effectively steal from them. The film epitomizes the formulaic talking animal genre, for the most part, but the main problem is that it relies on the gimmicks on the comedy and it isn't gut-wrenchingly funny. I had a hard time laughing at the screwed morality. Luckily, as usual, I was the only one who noticed it. What I have left to review is the animation, which for the time was adequate. The film is average, and it needs to get it's problems with the food chain settled out. It caused Ebert to give thumbs up to Disney's ""The Wild"" for paying heed to this issue.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Loved it!,"Why are digital animation films taking successfully over traditional animation? Because of examples like ""Toy Story"" (1&2), ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"" (wonderful), ""Monsters, Inc."" and now, ""Ice Age"".As the rest of listed films, the secret of this new breed of animation is found in the ORIGINALITY of the idea...ORIGINALITY-something quite difficult to find in cinema nowadays. The story told by ""Ice Age"", although simple, is perfectly narrated and very well ""juiced"" by their producers, as throughout the story you find lots of gags and scenes that could seem not essential for the story, but are excellent (the final scene, for instance) and very funny.The originality of this ""Ice Age"" stands in the excellent design of both characters and scenery, and in the excellent personification of the animals we see during the movie. A special mention for the squirrel, Scrat, one of the funniest toons I've ever seen. Another interesting point is the ambition of Fox Animation to transmitt, alike Disney films, a message (in this film, sort of friendship, courage and ecologic balance between humans and nature), but not in the classic ""kiddish"" way we are so tired of watching. The thing is, here that message doesn't take over the whole plot of the story: the real ingredient is the humour the film constantly radiates, let the public enjoy a memorable film just by its ambition of being extremely funny and humorous, not by showing a kind of serious melodrama, like happened with ""The Prince Of Egypt"" and many of the last Disney´s, such as ""Pocahontas"". David Newman's music outstands: rhythmic and very playful, like the very first piece of the film, in the starting credits and the migration of animals to the south.What more can I say? Many more small things and details, but the essential is summarized here. Just say this is NO film for kids and youngsters: the fame of animation of being exclusively aimed at children is finished. So important has this genre become, that even the Academy has made an exclusive Oscar for the best animation film of the year. Because thingts have changed. Just by watching the films I listed at the beginning, you'll find the answer. And ""Ice Age"" follows this new tradition of excellent and original digital animation.VOTE ----> 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Amazing dialogue!,"Maybe the film as a whole wasn't mind-blowing, but the comments of the characters certainly live on! The dialogue was truly funny -even though the plot was a bore.

"Slapstick, heart, and more laughs than I've had in a while","Having been disappointed by the overrated Shrek, I was delighted to find the fun and whimsy in Ice Age that's been missing in recent films, particularly animated ones. Yes, there are moments, particularly at the beginning, that feel somewhat cliche, but how many ways are there to kick off a journey picture? The characters are strong, the voice acting is excellent, and the plot far more emotion-driven than one would expect from the previews. That being said, the reason I love this picture is the slapstick. It features, in the form of a bizarrely shaped buck-toothed squirrel and his eternal crusade to bury a nut, one of the most original and hysterically funny opening sequences and running gags I've ever seen. Watching Ice Age is like watching an hour and a half of Shrek's Gingerbread Man. I have not laughed this hard in a movie theatre in an extremely long time, and I'd recommend Ice Age to anyone of any age. Nothing too scary for little kids or too intense for the older crowd and enough wit and heart for everyone in between.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
I'm positively surprised!,"This is one of the funniest animation movies I ever watched. The witty dialogs and the uncluttered storyline makes this one of the movies I'll be watching again for sure.The main difference from most Disney productions is that the dialogs are smart and not too targeted at kids... And this is of course an animation rather than a cartoon, most of the time.BTW, it wasn't that the humans couldn't talk, just that (as nowadays to :) ) animals and humans simply don't speak the same language.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Excellent.,"Ice Age is a wonderful film.  The main characters are so lovable and developed (a rarity in film these days.) that you can't help but be engaged and totally absorbed in their adventures.  The key to good film isn't plot, story or effects.  It isn't even good animation.  It's CHARACTER, and this film's got that in spades.  There are also deep and emotional messages about family and friendship, morality and betrayal.  Contrary to what you may read in some reviews, this film is not for little kids.  It is totally adult in feel and execution, full of maturity and perspective.   The humor is a great touch, even the ""poop"" humor, because it is dealt with in a sophisticated, adult way, not a Shrek-Ohh!-Someone farted!-That's so FUNNY!-way.  I would know because I HATE childish ""humor"" like that. Movies like Dr. Dolittle 2 make me want to walk out. It ISN'T funny.  It is just stupid and talks down to the audience as though we're all fourth graders.  What IS funny is three Prehistoric beasts arguing about who is going to look at the ""baby thing"" the baby is wearing and be the ""poop checker""... These are adult animals having to deal with a human baby, and that is just plain funny, especially when they conclude from it that ""humans are disgusting.""   To put a scene like this even NEAR the immaturity of Shrek's is unbelievable.   One is realistic and reflective, the other is just rubbish from some writer with a six year-old mentality.     ""Ice Age"" is light years beyond Shrek in its approach to real themes like death, loss and sacrifice, and all of it is carried off with perfect results.  There are a couple of very brief moments where the emotion is excessive, but it is so meaningful that this is hardly a complaint.   The story is wonderful and, unlike other great films like The Lion King, the quality of the humor and emotion is uniform to the very end.  I love this film because it is full of terrific dialogue.. The characters discuss everything with absolute honesty and realism, which rounds out all their personalities and provides lots of humor.  I went into this movie thinking it was going to be awful-- (Hearing things like, ""If you liked Shrek, you'll love Ice Age"" only confirmed my dread.)  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Ice Age was amazing and moved me to laughter and tears, and I'm going to see it again today.  If you're a big Shrek fan, you might not like Ice Age.  But if you like an adult movie with a great, emotional story and rich characterization, I highly recommend ""Ice Age.""My score: 9.8",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Almost could have gone Direct To Video. Bright moments and lots of dull and bad stretches,"""Ice Age"" is one of the most mixed and uneven movies I've seen in a long time. Overall it was ""OK."" There were wonderful aspects-- and some really bad aspects. The mammoth and the sloth, for example, were amazing bits of animation. The water at the end of the movie was also marvelous. Some of the scenes, though, were cheesey rip-offs of way better films. Note the similarity between the mountain cave passages in ""Ice Age"" and the flying whale scene in Disney's ""Fantasia 2000."" The flying whales, and the whole trapped under the iceberg thing--- was enchanting, evocative, uplifting, and a masterpiece. The rip-off version in ""Ice Age"" by contrast seems dim, depressing, and dreary.Much of ""Ice Age"" resembled the frenetic and abbreviated desert scenes of the later, crappier, Road Runner cartoons. I saw ""Ice Age"" in a small town full of ordinary people. The audience at my showing was a mix of small and medium kids and their parents. There were a few moments of ""Ooooh!"" and a few quiet chuckles. One or two kids guffawed every time an animal stepped on a stick and got hit in the face. Otherwise, the theater was pretty quiet. I think we were all waiting for the cool part to start, when all of a sudden, the movie was over.Referring again to the moments of goodness-- the tigers looked awful, but Dang! The mammoth and the sloth looked great. Their fur was so well done! But if it weren't for their great looking fur, this movie could probably have gone straight to video.Take the kids! Take the grandparents. But to keep from boring yourself into a stupor, get drunk first (but don't drink and drive, take a taxi!).",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Absolutely a delightful film, and the computer animation is excellent.

Good Family Fare,"Kudos to writers, Michael J. Wilson and Michael Berg, who have given us a unique and cleverly written film that will appeal to anyone over four. The story revolves around two misfit characters, a depressed giant wooly mammoth, and an obnoxious, irritating sloth who has been rejected by his family. They meet as one heads south to escape the ""ice age"" and the other is heading north to escape life. A friendship of sorts ensues and then strengthens when they find a baby boy and decide to try to find its parents. Trouble ensues when they meet up with a tiger who tags along with them under pretense of concern for the child, while secretly imagining it as breakfast. This is simply a downright funny movie, filled with clean comedy, slapstick, lots of action and the sweetness that we adore in Disney films. Some scenes are very poorly digitally mastered however, which distracts from the film, and for this reason alone I deducted a point.

Hit and miss animation,"Back in 2002, animation movies were really becoming hugely popular, so it's no surprise that Fox decided to jump on the bandwagon with their first real effort at a CGI movie. The result, ""Ice Age"", is watchable but certainly no match for the Pixar and Dreamworks competition.To start with the good things, all the scenes involving the frantic squirrel/rat (""Skrat"") character trying to hide his nuts everywhere are simply great. The same is true for the part involving the hilariously stupid and suicidal dodos.As for real laughs, that's about it though. There are some occasionally funny bits, but for the most part ""Ice Age"" is too predictable and repetitive to be really funny. The constant bickering between the main characters gets old really fast, and the Sloth character in particular often crosses the line between funny and just downright annoying.Don't expect anything from the story or the characterization either. I don't mind that the plot is predictable (let's face it, most animation movies have similar plots) but it's so sickeningly cute and delivered in such a pedestrian, play-it-safe manner that it should really appeal to kids only. The characters also left me completely cold, other than that I felt sorry for Skrat.As for the animation itself, I have to say in general that it's below par, even by 2002 standards. This might have been intentional and for the most part the overly cartoony style works reasonably well, but don't expect to marvel at the visuals.In the end, I'd have to say Ice Age is still watchable. I didn't care much for the fairly dull characters and the overly cute and basic plot but there are enough funny bits to mostly make up for that.**1/2 out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A New Age For Computer Animation,"Animation has always managed to keep up with the current techology. Nowadays, the big thing is computer-generated animation.  The leaders in this field is Pixar, the studio under the wing of Disney, which has given us ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.""  Then, Dreamworks' partner Pacific Data Images came to produce ""Antz"" and ""Shrek.""  Now a new studio steps into the ring, Blue Sky, which is partnered with 20th Century Fox.  Its first feature, ""Ice Age"" has already shown that it has what it takes to be a major player in the CGI animation game.  ""Ice Age"" isn't as finely polished as a Pixar movie, but it is very well done.  The story has its share of laughs and heartfelt moments.  But the main draw is the sight gags.  The walk through the glacier cave is a classic example.  Plus, the antics of the Scrat also amuse.  Another good point of the movie is its portrayal of prehistoric wildlife.  Almost everyone thinks of dinosaurs, but few people are aware of the more obscure mammals that walked the earth after dinos ruled.  And an interesting cross-section is presented in ""Ice Age.""  Chris Wedge has already given us an epic in ""Ice Age.""  I hope he can continue to give the competition a run for its money!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Very Funny Movie.  A lot better than ""Robots""","This is an extremely funny movie. Although some of it seems stolen from other movies, it manages to pull off a difficult job: making a believable world that is consistently funny throughout. Undeniably, the best part is Scrat (or is it Scrap). Whenever he's on screen, I can't help to bust out laughing. Too bad he's not part of the main story. The main characters include a mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber tooth tiger (Dennis Leary; apparently, they didn't think alliteration was appropriate for this character). All in all, these characters manage to get some good laughs (although they pale in comparison with Scrat). Sid can sometimes get annoying, but overall the three main characters aren't bad.There are plenty of good scenes, including a fight with a group of apocalyptic dodos, an amusing trip in an ice cave, and a final scene with Diego's pack. Some parts of the movie feel stolen from other movies. The pack feels like something from ""The Lion King"" and the baby seems like it was lifted out of ""Monsters Inc."" Furthermore, although I'm not complaining about the voice talents, I wish they would do what Pixar does, and mine the creative depths of the staff as opposed to just going to large scale celebrities for voices.Still, this was an excellent animated film. I would recommend this over ""Robots"" any day.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Among these creatures a lone mammoth named Manny is shown trying to leave all of the others behind, and soon meeting an oafish ground sloth named Sid. The two travel and soon Sid, who had found a baby human, made a move to try to return this baby to his tribe. Manny, not seeming to care a whit for Sid but having an altruistic attitude, teamed up with him and the two made their way to meet up with a saber-toothed cat known as Diego, who was employed in the finding of the humans, claiming that he could find them.

The best non-Pixar animated kiddie-flick.,"A mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger and a sloth must find a way to transport a human baby to his tribe, while avoiding pitfalls, natural disasters and pursuing sabre-tooths...In my humble view the best non-Pixar animated film made so far, and Sid the sloth the funniest character with the best voice performance in any animated film. (Way to go Johnny Leguizamo!) While the sabre-toothed squirrel Scrat and his pursuit of nuts are apparently hilarious (maybe once) and have been overdone to death in the sequels, the relationship between Sid, Manny and Diego is the film's strength. Manny is the leader and most sensible, Diego is a little dangerous at the best of times and Sid is basically a well meaning idiot that must be forever watched over else he'll end up in trouble. As the three realise that they must stick together to get the job done and learn to put up with one another they forge a solid dynamic, which enhances the drama near the end of the film.This lead to a couple of sequels (so far), one OK, the other a bit of a cash in.What you hope kids will learn: If we all stick together and trust one another we can achieve anything.What they'll take away: The prehistoric era was like a big theme park with cool slides and funny animals.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Subtle, sweet and hilarious, very good indeed.","Genre: Prehostoric creatures, animation, comedy, family.Main characters: Manfred the mammoth, Sid the Sloth/Thid the thloth, Diego the Sabretoothed tiger and the baby.What happens: The film starts with a rather determined-to-have-his-acorn creature called Scrat, who in trying to get his acorn, causes a few glaciers to collide. Then you meet Sid and Manny...My thoughts: It looks like Chris Wedge, who had done just little films before this film, could produce a motion picture SO good, that it became a hit at the box office (something which everyone seems to care about...) and it did well otherwise, making loads of people enjoy it all around the world (oh yes and they also put it into many different languages).Yes, this is a good film, no doubt about it. Pretty good use of computer animation, especially in background. The characters are very likable and their lives and personalities are very subtle in a good way (their past is certainly not easy to understand). The jokes are very good, funny and not too unclean (unlike in films such as ""Open Season""). The excitement is also not very high, a few fighting and scary scenes (not too bad for the youngsters though) but apart from that not much. Everyone wants action films nowadays and yet this was a big hit!

Predictable story,"This is the second animated feature by Twentieth Century Fox and I thought the general idea was endearing enough but it just plods along in a very predictable manner. The story of course takes place in the ice age and we see a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) being saved by a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and they start traveling together during the southern migration. Also, some sabertooth tigers want to get revenge on a tribe of humans and the leader of the pack decides to steal a human baby and he selects a tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) to carry out this mission. He chases the human mother until she and her baby jump into the river and disappear. She washes up down the river where Manfred and Sid find her. She dies but the baby is alive but then Diego shows up and wants the baby. Manfred and Sid say no but Diego says he can lead them to a pass in the mountains where the humans are going and they can hand the child over. But Diego is really leading them to an ambush where the other tigers will be waiting. So the journey begins and at this point in the film Diego discovers the importance of being in a herd and how you should look after one another. The story is very predictable and you can guess what is going to happen before it even happens! There really is nothing new here. A band of talking animals protecting a human baby, haven't we seen that before? Didn't that happen in ""Monsters Inc""? The animation is not overly impressive although some of the shots have some good detail. As you watch this film the animation just doesn't grab your attention. I think part of the reason is the bleak landscape. How attention grabbing is the color white? It doesn't leave a lot of room for detail. I did enjoy Ray Romano's voice for his character. His deep and slow drawl seems perfectly suited for a slow moving mammoth. Its not a bad animated film and its hard not to root for these characters no matter how hokey the story is. But the story is really aimed at a very young audience and it should work best for that mentality. But if your a teenager or older than you will easily spot how familiar the story is.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"There is humor, warmth, emotion, and attention","There is humor, warmth, emotion, and attention. It is also a classic animated film that cannot be missed. A pine nut and a child sparked a hilarious story for me... From then on, I fell in love with Blue Sky Studio-- I really liked it when I first watched it on the movie channel back then, and I also watched replays afterwards-- The MP5 I once bought contains a scene of Scott the Squirrel chasing nuts, which I have read many times-- Squirrels are responsible for humor... sloths are responsible for joking, and in the end, they have gained sincere friendship with mammoths and saber toothed tigers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Ice Age: a journey between ice peaks""","""Ice Age"" : film is a true classic in world of animation movies that not only provides a lot of entertainment, but also a lot of laughter and emotion. The engaging plot, amazing animation and brilliant characters make it still fresh and full of energy even after many viewings.Our main protagonists Manny, a large and rough mammoth, Sid, a lazy and slightly irritating sloth, and Diego, a brave and mysterious tiger - these are three heroes who face great challenges, and at the same time provide the viewers with a lot of laughter. Their adventures are full of unpredictable plot twists, which makes it difficult to take your eyes off the screen.Of course, the film not only entertains, but also conveys important values. Friendship, cooperation and acceptance of diversity are at the forefront, which makes it not only great entertainment, but also a life lesson for the whole family.Even though ""Ice Age"" is getting older, it can still delight and entertain.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Ice Age,"Just fun classic Disney comedy. I really enjoyed the film overall. The nice thing about the kids films made during this time period is the story's are so good that the adults can't help bit enjoy the film as they are watching it. This film takes place during the Ice Age, where there are animals running around Earth that are long extinct now like the Wholly Mammoth. A tribe of Sabre Tooth tigers are tracking down a family that appear to be settling in the area but are a form of hunter-gathers. They want to take the baby and feast but the mom escapes but gets still does not make it. Now a odd crew of animals work together to return the baby back to their home.

"Funny.. yeah, for 5 year old kids maybe!","The story is simple. The jokes are crude. The WHOLE story was clear after 10 minutes (if even that). It's full of every movie cliché in the book (then again, it is FOX isn't it). I can't believe that so many adults rate this highly. I'm not complaining, the animation is nice. It's perfect for kids but not really for anyone over 10. It is not comparable with any of the ""Toy Story"" movies or even Monsters Inc. to a lesser extent which all work on so many levels... for both kids and adults. Shrek blows it out of the water. Just don't bother, get it out for the kids if you want them to be distracted for 90mins or so. Otherwise just stick with Pixar!

"A Wooly Mammoth (Manny), a Sloth (Sid), and a Saber Tooth Tiger (Diego) set out to return a Native American child to its home","It was hard not to compare this movie to others like Monsters Inc. or Shrek, which were also great animated films. I really like the computer animated movies like these. This film is just fun enough and enjoyable enough to rank itself up with the other two. While this film may not be as original, actually seeming to blend the plots of Monsters and Shrek, it doesn't matter due to the lovable character personalities and intriguing scenery. It didn't seem to matter too much that the relationship between Manny and Sid was much like Shrek and the donkey, or that two odd characters are stuck with a human baby, with the larger hairy one eventually warming up to it. Mixing the two plots, tossing the setting back into prehistoric times and using that as a basis for a lot of its humor, works very well here. And the film has heart. While it does seem a little corny at times, the heart is there, and it's always great to see a warm movie like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Hey Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire","Ice Age is a very funny film. The story revolves around three different animals during the migration because of an Ice Age, who find a baby human and begin a quest to reunite the baby with his tribe. An interesting take on the John Wayne film ""3 Godfathers"", which revolved around three outlaws who find a dying woman that gives birth to a baby and requests the men take the baby back to town to give the baby a chance at life. Similar indeed. The difference is that ""3 Godfathers"" was more a drama and ""Ice Age"" is a family comedy. I'd recommend watching both films, then compare and contrast the two of them. You'll see the similarities.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Ah. yes.,"Ice Age as is should be... a funny, charming, tight little film about the adventures of Sid the sloth, Manny the mammoth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. Unencumbered by the progressively growing list of characters in later movies, the plot swiftly shifts on from one winning comedic set-piece to another, with some surprisingly moving scenes along the way. Basically, stick with this classic... the follow-ups might not be all bad, but they're thoroughly unnecessary and you could do better things with your time. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

My comment on the characters: Sid the sloth was only annoying, that Manny the mammoth is only grumpy and that tiger is pathetic...

A Story as far as I'm concerned is as real as we can make it.,When I saw the story unfold I felt like this was just another cartoon that someone made a few bucks on. I was pleasantly surprised to see characters developed with care and a illustrator with a heart. The Woolly's eyes and brow are almost human. He puts his trust in Deigo and Sid and when he almost died when the ice bridge collapsed trying to save Diego I lost it. When Diego asked Manny why he did it he simply said because that's what friends do. I think the story line really shows what we as humans should be like. It is a shame we have to use cartoons to show ourselves what we should be like. I will get caught up on the other Ice Age movies that are now out.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"""Ice Age"",a marvellous film for everyone","Although aimed at children, ""Ice Age"" is a little like one of those timeless tribal stories where different age groups get something valuable out of the tale at different levels, whilst always enjoying the story into the bargain.Its simple plot and easy going pace, do nothing but enhance its delivery and charm. Timeless you might say.The film follows three widely different species of mammal as they seek to return a Human child to his people.They are Manfred the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. They go through several testing adventures together, an experience which is often fertile soil for the making of strong friendships. Here is no exception since they come to refer to themselves as ""the herd"".I think the choice of mammoth as one of the child's saviours is a wise one since there have been allegorical tales of their surviving relatives, the elephants extending a level of concern beyond their own species.There is one very touching scene which takes place within a cave which Humans have perhaps used for generations to reflect and meditate on their place in the world. It is daubed with paintings of various animals, among which are mammoths being hunted. We are witness though to what appears to be a bond and an understanding between the child and Manfred, that their friendship transcends such concerns.Sid looks like a caricature rather than a real sloth, and most of Diego's feline pride also look caricatured. That said, I simply love the animation of the characters, and the level of observation which has obviously gone into living cats, pachyderms and Humans. Diego does the cat-crawl, and Manfred uses his trunk with absolute sensitivity, as would his latter day relatives.If you have young children show them this film, they'll love it. If you don't have children don't worry. See it anyway, and remember that friendship and responsibility frequently extends to those of another species.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Ray Romano does a great job as Manny the Mammoth, John Leguizamo is fine as Sid the Sloth, Dennis Leary is perfect as Diego the fierce sabre tooth tiger who learns the meaning of friendship and the character of Skrat the wacky squirrel, voiced by director Chris Wedge, steals every scene he's in and becomes a star.

All the sequels are better.,"Even as 9 year old I found this kind of underwhelming.I was disapointed that the Squirel wasn't really part of it, he just breaks up the plot with some vintage style visual gags that really are the best part of the movie.There is a pleasant approach to backgrounds and settings where you really get a convincing sensation of a pretty snow turning into something deadly.But too much of the movie is this tiresome duo of the goofy sloth and the no nonsense mammoth. I struggle to get invested in them trying to save this human. He just seems like a nuisance. The Tiger trying to misdirect them only discover the magic of friendship is also unoriginal, contrived and frustrating.The moments of pathos are not earned, the slapstick humour is something out of a hundred forgettable cartoon shows and it baffles how many sequels this got.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Excellent characters,"This movie is not plot heavy. It's really about the characters - who they are, how they interact with each other, and what their goals are. Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber toothed Tiger are the protectors of a child who they received rather surreptitiously... well Manny and Sid have, but Diego has a somewhat different idea.So all three head out to find the ""herd"" of humans to which this baby belongs. The baby is very quiet, happy, and very brave - a rare combination in any human. Regardless of this idealization (like talking, conscious animals are not?) all four are very well played out and voice acted (yes, even the baby has to be voice acted) that you feel that they are real and not animated. That's the success of this movie - since it is character heavy, then the characters must become real to the audience or else it would fail. Well it is a marvelous movie that kids of every age can appreciate and relate to in some way.One extra nod to John Leguizamo for his voice acting of Sid - who steals most of the scenes without being overbearing.There is one thing wrong with this movie - it's too short. :) 9/10-LD___________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
cute,Filled with clichés of all cartoons this one still has enough to overcome its mediocre story. The cast has a blast with the characters who are all well thought out. The characters with great voices are the highlight here. It looks great and can be fun if you let it. It is an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the pixar movies but fails to get the magic of those wonderful films.

Great fun. Presumably the funniest animated film I've seen so far.,"Ice Age is a movie that really focuses on it's characters. I found the way the characters look, move and sound very funny and amazing. It wouldn't be fair to say that they just had some life in them like I did for Madagascar. At times I was so sunk in that I forgot that I was watching invented creatures because they appeared so authentic.I won't give away the story, all I can say is that it's pretty classical but still very worth watching and portraying on the big screen. There's also a pile of fun and imaginative creatures in the movie. But most of all the creators gave great significance to fun and adventure.Surprisingly there's just a handful of movie references which I didn't mind at all. One of the few things I didn't find very good was the action that went a bit overboard at times. Overall this is a very fun animated feature.

One of the best animated films EVER!,"I first saw this film in a cinema when it was first released, and it is now one of my personal favourites. Even now, 5 years later, it still manages to make me laugh. I can't really choose just one aspect of the film that makes it so brilliant, but I definitely think that the cast has something to do with it.Ray Romano is a great choice for Manny; he can be moody and sullen at times, but we also get an insight into why he is like that; he is hiding his pain. Dennis Leary is brilliant as Diego; you're never quite sure where you stand with his character until the very end. Sid the sloth has got to be the funniest character in the film (aside from Scrat possibly); without him, the other characters would have no one to direct their sarcastic comments at, and there would be a lot less comic relief. John Leguizamo is amazing; the voice he gives Sid is so distinct and funny that it makes me laugh every time. He gives a charm to the character; even though he may well be one of the ugliest things you've ever seen, you warm to his kindness and loyalty to his friends. Sometimes when watching a film, there are parts that really seem to drag; fortunately, I did not find any such moments in this film.Possibly the best scene ever has got to be the one with the dodos. Granted, the way they died was dissimilar to the truth (we were the ones who hunted them to extinction) but the slow-mo scene with Sid and the melon was absolutely hilarious: Dodos flying everywhere and Sid leaping over their heads. I was in stitches. Backgrounds are a little plain and not realistic, but hey, this is a cartoon, not a super-realistic blockbuster.As I have mentioned before, the voices are perfect for their characters, and they give a little bit of themselves to the role. The interaction between the leads is brilliant and the dialogue is hilarious.Anyone who loves a decent comedy movie, go see ""Ice Age"", (but I must admit, I personally was disappointed by the sequel; that's just my opinion.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Probably the best CGI animated movie of the past ten years,"I found Ice Age to be funny and touching, at a time where fart jokes and pathetic sight gags might have done the trick for younger audiences. This is the kind of film that the whole family can enjoy.It's not just hilarious in places, but it is also very emotional at some points. I don't want to spoil anything, but you find out later in the film why the mammoth is so moody, and by the end of the film, you will have discovered that he is indeed the strongest character of the bunch.This film may not have been a ground-breaker when it was released, but it certainly has set a standard few have been able to match since.Scrat, the Izzardesque squirrel can make you squirt cola out of your nose in laughter, with his constant misfortune, and hilarious predicament.Overall, this is a film, you'll want to watch over and over again. As we all know with CGI films, the look of the film is the first thing to age.

A definite watch for the whole family,"When watching family animation I always like to have a good laugh and appreciate the sentimental and humorous ideologies as well as the fantastic graphics and this 2002 hit is one if not my favourite animation.This story sees a sloth; a mammoth and a sabre-toothed tiger form an unlikely friendship as they travel through the icy climate looking for humans to return the stranded baby.The story is slow moving. This way we can accept the different ideas put forth and gain the persona's of the characters. Its emotional, funny, and appreciative of the family comedy drama genre.The side story about the Scrat the squirrel is great and adds a different aspect to the animation genre. It's a little story about one squirrel and his nut and the physical humour is great.Having different animals the audience can gain an insight into different views, opinions on life. It's an unlikely combination and that's what makes the whole film exciting, because we don't know how they're going to deal with each other.The film is very humorous, it prides itself on physical humour although it does have some great speech humour between characters. Having humour was great but a real reason why I loved this film is because it is emotionally driven as well. The film sells ideologies of loyalty, friendship, families and survival making it a real aspect of real life. It preaches through the likable characters and therefore younger children will appreciate the ideas and realise how important they are in real life, because they will admire the characters and want to understand about life. Having humour combined with emotion allows audiences to accept the characters who are portrayed in a 'real' light.My favourite scene involved the three animals trying to rescue a watermelon from a group of dodos who are tripping over themselves, literally. It is hilarious and younger audiences as well as an older one can appreciate the hilarity behind the great physical humour.The CGI used is simply outstanding. It is used very effectively to gain the aspects of the characters. The funny expressions of the squirrel, the stupidity of the sloth, the greatness of the mammoth and he scenery is also outstanding, especially in the ice cavern towards the end.It's a different animation to what you normally see. Because of the high amount of loyalty emotional situations it is very different to your other animation films such as 'Toy Story 2' which should have been emotional but was comedy driven, and therefore adds something different.I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's a great film to watch with the family. You will laugh and you will cry when watching 'Ice Age' an enjoyable comedy/drama with a great energetic storyline",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

It is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring.  Also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting.  Like I said, it is a pretty good movie, but I would rate ""Toy Story 2"" or ""Shrek"" higher. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Scrat steals the show. Everything else is just fine.,"My Take: Nowhere near SHREK on the level of craftsmanship, but amusing and energetic enough.ICE AGE may not be a much for SHREK nor TOY STORY 2, but with fine characters, an appealing (of somewhat familiar) story and terrific animation (fur has never been this accurate), ICE AGE earns its place in the animation milestone. A trio of Pleistocene critters including Manny the moody Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), a talkative sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) and a shady sabertooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) come together when they come across a baby Neanderthal whom they plan to bring back to his tribe. While on the other hand, Diego's pack of hungry sabers, led by its vengeful leader (Goran Visnjic), look on the little human as a snack (while also looking at the mammoth as a little bonus).There's really not much of a story, partly being the main plot itself has already been done on MONSTER'S INC., released almost the same time as this film. Basically, it's just an environment-hopping adventure moving from one place to another, encountering critter (a pair of grumpy rhinos) to critter (a flock of dimwitted dodos who plan the biggest hibernation of their lives, with a stock of only three melons). The animation is fairly well, with the computerized fur almost nearing its perfection. The comedy is surprisingly sharp, with great help from the always reliable Ray Romano on the helm. ICE AGE is yet to be on the level of SHREK or other competitions, but it's a fine start for (hopefully) great things to come.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
best animation ever,"hi everyone ,i'm actually from romania(my English sucks that's the point of me mentioning where i'm from) so i hope i'll get this right.First i want too say that this is the best animation movie i have ever seen,can't wait until spring to see the second one .In my opinion the efforts for the making of this movie have been greater as for any other animation movie ,i can't seem to find any weak points ,everything is exactly how it should be ,has a simple story but it is not only the story that makes it so great it's mainly the characters,these are by far the most beautifully realized characters i have seen(i mean just freeze a frame and take a look at the squirell or at sid ,i don't know who made them but they must be great people),the voices are also incredible,the music and a lot of other good ideas in the movie it's just that this comment is getting too long anyway my guess is that 99 from 100 people will enjoy this movie no matter if child or adult.Thanks and i mention that this is my first comment on a movie so i'm sorry if this isn't a well made one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Ice Age review,"Ice Age is a great film, I have watched it for three times. It is an interesting and funny movie too! I think it is the best animation the world has ever had before.In the movie, the baby learned to walk and eat. She became friend of Diego- a tiger.This was really educative. I love the Dodo birds most, they protected their watermelons with their life. In the end, Diego changed his mind of saving the baby from other tigers instead of eating her. That showed justice, Diego was noble. Mannfred the Mammoth had saved Diego's life. That was the main factor that changed Diego's mind. They argued at the first but became good friends at the end.Ice Age is really too short, and I wished it would be longer. But the content is good.That's all I want to say. Hope everyone like this movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"The Ice Age has prompted many animals to head south. Except for Sid and Manny, who decide to head North, finding them self on a mission.","Even though a PG rating and cartoon characters, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought that it included real life environmental facts as well as an insight to what that time period was like, as well as a fun and lighthearted plot. I felt as though the animal's mission would be a great lesson for kids..even adult kids too! The animal's bonds, determination, and caring all are perfect teaching tools for young kids as well. The images in the movie were interesting, well thought out, and perfectly crafted for the audience at hand.

Ice Age: A Cool Adventure for the Whole Family,"""Ice Age"" is a visually stunning and entertaining animated film that tells the story of a rag-tag group of animals trying to survive during the Ice Age. First and foremost, the animation in this film is top-notch and truly brings the characters to life. The voice acting is also excellent, with Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary all delivering strong performances as the lead characters. The film's story is engaging and well-paced, following the group as they embark on a journey to return a human baby to its tribe. Along the way, they encounter a variety of obstacles and challenges that keep the audience on the edge of their seats.The film also has a good dose of humor, which is well-timed and adds a lightheartedness to the story. Additionally, the film deals with themes of friendship and loyalty, which adds a deeper layer of emotion to the film. Overall, ""Ice Age"" is a well-crafted and enjoyable animated film that can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages. It's a great choice for a family movie night or for anyone looking for a fun, lighthearted film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A dish served icy cold can be better than a dish served warm.,"I just finished watching this movie on the Net and I have to say that this was a very entertaining and heart warming animated movie that will please adults just as much as kids.The characters are stupendous, the animation is great, the plot is convincing, and the overall movie is wonderful.Just wonderful.The movie itself became such a hit that it managed to spawn 2 sequels, the 2nd movie I haven't seen but the 3rd I have seen and enjoyed very much.Out of all of the characters in the movie, my favorite one would probably have to be Scrat.In case you don't know, Scrat is a squirrel who will do anything in order to get his hands on an acorn.Seeing him trying to get an acorn on-screen just makes you want him to be the main character of the whole movie.Nonetheless, ""Ice Age"" is a great film for all ages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Appealing characters, good humor, creative story","A well designed yet wildly playful romp which is fun, silly, touching, clever, and creative all while telling a very sincere story. Of the many animated talking animal movies, this is one of the best.The characters are immediately likable. The film introduces the principals in a series of actions that demonstrate some favorable personality traits while revealing they have weakness too. As the story progresses, we get to know these creatures through their interaction as they slowly learn to trust and even like one another.The construct of the movie is a quest. A wooly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth join forces to return a baby human to its people, after a tragedy the child survives. The mammoth was my favorite, a heroic and gentle giant who made the silent pact with a dying human to save the child. He has nothing to gain personally for doing this; it's just the right thing to do. The sloth makes a great comic relief sidekick, and the tiger Diego is a deceptively complex character that is developed well. The running gag with the little guy trying to capture a nut that is seemingly always just out of his reach works well and seems to fit anywhere they choose to put it.The characters grow in ways which are surprising during the first viewing, but the logic in how they change ultimately makes sense. The film tells a wonderful story, and some moments, like the petroglyph imagery are quite touching. The expressions on the faces of the characters are magnificently done; no words need be said. The wild ice slide ride (with its ingenious sight gags) are the other side of the picture, just some entertaining silliness for its own sake.The movie involves you with the characters, as you join them on their journey. It's a sweet story with a lot of heart, and accomplishes this with both good natured humor and a moving outcome. Good for adults and kids alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

The last scene was also cool. The baby was very cute and that is also favorite character. When Sid says to Manny that I can take care of the baby, that scene was also funny.

Lame,"This is the worst feature length cartoon I have ever seen. I usually enjoy the genre as much as any kid. The problem is the lack of originality. Ice Age feels like those old Matlock episodes they would create by cutting together from previous ones. It is like they cranked previous cartoons through some AI morpher to create pseudo-new content.Manfred the Mammoth has a leading role. He has not a funny bone in his body. He is depressed, rude, a bully and self-centred, hardly a likable hero. He would be a fine side character, but he wastes huge amounts of screen time. He is BORING! For the genre to work, it really needs danceable, singable music.John Leguizamo, as Sid, was up to Lion King quality, but that was not enough to carry the show.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

3 Animals and a Baby,"""Ice Age"" came out still in the early days of CGI animated features. The ""Best Animated Picture Oscar"" had only just been introduced the previous year. It wasn't made by Pixar or Dreamworks it was made by Blue Sky Studios. Blue Sky was basically what was left over from Fox animation after the bombing of ""Titan A. E."". In fact, there was a time where Don Bluth was attached to direct this film. The director of ""Land Before Time"", directing another prehistoric animal adventure, sounds like a good fit to me. But alas, it was not meant to be.The actual story in the movie ""Ice Age"" is about as cookie cutter as they come. A grumpy no-nonsense loner is paired up with a fast-talking comedic relief sidekick. The two of them team up to return a baby to its family. Added to the mix is a tiger named Diego, voiced by Denis Leary, who wants the baby for purposes of revenge. He teams up with the duo in plans to betray them later. Hijinx ensue.The marketing at the time focused most of its time on the squirrel, Scratch. Enough so, that when I went to watch the film, I was surprised what little impact he makes in the story. He could be completely cut out of the movie and nothing would be missed. He is just a source for slapstick humor when the movie needs to wake the kids up. It is a sad state of things when I say that the filler is the selling point of the movie. The movie also spends 5 minutes on the animals going to change the baby's diaper. Despite being voiced by the lady who voices every cartoon baby, Tara Strong, the baby doesn't have much of a personality. It is just there as the plot device. To be cute at sometimes to warm up a character's heart, and to cry when the story needs a detour.It is a kids' road trip buddy comedy with no real surprises. It follows all the plot points you'd expect and tells most of the jokes you'd expect. Not awful, but nothing worth going out of your way to see. ""Ice Age"" gets a cold reception from me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

Very Cool Animated Movie!,"This has to be the best animated film I have ever seen. First, I loved Scrat (the sabre toothed squirrel) for his nut problems and Sid, for his laugh out loud jokes. This film has a clever and well written script and some famous voices (Ray Romano, Dennis Leary, Jack Black). I loved the slide scene, where they all fell down the hole. The main plot outline is that 2 weird companions, Sid (a sloth) and Manny(a mammoth) find this baby belonging to a group of humans, in which they try to return the baby. They then meet up with Diego, a cool sabre toothed tiger who wants the baby for himself. But as the film goes on, he becomes good and wants to return the baby himself. But as the great journey unfolds, the team will have to face lava pits, a group of mental dodo's and a little sabre toothed squirrel named Scrat.

It could be much better.,"This film is set in the Ice Age and tells how a mammoth, a sloth, and a sabertooth tiger join forces to return a human child to his father. Directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has voice actors like Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Animated Film.This is not a film I consider remarkable, but it's funny enough to not consider for lost the time I spent watching it. Although not easy to understand for young children, the film is appealing enough. Playing with the animals existing at the time, the script creates a situation, implausible but funny, involving a human child and a group of animals, predators and preys, united in a joint effort.The characters are not the most interesting but Diego, a tiger torn between loyalty to his brothers and friendship with fellow travelers, and Manfred, a mammoth mourning his dead family, deserve some positive highlight, giving the film a touch of maturity. The more negative note goes to Sid, an unpleasantly greenish sloth, which associates a grotesque aspect to an endless collection of stupid moments. Unfortunately, this creature is the largest attempt to make this movie something funny. The intelligent humor of other characters works better, making more digestible a film that, without it, it would be quite silly. The squirrel can also be very funny.The work of animators is regular and fulfills its role. The voice actors did a good job, particularly Leguizamo, who gave voice to Sid.

A great icy fresh start to a series milked dry,"Ice Age is a franchise that needs no introduction, aside from the fact that it has been going and going and going (and it´s still going). But today, let us not reflect on the present day, and instead, remember the past, with the series´first installment, made by the now-defunct Blue Sky Studios as their first foray in cinematic productions. And, even though it might have been their first, it is certainly also one of their best.Its strongest point is its main trio, who do a great job at bouncing off each other and are individually well-developed through their own character arcs, all of which are profoundly told with no dialogue. This great cast only adds to this film´s engaging, unique and rather wholesome plot about family and frienship, while tackling rather deep topics such as migration and hunting for survival. What also helps the narrative is the animation, which despite its wrinkles, is very detailed and animated in an interesting way, with different prehistoric animals having distinct character animations that correspond to their natural instincts. Lastly, and quite obviously, this film´s memorable Scrat scenes, which are hilarious and serve as a quick but fun little break from the main story.If there is one minor flaw with the film is that Manny and Sid meet each other way too early in the movie. While this is a problem with other animated kids films that were out at the time, like Shrek, but it´s still kind of a con, and I would rather have the movie take a little more time in the beginning to flesh the characters out a little more.But overall, while the Ice Age franchise nowadays may be seen as plague to the industry, churning out more and more movies probably till the sun explodes or gravity stops working, with each one having a more nonsensical story than the next, it´s first attempt remains one of the strongest animated productions of the century currently even today, despite its age (not pun intended). I personally reccomend it for anyone of all ages, wether you are a kid or an adult.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great Fun,"""Ice Age"" is a lot of fun! It's laugh out loud funny, even though it's not ""Shrek"" or ""Chicken Run"" but it's definitely entertaining for adults, including shots like a passing reference to ""The X Files"" movie and showing why the dodo became extinct.Sure it sticks with Disney-established cartoon clichés of orphaned kid, wisecracking side-animal and nature that's scary and dangerous.But the odd trio of stand-up comics with thick New York accents of Ray Romano, Denis Leary and John Leguizamo work really well off each other.I didn't recognize the voice of Goran Visnjic from ""E.R."" as the villain.I was disappointed that they didn't bother to do any original songs, just a recap of the old Rusted Roots song ""Send Me On My Way,"" though that does happen to be a favorite of mine.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Animal team rescues human cub,"A great adventure cartoon that will definitely help pass the evening in the company of friends or keep the children busy.At first it seems that this is just an entertaining spectacle, but the further the plot develops, the more you understand how important the topics are revealed by the authors. And the main one is friendship.A motley company by coincidence turns out to be ""one on one"" with a human cub and does not dare to leave that one. As a result, the animals go in search of the tribe where the baby comes from. This is an excellent plot for the disclosure of this topic.Each character is self-sufficient and has its own motivation. The mammoth is sad and believes that he already knows everything in life, the Saber-Toothed Tiger is a hunter who unwittingly fights off his pack and suffers from a difficult choice, the Sloth who does not yet know what is going on around him, but undertakes to save the child. And of course the legendary rat-bel, who fits perfectly into every moment of the cartoon, which is devoted specifically to his adventures.The drawing is very beautiful. The emotions of animals are transmitted thoroughly, it seems that they are alive.Watching a cartoon makes you think about many things. And most importantly, you begin to understand that you, like the heroes of the tape, are capable of those actions that you never thought about. After all, friendship is an important foundation that helps us in life.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"the plot treads on familiar ground, but ""Ice Age"" succeeds because of an arsenal of funny moments, charming characters, and some surprisingly strong and beautiful moments","As far as plot is concerned, there is nothing particularly spectacular about ""Ice Age"" because Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the saber-tooth are treading over the same ground that movies such as ""Shrek"" did shortly before. However, that does not disqualify it from being an enjoyable movie. By contrast, this is a very sweet, funny, and wonderfully charming little movie that I actually prefer over ""Shrek."" Yes, ""Shrek"" is a better movie, but I personally prefer ""Ice Age.""Like ""Shrek"", the movie concerns a grumpy hermit, an irritating sidekick, and an unwanted burden all joined together on a quest. Only this time, the hermit is a moody mammoth named Manny (voice by Ray Romano), the sidekick is a rejected sloth named Sid (voice by John Leguizamo) and the unwanted burden is a human child whose been separated from his clan following an attack by a pack of saber-toothed tigers. One of the tigers, a cunning feline named Diego (Denis Leary) has also joined the quest to return the child to his clan. And as they travel, there's a rat-like squirrel known only as Scrat, darting around, obsessed with protecting his acorn against everything from nosey sloths to avalanches.The reason why ""Ice Age"" holds up despite an all-too-familiar plot is because it boasts surprisingly funny jokes, well-realized characters, a decent enough story, and much to my delight, a potent level of charm. The movie is not all light-noted funny moments. There are some surprisingly moving moments in the movie, including one that succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes. And that's the primary reason why I like this movie so much. It makes me laugh, but also warms my heart. Yet it does not overplay the dramatic hand to the point where it becomes mopey or too depressing for younger children.Overall, ""Ice Age"" is a very well-realized family entertainment movie. It's not a jaw-dropping spectacle or a revolutionary film, but it is influential, very funny, charming, and it can pull at your heart strings. And that nutty little squirrel Scrat, he never fails at producing a grin.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

10/10,"First of all if you haven't seen this movie, please go watch it. I was going to give this movie a 4 star review because, I couldn't think of myself praising it that much but really looking back on it, I don't see how this doesn't deserve 5 stars. The main 3 of Ray Romano as Manny, John Leguizamo as Sid, and Denis Leary as Diego is just so classic and amazing. Manny and Diego's character arcs are very emotional (Especially Diego's) and they make up for Sid not being the most complex character by making him literally one of the funniest characters and in my opinion the funniest in animation history. The only scene I don't remember myself enjoying really was just when the mother was running away from the sabers but when she handed the baby to Manny and Sid and disappeared, that really tugged on the heart strings. Diego's character is commonly overlooked but the more I look at it, the more I just loved how Diego was moved by the pack throughout the whole journey. The scene where Manny reflects back on his life made me think about him as a character more and just made him all the more solid as the leader of the group. I may be the only one who picks up on it, but the way Sid follows Manny and Diego to the end just touches me in a way that few other movies do even though it may sound strange.

Fairly good but Expected it to be better.,"I am watching BlueSky Movies and i was pretty exited for ice age it has been my childhood for years and looking at it now i am a little bitty bit disappointed, the story is expected it's well done and well thought out i liked it but my negative take on this is the animation , it looks so poor and not all that great Yeah there's some good rendering shots but half of the movie's visuals were bland, i think the problem is on me because i am not used to animation looking that good, But overall it's likeable and somewhat watchable i didn't regret watching it but all that matters are the sequels i am looking forward for them and one good key factor is the voice cast i liked the cast a lot ! And the character design is SUPERIOR i loved it honestly ( excluding the baby lol ) but overall the characters & character design is my favorite aspect about this movie . Overall good but not as visually pleasing as the modern movies which is reasonable. :D.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Human-Washing History,"A wooly mammoth (hunted to extinction by humans), a sabertooth tiger (hunted to extinction by humans), and others try to save a human baby that will grow up and kill, eat, and be clothed by them until they're gone. They're hunted by a pack of other sabertooth tigers who are portrayed as the bad guys.I've heard of white washing and witnessed it all too many times. Where humans identifying with their skin- instead of accessible heritage that other skin tones do not have- edit historical facts to make dead people sound less horrible than they were so that said white people can pretend that said dead people weren't as bad as we all know they were.Now, just apply that to humans in general. And forever. There. Do you feel less guilty about not having a thing to do with killing all the sabertooth tigers?",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
This movie is dumb.,"Most of the ""comedy"" from this movie is based in poop jokes and characters being stupid. The animation in this movie is lazy, and the story is dumb. When I was younger and the target audience of this movie, I was bored for most of the runtime so I'm not going to make the claim that kids will like this movie. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.Side note, one time in the 4th or 5th grade a teacher showed us that clip where the character Scrat created the continents and then told us that that was how the continents were actually made. She did not then go on to tell us that that was a joke and then tell us how the continents were actually made. That clip aside, this movie is filled with bad science.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Not at all bad. Not the best, but not at all bad","Ice Age is the latest computer animated film to come down the pipe and is certainly a pleasant way to spend time staring at the big screen while transferring popcorn to your mouth.The story is simplistic (a mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger and a sloth return a lost baby to its tribe) and appeals more to younger children, lacking the multi-layered depth of Shrek and even Monsters Inc. Not that it's boring. Indeed, there is some stand-out stuff, such as the running gag with the squirrel and the priceless sequence with the dodo's. This latter is not only laugh-aloud funny, but qualitatively even seems lifted from another production altogether. As if often the case, you can tell some scenes had more care, attention, and most likely money, lavished on them than others.In technical terms, Ice Age breaks no new ground and the script and characterisation, as well as the animation, also lag behind Shrek and Monsters Inc. The fact of the matter is, these two films, have now raised the bar so high they are very hard acts to follow.The children who were at the press screening I attended certainly sat attentively (but they are German and their teacher had threatened them with massive death if they so much as ... ) and did laugh a few times.Ice Age certainly qualifies as a good family film and if it gets the kids' minds off the latest Harry Potter merchandise then that's a relief to parents everywhere.Where the film suffers, though, is the appalling voice performance of Ray Romano as Manfred the Mammoth. He sounds like John Ratzenberger (Cliff the mailman from Cheers), only drugged, depressed and telephoning in his lines. Literally!Romano might be a name in the US, but anywhere else? So what if he stars in Everybody Loves Raymond? (And what kind of suspicious title is that? ""Whaddya mean you don't love Raymond?! What's wrong wit yer?! You some kinda commie?!""). To most of the world he's Ray Who and it's I've Never Heard of Raymond, Haven't Seen The Show and Care Even Less.OK, so the film will be dubbed, or at least subtitled, outside english-speaking territories, but his performance is so bad as to seriously drag it down. It's thanks to John Leguizamo, as Sid the Sloth, that the energy isn't so sucked out of you that you dissolve in your seat and slide, a shapeless blob, to the floor. I've thought long and hard about when I last heard such a miscast cartoon voice and still haven't come up with one.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
If you weren't smart enough to plan ahead? then doom on you!!!,"ICE AGE is a compelling animation which uses simple imagery, dark humour and quirky characters to pull a masterpiece together.This is a movie for all ages:the belief that lesser beings should be helped or protected,that those in danger should be looked out for(cos that's what we do in a herd)that silly situations should be laughed off(dinner on a shelf), that you can redeem yourself by not lowering your standards (I don't eat junk food).The thrill of it all is that every situation is humourous(if darkly so), the morality stands out all through; never be surety for a stranger as you'll pay for it.  Which is what Manny & Sid found out with Diego though he developed a change of heart after Manny risked his life to save him.My nieces and nephew loved this picture and laughed all through it as did four other adults who accompanied them to see it(We laughed even louder and harder than they did).ICE AGE will definitely leave you with internal global warming(hint).10/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Kind of predictable, but pretty good","FIRST THE BAD NEWS:Unfortunately, I could not let go of the unreality of a tiger, a mammoth, and a sloth talking to each other and taking care of a human baby.  I kept being bothered by the fact that sloths are known to be very slow, but this one moved very quickly.  I couldn't accept that two different species of rhinoceros would be hanging out together.  I just couldn't let myself get into it as a cartoon.  Maybe that was because the animation was so good. If the animation had looked more fake, maybe I could have gotten into the improbable plot betterI was offended that the Dodo's were shown as going extinct because of stupidity, rather than because of human predation, which was the reality of the thing -- though I must say that their idiotic group think was an excellent social commentary.  I was also offended that the Native Americans were shown as having extremely low foreheads, sort of like the tiger, implying that they did not have any brains.NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS:It wasn't too scary or violent and had a nice heartwarming story, so it would be o.k. for most kids, though I still don't think that it's a good idea to take pre-schoolers to movies that have any violence or any suspense, and this does have some.It is nice that people are starting to pay attention to the age of the giant mammals, because it has been kind of ignored in favor of the dinosaurs.The facial expressions and acting were just great.  The characters were extraordinarily well-developed for a cartoon.The squirrel was really funny.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not what I had hoped for.,"I'm afraid he may have gone overboard with this movie, in a backlash against Episode 1's reception. I've been following it on the unofficial news site and in the theatres. Too much digital, too much Lightsabring and its all anachronistic to the classic trilogy, it could still pack some good thrills though.Now about Ice Age. It doesn't belabour the hip humour like Monsters, Inc., that style I believe is wearing thin already, and after less than a decade. This movie recycles everything basically, Jar Jar included. It still packs some big laughs though I must admit. But other ones are skipped over so quick that there is no time to appreciate them, eg. ""there'll be plenty of time to play extinction later kids."" The story also at points is a bit borderline for it's target audience and after less than a month the movie as a whole starts to rot in the memory. The little dude with the wallnut is the most memorable thing but he gets such a harsh beating from the Coyote/Road Runner gags that you feel too sorry for him, it's extremely violent.So basically all that's left is the glory of the landscapes and vistas, which are of high note. At the time you forgive the movie for that, but there is not enough otherwise to recommend a second cinema viewing, and the cinema is the only place you'll really appreciate that redeeming factor. Besides that is pretty much all we get nowadays is astounding visuals. 'films', are fast retreating the onslaught of 'movies', and even movies are fleeing the advance of 'blockbusters'. If there is one thing cinema is not short of its technological breakthroughs.The very conclusion, though irrelivant to the core story is both unexpected and refreshingly novel. But this movie is not much chop, and easily forgettable. Watch Shrek or Toy Story 2 instead, and Disney is unlikely to put anything of that grade out again. You will all have noticed the amount cheap Disney '2' movies coming out, Cinerella, Peter Pan etc.6.5/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Well done. Not great, but worth it if you like cartoons.","It's not quite up there with the likes of great animated films such as Toy Story and The Iron Giant, but it will definitely keep you entertained.  The action and slapstick bits feel much like watching a classic Looney Tune short.  The dialogue has enough witticisms to get it by, but thankfully knows when to stop and let the physical humor garner the laughs.  The movie does have a serious side involving returning a human baby to its tribe.  It serves well enough to provide a plot, but couldn't have been pushed much further without making this a tedious movie.  The voice talent is overall very good.  John Lequizamo's Sid the Sloth in particular fits the character quite well.  I didn't mind Ray Romano's monotonic rendering of the mammoth, and his tone makes sense when you learn the character's background, but I can see where some people wouldn't like it.  Visually, the animal characters are all rendered in a unique and distinctly caricatured style.  The humans don't look as good given their style, but since the story doesn't focus on them it wasn't too distracting.  The scenery is sometimes beautiful, given that there's only so much you can do with a movie set mostly in the snow.In short, when it tries to be funny, it generally succeeds.  The plot is indeed an amalgam of Things We've Seen Before, but I was willing to forgive that to get to enjoy the laughs.  And the squirrel IS as funny as everyone has said. An unflappable rodent committed to his goal, I too hope we see more of his plight in the future.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

And eventually the big guy develops a soft spot for the little guy and looks out for him as they reluctantly go on a quest together!

Their clothing appeared to be made out of the same stuff as their skin was made out of, which appeared to be the same stuff as Goodyear tires are made out of.In the movie, the snuffleupagus complained a lot. ""You're a disgrace to evolution,"" he told the sloth, and I had to agree. I agreed with most of his complaints, in fact. It was nice that the main character in the movie disliked it as much as I did.Like Dinosaur, the movie was advertised by a really wonderful teaser, which turned out to be the first scene in the movie.

One of the Best,"This is quite possibly the best animated movie I've seen in years. I was very eager to see this movie in the theaters but was afraid i'd have to settle for the video. Luckily, I managed to grab the chance and saw it in theaters. It was amazing! The characters looked purposely cartoony, having Sid's eyes placed on the top and to the side of his head, and having the humans look a tad deformed.

A WORTHY COMPUTER ANIMATION FILM,"ICE AGE is a very good computer animation film even if somewhat derivative of other recent titles ( SHREK, DINOSAUR etc. ) in this particular genre. The main characters are quite good, all the way from the aloof Manny the Mammoth to the flippant Sid the Sloth. There is certainly a feeling a ""deja vu"" in the proceedings ( ala DINOSAUR and MONSTERS, INC. ), yet the situations are settings are unique enough to keep the story fresh and entertaining. Some of the strong points are Diego's character development from an antagonist to hero, and the lovable Scrat whose presence charms even if adding nothing to the storyline ( seemingly inspired by toon-master Tex Avery ).Of course, the human characters in ICE AGE are as minimal as to be expected; even the baby ( though cute ) is a minor presence though constantly seen throughout. One has to wonder why these prehistoric mammals are going through all this bother to bring this infant back to its clan. Another weakness is with Manny himself; there are practically no insights into the basic nature of this massive elephant except for a brief incident where he remembers his family being killed by hunters ( giving more reason to wonder about his involvement here ). Sid is better defined but extremely similar to the goofy lemur in DINOSAUR ( with a ""hot tub"" scene where he is also trying to wow the ladies much like the Disney pic ).Some other notable elements are the other saber-toothed cats of Diego's pride, either wholly evil or comical like THE LION KING, and the hilarious suicidal Dodos which didn't die out until comparatively recent times. In spite of the aforementioned familiarity of the material, there is enough originality and cleverness to more than compensate for this recycling of story elements to make it a winner. Pleasing to the eyes, ICE AGE doesn't redefine the genre but is just as worthy as any of the others ( and in some regards even better ).On a 1-10 scale, a solid 8",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Stunning computer animation with classic cartoon slapstick...,"Going to see this movie, I was concerned that the plot would be aimed at a younger target audience.  I was delighted to find that this movie offered not only something for the kids, but a lot of humor and sentiment that adults can and will appreciate.  I was thoroughly entertained by this movie!The computer animation was stunning (the humans were a little blocky!), the dialogue was snappy and crisp, and the physical comedy was reminiscent of the old road runner/wile e. coyote cartoons of my youth.  It's difficult to find quality slapstick humor on television these days, as kids are desensitized to violence, and need more sophistication in their cartoons than simple physical comedy. Ice Age will please many who long for the golden age of cartoons with its simple physical gags and more complex humorous dialogue aimed at both adults and kids.  On top of all this is a heart-warming tale with a moral of seeing past what's on the outside, and loyalty among friends.  I was glad by the fact that the theater was filled with families, and I heard equal spurts of laughter from parents, and their kids. This movie is a must see!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Formulaic story, but great character design, and FUN","Surprisingly, in the past year and a half, all of the major animated films have been at least better than average (Atlantis excepted).

With great character design like the sabretoothed squirrel Scrat, a touching but not overdramatic story, and humorous sequences, Ice Age succeeds. 7.5/10By the way, referring to the GENIUS who pointed out that Ice Age rips off Monsters Inc. and Jimmy Neutron, all three were in production at the same time.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

A MUST SEE,I have always been a fan of cartoon animation but this is my favourite besides Shrek. It's excellent for the kids on a friday night at the movies.

The mammoth was slow and drawl was excellently voiced by Ray Romano from (Everybody Loves Raymond). The sloth voiced by (JOhn Leguismono) matched his slow and lazy  personality.

"Wonderful visuals ... and not bad in other respects, either","I went to see this because I wanted a real cartoon - you know, the kind animated by pencil rather than keyboard - and it was the only plausible substitute available.  It's a far better substitute than I'd dared hope.The title says it all: it's an ice age.  We watch animals migrate away from the ice.  That's the point to the film; there is no other.  There IS, admittedly, also a story, and don't believe anyone who tells you it's not a good story; if there's a problem with it, it lies not with its inherent quality but with the fact that it feels at times like an intrusion - something which takes valuable time away from the character-based vignettes about odd-looking mammals travelling through the frozen landscape.  But not so much time that we have any grounds for being impatient.All the animals (the humans being a trivial exception) are animated well, simply but convincingly.  Essentially they're the three-dimensional counterparts of the Coyote and the Roadrunner, the various beasts developed by Jack Hannah in the inspired cartoons he directed at Disney ... and more recent animals, too, like the raccoon in ""Pocahontas"" or the enchanted llama in ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The computer animators have really learnt something from their pen-and-paper colleagues.  About time!  Or maybe this film was animated by people who USED to animate by hand but left what they took to be a sinking ship, in which case the gain comes at too high a price.""Ice Age"" has the best art direction of the ten computer animated film ever released, better even than ""Monsters, Inc.""  At first I though it was just the ice, that the mere fact that everything HAD to be the colour of snow made it virtually impossible to duplicate the ugly, garish, cluttered mishmash of ""Shrek"" (or ""Jimmy Neutron"", a film I'm admittedly judging from the trailer - but doesn't it look like the ghastliest things ever made?). But this is uncharitable.  Many scenes take place on land on which snow has not yet fallen, and the art direction is STILL superb; everything MATCHES the snow, stylised in the same artful way.  And the creatures match the background.  It's not just that they're ""drawn"" similarly; the main point is that they all look and move and are framed relative to other things as though they belong here.  Only three computer-animated features have art direction that's even worth mentioning (except perhaps to complain about): ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."" and now ""Ice Age"".  Each is visually better than the last.  ""Ice Age"" may not be as inspired overall - it's certainly not as deep - as the two Pixar movies, and perhaps some of the jokes in the first half fall flat.  ""Monsters, Inc."" was a masterpiece; so (to take a recent example of something traditionally animated) was ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  ""Ice Age"" isn't.  But it's still the real deal; a good, sincere movie with something real to offer.  It's not a ""substitute"" anything.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"

"Cute, but not very original.","While this might be a cute film and ""family-friendly"", it is in no way an original piece and suffers from the ""Disney syndrome"" of blatantly ripping off from other works.

Sid is nothing more than clumsy mammalian version of Wallace from the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts. While these carbon copies got on my nerves a bit, I will have to admit that the ""Bambi vs. Godzilla"" reference got a chuckle out of me.Despite these flaws, the movie was fair, the animation was pretty good, and the best part was constant appearance of Scant the squirrel.  The story was a bit weak, though.  I would have liked to have seen a better plot.

80 minutes of pure fun,"Having seen ""Titan AE"" (and been bitterly disappointed), I thought that Pixar would hold the copyright on entertaining animation that appeals both to children and adults (with gems like ""Toy Story"", ""Toy Story 2"" and ""A Bug's Life""), but then I saw ""Monsters, Inc"" and it seemed Pixar had fallen flat on its face. As a result, I missed ""Ice Age"" on its theatrical release, but thankfully I bit the bullet and bought it on DVD and I can now say that Fox have come back with a vengeance: ""Ice Age"" is a scream!Where ""Monsters, Inc"" was uncharacteristically flat and irritating (especially the character 'Mike', voiced by Billy Crystal), ""Ice Age"" hits you with a knockout opening (featuring a character not unlike Wile E Coyote (Skrat) who never quite manages to bury his acorn) and goes on from there until the closing credits.The main protagonists of the movie: Manfred the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano who sounds not unlike John Ratzenberger, who voiced 'Hamm' from ""Toy Story"" and 'P T Flea' from ""A Bug's Life""); Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo, the actor who played 'Clown' in ""Spawn"") and Diego the Sabre-Toothed Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary who did Francis the Ladybug in ""A Bug's Life""), all have amazing characteristics and interact perfectly. The action sequences are spectacular (the opening and the ice slide sequences especially) and the moments of pathos are executed well. Even the cutesy child is not as remotely annoying as the cutesy child in ""Monsters, Inc"".On the DVD, you even get Skrat appearing in a four plus minute adventure ""Gone Nutty"", which is an homage to Tex Avery.

A blast for folks of all ages,"My expectations for ICE AGE were not great; after the pretty uninspired trailer, I rented the movie primarily for the kids. But then I always say that, and much like TOY STORY before it, ICE AGE is much more than a film that's just for the nippers. Indeed, it's a charming, heartfelt tale that will appeal to people of all ages. The animation is outstanding, and ICE AGE is yet another example of the shift within the genre away from the painstakingly hand drawn, classic Disney cartoons of old to the modern, computer-assisted animated features of today. (Although the work in animated flicks such as ICE AGE is no less impressive. Check out the DVD behind the scenes features for an eye-opening look at the  ahem  mammoth' task involved in bringing such a project to life.)Set 20,000 years previously in the midst of an Ice Age, the film opens with a look at the most amusing character in the movie: Scrat, the sabre-toothed squirrel. Poor Scrat wants nothing more than to bury an acorn, his food source for the winter, and throughout the film we're treated to his exploits as he attempts to do this supposedly simple task. Yet, no matter what he does, no matter how hard he tries, he is continuously foiled by the elements, his fellow beasts, or just plain bad luck. Scrat is a hilarious creation and his scenes are the highlight of the entire movie. (Scrat, incidentally, is voiced'  a series of screeches, grunts and screams  by ICE AGE director Chris Wedge. Make sure you check out the extra Scrat animated short on the DVD  it's the best of the lot.)The true story of ICE AGE centres on the tale of three unlikely friends: Manfred (Ray Romano), an enormous mammoth who decides that, unlike the rest of the world, he'll migrate North this winter; Sid, a lazy, good-for-nothing sloth who talks a mile-a-minute (voiced by the hilarious John Leguizamo); and Diego (Dennis Leary), a fierce, sly sabre-toothed tiger who doesn't tolerate fools  or anyone else  lightly. The trio are brought together by the discovery of a human baby. Sid decides that the right thing to do is to return the child to its father, and talks the reluctant Manfred around. Diego's motives are more sinister  his secret mission is to return the child to his pack.The story progresses as the three battle increasingly harsh conditions, including snowstorms, wind, volcanoes, a theme park inspired ice-ride through a cave, and more, as they move on towards their destiny. Along the way they become closer to each other and to the man-child, particularly the confused Diego, who begins to question his motives. Manfred, meantime, battles with inner demons about his own feelings towards mankind, while the upbeat Sid blunders in regardless of the dangers around him.The principle cast of ICE AGE provide a significant amount of character in their respective parts. In particular, John Leguizamo's Sid is very funny indeed, and the extra on the DVD that shows us how Leguizamo came up with Sid's very unique, toothsome voice, is worth the price of the DVD alone. In his other work, Ray Romano, a massive star in the U.S. thanks to his EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND series, but a virtual unknown outside of the States, isn't as funny as he thinks he is. But his nasally, thick voice is perfectly suited to the gruff, no B.S. Manfred. Denis Leary is always good value, and his sixty-a-day croak of a voice is ideal for the sly Diego. As stated above, however, it is the priceless Scrat that steals ICE AGE.Beautiful animation is almost a prerequisite nowadays; if a movie cannot deliver in that sense, it's almost a failure irrespective of the quality of the story (i.e., POKEMON). ICE AGE has some of the best quality work you will see. The team behind the animation talked of their desire to replicate the work of Chuck Jones ROADRUNNER style of animation  that being, simply, sketched backgrounds with the focus on detail applied completely to the characters in the foreground. Whilst the background detail is a million miles above that seen in Jones' classic work, the ICE AGE team have succeeded in making the foreground so visually appealing that you'll hardly notice anything else. But you should, as some of the background scenery, particularly in long shot POV, is breathtaking.But it's the animation on the main characters that you've paid to see and it doesn't disappoint  little things, like the attention paid to Manfred's eyes, the lone source of all of his emotion and feelings, are handled with the utmost in care and detail. Likewise Diego's smooth, graceful yet twitchy mannerisms beat that seen of the big cats in Disney's THE LION KING. Sid, of the three main leads, steals the show with his endless repartee and exaggerated goofiness, and that's mostly thanks to Leguizamo, who clearly had a blast with the character.The movie is somewhat predictable, but don't let that spoil your enjoyment. It's enormous fun. As I said, I came in expecting little cause of the poor trailer but had a blast. Which is a very good sign.To conclude, this falls just short of the overall quality of TOY STORY or TOY STORY 2 but is miles better than any Disney film post THE LION KING. If you have kids, this is highly recommended, but also give it a look yourself. And the DVD is a must buy if you have already seen and enjoyed the film.Rating: **** (out of five)DVD Review: So much! Hours and hours of extra animated clips, deleted scenes, behind the scenes, commentaries, etc. So much that you'd do well to buy this DVD if you had an interest in getting into computer animation  it's that thorough, and they provide that much background detail. Highly recommended.DVD: ***** (out of five)",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
"Terrible, idiotic mess is my vote for worse film, so far, of 2002.","Crude animation, inferior story, and few laughs makes this Monster, Inc./Shrek wannabe a painful example of how computer animation can not only raise the level of such story-telling, but lower it to new depths as well. Compare this film with early Warner Brothers such as Road Runner and Bugs Bunny (it's inspiration of sorts), or heck even new Speilberg Warner Brothers, and it falls way short despite sixty some years of progress.  Even a lesser Disney effort like Return to Neverland has more to offer in it's first two minutes than all of Ice Age.  All artistic merit has been abandoned in lieu of juvenile computer graphics and a tired story line. Just because the producers knew their intended audience would not demand more than a typical computer game does not mean they had to dive so low in the intelligence pool.  Don't expect kids seeing this film today sharing it with their own kids twenty years from now.  More likely they will be denying they even saw it.  My vote for the worse film, so far, of 2002.  Even if you consider Pokemon high art and Harry Potter classic literature this film doesn't even rise up to those darken depths for entertainment value.  If you're an idiot and want to feel smart go see Ice Age, you might feel smart, but you would still be an idiot, and you surely won't be entertained, just stuck in the Ice Age.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
A movie for kids and grown ups!,"Well I must stress that I didn't really laugh much over the course of Ice Age, maybe it's because I'm too serious, but I didn't really find anything funny in this movie, perhaps I just smiled a few times. Well this is a great and different animated movie. It was also original, since it shows the beautiful landscapes of a cold winter. I love snow, so I think that's why I liked it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the story is somewhat interesting. It's a nice movie for kids and also for grown ups. I saw many adults and kids in the theater and they all seemed to have enjoyed the whole film. I don't really think I wasted my money seeing this. On the contrary, it was well done and quite entertaining. It leaves a good message for all people: help your friends whenever they need it. This movie shows how other children's movies should be. There are so many rude and inappropriate movies for children and kids really need a good influence for their lives, but I'm certainly glad it's not like that. Overall it's an entertaining movie that everybody will enjoy. 7/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not quite an empty wasteland.,"I was really looking forward to this pic, and I was slightly disappointed. What should have been an animated short entirely about the rat-thing and his acorn became an uninspired piece of schmaltz.While Ice Age has a funny beginning, the middle is quite dull and the ending is deliberately and unsubtley emotionally manipulative.Other than Sid the sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) I found the character design to be unimaginative. The backgrounds, while very nicely coloured, were drab and uninteresting. I know this is supposed to be set during a pending glacial period, but a little background detail would be nice!Not bad, but uninspired. A video rental.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
good family movie!,"i have seen ice age and i think it is a very good family movie. it's good for all ages. it was very funny and even had some action in it. i went to go see it with friends and the funny parts were the best! but then when the serious parts with the human baby came on, it got kinda boring and we resorted to throwing popcorn at people. but when the weasel with the acorn came back on, we died laughing! i would definately see it again!!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Very cute! Perfect for the kids.,"I rented 'Ice Age' for my neice and newphews while I was babysitting one afternoon. I saw a preview for this film in a theater, and truth be told, I wasn't too keen on seeing it. Still, I'd read some great reviews and I wanted a good movie for the kids. I am glad I took a chance on it.Ray Romano heads an all-star cast of voices as Manfred the mammoth. The story takes place during the ice age, where primitive man and ancient animals are going head to head. Denis Leary provides the voice of Diago, a cunning saber-tooth tiger who kidnaps a human baby as revenge against the humans for destroying some of his pack. Manfred and his dorky sidekick, Sid (John Leguizamo) get ahold of the baby, and vow to return it. Diago has plans to thwart their good intentions. Along way, Manfred, Sid, and Diago learn about the goodness that lies in every heart, but they also learn some important lessons about themselves.I love this movie for three reasons: A) The pathetic squirrel chasing after the nut, almost a totally unrelated tangent to the story, is hilarious. B) Unlike a great many animated films, there are no disgusting bad guys to beat up. The premise of the story is simple and not too complex for little kids to figure out. There is also a very positive message that you don't have to dig around to find. C) The cast of voices, which also includes Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer, Diedrich Bader, and Jane Krakowski, are wonderful.I am not sure that all adults would like this movie, but my neice and nephews LOVED it. I really liked it too, and I would recommend it to any parents who want a nice, refreshing break from hard-core violence and glittery, overactive animation.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great new style,"Ice age is a really entertaining movie, a lot of laughs for the kids and their parents and really nice graphics. A completely new style was used. A smart move you don't want your work to end being crushed by pixar films or the Box-buster Shrek, which has great graphics but a bit of the same we have had already seen with Toy Story, and a lot of other computer animated movies. Instead of trying to make the characters and backgrounds as realistic as possible they tried to give the movie more the style of a classic cartoon, at which they succeeded, so don't expect to see Manfred the Mammoth's hair move in the wind like donkey's does in Shrek. But you can expect a movie that has a great use of colours and will give you the feeling of the old cartoons from fifteen years ago.The children will love all the characters (and so will adults), especially Sid the Sloth. I have never seen a cartoon character so adorable as Sid.The story is a little too sweet and predictable but the good humour makes up for that. The many jokes the movie is rich are great, as well for the little ones as for the more mature people under us, the more adult humour is brought to us very subtle and some of the jokes will never be understood by children or the less intelligent living among us. Especially the side story of the acorn-adventures of the little saber-tooth squirrel Scrat is a lot of fun and makes sure that even in the more serious parts of the movie there is humour present.To conclude: this is a great movie for everyone, the humour is as much fun for adults as it is for children. The only thing I liked less was the story line, but that is forgiven because everything else is great and deserves a lot more credit than it has been given.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Not as good as it might seem...,"This film raises quite a few points about what qualifies as good animation these days.  Many people seem to be of the opinion that computer generated animation is automatically 'better' than the hand drawn variety but I fail to see it.  How superficial has our society become when we claim to be satisfactorily entertained by a flimsy story rendered in a largely sterile style of animation?  Lost to us is the artistry and skill with which past greats like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was brought to us.  There are many reasons why this is not a particularly good film, yet all require one to think, so most people will fail to realise this and give it a good review; fair enough.  If you only want an entertaining pastime for 80 minutes or so, something to occupy the kids on a Sunday afternoon, then Ice Age will do the job better than many; at least it *is* suitable for kids (all too rare these days, even when intended for them) with little scatological humour and no jokes of a sexual nature. Look more critically at Ice Age though and several things are apparent.  The story, as I have said, is wafer thin, making the film rely too heavily on the character animation for its entertainment value.  These are fine but I couldn't help but feel that *all* the effort had gone into them; apart from the three main characters, all the others looked very plain and in many cases e.g. the fat sabre-toothed tiger and the small, particularly nasty, sabre-toothed tiger, actually seemed to have been designed by different hands.  This is a bad thing in any type of film, when the viewer senses that not everyone who was on board the project was pulling in the same direction. The style of these animations wasn't in harmony with the leads. Furthermore, none of them had any real depth; an attempt was made at this with Manfred, but it was way too little to generate the kind of sympathy audiences built up for characters in the great Disney features.  This means that Ice Age relies throughout, entirely, on the nuances of animation in what the characters do as opposed to what motivates them.  Luckily, what the characters do *is* entertaining - they are funny, look great, and say funny things with good sounding voices.  There are some great set pieces e.g. the ice slide sequence, and the genuinely dramatic lava flow, with some great sound effects. I was unhappy with the super-realistic water; judging from everything else in the film, the intent wasn't to make the film 'realistic' yet the water looked incredibly so.  This worked to draw the attention to how real the water looked and away from the film; yet it clearly couldn't have been rendered in any other way than by computer, so surely this undermines any real artistic talent that may have been on display elsewhere.  I wish more effort had been put into story and characterisation than in developing water-rendering computer software. As well as those characters that looked odd, the entire dodo sequence didn't seem to fit in with the film's look.Overall, Ice Age is a slick-appearing film with too much emphasis on the superficial, which, given the success of the overated Pixar films, is exactly what most people want.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Icy,"Wow. What an awful film. Pointless, annoying, chock-full of stale pop-culture allusions and cliched situations. John Leguizamo, fresh from being so fantastic in Moulin Rouge, is the worst at the ultra-annoying Sid. If you hated Jar-Jar, you'll want to kill Sid. Even Jack Black is more likeable, (not by much) and personally, Jack Black makes me beg for the elegant comedy of Carrot Top. The animation is pretty nice, though.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Great movie,"The website just ate the carefully argued five paragraph user comment Iwrote (and was trying to correct) for this movie so I'll just say GO ANDSEE IT.

"While not quite ""Shrek"" or Monsters, Inc."", it's not too bad. It's worth taking the kids to.","With the success of ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Fox has decided to give their brand of computer-based animation a try. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to the aforementioned films. While it is cute and kids will most likely enjoy it, it's not of the caliber of its competitors and doesn't seem to reach its full potential.  First time director Chris Wedge does well keeping the film rolling along at an ADD-acceptable pace, but the overall feel of the movie isn't as fun as it looks in the previews. The voices are provided by B-listers Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo, who do an OK job, but don't seem to make the characters loveable enough.  The opening sequence (which is what you may have seen in previews last year) with the little furry animal and the acorn is classic, but the dialogue-heavy sequences aren't quite as funny. The plot isn't too bad, but the sequence of events is pretty predictable. While no one is expecting anything groundbreaking, there's nothing really new here. This is one that is worth taking the kids to, but will still be OK to wait for video as well. It's not too adult and not too childish either. This film wasn't made for critics, though. It was made for kids so in that respect it's good. Through the eyes of a child, this one is pretty entertaining. Go ahead and check it out if it looks good to you (or your kids).",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
Love the sloth,"I'm just wondering, why do people seem to think that computer animation started last year with Shrek and Monsters Inc., talking about them as the beginning and the end of the genre (especially Shrek)? It's probably because ""adults"" read Shrek reviews saying it was so smart they would enjoy it too. I guess must of these people have never seen the true masterpieces of computer animation...What about TOY STORY 1 & 2, real classics that are funny, heart-warming, intelligent? That should be your standard when it comes to animation, not Shrek!!Now, about ICE AGE... it definitely works on the most basic levels of emotions and values like friendship, loyalty, sacrifice, etc... And that's OK, no complications but a strong emotional foundation. John Leguizamo is excellent as Sid, the sloth. It's funnier than I expected, too bad they only showed the slapstick in the trailers.Technically, some scenes are amazing (the sliding sequence), but it's true that characters such as the humans are a disappointment. Or maybe they were never looking for photo-realism a la Final Fantasy.Give a chance to Ice Age, and never say no to an animated movie thinking ""it's for kids"" (except when it's produced by Nickelodeon).",,Anonymous,"Animation, Comedy"
