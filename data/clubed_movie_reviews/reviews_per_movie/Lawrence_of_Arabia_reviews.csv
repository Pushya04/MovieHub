a memento from the days when they made real movies,"It is, in a way, depressing to watch this movie today. One winds up contrasting it with the sort of technologically slick and aesthetically shallow spectacles, like ""Titanic"", that garner the sort of adulation that a truly great movie like ""Lawrence"" received in its day, and one realizes how far we have fallen.Ignore David Lean's painterly technique, the way he fills the screen like a canvas. Ignore Freddie Young's stunning cinematography in fulfillment of Lean's vision. Ignore the fabulous score by Maurice Jarre. Ignore the stupendous cast. Ignore the topnotch script.What we have, beyond all this, is an absolutely gripping and psychologically perplexing character study of a uniquely enigmatic individual that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the full length of the movie. ""Lawrence"", at over 200 minutes, goes by faster than many a movie of half its length, due to Lean's brilliant pacing and direction, and superb acting all around. To make a comparison in the world of music, this movie, like Mahler's 8th symphony, is a universe contained within itself.Of course, it is an exercise in self-denial and philistinism to watch this movie in anything other than the wide-screen - or ""letterbox"" - format, due to Lean's complete use of every inch of the wide screen. To watch it otherwise is to miss half of Lean's intention.To use a hackneyed phrase, they simply don't make 'em like this anymore.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Complex Man In Epic Events,"Although having just watched Lawrence Of Arabia again though I am bowled over by the size of the epic, I still can't believe that for the entire length of the film, the word oil was not mentioned. If it were done today it sure would be.T.E. Lawrence's story fascinates people today more than ever because he was in the center of the events that gave us the Middle East we have today. In the previous century and a half questions about that area revolved around the Ottoman Empire, the so-called sick man of Europe for that conglomerate of territory spilled into quite a bit of Europe. What's to happen if one country gets control of the place should that aging and decrepit empire falls apart. The question was postponed right up to World War I when Ottoman Turkey committed itself to the Central Powers.It was time then for the various peoples still under Ottoman control to rise and rise they did. In Arabia a young staff officer named T.E. Lawrence gained the trust and confidence of many Arab leaders and had a lot to do with uniting them and forming an army to chase fellow Moslems, the Turks out of the area and helping the British and French win in the Eastern theater of World War I.If going native which was the expression used by the British for one of their's who starts to identify with those he's supposed to subjugate than T.E. Lawrence went native in a big way. When his fellow countrymen did not keep pledges made to his Arabs he opted for a life of obscurity which is what he got until his death in 1935.David Lean when he couldn't get Marlon Brando for the part, opted instead for a young Irish player named Peter O'Toole who he had seen in the Walt Disney version of Kidnapped two years earlier in a small role. It was a felicitous choice as O'Toole became the star he remains to this day as a result of Lawrence of Arabia.It's a complex role and one you have to keep the audience interested in for over four hours. O'Toole runs the whole range of emotions here. We see him as idealistic, as arrogant, as humble, as honorable, as a stone killer, even a bit of a fathead at times. Sometimes a few of these mixed together at different points. Although David Lean got him a stellar supporting cast, if your Lawrence isn't any good, the film would flop. But Peter O'Toole was up to the challenge, he got the first of seven Oscar nominations. In this particular year he had some stiff competition with Burt Lancaster for Birdman of Alcatraz, Jack Lemmon for The Days of Wine and Roses, Marcello Mastroianni for Divorce Italian Style and the eventual winner Gregory Peck for To Kill a Mockingbird.Omar Sharif also making his first film for a world market got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Such Lean veterans as Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Anthony Quayle got plum roles. Anthony Quinn and Arthur Kennedy are the Americans in this film. Kennedy plays the fictitious Jackson Bentley who is really Lowell Thomas. Presumably Lowell Thomas did not want his name used here, but Thomas got his career started in the news field by reporting on T.E. Lawrence in this backwater theater of World War I, making his name famous and launching Thomas's own career in the process.One thing ever so gingerly hinted at was T.E. Lawrence's homosexuality. You can see it in his relationship with the two young men Daoud and Farraj played by John Dimech and Michel Roy. There is the alleged incident of gang rape when he's taken by Turkish soldiers led by their commander at Deraa, Jose Ferrer. It too is part of Lawrence's story though if Lawrence of Arabia were made today, they would be far more explicit.They would also be more explicit about oil instead of these unnamed 'British interests' that Lawrence is supposed to be really concerned with. You do get the idea that all they're interested in is the right of transit in the Suez Canal and the right to say who has the right of transit.Still Lawrence of Arabia is one sweeping epic both capturing the grandeur of the Arabian desert with the complexity of the issues and the man surrounding the desert campaign in World War I.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Runs out of steam in the 2nd half as the main character gets simplified,"Undoubtedly this is very good film. Filled with iconic images, scored with some of the most rousing music and anchored by O'Toole's deeply charismatic performance this is the film most people think about when they hear epic film making. If the 2nd half was as engaging as the 1st half I would wholeheartedly agree. As it stands I only halfheartedly agree. The 2nd half runs out a steam as the screenplay repeatedly decides to make Lawrence fit into the disillusioned soldier tropes. Worse the tensions and ironies of the character, say his love-hate relationship with violence, slowly and surely get resolved. By doing so the film is robbed much of narrative momentum.As scripted the story needs to be tightened up as the last hour or so simply crawls to a stand still. In particular a reworking of the Deraa assault should have occurred. While that scene is the impetus for Lawrence to be humbled and to realize he was ""ordinary"" it stands out as utterly unwarranted in the narrative. The film only hints at T.E. Lawrence's masochism and it doesn't imply that scene was an invention of his (as it probably was). It makes Lawrence's eventual descent into barbarism and setting up his disillusionment to pat and straight forward. This is especially true as the 1st half resists giving easy answers.Nonetheless this is a grand film that everyone should see once. It has a so much pure cinema in it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, what a treat!","Did you know that Cary Grant had been approached to play it? Yes, as well as Albert Finney and that made a lot more sense but it was Albert Finney who said, have you considered Peter O'Toole? Who? - Yes, I love that story. It goes to prove that certain things are meant to happen. I'm sorry if I'm going on about it. But I saw Lawrence Of Arabia for the nth time in a 70mm print in a crowded theater and what came across as the one major reason this film will be relevant forever is Peter O'Toole. His performance is timeless because it is unique. Cinematic and theatrical but always true. David Lean brilliantly created a sense of intimacy in O'Toole's eyes within the vast, arid landscape. I know the film has its detractors. I heard once director Michael Apted call it a ""silly movie"" Wow, I had Michael Apted's quote in my mind when I saw the film last and for the life of me, I don't know what he meant. I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simultaneously personal and panoramic,"Sweeping, epic and literate version of British adventurer and soldier T E Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during the First World War. Lawrence, miraculously well played by Peter O'Toole, ""went native"" when sent into the desert to find Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal. Before long he was striking out himself against the Turkish Ottoman Empire, which still held sway in the region at the beginning of the last century. Lawrence's efforts to unify the various Arab factions are particularly prescient.Lawrence became an inspirational warlord whose neutral presence amongst the Arab tribes, lead by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn, amongst others, served to glue together shifting and uneasy alliances. As well as wrestling with himself, with his own demons, and with the cruel desert environment, the Englishman was also faced with culture clashes which pitted not only the imperialists against the indigenous populations, but also the mercenary practices of the Arab guerillas against the discipline of the British army. In the end, Lawrence himself does not know which side he is on, nor which party he belongs to. Set against a backdrop of the Arabian desert, the nomadic allies under Lawrence's direction, attack and disrupt the Turks' efforts to maintain control of the territory, whilst the elephant - the British army and its heavy guns under General Jack Hawkins - pushes ever deeper into the area: not until his job is done does Lawrence learn that the French and British governments have carved up the middle-east between them and that the battle-lines for the 21st century are already being drawn.Scripted by the inimitable Robert Bolt and directed by David Lean, Lawrence of Arabia is one of those films without a weakness, despite drawing complaints for its near four hour length. The dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack and especially direction are superlative; likewise the supporting actors. But it is O'Toole at his charismatic best who steals the show in his starring debut; he never looked back. It may take an effort to watch this movie, but is well worth the ride and will, by the bye, provide some insight into the fractious and volatile world of Arab politics.One of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still my personal favourite,"I first saw this film on its release, aged 13, and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings, even from others (whom I envy, for I can't see it with fresh eyes) who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers, for whom a forty-three year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing (and for whom punctuation, paragraphing and grammar are a lost art), I suggest they learn a little about the history of film-making (from which it may become apparent that much of today's fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s: try Eisenstein's October, for example).From the universally admired cinematography of Freddie Young, the long shot of Omar Sharif's floating mirage entry, the pre-CGI battles and pan-up scene changes, to O'Toole's florid but career-defining performance and the (then) novel time-shift narrative, this film set standards not matched even by Lean himself, and, as many reviewers have commented, financially and practically unlikely to be attempted today. I too have rarely seen such clarity of image outside of Imax, and in my view the script by Robert Bolt (and I now have learnt, an uncredited Michael Wilson) is the finest in cinema. Maurice Jarre's music and some of the acting style now seem a little excessive, but repeated viewing (around 35 times in my case) does not diminish the impact and quality, and the restoration and now DVD release still, after all these years, approaches the effect of that first 1962 viewing.It is rare that repeated watching of a film (as opposed to a live performance) does this, and the reasons go beyond the photography, performances and editing. In my opinion, it is because the characterisation and storytelling encourage an appreciation of the ambiguity and inconsistency behind our motives and behaviour, and, in a wartime scenario, in the contrast between political expedience and personal morality. For a 13-year old, this opened a window into the adult world, and it explains why the story has resonance far beyond its setting. The film doesn't require an understanding of middle-east politics (though it does have some very current relevance), but it does require an ability to look, listen and understand. The fact that so many people rate it so highly says everything about its wider impact. When The Matrix and even Lord of the Rings have slipped out of the ratings (and the adolescents who inhabit these pages have grown up), I believe this film will still be in the 20s or 30s, perhaps enabling young people to once again see the world through adult eyes.Like Ali, I fear Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us, to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more, discover something new. When I was 13 I didn't understand much, but this film helped me to see that I wanted more, knew more, than my peers. I can't rate it more highly than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Majesty in the Desert,"The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.""Lawrence"" feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most ""big"" films--I'm thinking of movies like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Cleopatra,"" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as ""Lawrence""--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in ""Lawrence,"" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set ""Lawrence"" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries ""Lawrence of Arabia"" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all. O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" again. His later films are certainly more than watchable, and ""A Passage to India"" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another ""Lawrence."" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
David Lean's Masterpiece is a Cinematic Treasure (now in 4K UHD!) 💯,"The film that inspired Steven Spielberg to pursue a career as a film maker for good reason - 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a cinematic treasure - the greatest ""Epic"" movie, and one of the 5 greatest films ever made by almost everyone's standard.The spectacularly gorgeous and awe inspiring cinematography of Freddie Young tips the scale for me in favor of 'Lawrence Of Arabia' as Film's greatest work of art in the Epic genre, surpassing 'Citizen Kane', and The 'Shawshank Redemption', landing at #2 on my lMDb ""Top 5 Greatest Films"" ever made list (see herein), topped only by 'The Godfather' (#1).The immensity and scale of the desert creates the perfect canvas on which Lean paints his masterpiece - We shall never again see authentic location shoots on this truly epic scale, as granted permission for such is virtually impossible today.Restoration efforts in 1988 led by Spielberg and Scorsese saved most of what would have been a tragic loss.Now available in 4K UHD, the film has never looked better.My grandmother took me to see 'Lawrence Of Arabia' at a beautifully restored baroque theatre when I was 12, as the film was periodically shown in such art film houses for years after its release - It is an event I will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Deserves spot among its era, but best ever? I guess you had to be there.","I recently watched Lawrence of Arabia for the first time, as it certainly has a reputation as a classic. The film was genuinely moving and thought-provoking in parts, but altogether it's an experience akin to many movies like it: It probably watches better now if you'd already seen it decades earlier.There's an element of stage acting in many of these classics - a manner (or even volume) of conversation, dramatic, unnatural turns toward or away from an argument - that, to me, has not aged well.The pacing is slow and deliberate. There's maybe an hour of dialogue in this 3 hr, 42 minute movie, a runtime which is used mostly to explore the grandness of the scenery, though admittedly, at times, I wondered if the film was buffering when it wasn't. I don't think criticisms that it's a bit boring are unwarranted.The scale of the film, even by today's standards, is pretty outstanding. Scenes of charging camels riding to battle, the music & landscapes of the desert - all of this is as advertised. The main character? I'm not sure what we're supposed to think of T.E. Lawrence. He sort of alternated between humble solider & self-appointed deity, between altruistic and self-serving. The lack of consistency never gets us to truly understand his motives or desires, and again, like movies of old, the overacting (theatrical falls to the ground, dramatic glances, contrived shouting matches) pulled those opposing themes farther apart.Again, I feel like you just had to be there. I don't think it's unfair to suggest that Hollywood's top filmmakers have found new and innovative ways to tell great stories in the last 60 years, at least for today's audiences. If classic films aren't your cup of tea, this one may be tough to sit through.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A mixed but pretty unique experience.,"A perfect 100 on Metascore would indicate that this is indeed a perfect movie, and while I'd call a few aspects perfect, it has undeniable issues.The georgeous cinematography makes the 4 hour runtime much less unbearable, compared with the well used music compositions. All the performances are amazing, especially the main 4.All the action sequences are really well done along with the practical effects.The 4k remaster added a lot of depth.
The sunburn scene was really powerful with the image of the sun and that irritating music, and the dialogue generally was witty, and playful, and mostly cleverly written.The runtime itself is a choice that I feel like was really intentional and purposeful, this movie had to be big and monumental so that it could really make you understand the psychology of Lawrence, and I don't have a problem with that, but some scenes could've cut down. Some sequences are too long, while others are too short. And the intentions of the director aren't always clear, and sometimes it can feel like a mess. And while I think it's a completely unique, and masterful movie that I won't forget anytime soon, but the enormous runtime, sometimes unclear intentions, and cheap and really boringly done death scenes kind of bring it down for me. If you are going to do something that's 4 hours long, every single scene in it should be perfect, to keep me completely interested, but it's really not perfect.I'll watch it again 20 years from now.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Overrated Borefest,"I've heard about Lawrence of Arabia for years, but not really knowing what it was about. One day, while I was on the internet, I came across information about the film. I've learned that it won best picture in 1962; I've learned about how it influenced filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg; and I learned about how it adapted the memoirs of T.E. Lawrence and made them into a feature length film. This interested me so much that I decided to head down to blockbuster and rent it. Now that I've watched it, what do I think of it? Well, to be honest, I thought it was just plain out boring. The problem I had with this movie is that not once I cared about Lawrence or his conflict. I did not see any depth in his character and I did not for once care for what he was fighting for. To me, this felt more like a boring history lecture than an actual film. There is a plot in this movie, but it doesn't really surface in an interesting way and the viewing of this film just becomes tedious.I do admit that this film was very well made, but it's only icing covering a bland, tasteless cake. There are some good scenes in this film, but why couldn't the filmmakers make Lawrence or his conflict more interesting. At least in Seven Samurai, the conflict was simple enough and the characters were well developed to keep me interested, but Lawrence doesn't have that.I can't recommend the film, but I know other film buffs will want to see it. If you want to see, by all means go ahead. I hope you enjoy it. I sure know I didn't.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best movie of all motion picture history,"I first watched ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when I was about 11 years old. Being a big fan of Steven Spielberg at that time, I was sort of awed by the fact that this was his personal favorite (check the ""conversation with Steven Spielberg"" featurette in the special features disk and you'll really see Spielberg's affection for that film)Over the years, Lawrence remained among my DVD collection, and I can't say I actually watched it since that first time, when, by the way, I didn't really like it. But ""time does things to movies"", and when I watched it again last year, I found my eyes to be weeping at the end. It instantly became one of my favorite movies.Since then I learned a lot about the history of cinema, and I also learned a great deal about the movies of Sir David Lean. I found my self watching films like ""Brief Encounter"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""Ryan's Daughter"", and the underrated, ""A passage to India"". Lean became one of my favorite directors, and, just a few months ago, I decided to watch Lawrence with some friends. Although I had seen it a couple of times before, this time it was a different experience altogether: from the starting credits, to the blowing of the match, the crossing of the Nefud dessert, finding Gassim and bringing him back to the camp, the invasion of Aqaba, his torture and rape (?), Lawrence's laugh after the slap by the ""outrageaous"" guy, his being left alone, to the final gaze to the motorcycle. I sensed something when I watched that film, which leaves my with the undoubted feeling that ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the greatest film ever made. For me, this is it. Ever since '62, it's been a downfall. No other film has managed to reach Lawrence in its poetic greatness. Few do come very close (Vertigo for instance).If we are to classify the two complete different cinematic styles, it would be those of Hitchcock and Ford. Hitch was a very ""confined"" director. He captured his movies from the point of view of one character. His movies took place, most of the time, in closed spaces. In a sense, Hitchcock's films were a journey in people's emotions and a study in people's characters. On the other hand, Ford was an open director. He wasn't confined to one character, or one location, his films where actual journeys. His basis was mostly on theme, and his main ability was to amaze with his imagery. Thus, these are the two different shooting styles....Well, Lean combines both.Which is basically why his best film, Lawrence, is the best film of all times. But not only in terms of style. Also, in terms of content. The intelligent script written by Robert Bolt, the powerhouse performances by O'Toole and Shariff (a shame they didn't get the statuette), but also, the ultimately heroic yet tragic figure of T.E. Lawrence, contribute in making this the most visually and emotionally sweeping film of the last 111 years.Such a shame that Lean retired for 14 years after ""Ryan's Daughter"", there's no way to know where he would have gotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Heroism brilliantly shown,"When it come to making epics, David Lean is the master and what better proof than this masterpiece.  ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was first shown in 1962 and after almost 40 years later, it is still beautiful.  The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"".David Lean has shown us a man's long, yet never boring (at least for me) journey into the deserts of Arabia.  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is an ordinary man that becomes a hero (at least in my eyes) during his extensive tenure in Arabia.  He becomes a traveler, a great man, and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.An assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O'Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I'm allowed only 1,000 words to use in my comment.Will all do respect to classics such as ""Gone With The Wind"" and even ""Bridge on the River Kwai""this is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.

The grand-daddy of all biopics,"If we're in the mood to do film genealogies, and I am, then Lawrence of Arabia is probably the inventor of the modern biopic, the perennial awards-bait genre. (You could maybe posit Citizen Kane as the originator, but that's really a different kettle of fish.) It examines a fairly recent historical figure at the prime of their life, dedicating numerous scenes and most of the dialogue to hammering home that the central character is a Very Special Person Unlike His Short-Sighted Bosses, and in this way the film spends a good amount of time justifying itself. This genre obviously has strengths and flaws, and they're apparent in Lawrence: the striking personal power as well as the kind of historical oversimplification and tourism that goes along with it.Lawrence of Arabia's main claims to being a great film are David Lean's gorgeous cinematography, stopping the action at several points simply to capture the desert in all its cold grandeur, and the film's final hour, in which Peter O'Toole turns his larger-than-life hero into a desperate, wild-eyed man who can no longer control the violence he's created. The biggest points against it are its indulgent four-hour running time and its unavoidable racism (having two of its major Arab characters played by white actors in brownface is really one of the lesser offences.) With this in mind, it's hard to say whether a contemporary viewer will really enjoy this film. I found it fitfully interesting but ultimately had trouble engaging with it, and felt kind of exhausted by the film. On the other hand, I've been told that it needs to be seen on a big screen for true appreciation, and not my modest laptop monitor, so I don't want to say anything definitive. Whether or not it ""holds up"", Lawrence of Arabia is a pioneering movie that manages, despite everything, to capture a kind of beauty, and that makes it worth slogging through for anyone genuinely interested in film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Quite simply movie-making on the grandest scale,"At 17, I love David Lean, his films are filled with beautiful images and he also directs with real flair. Lawrence of Arabia is a perfect example of movie-making at its finest, the whole film is absolutely phenomenal in every aspect:Whether it is the film's visual style. Lawrence of Arabia is filled with absolutely beautiful images, such as the mirage that introduced us to Omar Sharif. I don't think this could be possible without the astounding cinematography, or the stunning, picturesque Morrocan, Saudi Arabian, Spanish and English locations. The shots of the desert were visually jaw dropping and the battle scenes are unforgettable. But that is the thing with Lean, all of the films I have seen of his are visually stunning, Passage to India, Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, Brief Encounter and Bridge on the River Kwai all but to name a few.Whether it is the film's music score. I used to listen with real enthusiasm to Classic FM at the Movies every Saturday (on the radio that is), and along with the main theme of Gone With the Wind, the score's main theme was one of the main themes that stuck out most. Maurice Jarre's score is nothing short of outstanding, swift, sweeping, epic and even iconic. I could very well say it is probably one of my all time favourite movie scores.Whether it is the film's screenplay. The screenplay is intelligent and is like a withering satire on the mentality of Lawrence's superiors, who go by the book. Like the screenplays for Casablanca, Shawshank Redemption, It's a Wonderful Life and All About Eve, the screenplay here has lines that are a) quotable and that b)linger long into the memory, just like the story the film tells.Whether it is the film's acting. Peter O'Toole is the easiest starting point, for he gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on film. His performance is so flamboyant and brilliant, it just highlights what a great actor he is. He nails Lawrence's complex character like a fitted glove, he is enigmatic and charismatic like TE Lawrence was like in real life. Supporting him all the way like iron are Alec Guiness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer. Their characters aren't as complex as Lawrence's but they are still fully fleshed out and intriguing.The film is very long, but thanks to the quality of the visuals, direction, screenplay, music and acting there is no time whatsoever wasted. Quite simply one of the best movies ever made, movie-making on the grandest scale. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful cinematography and a worthy epic to boot,"David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a 4-hour desert epic telling the true story of T. E. Lawrence, a man who united the Arab tribes against their Turkish enemies, is considered an epic for a reason. It has wonderful vistas and backdrops brought to life by some splendid widescreen cinematography; it boasts a stirring score and stunning production values in which everything is catered for. It's the kind of film that makes modern movie-makers, with their green screens and CGI armies, look lazy.The story itself is both intriguing and compelling, working on both the individual and the expansive level. There's action here: desert crossings, battles, sabotage and war, and yet it's much more complex than that. The script carefully draws out the nuances of the various Arab tribes and the tribal complexities preventing peace in the region, as well as providing a fitting introduction to the modern-day Middle East.The only thing that really dates the movie is the acting, as these are the kind of stiff, mannered performances have long since gone out of fashion; Alec Guinness for example acts in a way long out of fashion. But the calibre of the cast is epic in itself and there are lots of supporting actors giving decent turns, such as Omar Sharif and Anthony Quayle. Peter O'Toole and his role both stay an enigma throughout, but that's no bad thing; instead, it only adds to the wonder of the piece.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Vision that Defines Itself,"A man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. He goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. Gaining powerful sponsors, he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. But in a very short time, that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.True of both Lawrence and Lean. The legacy of Lawrence is still in violent disarray (I write this a short time after the Sept 11 attacks on New York). But Lean's vision was saved, and what a vision! Of this picture, it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.Lean's vision is also lean, with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. Though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of TE's 'Seven Pillars,' which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. So powerful a depiction that Islam experienced a faddish attraction in the West, a place now enjoyed by Tibetan Buddhism. That was before.See here the original Obiwan, every intonation, movement and dress. See here Peter O'Toole's personality become completely entwined with the character, who is as fictionalized by our eye as by Lowell's. See the most expressive, anthropomorphic train wreck in history.Watch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the 'Arabs.' Macho men are acting anyway, so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.The star of the film is the clever eye of God, not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. Its face is clearest in my mind when the Turk holds TE down for torture and smiles. Its hand in the creaking of Feisal's tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting? (Kurosawa's 'Ran' at the beginning is the only other example I know.)I have a few films I admire for various. mostly intellectual qualities. But in the direct matter of visual storytelling, this one tops my list.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie For All Time.,"I have seen this movie many times. It is a movie to be seen in a large movie theater on a very wide screen. One of the persons responsible for the restoration of this great film is my cousin Robert Harris.Bob did a masterpiece in restoration. He invited me to the opening of the restoration in Los Angeles, and I was introduced to Omar Shariff. Unfortunately, the Cineplex Odean in Centuty City has been demolished to make way for a modern office complex. The demolition of this movie house coincides with the demolition of movie making in this town.The scene of Ali coming into view on the desert is the best piece of cinematography I have ever seen. This movie prompted my wife and I to travel through Syria, Jordan and Israel, where this movie takes place. I brought with me on this trip Lawrence's autobiography, ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"". I used this book to instruct my car and guide to take me to all of the places that Lawrence visited in Syria and Jordan. I even hired a 4 wheel drive vehicle to take me into Wadi Rum, the canyon that Lawrence sung Tum Te tum Te tum. The place really echoed. My Bedu driver took me to a cave at the end of the Wadi where I was introduced to a very old Bedouin who fought with Lawrence during the ""Arab Revolt"". There was even graffiti on the wall of the cave written by Lawrence's followers.Before Lawrence involved himself in the ""Arab Revolt"" he lived among the Arabs in the land once called ""The Ottoman Empire"", which was administered out of Constantinople. His book discussed his visit to the most preserved Crusader Castle still in existence today in Syria, north of Damascus, Craque DE Chevalier, where the Crusaders held off Saladin during a great siege.That movie and my visit will never be erased from my memory. Thank you Bob for that wonderful restoration.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can't Sleep at Night? Try Lawrence of Arabia,"The definition of an epic must surely be a film that is annoyingly too long.

"Memorable Visuals, Sound & Acting, Yet It Peters Out","I'm doing this review despite not having seen the movie in a number of years but what I remember best is some fantastic desert cinematography from the point when ""Lawrence"" (Peter O'Toole) arrives in the desert until about the last third of this 3-and-half-hour film. There are just numerous spectacular desert scenes and, of course, this was a must to be seen in widescreen. Fortunately, that has been available for many years, even on VHS. Between the direction of David Lean and the photography of Freddie Young, this is a fabulous visual treat, one to be treasured.Unfortunately, the story as well as the great visuals, seem to dissipate in the last hour-plus of the movie. It just kind of peters out, like Lawrence's desert campaign.The acting is superb with the possible exception of Anthony Quinn, who overacts. Two of the all-time greats - Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif - also added life to this monumental epic story. This was O'Toole's first role, too, and probably his most famous and some think his best. After this film and for a short period afterwords, O'Toole was looked upon as the premier actor in the business.For a film this long and with such little action, it's amazing it entertains as well as it does. For those who need some pretty women to aid in the story, forget it: in fact, there are NO women that I can remember. It gets by with the cinematography, O'Toole intense acting portraying a real-life vain, courageous, stubborn and obsessed Englishman trying to unite the Arabs to fight the Turks.Another very memorable and impressive aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. Is it my imagination or were soundtracks (like this one) more important and remembered better than movies in the last quarter of a decade? The main theme song is played throughout the film and I still remember it 44 years later.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Marvelous Epic,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)**** (out of 4)I'm really not sure I could add anything original to what has already been said about David Lean's masterpiece epic. The story is pretty simple as for nearly three hours we follow T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who rises to the top as a hero but quickly things take a turn for worse. LAWREANCE OF ARABIA is certainly one of the most memorable epics that has ever been made and I think it's one of those films that just beg for a large screen and in particular a theater screen. Watching it at its 50th Anniversary re-release, one really has to be amazed at the pure grand scale of it all. Did it have to run for nearly three hours? Probably not but if you took anything out of the picture it simply wouldn't have that epic feel. Today movies are long for no reason what so ever whereas in the past and with films like this they were long for a purpose. The film is pretty much flawless but I think the greatest thing it does is the visual scale of everything. Those opening shots of the desert are just marvelous to see on a large screen and those beautiful shots of the sun rising and falling. The entire scope of the sand, the mountains and the eventual battles are just something truly marvelous to behold. It's also important that the story itself didn't get lost in this massive production and Lean really does a remarkable job at telling the story and especially during the second half when the film really does focus on Lawrence and his downfall. O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are all marvelous in their performances and you really can't see anyone else playing the parts. Add in the marvelous score, the wonderful cinematography and you've really got a film that deserves its legendary status.",,Anonymous,Biography
Visual Grandeur,"Everything about this film is bold, clean, striking, vivid -- most apparent in the magnificent visuals. The landscape might as well have been Mars. Desert scenes convey a wonderful sense of sterile beauty, pristine and natural: blowing sands, the sun, the sky, and not much else, uncluttered by modern techno-jumble that renders cities ugly by comparison. The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place.So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), on a mission to help Arab tribes come together against the Turks in the early part of the twentieth century. Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash.The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence: ""What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert?"" To which Lawrence responds in two words: ""It's clean."" Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot: simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered.Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times.My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with ""Intermission.""""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
If you can find it on the big screen - that's the way to see it!,"This film should be viewed in a big cinema on a big screen. That really is the only way to truly ""feel"" the desert scenes in this film beautifully photographed by Fred A. Young.This film has influenced so many - Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, etc., etc., but most of all film restorer Robert A. Harris. Mr. Harris along with Jim Painten, brought the film back to life with the magnificent 1989 restoration and director's cut watched over by Sir David Lean and Anne V. Coates, the film's original editor. It is a MUST for all film buffs.Although the film is over 40 years old, being a period piece it doesn't date. The film re-creates the stiff formality of the British Military of the First World War very nicely bringing to life the pompousness of General Murray, a type not likely to be encountered by today's generation. The odd quirkiness of Lawrence and his many hang-ups are depicted as only O'Toole could have created the character.The DVD is pretty crisp and clear infrequently revealing the age of the celluloid. It is very exciting but no television can match the awesome landscape created in a large format cinema equipped with real 70 mm projectors. If you have the chance, see it there first (and often, if possible).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Landscape of Arabia,"The story of T. E. Lawrence as he fights for the Arab cause becomes a sprawling screen epic, magnificently photographed under the keen eye of Lean. The film made O'Toole a star and boasts an all-star. This is a fine film, but is extremely overrated. The plot, what little there is of it, is generally uninteresting and rambling, causing the middle part of the film to drag terribly. An hour or so could easily have been trimmed from the middle, thereby producing a tighter and more compelling story. The acting is uneven, with Guinness underacting and Quinn overacting as Arabs. Ultimately, though, the cinematography and score manage to compensate somewhat for the weaknesses in the script.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not what I expected,"Having read the book ""Dr. Zhivago"" many times and also having watched the
movie of the same name many times, I obtained a DVD of ""Lawrence of
Arabia"" and proceeded to watch it. I figured that since this movie had received
many good reviews, it would be an excellent movie.After watching the first hour of the movie, I was not all that impressed with it.
I did finish watching the movie and probably will never watch it again. The
actors did a good job but the movie reinforces my belief that ALL WARS are
not about establishing peoples' freedom but are instead about making rich
individuals richer and furthering the economic and political interests of the
participating (winning) countries.This film certainly added credence to my opinion of WARS that much more.
I do NOT watch TV and if I was to go into any movie rental business, I would
not recognize 99% of the titles because I have never watched them or even

A feast for the eyes,"This film features some of the best cinematography ever done, you really get the feeling for the vast expanse of the landscape, the heat of the desert. The scene where Lawrence returns from the desert, slowly appearing, first only as a speck, in the boiling air - brilliant and not a second too long. And you can't beat hundreds of extras running and riding through giant sets. (btw, there are some blue-screen shots with o'Toole and Sharif on camel-back, those don't ring true) Peter O'Toole is amazing, but I have to disagree about many of the other roles - OK, it was a different time, but some of the performances were plain cheesy or over-the-top, even Olivier and Sharif. Also, while I'm skeptical about today's PC-brainwashed stories, the different factions were presented in a very one-dimensional way, the running time would have allowed for more nuanced characters. Not a film I'd watch very often, but definitely worth the money if you can catch it on a big screen, preferably a 70mm copy. Look for those detailed sets with the tiny mosaic and wood inlay works, or the wide-angle landscape shots! Amazing ...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the greatest movie of all times,"T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) has a minor function in Cairo during WWI. Nobody really cares about the Bedouin uprising against the Turks except for Lawrence and the Arab Bureau. He's sent for 3 months since he would be of no great lost. He learns the ways of the desert, and memorably encounters Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) at a well. He finds Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) harassed by superior weapons, and the British unwilling to take Aqaba from the sea. So Lawrence proposes to take Aqaba from the desert and Feisal gives him 50 men.Director David Lean's vision is absolutely beautiful. The desert is beyond gorgeous. Peter O'Toole is brilliant. There is nothing inferior. It is all first rate. The bigger the screen, the better the movie looks. This is simply one of the best of all times.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Film of Epic Scale and Epic Proportion= One of the Greatest,"Every once in a while there is a film that will blow you away from start to finish, in this case Lawrence of Arabia ins one of those very few films that will blow you away. For many years my grandfather enjoyed this film and suggested it to me for some time, finally being old enough to see it, I see why he and many others have enjoyed it. Epics are a kind of film that take an immense approach towards a story that needs a massive vision in order to tell such a story. David Lean took this massive vision in order to create something of epic scale and scope, which captured the extensiveness of an epic-genre film. Like most other epics, they take a great amount of time to tell their long stories, some ranging between three to five hours long which I will say may be too long for any kind of film. Lawrence of Arabia runs in at three hours and thirty-six minutes would seem like a rather long film, but this runtime feels appropriate when telling the progressional story of T.E. Lawrence building his character in great depth. Think of it like breaking the character of T.E. Lawrence into several parts such as a man, soldier, hero, leader, and advisor. In regards to the performances, Peter O'Toole brings T.E. Lawrence to life on multiple levels making us feel for his life journey and all other circumstances that he faces on that journey. All supporting and secondary performances adds a lot of good flare as well, especially from Omar Sharif's character. The direction by David Lean resonates every minute of this epic, Lean took such great care in creating a film of scale, meaning making this film both look and feel immense. Great utilization of wide lenses and shots allow the look of the film to larger than life, which in turn makes those particular shots more impactful.I would recommend this film to anyone, even if it were just one time. This film has been on many ""top films or greatest films of all times"", after seeing it I feel that this film justifies its placement on those lists.

The most beautiful film I've ever seen,"When I first saw Lawrence of Arabia, I was 16 and my teacher had loaned it to me as he suspected that I might enjoy it, much unlike students in his previous classes. I actually expected the film to be an incredibly boring four hours in the desert, but my opinion had changed almost as quickly as the movie had started. I was amazed by the characters, the graceful and witty dialog, the never-ending presentation of amazing shots, and of course, the character of T.E. Lawrence.To understand that a film crew had to go out there and film rare and beautiful desert phenomena, without the aid of modern visual effects technology or even a SINGLE matte painting presented an incredible feeling. Before watching this film, I was under the impression that beauty was better recreated in artifice than actually filmed. I thought that only the skill of a matte painter could produce such beauty. No. I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the desert, by the magnificent and colossal natural structures in Wadi Rum and the seemingly infinite vacuous space covering the land. It was difficult to believe that there are actual places on earth like these.Second, the script was brilliant. I had a bit of trouble following the plot, but it mattered not; I was too busy admiring the visuals and the almost poetic dialog. On my second viewing, I had no trouble understanding the plot.In short, this is perhaps the most beautiful film I've ever seen.Though, I must warn: The movie is heavily fictionalized. The historical inaccuracies are numerous, however they don't take away from the film at all.In fact, not long after purchasing the film for myself, I've done quite a bit of reading about the Arab Revolt, T.E. Lawrence, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
can only be appreciated on a really big screen,"David Lean's stunning 1962 portrait of the fabled World War One adventurer is sometimes hard to pin down, and perhaps for good reason. Filming Robert Bolt's thoughtful script against the spectacular wide-screen panoramas of ace cinematographer Freddie Young, with Maurice Jarre's justifiably famous music score for support, makes it all too easy to overlook some of the finer nuances of such a complex character. Lawrence went into the desert not only to enlist Arab aid against the Turks, but also (in modern jargon) in a quest of self-discovery. In the end he found more than he bargained for, after being transfigured by the unforgiving landscape into something more than just an ordinary man, but something less than the near-deity all but worshipped by his Arab hosts. The length of the film (overture included) is intimidating, but seeing it again on the big screen shames the petty ambitions of today's ersatz blockbusters, proving in truly epic proportions that intelligent entertainment is not an oxymoron.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An odd, stylishly quirky confection, Increasingly anachronistic.","Stunning and ground-breaking cinematography. (Restored to brilliance in the 50th Anniversary BluRay edition)Gorgeous soundtrack, with its familiar, enigmatic theme. Spectacularly bravura and camp performance by eye-lined Peter O'Toole (of whom Noel Coward noted, ""If he'd been any more beautiful they'd have had to rename it 'Florence of Arabia.'"" (Omar Shariff may have had the same eye-liner clause in his contract, BTW.)I wanted to watch this with the family a) to see a movie classic and b) to see how the story of Britain's carving up of the middle-east post Ottoman empire was presented and finally c) to revisit the story of a remarkable (and controversial) man.The first thing to note is the length of the film - 3 hours and 18 minutes. Blimey! You're not gonna take this one in one sitting. The second is that you may struggle with the plot and context if you don't gen up before (or while) you're watching. e.g. Q: The Arab Bureau? A: A department of the Foreign Office responsible for overseeing the political machinations of the regional players; Turks, France, Britain, local Arab emirs, independent tribes and whose representative decides to support the maverick Lawrence. If you don't know he'd been an Academic already in Arabia for two years or more, spoke fluent Arabic, was well respected by the locals and so on, you might wonder why the Arab Bureau was keen on having him work for them.Indeed, the historical accuracy is very variable, so don't expect a well structured history lesson. There were some hefty arguments at the time about the content, and how it portrayed the film's prime antagonists.What it does very well is show the brilliant madness of a man obsessed with his own destiny and special nature. This is probably an accurate representation of Lawrence, at least it concurs with what he autobiogrpahically wrote in his 7 Pillars of Wisdom.But in watching it, you too will probably be puzzled by his motivation - why he takes many of the actions he does.Questions remain about Lawrence's sexuality and the film makes nods in this direction as well as his potential sadism, for example when we see him apparently revelling in unnecessary killing (instead of taking prisoners).Lawrence clearly was an extraordinary man and Peter O'Toole's performance was pretty darned amazing. But for me the narrative doesn't hold up. It's fragmented and sporadic and fails to give the personal or historical insight it deserves. The panoramic shots of expansive desert are indulgently long, as is the whole film.So, a ground breaking, historical film, with some outstanding performances and truly stunning photography. But it is flawed in its accuracy and proportions and is unlikely to get a great deal of attention from future generations other than film aficionados, for whom it will continue to be a classic and formative.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
How can I fight a bloody war without artillery?,"Reading ""The seven pillars of wisdom"" does enhance the film experience indeed. Several times you have to hear ""No, I didn't know him well, you know."" at his - T.E.Lawrence' - funeral and it will ring some more bells inside you, if you've read his biography. One might accuse the film here, that it missed the opportunity to show what his extraordinarity consisted of other than his control of pain and fear. But at the time, 1962, it wouldn't have made too much sense to include those things. Today though... the man is so severely against the modern grain that it would have been a delightful thing to have him privately portrayed. He is an anti-future, so to speak, a glimpse on a branch that history just didn't pursue any further.So much for Lawrence, now to the film itself. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" seems to be a monumental film, but all the wide shots do nothing to disturb its personal tone, probably because there is nothing that they capture, just the emptiness of space. Anyway, as such, as the exhibition of emptiness, they don't really work, that's better left to the imagination of the reader or the eyes of the tourist. The important thing though is that they do not disturb the personal tone, which is the quality of the whole film.That statement might surprise after my prelude, but personal isn't the same as private. In this film we see only ordinary stuff, people getting shot at, arguing, riding horses or camels and laying bombs. Yet artificial as it - as any film - is, it radiates warmth. The characters are convincing. Their dialogue is essential and sometimes, where you'd least expect it, namely in Auda, it is even philosophical, touching Lawrence' religious considerations ""It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rum!"" This exposure of hedonistic thought illuminates a wider principle. What it means to be truly free. So free that you can even choose what you want to believe in, what you want to make the religion of your tribe. And what it means to be truly tolerant.Now, having stated all that, I still haven't even remotely begun to tell anything about the film's plot, about ""big things"" in Arabia. How ""big"" these things were in Lawrence' head, you won't be able to tell by watching the film, the term ""New Asia"" doesn't occur once, a shame, considering the influence of more recent ideas on the same subject. Still, a ""big thing"" remains essentially a ""big thing"", no matter how far you drive your fantasy. And standing against ""big things"" there'll always be the common things. Verily, both sides do their best to drive each other mad.And then, there's something more, something elusive that is never clearly mentioned in the film... o.k., enough of that parody. I missed the quote ""Preaching is victory. Fighting is illusionary."" I did miss that, because it captures the soul of this whole thing and gives the answer.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Hollywood Treatment of a Historical Subject,"When considering the history of the relationship between the Arab countries and the West, it would be worth your while to watch this movie. This movie portrays a moment in history when the Arab people and the West were actually ALLIES, fighting together against a common enemy. Here a British soldier, Lawrence, actually risks his life in the cause for Arab independence. This is am incredible revelation. Peter O'Toole play Lawrence. Although O'Toole is at least a foot taller than the actual T. E. Lawrence, he nevertheless gives an outstanding performance as the enigmatic and heroic figure. Of course, one should not confuse this movie with a documentary, so don't cite this movie if you're doing a paper on the subject. But if you want to watch a credible dramatization of historical events and characters relating to the role of the Arab people in World War One, then this is the movie for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Here, his uneasy array of homo-hints, blank stare, evidently weak acting, very unnatural emotional display, shallow delivery and generally very irritating mimics. Omar Shariff and Alec Guinness are no better with their laughable gestures, bad lines and unconvincing acting.

"very good, not great","Lawrence of Arabia was a bit spotty, IMO. There obviously were brilliant and gorgeous elements but there were those that prohibited me from being completely won over as well. Some of the latter were idiosyncrasies of many movies from that era, therefore, I tried to keep those in perspective.After the music, which was at odds with the movie and which I tolerated only so long before skipping, the early scenes were witty, absorbing and charming and everything I love about older films (especially the magnificently droll, British ones) as were many subsequent scenes. But as I grew knee deep in suspension of disbelief I found myself questioning the director. Not necessarily the people Lawrence happens upon in the desert but the way he happens upon them, the anachronistic and totally miscast Anthony Quinn (who can be such a hack and was in this movie - IMO), etc... all contributed to me finding the movie a bit too inconsistent to be considered great. It lacked a degree of internal logic. I also must admit to a prejudice against the residual self-conscious mannerism from stage and silent film that some early performers exhibited in dramatic roles. O'Toole's operatic manner toward the end made me ever conscious that he was acting and not going mad. It's like watching Parsifal. Omar Sharif, on the other hand, was BRILLIANT. His entire performance was flawless.I do believe the way Lawrence was portrayed with the two boys was a hint that he was suspected of being gay. I kept thinking of Batman and Robin and all the adolescent sidekicks superheroes have. I did not go into this movie with any preconceptions and don't think the thoughts these scenes evoked was arbitrary.Oh, and the voice Alec Guinness used for the prince was goofy, almost like a Peter Sellers spoof.All in all it was a very good movie but not a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Timeless Classic,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962) - [10/10]Now this is an epic. An epic of epic proportions. To make a 3 hour and 48 minute film in the 60s, that didn't have many stars, no sort of love story, minimal action, a budget of 15 million dollars, and film it completely in the deserts of the Middle East is a feat in itself. It was shot in 285 days, won 7 Academy Awards, and has an actual intermission! Films simply aren't made like that anymore. Steven Spielberg once said that to film a similar film like this today would cost around 258 million dollars. It's extraordinary - just like T. E. Lawrence. I love this film, and so do many others, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Roger Ebert. There's a reason why we are infatuated with this film. It's timeless. This film holds up today, 58 years later, because it was filmed completely naturally. No sort of CGI backgrounds, remote location filming, or absurd action sequences; it was all real. They actually blew up trains in the desert, flew planes through rocky plateaus, and traveled across the desert on camelback. That's why it took 285 days to film! There are plenty of scenes where our characters travel across the scorching desert, and there isn't a human being in sight - let alone prior footprints (it's the small things that really tie this film together). It's spectacular.Let me begin with one of the many things this film is praised for, the cinematography. It is gorgeous. That is the reason I chose to use 17 pictures in this recommendation (and I wish I could've used more). Not a single shot isn't perfect. The cinematography, from F. A. Young, inserts us into this foreign world (and foreign story) of Arabia with the long, sweeping takes of the desert. Simply seeing the sun rise over the desert is an amazing experience. In (probably) the best shot of the film, we witness a mirage. Up to this point (I can't recall any other films with mirages), no film had ever captured this optical illusion. It's beautiful. A lot of the shots in Lawrence of Arabia (1962) are taken for granted. Just think about having to lug a Super Panavision-70 film camera (it's pretty big) out into the desert and film these complex crane shots, tracking shots, and extreme wide shots. Just the opening sequence is complex, they filmed a motorcycle POV scene. By today's standards that isn't complex at all, but can you imagine having to mount a gigantic camera on the front of a truck, operate it, and film the road in the 1960s?? Revolutionary. The average length of each shot in this film is also fairly long. That has a purpose; it cements us into the desert with our characters. Like I said, it's the small things that tie this film together. The things you may not think about. Those are the extraordinary things about Lawrence of Arabia (1962).David freaking Lean. What an amazing director. He had a vision, to tell a story that was lost in time, and to tell it with utmost respect for historical accuracies. He's the one that pushed everything to the next level. To film in the desert. To film everything real. He was able to manage all these moving parts, capture small amounts of emotion in large landscapes, and create a masterpiece of filmmaking. There are sequences (many actually) that I sat there and wondered, ""How on Earth are they doing this?"" There are countless amounts of extras, camels, horses, and sets in this film. I have never seen so many moving parts onscreen. He is a new inspiration for me as an aspiring director. He is the reason we have filmmakers like Spielberg, Scorsese, Cameron, and Fincher. And he is the reason we have this masterpiece that is Lawrence of Arabia (1962).I need to talk about the score. Maurice Jarre composed the titles that would be performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and it is beautiful. Never have I really been moved by a score like this one. The opening of the film is just a black screen for a period of about 5 minutes. In that five minutes, we hear the Overture of the film. Oh how it places you into this film. The black screen allows you just to imagine what you're going to see on screen and what you imagine is what this film ends up being. If there was ever a sound I would associate the desert with, it would be what we hear in the film. It is beyond iconic and one of the greatest scores in film history. It completely adds to the astonishment and experience that Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is. Listening to it again, I can feel the film playing in my soul. It's brilliant.The casting is beyond perfect. If you look at actual pictures of the real Lawrence of Arabia, T. E. Lawrence, and Peter O'Toole, it is uncanny. They are pretty much the same person. Alec Guinness actually plays an Arabian Prince in this film, and it is believable (times were different back then, as he was brown-faced). In fact when they were filming, some of the people that actually knew Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness' character) believed it was really him. I would say that is pretty great casting as well (regardless of whether or not it is culturally sensitive right at this time, Alec Guinness was really good in his role as Prince Faisal). Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi and Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali are spectacular. A lot of the performances are really above their time. This was Peter O'Toole's first mainstream role and he killed it. He carried the story extremely well, and was able to be the imperfect, larger-than-life, T. E. Lawrence. Whenever Alec Guinness was onscreen, you knew he was there. He had such authority in the film and really gave a great performance. The chemistry throughout the entire cast is golden. Especially O'Toole and Sharif. They work off of each other and you can't help but smile when you see them together. You can't help but smile throughout this entire film.The writing is above its time as well. Spielberg stated that this script is probably the best in film history, and I agree. It is really good. Story elements, important plot points, and key narrative ingredients are set into action within the first 30 minutes if the film. It's perfect. The dialogue is also extremely natural (probably because it was based off of T. E. Lawrence's own writings) but, at the same time expositional. You don't know you're getting these important details until they happen. At 268 pages of script, you would think the story would have moments where it slows down - you would think that. It doesn't. It just builds and builds and builds. I found that the runtime just flew by, and it wasn't a problem at all. I was so engrossed in this amazing narrative that it didn't matter. I guess time really does fly when you're having fun.The last thing I'll touch on is the editing - you do not notice it. According to Scorsese, the best editing isn't noticeable. I 1000% agree. The editing in this film isn't noticeable. It's timed perfectly. Great work by Anne V. Coates. I can't imagine having to look at all the footage that they filmed and trim it down. There are moments in this film that you can't even see the cuts. It's not noticeable, and that's how it should be.A lot is said in this film without the utterance of a single word. Be it a glance from Peter O'Toole or the heat seen radiating off of the desert floor, a lot is said. The soundtrack serves as the words to the audience's ears. The Arabian landscape serves as the structure of each soundless sentence. The actions and visuals of each character serve as the punctuation at the end of each of these sentences. All of these devices form the sentences that are spoken in Lawrence of Arabia (1962). This film is fantastic on so many levels. It is a great character study. It is a great war film. It is a once in a lifetime experience. I love this film, and I hope you will too. Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is a timeless classic that still holds up today, and in some ways is better than most films being made right now. I highly recommend - no. You need to see this film. This is a film that everyone should watch in their lifetime. This is Lawrence of Arabia (1962).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Visually magnificent,"The strongest element of this film is the camera's capture of the landscapes and the detail that was put into the visual elements of the film. By proportions, this film is an epic and certainly in a league of its own, similar to the title character himself. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a film about an English soldier who helps the Arabs fight the Turks in the 1940s because he has a strong love for their culture and country. The film follows this man and how he influences others around him. The only downfall of this film is that it is often difficult to follow the story and to understand exactly the different players and reasoning behind some of their actions. (However, I do not think that this is a fault in the acting but probably a fault in the script.) Despite being a long film, this film is engaging - more-so for its visual and striking portrayals of landscape and battle scenes. Do not miss this film if you enjoy historical epics.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
They just don't make movies like this anymore!!,"Sometimes what is not said is equally important as what is said. In today's moviemaking everything seams to need to go fast, with heavy dialogue and quick camera shifting. We have forgotten the power of letting the story slowly evolving, taking its time, lingering on every syllable or frame. Peter O'toole acts whit his mimic, his posture, his gaze and I find myself blown away and not once did I think about the length of the movie. This is true art and immensely enjoyable.

"Overlong, overrated but no women, worth ten stars for that alone.","I have read a number of reviews on here from one star, over harsh, to ten stars, overrated.The main complaint is it is far too long, something I have to agree with, it could have been cut to 2 hours without losing any of the plot and action.Another complaint is the sand, lots of it, what do you expect from a film set in a desert? The forests of the Ardennes?A number of reviews, mostly with female names, complain about no female lead or any women come to that. The day I see a woman in WW1 film fighting I'll do more than eat my hat. So where would a woman fit into this film? Answer they wouldn't, it's a war film and women were only good for handing out white feathers at the time. Crowbarring a woman into this just for the sake of having a woman in it would be absurd.Peter O'Toole and Sharif are perfect, sure Alec Guinness playing an Arab might have been okay at the time but only looks odd now, at least Anthony Quinn managed to pull it off. I read on here that Marlon Brando was considered to play Lawrence, now that would have been a travesty, it would have been Brando of Arabia with his appalling British accent (See Mutiny on the Bounty for an example)I first saw this film aged 11 in 1962, if I was going to be bored by it I would have been then. I was mesmerized by the sheer expanse of the super wide screen which almost made me feel as if I were in it. So much of that is lost on a small screen (TV) which doesn't help. So if you bad reviewers ever get the chance to see it in its 70mm glory you might just change your minds.Certainly not one the greatest films ever made, but neither is it the worst. I think 7 stars is fair.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Should be Watched by Every American/Brit,"This film is a classic and an important tool for understanding current upheaval in the Middle East. Aside from the unbelievable cast, haunting score, and superb acting (particularly O'Toole's Lawrence... even better in the director's cut which shows additional facets of O'Toole's character development), the film demonstrates the most effective tactics employed in asymmetrical warfare... hit and run strikes on soft targets like Aqaba and Turkish railroad/supply lines. These are the tactics currently being utilized in Iraq, and we could learn valuable lessons, namely that the Sykes-Picot agreement and its arbitrary national boundaries, combined with the dishonesty of the British has been a great factor in the ever-present unrest that has plagued the region since the days of Lawrence. Perhaps we would also be wise to note that a superpower has NEVER defeated a well-established insurgency. Even ignoring its intellectual provocation, this is an epic that effectively balances the sweeping vastness of the Arabian peninsula's awe inspiring deserts with the (certainly exaggerated) grandeur of the fascinating character that was T.E. Lawrence.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Dissenting View On Lawrence Of Arabia,"This is a film generally hailed as great that I believe is merely good, and at times mediocre. Yes, Fred Young's photography is magnificent, Robert Bolt's script far more intelligent and clever than the average screenplay, and David Lean most definitely had an flair for spectacle. All this is true. Many of the actors are good, too. But it goes on too long and doesn't explain enough of Lawrence's personality. Mostly, though, what ruins the film for me is its pretentiousness. Lean is simply trying too hard: for beautiful effects, stunning shots of the desert, sweeping moments, ironic ones, lovely shots of pretty things and ugly shots of evil things, all captured to perfection by his beloved camera. The movie is funny and disturbing and true to life, at other times larger than life, it is a history lesson and an action picture, a thinking man's spectacle...but it's shoveled down my throat and I resent it, and half-way through I want to spit it out. Art is to a large extent made up of artifice, however, artificiality should not be the main thing but rather one of the many things one likes about a work of art. Lawrence, it seems to me, is pure artifice, and not much else. Let me give an example. There is a scene near the end of the film when the various competing factions among the Arabs are debating over what to do in the post-war world. Suddenly, the lights dim in the great hall where they're all gathered. At first I thought nothing of it, a nice touch, maybe even true. Then, as I pondered the matter, I got angry with the scene and the film for the obvious symbolism: the lights are England, the hall is the Middle East, the sun is setting on the British empire, on the West in general, and the Third World shall triumph despite its lack of much technical know-how (the lights). Instant term paper! Moments like these, and Lawrence is full of them, turned me off,--how shall I say--big time? To make matters worse, Peter O'Toole's prancing-mincing-detached-ironic-aristocratic posturing wore me down early on, as I found him increasingly repulsive as the film dragged on. Nothing in Lawrence is natural and alive. It all seems so thought out. I agree that a tremendous amount of talent went into the making of this overrated so-called classic, but the result is just a lot of, well, hot air. (Sorry I didn't go into the story itself here, since I am assuming, probably incorrectly, that most people are at least casually familiar with the life and times of T.E. Lawrence).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Greatest film ever made,"Majestic isn't a term I would apply to many films, but ""Lawrence of Arabia"" deserves it. So brilliant on so many levels, acting, screenplay, photography, costume design, set decoration and above all direction. David Lean is by far my favorite director and his influence can be seen in countless other films. Peter O'Toole is by far my favorite actor and this is probably his greatest performance, although The Ruling Class is equally stunning. If you would like some insight into the huge mess in the Middle East, this is one film you must watch. Martin Scorsese commented that ""Lawrence"" could never be made today. I agree but for different reasons. I do not think there is any director alive today who has the insight, the patience or the work ethic that was needed to make ""Lawrence"" Devoting millions of dollars to an intelligent historic epic would also be something that today's movie makers would never venture into. David Lean was one of the last of a dying breed of precise filmmakers (Kubrick being the other) that went to any lengths and expense to get just the right shot.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence of Arabia,"Along with ""The Third Man"" and ""Lost in Translation"", this is my all-time favorite movie.

It has amazing shots of the ""clean"" desert, Dirction by David Lean (whose known for his scale in directing), great performances, and most of all, one of the best of scripts all time (were talking about a script that stands next to Casablanca's in greatness).This movie is understated, and I am especially appalled that this movie is #28 on the ""IMDB top 250"" (especially considering that it ranked # 5 in AFI's top 100 movies).

Expensive and breathtaking  screen adaptation of  enigmatic  adventurer and military T. E. Lawrence,"Mighty motion picture of action and adventure deals with Thomas Edward Lawrence , following this brilliant , flamboyant and controversial British military figure and his conflicted loyalties during wartime service . He was renowned for his liaison role during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, and the Arab Revolt against Ottoman Turkish rule of 1916–18 . This blockbuster is a huge accomplishment in every respect . It is a groundbreaking epic that is also literate and intelligent . Tremendous scenes , spectacular battles , intense drama , lots of action and awesome production design and art design from John Box and John Stoll . Still , the only way to really appreciate it turns out to be in Super Panavision and on big screen . Overlong though still knockout and resulting to be an immortal film . Based on T. E. Lawrence's book , ¨Seven pillars of wisdom¨ with interesting screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson . The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia . Peter O'Toole is splendid in his film debut , and made him an instant star . Colorful and impressive cinematography in Technicolor by Freddie Young . Unforgettable and classic musical score by the great Maurice Jarre . Lavishly produced by Sam Spiegel and masterfully directed by David Lean who bring us an overwhelming show delving deeply the complex personality of the British , semi-Arab leader who led the revolt against Turkey in WWI . Reissued in 1989 , a stunning version which restored a lot of cuts made over years . As many scenes of dialog were missing and as a result Peter O'Toole and a number of living principals returned and re-recorded dialog from more than 20 years previously . An ultimate thinking people's spectacle .Adding more biographic elements about this rich character T. E. Lawrence (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) , he was a British archaeologist, military officer, and diplomat . Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) was born out of wedlock . He became a practising archaeologist in the Middle East , working at various excavations and in 1914, before the outbreak of the Great War , Lawrence was commissioned by the British Army to undertake a military survey of the Negev Desert while doing archaeological research . Lawrence's public image resulted in part from the sensationalized reportage of the Arab revolt by an American journalist, Lowell Thomas (Arthur Kennedy) , as well as from Lawrence's autobiographical account . In 1917, Lawrence arranged a joint action with the Arab irregulars (Omar Sharif , I.S. Johar) and forces including Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) against the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba. On 6 July, after a surprise overland attack, Aqaba (it was recreated in a dried river bed in southern Spain, consisting of over 300 buildings) fell to Lawrence and the Arab forces . After Aqaba, Lawrence was promoted to major, and the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, General Sir Edmund Allenby (Jack Hawkins) , agreed to his strategy for the revolt . In1918, Lawrence fought in the battle of Tafileh, an important region southeast of the Dead Sea, together with Arab regulars . The battle was a defensive engagement that turned into an offensive rout and was described in the official history of the war as a ""brilliant feat of arms"". Lawrence was involved in the build-up to the capture of Damascus in the final weeks of the war. Much to his disappointment, and contrary to instructions he had issued, he was not present at the city's formal surrender, having arrived several hours after the city had fallen. Lawrence entered Damascus around 9am on 1 October 1918 but was only the third arrival of the day; the first was the 10th Australian Light Horse Brigade, led by Major Harry Olden, who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said . In newly liberated Damascus —which he had envisaged as the capital of an Arab state—Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal (Alec Guinness) . During the closing years of the war Lawrence sought, with mixed success, to convince his superiors , General Allenby (Jack Hawkins) , General Murray (Donald Wolfit), Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle) in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests . The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work . In 1935, Lawrence was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident in Dorset.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Movie Ever Made,"There are so many excellent insightful comments, here, I will only add a few:1. Like many others, I consider this the greatest movie ever made. 2.

What never fails to amaze me is that it is an awesome epic with the brilliant dialog of the best, intimate play.In ""Amadeus"", Salieri says about one of Mozart's pieces, ""Displace one note and there would be diminishment"".

Totally Unmoving.,"I rate this movie 6 out of 10.This is hardly the greatest movie of all time as others have written here. I'd be hard pressed to call it one of the greats.   Of course, there is much subjectivity in any of these types of judgments.   My opinion is partly based on the fact that I am seeing this movie for the first time now in 2002.   Had I been born (and old enough) to appreciate this movie during it's 1962 release, I suspect I would have rated it higher back then.  I'm sure things that were breakthroughs and outstanding back in the 1962 release of this film would have improved my opinion of it had I seen it then.    On the same token, I suspect movies that I've seen in recent years which I've given one rating now, may change slightly (maybe even significantly) over the years.Perhaps I did get off on the wrong foot with this movie in the beginning.  I did not find it very artistic, moving, or stirring to have the interminably long period of black screen with the soundtrack playing at the beginning of this film (on DVD).   Then the very first scene set me off with a negative impression.  In this scene we see T.E. Lawrence riding his motor bike down the road at a VERY high rate of speed WITHOUT his hair being blown back, or blown about in the slightest bit, other than from the up and down motion of whatever he was sitting on when they filmed this scene.    Surely one could say that he is wearing some pretty strong hair spray, gel, grease, whatever, but nothing could be so strong as to have his hair not move at all while traveling so fast on a motorbike.Okay so those are fairly minor flaws of which there aren't many in this film.   The main reason I didn't rate this movie higher was because this movie (the story) didn't really move me in any way.  It didn't elicit any strong emotions in me one way or another whether it be sadness, happiness, fear, intrigue, wonder, nostalgia, anything.  There was hardly even a sense of adventure (to me).   In some ways it was dryer than watching an old PBS documentary.I also found the storyline somewhat disjointed, and the ending very dull and incomplete.  So dull, ordinary, and incomplete that it was unexpected.  If not for the words 'The End', I would not have thought the film was over. Although I must say that I was sort of glad that it was.Anyhow, I suppose certain people rate their movies primarily on the artistic value of how well the film was made.  I take that into consideration, but my ratings have a lot to do with how good the story is and how the movie makes me feel.  A great story poorly made will get low marks.  A boring story, nicely made will get mediocre marks from me.   This movie fits the latter. I did not come away from this movie with a sense of ""Wow, that was fantastic"", but more of a sense of ""Eh, that was okay"".If not for the fine acting and cinematography, I would have given this movie 4/10.   Because this movie does have merit in it's style and acting, and the breakthroughs made for its 1962 release I decided to give it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A beautifully made film that has not aged well,"It's an epic (3 3/4 hours), somewhat fictional, partial biopic of T. E. Lawrence during World War I from 1916 to 1918 during the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East. The story focuses on Lieutenant T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) of the British army, who had experience in the Middle East. Beginning in Cairo, he works with General Murray (Donald Wolfit), Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), and British diplomat Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains). Because of his experience, Lawrence is sent to explore relationships with Arab leaders like Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness), Ali ibn el Kharish (Omar Sharif), and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn).Robert Bolt's script makes Lawrence the Great White Leader of the Arab Revolution. David Lean's direction and Freddie Young's cinematography provide some spectacular scenes in the desert. The most substantial relationship in the film is between Lawrence and the fictional Ali ibn el Kharish. The British military leaders play to superficial stereotypes.

I am no plot hound or action junky, but lets speed things up shall we! Sweeping cinematography cannot carry a movie.  I can't emphasize enough how lacking this movie is in story.

Grand and Intimate Epic,"For some unknown reason I've always had an attraction to this film and it's enigmatic lead character. Which is why I went all through my high school and college years refusing to see it on the small screen in the hopes that I would someday have the chance to see it on the big screen. I was about to give up when in 1987 they released the 25th anniversary edition. Boy, am I glad I waited. I was not disappointed and this film was even more than I'd imagined it to be, which is super tough considering I'd been building it up in my mind for almost 15 years. The story, score, costumes, performances and most significantly Lean's deft and inspired direction all held me captivated from beginning to end. I'd read several biographies of T.E. Lawrence, and was this film a wholly accurate depiction of him and the events during the Arab campaign, not exactly. Then again it's a dramatic film inspired by Lawrence and not a documentary, which is why I take issue with those who complain that the film is not a detail by detail account and I remind myself that for every film inspired by either a real person or book that there will always be those hold-outs who refuse to allow themselves to fully enjoy art for arts sake. Oh well, their loss. As for me and anyone else reading this review I cannot recommend this film enough, and if possible see it on the big screen to fully appreciate it.

A Unique Landmark,"Lean's tremendous 'Lawrence of Arabia' is truly one of a kind. Compared to epic Hollywood movies that have been made before and since, the strength of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is that the film's heart lies in its story and character rather than lavish sets, action scenes or special effects. That is not to say that this movie was lacking in the aforementioned department. Quite the contrary because Lean has used a lot of rawness and subtlety. The desert is so wonderfully captured that it is successfully portrayed as ruthless and yet seductive. The viewer can understand why Lawrence is drawn towards it. During the action sequences, the camera would shift back to the characters' faces allowing the viewer to see their emotional reaction to the ongoing horror rather than merely showing 'cool action scenes'. Beautifully shot and edited and thanks to a solid screenplay, 'Lawrence of Arabia' follows a very smooth pace and even though the running time is more than 4 hours long, there was not a moment when I felt that it dragged. The soundtrack is mesmerizing.However, what would have 'Lawrence of Arabia' been without the immensely talented Peter O'Toole? I was very surprised to discover that this was his first film. Whether it's his spontaneous reaction, impressive improvisation, or terrific dialogue delivery. The actor plays the part very naturally. There is not one scene where he acts formulaic or theatrical (a risk many actors ran into those days, especially with such roles). It is a prototype performance that portrays a heroic character as very human.Of the supporting cast, Omar Sharif is very likable as Sheriff and Anthony Quinn provides some comic relief. The rest of the actors do fairly well. Only Alec Guinness's portrayal of Prince Feisal falls flat.Overall, 'Lawrence of Arabia' can be described as a one-man show because of Peter O'Toole, but then that would be unfair to David Lean and Robert Bolt as this also marks their best work (or at least one of their best works) to date. This is truly a unique epic film experience and there is hardly any other picture of its genre that has achieved remotely close to what 'Lawrence of Arabia' has.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest and most epic films ever made.,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" stands as an enduring masterpiece of cinema, a sweeping epic that transcends the confines of its genre to become a timeless work of art. Directed by the visionary David Lean, the film unfolds with a grandeur and scale that is unmatched in cinematic history. At its core lies a mesmerizing performance by Peter O'Toole, whose portrayal of T. E. Lawrence is nothing short of extraordinary. O'Toole's command of the screen, coupled with his impeccable delivery of dialogue, elevates the character to iconic status, leaving an indelible impression on audiences long after the credits roll. Supporting O'Toole's tour de force performance is a stellar cast that includes Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif, each delivering nuanced and compelling portrayals that add depth and dimension to the film's rich tapestry of characters. Guinness, in particular, shines as Prince Feisal, bringing a gravitas and dignity to the role that is simply mesmerizing to behold. Sharif's portrayal of Sherif Ali is equally captivating, imbuing the character with a sense of mystery and intrigue that adds to the film's sense of wonder and adventure. But perhaps the true star of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the desert itself, captured in all its breathtaking beauty by Lean and his cinematographer. The film's wide shots of the vast expanse of the Arabian landscape are nothing short of breathtaking, conveying a sense of solitude and majesty that is both awe-inspiring and humbling. Each frame is a work of art in its own right, with every detail meticulously crafted to perfection. Complementing the film's stunning visuals is Maurice Jarre's evocative score, which sweeps viewers away on a journey of epic proportions. From the haunting strains of the main theme to the stirring crescendos that punctuate key moments of drama, Jarre's music serves as the perfect accompaniment to Lean's sweeping vistas and larger-than-life characters. At its heart, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a timeless tale of adventure, ambition, and the quest for identity. Based on the true story of T. E. Lawrence, the film explores themes of colonialism, nationalism, and the clash of cultures with a depth and complexity that is as relevant today as it was upon its release. Lean's direction is masterful, weaving together a narrative that is both epic in scope and intimate in its portrayal of one man's journey of self-discovery. In conclusion, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is more than just a film; it is a cinematic triumph that continues to captivate and inspire audiences more than half a century after its release. With its breathtaking visuals, powerhouse performances, and timeless themes, it earns its place among the greatest films ever made, a true masterpiece that deserves to be celebrated for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Visual beauty makes sanctimonious handing tolerable .....,"Probably the most visually stunning film that I have seen in my whole life. The visuals in this one would put to shame the visuals in the greatest of Westerns. The grand vistas are the grandest ever.But PETER O TOOLE's sanctimonious portrayal of Lawrence got on my nerves. There is no other way of putting it - he was too feminine and irritating (I checked on wikipedia and apparently LAWRENCE was a homosexual). Brando (to whom the role was offered initially) would have done a better job even with his mumbling. ALEC GUINESS was also a real pain, I mean he was hilarious. Apparently DILIP KUMAR was offered the role played by OMAR SHARIFF (who was brilliant).And the story doesn't get really interesting until just before the interval. The film does offer some terrific insight into the Arab psyche. Basically the Arabs were parasites who had no interest in democracy and could not run a country properly. They depended on the British for various systems to continue and the moment the British retreated, everything fell apart completely.The British were no better. Their flexible morals and deceitful imperialistic ambitions made them play one side against the other quite easily.The film had this very sanctimonious tone throughout, the main character was completely unlikeable and I don't think TOOLE played him very well. And nor were the filmmakers successful in showing what a nefarious person Lawrence really was.LEAN might have made some visually stunning films but I guess he always worked with a big budget. he is no KUBRICK or POWELL/PRESSBURGER.The film did make me wonder about the remarkable men produced by England and what the country has become today.(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
great if you like men riding through the desert,"Always meant to watch this movie so well praised. I could not get into it. Most of the movie is men riding through sandy deserts with overly dramatic music in the background. The plot is not compelling, basically it's men posturing and prancing about. I really did try to like it but gave up after a very long hour and a half, i found it extremely tedious and boring. Hardly a decent story to grab onto.

Epic film shot in 1961,"Epic film shot in 1961. You might have wondered why this movie lasts almost four hours with an intermission. When LofA was made, going to the cinema to watch a movie was a bigger deal than it is now. It was commonplace for movies to last this long, and lengthy epics with a cast-of-a-thousand were the flavor. This is the only significant quality this movie shares with other contemporary movies of the time.Obviously, this movie takes place in the Middle East. As far as western audiences were concerned, LofA might as well have taken place on the moon for all that was understood of Arabian culture and history in 1962. LofA transports us to an alien land with strange characters and values. To help tell this story, the movie is anchored by established actors like Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, and Claude Rains. While Hawkins and Rains perform familiar characters, Guinness and Quinn paint credible portraits as Arabic royalty and tribal leader. That their characterizations still ring true today is a testament to their portrayals. Only in the last 10 years or so has western cinema begun to maturely portray Middle Eastern culture. Omar Sharif, one of the few actual Middle Easterners with a prominent role, demonstrates the complex beauty and brutality of this culture.Of course the real star was newcomer Peter O'Toole. His was a risky casting and proved to be one of the best of all time. The real genius of LofA is its simplicity. Here is the man Lawrence, here is what happened, here's how he felt about it all. This is made possible by O'Toole. At the time, campy presentational acting was still the prominent style of movie acting. O'Toole was part of the new blood of method acting, made en vogue famously by Brando and ""On the Waterfront"", that was showing the audience, not telling, the emotional fabric of a character. Watch O'Toole's eyes on his close-ups. He communicates more depth and presence than any dialog could provide. He draws the audience in, includes them in his triumphs and despairs, all the while impressing the hope and ambition of Lawrence.Steering the ship is David Lean. He makes nearly every minute of the movie matter. An important part of the story is the environment of LofA, the desert. It's such an integral part that Lean treats the desert as a character. Lean takes the audience to another world to show how the desert is a huge factor to the method of madness Lawrence finds there; why a man is killed simply for drinking from a water well, why Lawrence is the Giver of Life, why crossing the desert for gold is honorable, why it is important that Arabia be ruled by Arabians, not the British or Turks. There's a scene where Lawrence is crossing the Devil's Anvil. In that sequence Lean includes a shot of a dust devil (the tornado-looking thing) spinning fiercely on the baked ground. If this movie were made today, a CGI-artist would make this. Of course CGI didn't exist in '62, but nonetheless Lean patiently set up in the desert to capture this phenomenon and include it. It's a small color, but important the vast and vibrant world he communicates.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Finest Film I have Ever Seen!,"Sam Spiegel who ran Horizon Pictures out of London had great producing deal with Columbia Pictures and the relationship brought forth ""On the Waterfront"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwa""i in this film among other such as Elizabeth Taylor/Katharine Hepburn in ""Suddenly Last Summer"" also ""The Chase"" with Marlon Brando and Jane Fonda.Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'oole in what I consider one of the great male performances in the world of Cinema, also starring Anthony Quinn, Alec Gui Sam Spiegel hired David lean to direct this movie which I feel is the finest film I've ever seen.Peter O'Toole then a young actor unknown to the world gives one of the greatest performances ever on the screen and lost the Oscar to Gregory Peck (The Academy not always known for discretion waited for Mr. Peck to die before awarding O'Toole an honorary Oscar). Supported by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinnes and an immortal performance by Omar Sharif. Lawrence of rabia won the Oscar for Best Picture and Davi Lean for Best Director. Maurice Jarre won for his legendary score. Oddly neither O'Toole nor Sharif won Oscars. The Academy took care of that oversight by s=awarding an Honorary Oscar to O'Toole.The Honorary Oscar was meant for those who were never nominated nor won.. Garbo,O'Toole, Deborah Kerr, Myrna Lo, Maureen O'Hara y were honored but left out were Irene Dunne, and Jean Arthur, Doris Day. A Major star who should bhonored is Kim Novak for her iconic performance in ""Vertigo"". Kim is probably shy after the lambasting she got from many including Trump. Kim

Mesmerisng.,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) is one of the few films that I would call mesmerising. The acting by all the leads is brilliant. Peter O'Tool is just superb as Lawrence. His performance could quite possibly be the greatest role ever. Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal was one of the more strange acting choices (he plays an Arab), but Guinness is very good and (the then) newcomer Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish is astonishingly good, and there are a lot more great actors in the movie like Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains, and Arthur Kennedy. All the different departments did everything to perfection, (espesially the breathtaking Cinematography by Freddie Young) and the direction and script are flawless. One to watch in a sitting.

A great biopic of one of the greatest of all men.,"In 1986 at the tender age of 13 I was holidaying in Dorset, England and visited a tiny country village called Moreton.It was here, far far away from deserts, sheiks and camels that I first became enthralled by T.E. Lawrence the British Officer who fought alongside the Arabs against the Turks, and who foresaw and tried to prevent the very political tensions we see in the region today.Why Moreton you may ask? Well that day I found him. There he was at the back of the tiny graveyard, finally tucked away from the world he spent his final years trying to escape. The grave is simple. There are no carved figures of camels or an effigy of a robed desert king or the like, neither does it make any reference whatsoever to the great man he was or what he accomplished. It simply reads T.E. LAWRENCE FELLOW OF ALL SOULS COLLEGE OXFORD.Intrigued but not yet in full appreciation of what I had just seen, I was determined to learn more about him and I was recommended a book called THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM written by Lawrence himself telling in detail his exploits in the desert. However no-one told me that Lawrence was also one of the most superficially intelligent figures of the 20th century and it was so intelligently written that I found it very hard to get through. You yourself would also have to be a fellow of All Souls College Oxford, to have understood it.Instead I opted for the 1962 film which basically is an adaptation of this great novel. This I understood and was I amazed? Not 'alf.This ranks as one of my favourite motion pictures if not THE favourite. Of course the real star of the picture is the stunning cinematography, but the all-star cast runs it a very close second.Peter O'Toole gives a more than adequate portrayal of Lawrence, and I find it amazing that after such a promising start for such a naturally talented actor that none of his subsequent projects lived up to this standard. Alec Guinness is superb as Feisal and seems to have actually changed his race and creed for the role. Jack Hawkins gives General Allenby more of a humane and good natured disposition than the real Allenby deserves, but none the less portrays him well. Claude Raines, as Dryden, shows true English style, with his wit and dead pan attitude even when faced with the worst of news.Omar Sharif, in his first non-Egyptian film, plays Lawrence's friend and confidant, Ali and it is their love/hate relationship that gives the film it's tenderest moments. And of course special mention for Anthony Quinn who once again proves that he could play anyone, of any age, race or culture with as much conviction as the real thing. Excellent.What the film fails to explain is what kind of man Lawrence really was. However this cannot be blamed on the director or the actors as Lawrence was so superior of mind it was almost like he was on another plain, even his most closest of companions failed to understand him if of course he understood himself.I do not find this film too long and on many frequent watches I often have to look at the time to see if four hours have really passed. It is an engrossing story and is told in a manner as to be true to Lawrence and the people who coloured his world. So true in fact that Lawrence is portrayed in a 'warts and all' kind of way giving equal screen-time to both his failings and his triumphs. From his growing enjoyment of killing and his failure to save his friend from quick-sand to the crossing of the Nefud desert and the taking of Akaba, the events are shown true to life. Rarely do we see a story-line where we are made to love, worship and admire a man who also appalls and sickens us in the same film.One of the few films to actually stay true to the historical facts without studio sensationalism seeping in, it offers realism unlike any film before or since.It might also interest you to know that this this is the only film I have ever seen that does not feature any women at all. I wonder if it is the only one? If anyone knows the answer to this please let me know.If you still don't fancy this epic or still think its boring or badly made, try reading the book instead. You'll come back embracing this DVD with three arms.",,Anonymous,Biography

Definitely not the best movie ever!,"I just had to write a review because there are so many people who claim this is (one of) the best movie ever. I'd just like to ask: Why?I'm sure that at the time this movie was made, it had that ""wow"" effect, it had storyline (with many holes or things hard to understand), acting was decent, scenery was amazing, but the movie never explained the reasons for the main character's actions or those of others, how did he manage to convince all those Arabs to fight with him, fight scenes were poorly executed, they travelled through the desert that nobody travelled before like it was child's play and traveling between Arabia and Cairo was like two hours drive..it just stretched forever never really explaining anything that was happening. I'm even getting annoyed writing 😅

David Lean's Lawrence Of Arabia,"Director David Lean's 1962 epic ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" is one of the few films hat legitimately deserves to be called not only great,but magnificent. The films appears on virtually all ""ten best"" lists and reveals deeper layers of meaning with repeated viewings almost every time it it presented. The best way to appreciate this epic biographical adventure than to see it projected in 70 millimeter onto a huge theatre screen. That caveat aside,this is a masterful ""desert classic"" that is appreciate on home video if viewed on a widescreen format is okay,but to see this in a theatre with a audience is worth the movie-going experience. In 1989,Columbia Pictures re-released this classic back in theatres in a re-mastered format and presented in Dobly Stereo sound not to mention was restored to its original format by Robert A. Harris and the results were brilliant. In 1992,the studio released ""The 30th Anniversary"" edition exclusively on home video and DVD since this edition of the film was based on the 1989 Robert A. Harris restoration and captures as much of Lean's original intention as any video version can.Structurally,the film is a standard biography,beginning with the subject's death(in a motorcycle accident),brief interviews with people who knew him,and then a chronological recitation of the high points. The first spoken line of the film is ""He was the most extraordinary man I ever knew."" But T.E. Lawrence(Peter O'Toole) is not an easy subject. He is a contradictory figure,and the filmmakers properly don't try to pin him down,allowing him to remain a fascinating enigma throughout. In a visual sense,David Lean combines a sure sense of place with approach to the action that he borrows from an unlikely source-John Ford. Lean turns his vast desert canvas into another Monument Valley,and when his Bedouins ride across it,they are not far removed from Ford's cavalry. In many of the early scenes,the stately gait of the camel's walk gives the film a slower pace,and this is precisely what Lean is trying to achieve. Lean even manages to surpass Ford with his understanding of the relationship between his characters and the landscape;how the desert changes those who go into it. The complex character was created by playwright Robert Bolt in his first script,and blacklisted Michael Wilson(who also worked with Lean on Bridge On The River Kwai). This Lawrence is at first ambitious,inexperienced young officer who is transformed by his immersion into the Bedoulin world into a messianic hero. Later he comes to understand himself,though his knowledge comes with a large portion of self-loathing. Lawrence's mission,largely his own creation,is to unite the feuding Bedoulin tribes under the leadership of Prince Feisal(Alec Guinness),and to keep the British politicians,as personified by Mr.Dryden(Claude Rains),from putting the Arabs under their colonial thumb after WWI is over. It is accomplished through a semi-episodic series of battles and raids where Lawrence is sometimes accompanied by Ali(Omar Sharif)and Sheik Auda(Anthony Quinn),and equally difficult bureaucratic struggles he faces with General Allenby(Jack Hawkins).The two sides of the story are clearly contrasted-the blast-furnace desert exteriors and the cool,echoing marble interiors where the army staff does its work. The initial scene of negotiation,when Lawrence has returned from the desert for the first time and meets Allenby takes place in a courtyard,neither interior or exterior. Its a simple device,but an effective way to set the moment apart. In the same way,changes in clothing color and style are used to reveal changes in character,and Lean's none too-subtly inserts motorcycles at odd moments to remind viewers where all this is leading,and the results are beautifully executed to the fullest extent and it shows in such scope and grandeur of the romance,danger,and allure of the desert with such physical and emotional power. As the filmmakers see it,the central conflict within Lawrence is his simultaneous desire for adventure with is sometimes uncontrollable lust for excitement. The film itself made an unknown actor at the time Peter O'Toole into an international star. His performance is this magnificent epic is worth seeing. The payoff resulted in a total of seven Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director(David Lean),Best Original Score(Maurice Jarre).",,Anonymous,Biography
"A great, timeless, classic of epic cinema.","This film tells an important part of T. E. Lawrence's life. A curious and highly intelligent man, joined the British Army during First World War and had a decisive role in the Arab Revolt of 1916 against the Turks. Directed by David Lean and scripted by Robert Bolt, it has the participation of Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif.T. E. Lawrence is one of the most interesting characters of the First World War. It wasn't a brilliant general or military, but got a huge part along the Arab tribes, disunited and often rivals, making them a highly effective troop (despite being composed of irregular militias). The film shows us how he got it and the price he paid (the scenes of violence when he was imprisoned by the Turks, although softened, can still suggest the alleged anal rape that he have suffered, among other tortures).The film is full of stunning scenes of the desert and is visually appealing, perhaps one of the epic films that gave greater attention to the use of natural landscapes to impress the public. The harshness of living conditions (or rather, survival) of the local tribes is also depicted with objectivity, as well as the importance given to water and control of wells. The action scenes were well thought out and show how the struggle was unequal, apparently doomed to failure (the Arabs battled with archaic methods and weapons, when compared to those used by Turks).The performance of the actors is something exceptional. The film is full of great players who have been at their best. Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif stand out naturally by the exceptional quality of their work, in a film that has become largely responsible for their consecration. The costumes are also excellent and, at least to me, seem consistent with the kind of clothes and uniforms depicted in photographs of the time, a sign of a good historical consulting work. The same can be said of military equipment shown. The soundtrack, an essential part of a good epic, is one of the best that has been done by Hollywood, having the signature of Maurice Jarre.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Epic Masterpiece for All Time,"While this past weekend has seen the launch of the latest James Bond movie, Skyfall, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the first James Bond movie, this fall marks the 50th anniversary of the premiere of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, a winner of seven 1962 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.Today I went to a local Cineplex theatre to watch the 2012 50th anniversary digitally remastered version; it had to be digitally remastered to be compatible with today's projection equipment. This was exposed when they had technical difficulties starting the second half.Aside from its awards for film mastery it is unique in that there is a 15-minute intermission after a couple of hours. There are five to ten minute musical preludes to each half of the production. At 222 minutes it is only a couple of minutes longer than Gone With The Wind and the longest movie to win a Best Picture Oscar.From the time I first saw it in early 1963 at the then multi-hundred seat Carlton Theatre in Toronto (next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens) it remains in my memory as the best film production I have seen over time. The amazing Super Panavision 70 cinematography, Maurice Jarré's symphonic musical accompaniment and the overall sound established new performance standards. More surprisingly is that, even today, the script is not out-dated, with its philosophical musings, innuendos and double entendres. The plot, covering and exposing the complexities and emotions of the constantly challenged soldier is still gripping and keeps you on the edge throughout (I have now seen it five or six times over the years).The scenes of Arab tribal armies on the move are epic for their coverage of hundreds of riders thundering through each such scene. With its desert panoramas and these scenes of undisciplined herds of camel and horseback riders, it is really best seen on the large screen. It was perhaps the first movie to show the full advantage of, what was then, relatively new wide screen 70 mm film technology. The sound and music is still ringing in my ears hours later. To absorb it totally on even the best of today's home theatre systems would be a challenge .For all the video and sound technology available today, Lawrence of Arabia established a new movie theatre experience that is only mildly embellished by today's technology.Bottom line: Lawrence of Arabia remains an epic and one of the greatest films ever produced, withstanding the test of time.

Lawrence in Arabia and his demons,"It has been a pity not to have been able to see it in the big screen. When one thinks of the great epics in terms of cinematography and scenery in the history of cinema, Lawrence of Arabia must always be taken into account. The landscapes and the cinematography go together beautifully with the music, but I have to say that although the main motive in the soundtrack is very good, the majority of it is not memorable. It could have taken more inspiration from Bedouin music. The things that I would most like to underline besides the background are the acting, particularly that of Anthony Hopkins, Omar Sharif, and Alec Guinness, and the touches of poetic irony throughout many scenes of the movie (highlighting ""it was written"" and ""you will come, there is only the desert for you"").However, many subtle details amount to the uncomfortable feeling that the film falls short in fulfilling its potential. There are four main reasons why: firstly, a victim of its time, the film does not respect the people of the land it is depicting. This is seen through the inexistence of language barriers, the omission of their cultural particularities (other than the beautiful garments, horses, and tents), and the absence of a more comprehensive account of the colonial relations between Turks and Arabs. It is outrageous to depict bedouin tribesmen talking in English to each other, it destroys credibility. Secondly, TE Lawrence is an awkward main character. Through an unsettling smile, quirky remarks, and the ability of not being bothered by thirst or sunburn, the film attempts to establish this messianic figure that ought to liberate the Arab tribes, but which ultimately fails and becomes overwhelmed with the violence and the chaos of revolution. It feels like the director tried but failed to convey the tragedy in the corruption of the character, as he never succeeded to create real sympathy for him in the first place, perhaps by fault of Peter O'Toole. Thirdly, the political subplots in Arabia are too secondary, it feels like an arbitrary revolution by the oppressed Arabs against the bad Turks, supported by the despotic British. However, this episode of WW1 was much more complex, and to delve more into this network of interests instead of so much into the psychology of Aurens would have made for a more interesting movie. Finally, the time. It is just not exciting or compelling enough to carry the weight of three and a half hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A long and winding epic adventure,"At over 3 1/2 hours long, watching this film is a commitment. One that is probably worth it though, especially if you get into the nostalgic classic film mood and treat yourself to an old school ice cream intermission half way through!The story, in brief, is that of T E Lawrence - a British Army Officer who accepts a posting to Arabia during World War One. His official brief is little more that fact finding, but he has greater ambitions - to unite the Arab peoples, deploy them in the fight against the Turks, and inspire them to an independent one-nation future.Lawrence existed in real life. How accurate the story telling is is open to debate of course, and my review puts aside that matter.The two stars of the film are the landscapes, and Lawrence - played by Peter O'Toole.The cinematography makes the most of the wide open desert settings, and although I haven't had the pleasure of watching this on a cinema screen I would imagine that is where the scenery would look most impressive.The character of Lawrence, and the casting of O'Toole, is a fascinating one that works really well. It might have been tempting to put an all action, macho, Steve McQueen type character into this lead role, but they didn't - presumably to closer match the true life character. Lawrence is portrayed as a sometimes macho, sometimes effeminate, deeply complex and certainly flawed character, capable of love and hate, compassion and violence, egotism and selflessness. It adds an interesting layer into a already fine film.Some of the supporting acting is undeniably hammy, some fight scenes unconvincing, and the general pace and development of the story is somewhat disjointed. Ultimately though, the film remains a good watch and deserving of it's 'epic' categorization.Long and imperfect it might be, but highly enjoyable all the same.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The trick, William Potter, is not MINDING that it hurts.","A British soldier – the titular Lawrence - and his Arab guide Tafas have stopped at a desert well to drink. Through a mirage and the shimmering heat, we see a black speck in the distance. ""Turks?"" Lawrence wonders. Slowly, with minimal cutting, the speck resolves itself into a man on a horse who rides up, lowers his weapon and shoots dead the Arab. It is a beautiful, shocking and violent entrance and given the time it takes, a surprisingly economical one. We meet the second main character and juxtapose his character with Lawrence's. We see the stupid and brutal nature of the inter-Arab feuds and squabbles – which sets up much of what happens later – and the stupid and brutal nature of life in the desert – a desert which might be as important a character as Lawrence.But as the movie plays out, it also plays off what that scene reveals. We already have some inkling that lurking under the civilized veneer Lawrence wears something darker is lurking. We know he is something of a professional risk taker – we've seen his demise, for instance, and the way his immediate reaction to learning how to drive a camel is to put spurs to it. But there is a masochistic streak running beneath it that may explain Lawrence's actions better: his trick with putting out a match with his fingers, despite the pain. It is significant that when he gets what he wants, an assignment in the desert that he thinks will be ""fun"" (""It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun."") he blows out the match rather than snuff it with his fingers – the jump cut to the desert is not only beautiful and beautifully done, it indicates that the desert fulfills the need for pain that the lit match had poorly filled. After Lawrence leads a spectacular raid on Aqaba, he reports, ""We killed some, too many really. I'll manage it better next time."" But he also reports having to execute a man: ""There was something about it I didn't like. I enjoyed it."" In the end, Lawrence and Ali have changed places: it is Lawrence who leads and participates in the bloody massacre of Turkish troops at Tafas – now where in this review have we seen that name before? - and Ali who resists violence. But then, Prince Feisal had already previsioned what would happen with Lawrence. He tells the reporter Jackson Bentley, ""With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion. With me, it is merely good manners. You may judge which motive is the more reliable."" And Lawrence learns that the internal squabbles of the Arabs are not the greatest problem he faces. Prince Feisal had already indicated this: ""The English have a great hunger for desolate places. I fear they hunger for Arabia."" Lawrence has been aware all along that his superiors have designs on Arabia (the historical Lawrence, by the way, had known of the agreement between England and France all along, but in the movie he learns of it only after Tafas, when the push for Damascus is planned.) and his work for the Arabs is designed to make them an English client state. Lawrence has been working all along for two goals, an independent Arabia and an Arabian client state.But then, this just scratches the surface of what is going on with Lawrence's character. We see so much more: the shameless exhibitionism, the intelligence, the possible sexual orientation – one wonders if his reaction to being raped in Deraa is similar to his explanation for the match trick – his belief in his own indestructibility, his conflicted loyalties and his love for Arabia, whatever the questionable source for that love might be. The movie needs a great performance in the central role, and boy do we get that. Peter O'Toole was a little-known Irish actor, primarily on stage, before this role. He is, if a strictly hetero man may say it, magnetically gorgeous and as perhaps our mostly naturally flamboyant actor he is a natural for the part of ""A poet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior (and) also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey."" He gets the conflicts inside Lawrence and wisely never resolves them. O'Toole's performance here is perhaps the single most unfairly overlooked lead performance in AMPAS history. This man being competitive Oscarless is a crime.The movie also has perhaps the best color cinematography ever – Freddie Young gets the credit for that – and a magnificent score, from Maurice Jarre. Along side O'Toole's great performance are superb performances by Sheriff as Ali – smoldering sexuality in the love interest – the always welcome Jack Hawkins and Claude Raines as Lawrence's British handlers, Anthony Quinn as an Arab leader of questionable loyalties and clear motivation, and Jose Ferrer in a brilliant brief turn as a Turkish Bey. The only performance that too me seems off key is Alec Guinness as Feisal. Not that Guinness is not a great actor, but perhaps because for me Guinness is the most British of British actors, even when made up as an Arab or a Tantooean hermit he seems like, well, a Brit made up like an Arab or a Tantooean hermit.It is not a perfect movie. Lean's direction is overall fantastic – no one handled epics like Lean. The battle sequences are beautiful, there are images (O'Toole in flowing white robes atop a train, for instance) that are perfect and iconic. But like all epics, including Lean's, there are stretches where the pace seems to lag unnecessarily and the movie drags. The ride across the Nefud should not feel like it is in real time, no matter how gorgeously filmed. But that's a quibble. This is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
He likes your lemonade.,"Sound: Excellent orchestral score. 
100/100Narrative: Circular narrative, with heavy fictionalization of Auda abu Tiye and some of the battles; especially the battle of Aqaba. The story is still told well though. 
80/100Technical: Exquisitely shot, framed, and edited. Excellent use of montage and landscapes. 
100/100Acting/Character: All parts well done. O'Toole brings out Lawrence's eccentric behavior well. Alec Guinness' King Faisal gives us a dyed in the wool politician playing against experienced Machiavelli's 
100/100Did I like it: Yes, viewing this film on the big screen I felt like I could step out from my seat and into the scene.

"This movie shows the same thing that's happening in the Arab word now, back in 1962!","History Repeats Itself...We are the stupidest people in the entire universe.This movie shows us two things:1. How power corrupts and vanity ensures.2. How the Arab culture lends itself easily exploitable.And this is a fun movie too (it is a movie after all). There is subtle attention to detail all around, especially the expressions by the actors, you can read more from those than all the talking (just like in real life).Lawrence is a good man. A little vain, but good nonetheless. But put a person in an extreme circumstance and it changes him. Peter O'Toole's acting was too good. I could clearly feel what was going on in him. We who have lived out childhood days in a peaceful cultured society, can't cope with the brutality of war. Nowadays we have a lot of movies that show violence in graphic detail (The Revenant) to better make us understand a different world. This movie without showing the gore is able to tell us the 'why', so much more clearly. The story, editing, cinematography, everything is just that superb.I felt that this movie was at a higher level than even Shawshank Redemption. Relatively that is just a movie. And this one goes far beyond.I finished the move thinking of just one thing. We need to educate and culture our young from the smallest age to love and respect 'everyone'. No matter how different they are or how bizarre they are. Showing them the art of standing in another man's shoes.Please do watch this movie. Almost a must watch, on the levels of Life is Beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence of Arabia,"David Lean's 1962 Best Picture Academy Award winning film, Lawrence of Arabia leans on Lean's inventiveness as a filmmaker. The film clocks in at just under 4-hours and relies wholly on the concept of developing Peter O'Toole's titular character. Joining O'Toole are notable actors Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif to tell the story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who sought to go into the desert to unify the divided Arab tribes to fight the Turks in WWI. Lawrence took the burden of unification onto his shoulders voluntarily, believing he could be a great force for unity; Lean's portrayal of Lawrence's story is nothing short of an artful masterpiece.This film captured my heart from the opening scene. A backward narrative always pulls me in, and can almost guarantee that I'll be engaged through the entire film. We learn of Lawrence's fate with the opening scene, then, we are shown his life and his various unexpected accomplishments. a multi-faceted, somewhat difficult English officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who seeks to go into the desert and further the English ambition against the Turks. The only problem was, as much as Lawrence was revered for his mind, he was chastised for his tongue. Lawrence was no rank and file soldier; he often mouthed off to high command and never abandoned his own principles. Lawrence just might be crazy enough to make this work, was the consensus of the high command as they sent him to deserts of the Middle East. After overcoming a rocky start, Lawrence made friends along his travels, eventually earning the respect of Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) who holds great power in the Middle Eastern deserts. After much intricate maneuvering, Lawrence eventually brings together the divided Arab tribes against the common enemy, the Turks; all the while furthering the English position against the Turks. Lawrence is the most unlikely hero, yet his idiosyncrasies suited him perfectly for the task at hand.The absolute highlight of this magnificent film is the incredible acting prowess of Peter O'Toole. O'Toole completely mastered the piercing stare, the jaunty walk, and the effeminate mannerisms consistently noted characteristics of T.E. Lawrence. O'Toole was a master as the awkward, undaunted British officer; well worth the top spot on Premiere Magazine's list of 100 Greatest Movie Performances of All Time. This was the first role of O'Toole's I have ever seen and I can't wait to take in more of this great actor's work. This film also has some of the best cinematography I have ever seen. Shot in real life deserts, Lean spared no expense bringing the toils of Lawrence to life. The stark realism brought about by the rigorous shooting schedule and intense commitment from David Lean have entrenched Lawrence of Arabia as a classic for audiences of all ages. Another standout from this film is the incredible soundtrack. The music transforms the audience from their couch to atop a camel bringing the travels of Lawrence to a relatable level. The magic of the music and the acting and the beautiful shots come together to gift the audience with a glamorous spectacle to enjoy again and again. Do yourself a favor, and watch Lawrence of Arabia, at least once.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"simple tale of a man and his conflicts, a poetic expression amidst barbaric wars, an epic saga well told","i finally got to see it yesterday after many half starts and chances. i was just mesmerized by the epic proportions of this war movie which might have gone wrong in so many ways. but what comes out, is a beautiful piece of story well told. the beautiful shots of the great deserts, the heart churning melody that rises with every wind on the dunes, the battle scenes of epic proportions, the depiction of an Arab world and their culture ... what touched me more is the way the different phases of the central character is captured and managed. the inner conflicts and the human emotions. from a simple good for nothing soldier to the messiah like figure in the Arab kingdom to mere puppet in the hands of the politicians... this movie for me has different layers which one can appreciate. the purpose of our lives and its futility is so very well demonstrated through the rise and fall of our hero.",,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence changes personality a little too radically,"I enjoyed this movie but not as much as others.  I think the first problem with it is that Lean spent too much time showing us Lawrence's character.  What I mean is that instead of showing only the non-violent side of Lawrence he also shows us his nice and polite English man side which didn't have such a major role in the picture.  Personally, I thought Anthony Quinn and Jack Hawkins were really the ones who controlled the movie and gave that nice smooth flow.  The fighting scenes in the desert are excellent and so is the acting, directing, filming, and story.I have to say that this is an excellent movie and the reason I it enjoyed a little less than others is probably all a matter of taste.  However, I have to recommend this movie-classic to any movie lover.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It doesn't bear the humanity of either character or filmmaker...,"British Colonel, and ""shameless exhibitionist"", T.E. Lawrence, stationed in Cairo during the first World War, is sent by the military into the Arabian desert to locate a reclusive prince; living amongst the soldiers and bandits, he uses his flair for adventure to his advantage, leading an army in the war between the Arabs and the Turks. Sprawling, of course, but also imposing epic drama from director David Lean, with a nearly four-hour length that can be self-defeating. It's a film that should be seen on the big screen to get the full effect, although Lean's staggering grandeur tends to dwarf the plot, which is hardly a study of T.E. Lawrence and more a commercially-viable action picture. The performances are solid and intense, and there are many memorable sequences, but it's far more exhausting than moving. Visually it's always exciting, but we don't sense the broiling hot sun, or the winds whispering over the dunes. It's too much a tableaux. For a director like Lean to slaver over a project for so many years, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" should be a passionate document. But it doesn't ache, it doesn't bleed--it's a stunningly shaped rock, an unmovable one. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Overblown, overrated, and sincerely just a boring movie!","David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia is considered a full out classic. it is widely respected everywhere, on numerous top ten best films ever made lists, and has received four star reviews everywhere. I watched this film because a friend recommended it to me. i sat down, ready and willing to watch it because of all the praise it had received. About an hour later, i was about to fall asleep. nothing was happening at all. i do enjoy many long films (Dances With Wolves, Titanic, etc.), but the fact that this film lasts about three hours and forty minutes is asinine. Why does this film about a guy that hardly anyone has heard about have to be this long/ I know why! Because all that was on the film makers minds was "" I wonder how many Oscars I can get with this film."" The Academy loves epic, and this sure was an epic. A seriously flawed epic. First of all is the length. All of this material could have been shown in a matter of 2 and a half hours, if only the script writer had cut out unnecessary dialogue. second, is how Peter O' Toole portrayed Lawrence. Apparently this character is a man who gets a rush by killing people. but, instead of giving the viewers a portrait of why this character has this issue, it instead shows shots of as much desert land as possible. Third of all, this film did not make me leave with a sort of meaning or purpose. All I left with was questions that could have been answered if only It had a better script. now, there are some aspects of the film that saved it from being a one star. That is Alec Guiness's performance as prince Feisal. He is, as always, brilliant. The rollicking score. It left me humming the theme for days. and third is the editing. my favorite is when lawrence blows out the match and it cuts straight to the red sunrise.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""There may be honor among thieves, but there's none in politicians.""","LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is an epic adventure drama. This movie is sort of a collection of intriguing questions, which follow a man and his legend.A man is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service a reporter tries, with little success, to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him. The story then moves backward to the First World War where one British Army lieutenant is noted for his education and reverie. His generals sends him to assess the prospects of an Arabian prince in his revolt against the Turks. The lieutenant is quite intelligent and eloquent piques the prince's interest. He proposes to the prince a daring surprise attack on Aqaba. Its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. He convinces the prince to provide fifty men, led by a skeptical Sheriff. He managed to unite two warring Arab tribes and the next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish garrison. However, political interests have always been dirty ...One, to some extent, kind idea by an able-bodied man is lost in desert conflicts and political fraud. The main protagonist is beating a harsh battle with the world and himself at the same time. It is difficult to draw the line between his ambitions and his disappointments. A winning spirit has become a sadistic brake of the despair.Does war and politics destroy the man and his ideals?!The open landscapes, soundtrack, exotic and epic atmosphere bring magic with this film. A glorious adventure is based on the somewhat clumsy conflicts, in which all the beauty and brutality of a country is in contrast to the human spirit. That is a game in which one character is searching for his identity. A mystical plot, which initiates the main protagonist, is the greatest asset of this film.Peter O'Toole as T. E. Lawrence is confused and fascinating character at the same time. He is a capable, organized, brisk, disinterested and disappointed man at the end. He is a hero and a loser, a winner and a tragic, a leader and a political pawn, a believer and a sadist. A transience is the essence of this film. Mr. O'Toole has offered a magnificent performance.His support are Omar Sharif (Sherif Ali) is like a desert tiger"", who wants to learn from ""his friend"" a new philosophy of life. An incredible chemistry has developed between him and the main actor in this film. Anthony Quinn (Auda abu Tayi) is something between a rebel and mercenary. A theatrical character, who, regardless of the tradition, doing what he pleases. Alec Guinness (Prince Faisal) is a very tricky character. Jack Hawkins (General Allenby) and Claude Rains (Mr. Dryden) are the embodiment of a political obscenity.This long experience will not leave anyone indifferent. I am fascinated by this strange adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Epic , Epic , Epic And Epic","Since I've been watching an absolute ton of recent releases now is as good a time as any to take a step back and watch some old time undisputed epic cinema from the good old days . Nostalgia is never what it was but there was a time when the word ""Epic"" meant .well ""Epic"" . Nowadays epic merely means lots of CGI and anyone with a working knowledge of computer software could in effect create an epic film on their laptop . In ye days of olde if you wanted to create an epic scene then you'd have to go to the time and trouble of hiring extras and get round the logistical nightmare this involved . If it's set in an inhospitable location say a desert for example then the problem is magnified ten times . This masterpiece by David Lean is the type of movie I'm talking about and is .... EpicLean is the sort of director Britain needs in the 21st Century . The most oft complaint of modern day British productions is of an uncinematic feel better suited to television , Not so with David Lean who perhaps conscious of the way television was eating in to prospective cinema audiences countered attacked by making his films bigger in scope and scale and more beautiful to look at . There is no replicating the genuine beauty of a film unless it's watched in the correct aspect ratio on a large screen . Lean uses the language of cinema as if it were his mother tongue , Editing , cinematography and musical score are perfect but then Lean was a perfectionist . If he was unsatisfied with a shot of the Sun rising he'd get the crew out the next morning just before dawn and if that shot wasn't good enough he'd do the same routine again until he'd captured perfection . I should also repeat for the benefit of those younger film fans blasé about film making over the last couple of decades that if you wanted a shot involving hundreds of men on horseback then the only way you could achieve it was by sticking hundreds of men on horsebackThomas Edward Lawrence was a homosexual but thankfully the film at the very most just fleetingly hints at this aspect to his character . If this type of bio-pic were made now I suspect that his homosexuality would be at the fore of the story but there's certainly no need to do that . What the film does is tell the story of a deeply complex man thrust in to a situation where killing is an everyday part of life , where enemies are allies one day due to pragmatic reasons but could easily be enemies again tomorrow , and of making promises you can't keep because powers above don't want to keep promises down to once again pragmatic reasons . It is a great performance by a young , unknown , impossibly handsome Peter O' TooleThere a few factual errors but since I recently stated changing the truth is justified to an extent if it makes a better film as in the case of THE IMITATION GAME I won't contradict myself here . I should point out though that Edmund Allenby had the greatest respect for the Arabs in their guerrilla war against the Ottoman Empire and is undoubtedly the greatest British general of the 20th Century . It's also slightly strange watching a film where the Arabs are if not the good guys then perpetual victims of the Turks and later British manipulation . In some ways the portrayal of the Turks doesn't go far enough since they were responsible for the first genocide of the 20th Century against the Armenians which was a direct inspiration for the Nazis twenty years later . Perhaps the most powerful scene of the film involves the suggestion of male rape by the Turks which is every bit as chilling as it is understatedI've not done this film justice . All I have to say it made Scorsese and Spielberg want to become film makers and has been a massive influence on the modern day epic directors like Ridley Scott . Perhaps its only flaw is that it seems a little bit too old fashioned and the scenes are a bit too self congratulatory , but this is a minor flaw in a great film",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Perfect in Every Sense of the Word,"People who dislike this movie generally say one of the following things. ""It's boring""; ""It's old""; ""It's not violent enough."" Well, I have a message for those people: What movie are you watching?While I cannot deny that LOA is old, it is only boring if you're watching it in slow-motion. A 220+ running time may frighten a lot of people, but LOA apologizes for its bottom-testing quality almost immediately by displaying in that long period of time an epic that someone could actually get involved in. It does that with its cinematography (which mere words cannot describe), its striking music score, and its staggeringly good performances from every actor.And if you think it's not violent enough, maybe you should go back to watching Tarantino flicks. Violence abounds in this movie, and it is some of the best-handled in cinema history. It's a shame Peter O'Toole didn't win an Oscar for this movie, but its haul on awards night did suffice.Most of you are probably expecting this review to come from a 50-year-old art-film devotee, but I'm under 20, love movies like ""Rocky Horror,"" and have loved this one just as much or even more since I was 10 or 11 years old.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I walked on air all the way home.The greatest film of all time hardly needs more words from me, but this film should be owned and seen on a regular basis just to remind us what great cinematic movie-making is all about.Sir David Lean's effort was not wasted. This WWI history was told brilliantly and the equal of it will not likely ever be achieved. I believe this film was greater in scope and cinematography than Lean's ""Bridge on the River Kwai."" ""Lawrence of Arabia"" makes movie magic by creating an atmosphere that places the audience successfully into another world in another time.I wonder why filmmakers today do not set their standards a bit higher so they can produce decent works of art. Perhaps they know they cannot achieve such a high standard for themselves so they give up and produce nonsense that they think will sell to younger audiences.Maybe one day soon some miracle will happen to revive the mystique of the past in the movie making of today. But this could be too much to hope for in a high tech world that is only bent on making ""a fast buck.""""Lawrence of Arabia"" captures on screen for all time the beauty and mystique of the desert in a time of conflict and war in this 1989 restored version.

The essence of cinema,"One sure thing about this masterpiece it was done with great love for the subject, characters, place & the people of Arabia.David lean spent nearly 2 years in filming this picture, and the result = the greatest masterpiece in film history.The majestic landscape of the Arabian Peninsula combined with the majestic music by the genius Maurice jarred with a director vision, the combination of these three elements is a rare commodity through out the history of movie making.I believe that David Lean actually fell in love with the Arab and became another T.E. Lawrence. Practically, you can not do such marvelous work without great love and devotion.You probably saw a lot of the desert flicks, and I am sure most of them are stinkers. Because they lack a major value, respect to the natives and their way of life, I cant say that Lawrence of Arabia praised the Arabs, but he gave more than any film I can remember a wide range of characters that covers the whole human spectrum in any society, it do not have that cheap attitude towards the Arab as human beings as most of Hollywood films does.The 2 years spent in the desert played a major role in realistically studying the natural Bedouins in their natural environment and to learn their customs, manners and even their body language, this was obvious in the acting, also using real Bedouins as extras gave the film its distinguished flavor. The costumes was something I always admire in this move, the way they show the Arabic dress is dignifying, its not like those fantasy costumes that Hollywood uses frequently even in modern cinema (hidalgo for example).I think modern cinema lost its magic, although they are trying very hard not to, but they couldn't figure it out. its very simple the human factor is lost. Its not any more important like before, I can go further in saying actors became shallow, their real life is shallow and artificial and this is the human dilemma, the more technologically advanced and materially we become the less humans we became.Life is soul, and you can not pump life in a dead body.Cinema as an art form is losing its soul, I think the cinema will be revived but it needs another people that still did not lose their innocence and souls.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Over-rated testosterone extravaganza,"This is a prestigious film distinguished by a large production budget and extended investment of time.

I've tried to watch this film many, many times throughout the years and never managed to sit through to ""The End."" Peter O'Toole's performance comes off as the stereotypical, effete British colonialist, hardly an admirable character worthy of heroic accolade. One can say much, much more about the shortcomings of this film, which has been highly praised and festooned with awards.

"""Nothing is written.""","The parched vastness of the desert stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. The glorious morning sun begins to rise from beneath the earth, casting brilliant rays of searing light across the scorched landscape. In the distance, barely noticeable to the human eye, a dark speck appears. We watch, we wait. The tiny approaching figure, ever so gradually, moves tantalisingly closer, and we lean forward to discern it, the enormity of the Arabian desert instantly enveloping us, consuming us. We are there. When a character gazes up at the blazing overhead sun  an immense ball of fire in the sky  we feel it burning our skin, and we, too, yearn for that life-saving swig of water.David Lean's epic masterpiece, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' is one of those precious few films that is capable of completely absorbing the audience into its world. Just like Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterwork '2001: A Space Odyssey' of 1968, the plot of the film is not what we ultimately remember. When asked why it is such a great film, we can only recall the sheer majesty of the images that have been permanently seared into our minds  Lawrence blows out a burning match, which becomes the rising desert sun; a stranded soldier, stumbling across the sands, gazes up in horror as the first rays of morning sunlight beam across the land; a triumphant Lawrence, dressed in flowing white robes, poses at the summit of an enemy trainwreck, the sun glimmering behind him as if he is a god. Minute after minute, for the entire four-hour running time, we are simply bombarded with unforgettable images, thanks to the Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography, a stirring score from Maurice Jarre and director David Lean's epic cinematic vision.Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward ""T.E."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) died on May 19, 1935 after a horrific motorcycle accident. He was honoured with a bust in St. Paul's Cathedral for his liaison role during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18, his achievements made famous by the sensationalised newspaper writings of American journalist Lowell Thomas, who is represented in the film by the character of Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). Lawrence's funeral leaves us with several unanswered questions regarding what sort of man he really was: was he a ""poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior,"" or, as Bentley suggests after the departure of the reporter, ""the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey?""'Lawrence of Arabia,' very loosely based on Lawrence's personal memoirs, shows how, throughout his exploits in Arabia, he was a man trapped between two cultures, torn between his allegiances to Britain and its army, and to his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes, to whom he had promised freedom. He also battles to understand his own emotional reactions towards violence in war, his uncertainty beginning with the shocking satisfaction he experiences upon executing one of his companions. Early in his exploits, Lawrence embodies the qualities present in all great historical heroes: courage and determination, self-assurance and loyalty. Nearing the end of a harrowing march across the impassable Nefud Desert, though ragged from exhaustion and desperate for hydration, Lawrence turns his camel around in search of Gasim, a fellow comrade who was unknowingly left behind after succumbing to sleep and falling off his mount. However, as Lawrence's victories become many, he finds that his humility has been replaced with arrogance, and his bravery with blood-thirsty cowardice.The acting performances in this film are absolutely stunning all-round. Peter O'Toole (""The Lion in Winter"") is undeniably brilliant as T.E. Lawrence, masterfully portraying a complex character in his debut high-profile role. It is perhaps unfortunate that he came up against Gregory Peck's equally memorable role as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' at the 1963 Oscars, otherwise he most certainly would have won Best Actor. To this day, despite a total of eight nominations, O'Toole remains without a competitive Oscar, though he did receive an Academy Honorary Award in 2003 for his collective body of work.A stunning supporting cast complements O'Toole's performance, and the film simply could not have been as powerful if any of the supporting roles were anything less than perfect. Alec Guiness (""The Bridge on the River Kwai"")  who had originally wanted the role of Lawrence, but was turned down due to his age  plays Prince Feisal, the Arab leader who learns to value Lawrence's advice and assistance. Anthony Quinn (""Zorba the Greek"") portrays Auda ibu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe of Bedouin Arabs, whom Lawrence convinces to invade the city of Aqaba. Omar Sharif is brilliant as Sheriff Ali, a man who inexplicably becomes Lawrence's most loyal comrade, though he fears what his good friend has become in the face of success. Other notable performances in the film come from Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Anthony Quayle, Arthur Kennedy and José Ferrer.In terms of David Lean's vast artistic vision, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time. This is truly one of the grandest epics ever made, demanding to be witnessed only in the cinema; put quite simply, a minute television screen just does not do this film justice. This is an life-changing experience like few others, and, for 220 glorious minutes, you can almost see yourself in the desert, sitting atop a camel, trekking across the sands alongside one of the twentieth century's most fascinating historical figures.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Desert Myth: Perhaps the Finest Film ""Epic""","To understand the Middle East as it presently exists, one must understand World War I and its consequences for those who live in the region. In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T.E. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self-promotion.Lawrence authored an account of his Arabian adventures following the war. Titled THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, it has the very unusual distinction of being extremely famous before it was widely available: originally printed in a limited edition of 120 copies, it was widely praised, but it was not given a further printing until after Lawrence's death--at which point both those who served with Lawrence and historians alike noted that the work was much less accurate, much less factual than its first readers supposed. Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self-mythology, it was enough. T.E. Lawrence was enshrined in memory as Lawrence of Arabia, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s David Lean set out to make a film about him, using THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM as primary source.A great deal has been made of the film's factual inaccuracies; a great deal more has been made of the film's failure to explicitly portray Lawrence's covertly sadomasochistic personality and homo-erotic edge. But LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not a film of mere fact; we must turn to documentary for that. It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film. Factual, no; explicit, no. But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen. The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well. The cast is superb. Led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, virtually every actor involved not only brings the various historical figures to vivid life, but transmutes them into archetypes as well. David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.It is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power; even so, it fares remarkably well on the small screen, much more so than epics that rely on visual power to the exclusion of all else. There have been several releases to the home market, including a double cassette VHS and a two disk DVD with a host of extras; the single DVD release, a ""no frills"" release without significant extras, also offers a near-pristine picture and excellent sound. If you are interested in purchasing the film, make certain that you are not buying a pan-and-scan version, for these very significantly undercut the beauty of the film.Alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release. I cannot recommend it too highly.Gary Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The finest movie I have ever seen in 60 years of watching movies,"Lawrence has been the finest and most memorable film I have ever seen even edging out such classics as Gone with the Wind, Gandhi,Raging Bull, Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves. Firstly-in my opinion David Lean was the greatest film director of all time. He had a superb true story,fantastic locations,a great cameraman, a totally mesmerising score and a PERFECT cast. The movie had everything except humour which was not suitable. I shed more tears in THIS movie than almost any other at the way Lawrence was used and abused(literally in one episode)for the interests? of the British and French but certainly not for the Arabs and the future of the Middle East. There were more individual memorable and moving scenes in Lawrence than I can remember in any other. The one where Daud died in a quicksand was truly heartbreaking.I have seen Lawrence four times and I would watch it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
another popular movie which has little historical accuracy,"I do not how to start writing a comment on this movie.""Lawrence of Arabia"" is today regarded as a masterpiece of world cinema and it has been consistently on the top 250. I'm not questioning the value of top 250 anymore just because it does not really reflect the total gusto of all the cinephiles. But I wonder whether 70-mm widescreen, color cinematography, epic war scenes or heroism are enough to make a movie acclaimed. The first thing I'm looking for in a movie is ""historical accuracy"".Since the movie takes its name from the leading character Lawrence let me ask you a question to those who casted a top-ten vote for this movie?Do you really know how Lawrence looked like?Six foot two inch Peter O'Toole differed strikingly with the real Lawrence, who was almost nine inches shorter.Lawrence was not a gung-ho drama queen who lead a nation to freedom.Most scenes such as the attack on Aqaba were heavily fictionalized from the writings of Lawrence.You can easily question how much he is reliable.Lawrence mentions in his Seven Pillars of Wisdom that he was raped by the Turkish Bey which was called into question by the historians.(Check out the article : Lawrence of Arabia 'made up' sex attack by Turk troops By Elizabeth Day) Not only most scenes are heavily fictionalized but some characters are a bunch of fiction too like Sheriff Ali,Mr. Dryden and Colonel Brighton. The movie neither tells you anything from the Turkish point point of view nor does it tell anything about the real Arab points. Yes it's a well-know truth that the Arabs were tricked into fighting against the Turks by the British and they have been paying the price by being belittled by the westerners for centuries.But the movie shows us only a bunch of Bedouin tribes which are desert dwelling nomadic people. Not every Arab is (and was)a Bedouin.Plus when I see ""Language: English / Arabic / Turkish"" tag on IMDb I can't help laughing.It's fact that Westerners have always imposed their language on the nations they dominated. Arabs started to speak English then just like some African nations started to speak French. Yes they have been living under the Turkish rule and they have not been speaking Turkish. That's the truth but how on earth from a ten year old kid to pariahs everybody speaks English.Let alone that the actors who play the Turkish soldiers do not even look like a Turk they do not even speak a word of Turkish. The only Turkish word you hear is ""su""(water)which is spoken by a wounded villager on the hospital in Damascus. The historians say that the real Lawrence actually shunned the limelight, as evidenced by his attempts after the war to hide under various assumed names but the British officers certainly did not the find the attack outrageous since the Great(!) British Empire can finally be positioned at a table with the French to take care of the rest of the Turkish empire.And according to Wikipedia the film's portrayal of General Allenby as a cynical, manipulative superior to Lawrence is not entirely accurate either. Allenby and Lawrence respected and liked each other, and Lawrence once said of Allenby that he was ""an admiration of mine""... There are people who claim that such fictionalization was necessary to dramatize the great Lawrence character but I say ""watch out! The devil lurks in the little details""",,Anonymous,Biography
Moving cinematography and great score.,"Also an interesting story based somewhat on a true one. But way way waay too long. Also, all Arabs talking perfect english? Even preferring talking English to each other? I know this is a classic and an achievement in movie making history and I can see why. But I had a really hard time staying awake watching this. Main character acts way too naiv for me also. You can't be a saint and a warlord at the same time, you just can't. I really wonder what the real T E Lawrence was like, beacuse if he really was like this, he was a very confused person. But still, it is a strong story. And the desert is vast, beautiful and mysterious, really captured well here, the desert is the real main character to me. But other then that, as a whole, this movie just doesn't work for me, for some reason it really starts to bore me only half way in and main characters really starts to become annoying. Maybe I'm missing something and don't get this movie. I don't know...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence of Arabia,It was too long especially in desert scenes but an excellent movie,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Peter O'Toole should have won an Oscar,"With only a few television credits and bit parts in Hollywood, Peter O'Toole made his breakthrough performance in Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that everyone remembers a scene from even if they haven't seen the four-hour epic all the way through. Between the famous theme from Maurice Jarre, the iconic rooftop silhouette, ""No prisoners!"", the appetizing order of lemonade, Omar Sharif's entrance, Peter O'Toole's beautiful blue eyes sparkling in the middle of the desert, and the hundreds of fight scenes, there are plenty of memorable moments to choose from when you relive the movie as you talk about it with your friends.In case you don't know, David Lean's sprawling, dazzling epic is about T.E. Lawrence's time fighting in the Arabian Peninsula. This is much more than just another WWI movie. Peter O'Toole is not a gung-ho commanding officer who joyfully leads his men into battle. He's incredibly conflicted and disgusted by war. To him, a dead soldier is not a statistic, it's a man. During the famous ""No prisoners!"" scene, in which he only utters those two words, his face shows an incredible array of emotions. If you watch that scene and don't simultaneously think he was robbed of his Oscar and fall in love with him, well, watch it again. Guys, feel free to develop a man-crush; no one will blame you. After all, Noel Coward famously quoted, ""If *he* had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia.""Unfortunately for Peter O'Toole, this incredible epic was released during the same year as To Kill a Mockingbird, and no one else stood a chance come Oscar time. He was in pretty good company, though, since Burt Lancaster and Jack Lemmon also lost out that year after giving excellent performances in Birdman of Alcatraz and Days of Wine and Roses, respectively. The good news is Lawrence of Arabia did win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography, among others.This a great compromise movie for date night, if you don't mind a four-hour running time. Ladies will get to drool over the ridiculously handsome Peter O'Toole-as Robin Williams said in Aladdin, ""Pick a feature!""-and gents will get lost in the endless fighting and strategy scenes with nary a woman in sight. This is definitely a man's movie, and if it weren't for the perfect piece of eye candy, no woman in her right mind would probably watch it. If you're considering renting it, check out the preview. Usually, old movies were chopped into terrible previews, but this one is pretty good. It gives a pretty good representation of the film and shows off the supporting cast, including Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, and Claude Rains.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The most over-hyped, overrated film of its generation","This is the film where David Lean's megalomania and pretentiousness, already evident in The Bridge on the River Kwai (a film that is just this side of bearable), spilled over into an overweening arrogance and smugness, and an unjustified belief that he can do no wrong, however absurd the casting, the story and the photography. Lean knew nothing of the Middle East and understood less. The film presents a completely false picture of it: glossy, saccharine and indeed patronising (and thus, borderline racist). The historical context is tendentious, biased and false: the centuries-old story of the Jews rebuilding their own country is barely given a supercilious nod. However great an actor Alec Guiness is, casting him as Feisal is just plain silly. Were there no actors of Middle Eastern background and appearance? He looks like an uncomfortable transplant from the East End of Charles Dickens, an Irish or Scottish princeling who took the wrong train at Holborn underground station. The notion that 'this is the best British film of all time' is as absurd as the film itself: glitziness does not equal quality. Even Lean made better films by far (for example, Great Expectations), and The Third Man is miles better, too. These films are cinematic: they understand the medium and utilise it properly. Lawrence tries to get by on sheer bombast, and fails miserably as it must.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
History brilliantly set in desert-sweeping motion,"David Lean's famously epic rumination of the titular character is a relentlessly long desert saga, but it has a destination: illustrate the hypocrisy of war and the madness of pre-world war I colonialism. It is also one of the best films I have ever seen, with a lead actor's performance that is simply ten times better than anyone else's in film history. Although the success of Lawrence rests squarely on the shoulders of the eccentric Peter O'Toole as the flamboyant British officer, the manageable script by Robert Bolt, the sweeping cinematography of the desert-laden plains by Freddie Young and the swarmingly epic score by Maruice Jarre all firmly elevate the film to classic status.Based on T.E. Lawrence's rambling, puzzling memoirs in ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" David Lean translates the man's epic journeys in Saudi Arabia to something equally mystical in the film. Lawrence of Arabia tells the story of English officer (O'Toole) who helps the divided Arab tribes to unite against the Ottoman Empire in the Great War. With his hit-and-run, guerilla-warfare tactics, military triumphs unfold in the desert-swept, dramatic landscape that no one thought possible. Through a series of audacious victories, Lawrence earns the trust, respect, and loyalty of the Arab peoples and becomes something of a hero to the world, even though it nearly drove him mad in the process, torn and conflicted between he loyalty of England and that of the ""quaint, barbaric"" Arabs. Why he wanted any of this the movie leaves up in the air.Much like the story, Peter O'Toole lets his character Lawrence unfold in mystical ways, heightening the enigma that is the officer-turned-major. He is emotionally transparent in his performance when it calls for it, such as at the height of battle or broken-down in a Turkish prison camp, but there is a perpetual impenetrable air about him that is so endlessly refreshing and interesting to behold. ""I'm different,"" he proclaims to the stiffy bureaucratic military in Cairo and shows us a man who sings, jests, philosophizes and befriends unlikely subjects in the vast desert. When given new white billowing robes by his friend Sheriff (Omar Sharif), he twirls and admires his appearance. In this way, Lawrence is both suggestive and flamboyant, fit with a plummy English accent, hinting at homosexuality, and indeed his presence is almost incongruous to the barren, plain setting. Suffice to say that O'Toole shamelessly swallows every scene he is in and aptly captures the many ever-shifting shades of Lawrence.The desert-strewn pictorial style is a definite strong suit for 'Lawrence of Arabia' as it provides juxtaposition (O'Toole's piercing blue eyes against the sandy infinity), visual stimuli and living illustrations of the vast harshness of a far-stretched Arabic desert. The first sight of Omar Sharif, initially a mere dot on the horizon, is perhaps the most striking sequence in this epic travelogue  but in all fairness these visual gems are delivered by the bucketload by cinematographer Freddie Young. There is no fancy-schmancy CGI or effects; if you want to shoot a desert sunrise you get up early and wait until it emerges. The result is unbelievably raw and sliced down to the bare essentialsdesert, desert, desert. Even the dialogue is comparatively sparse, and epic battles are only interjected when it calls for it. Its biggest accolade, as far as I am concerned, is the absence of extra-template romances or personal intrigue. That is something you do not see in films today, and I am endlessly thankful that there are no gratuitous swooning women in it.In spite of the absence of epic romances, Lawrence of Arabia is romantically poetic enough on its own. David Leans opens with 5 minutes of all score, and no visual images. Now, I have heard a lot of good scores in my days, but Maruice Jarre's hauntingly recognizable desert tunes are simply incredible. This musical component speaks volumes on the epic scale and is brilliantly scored to scenes such as the iconic 'match melting into a desert sunrise' sequence. Some would perhaps argue that the film is mostly cinematography, music and acting, but I say it touches on some highly then-salient issues, giving a curt nod to the Lawrence enigma but truly breathing life into his character and intertwining some imperial politics in the process. When Lawrence returns sweaty and dressed in rags from gruesome desert fighting and having lost men in the swallowing heat, the posh officers in the Cairo headquarters inform him on the news: ""We've built a squash court."" ""Jolly good."" Brilliant, and satirical.I could give more rambling, semi-coherent and fawning praise for 'Lawrence of Arabia', but I think I will stop here. It is certainly an experience, visually, sensory and musically and the fearsomely intense radiance of Peter O'Toole gets it far alone.10 out of 10 (I don't just throw this grade out)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A very great film, excellent as both a character study and in historical insights","There have been some intelligent comments made on this - and the most I can do is to show why this is my favourite film. Not having been born when it was made, I have only once had the privilege of seeing it on the big screen - when the restored version went on limited release around the country.As a boy, I undoubtedly appreciated it on the level I appreciated other films about adventure and war. As I have watched it again, I have appreciated and marvelled at the film-making techniques and tricks others have drawn attention to - for example, the lighting of a match in an office leading into action in the desert heat.However, it is now as a character and historical study I most appreciate it. Reviewers have sometimes complained that the film really helps us understand nothing about Lawrence's motivations and that the desert atmosphere and action are what is paramount. However, that is precisely the point - the T.E. Lawrence of the film does not understand himself. After his early victories and his working of the 'miracle' he was told was needed he sees himself as a prophet, someone for whom 'nothing is written', someone like Moses who is 'beloved of God'. His insecurity about his identity is, however, reflected in his conversation with Ali about being born out of wedlock. And towards the end of the film, after his torture and also after his discussions with Allenby, he has changed from someone for whom mercy is 'a passion' into someone guilty of a massacre of Turks and then contemptuous of the responsibility to care medically for Turkish prisoners. He has assumed some of the barbarism the British, French and Americans have accused the Arabs of - and yet there have been his statements about how his white skin have meant Arab robes could not hide the fact he was not a true Arab! He is indeed a man who does not understand himself - who cannot settle comfortably into the role of either prophetic uniter and deliverer of the Arabs or else the ordinary soldier he sometimes aspires to be.In terms of history, I find the film interesting in reflecting the divisions between different Arab peoples. Although no expert on Middle East affairs, I wonder if that is a lesson Westerners have failed to learn about the Arab world. And I am also intrigued by the light it casts on colonial interests during World War One - on how, for example, Lawrence was also at the mercy of the politicians. And again, I suspect those are factors whose bearing remains to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A monumental film,"This masterpiece could likely never be produced today, and the reasons for this go far beyond regional Mideast politics. What studio would enable any director, no matter how talented (and David Lean certainly was) and in possession of any equally brilliant script, the liberty to present a story so matter-of-fact in its portrayal of Britain's accomplishments in the colonial era? Oh, the wave of Leftist angst that would ensue! Yet, in this film David Lean manages to weave an enchanting and historically accurate tale of adventure and struggle, of crisis and achievement, of triumph and tragedy that both informs and uplifts, without modern-day remorse over matters of race, creed or color. The story couldn't be more gripping, the acting more talented, the scenery more breathtaking. This is perhaps the finest war adventure story ever filmed, and will reward any number of repeat viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Comments about Lawrence of Arabia.,"This movie had the same effect on me as it did on George Lucas. I couldn't stop watching it. How David Lean developed the characters in the story is part of what makes the movie great. The scenes are seamless. A documentary about David Lean's life portrayed him as a perfectionist. I am glad of that. This great movie could not have been made by any other type of person. Peter O'Tool playing the lead role was probably a double edged sword,it was his first and greatest role. Where does anyone go from the top? The ""chemistry"" between actor Alec Guiness and Sir David Lean was just as powerful as it was between Humphrey Bogart and John Huston. Everything in this movie works. Lawrence of Arabia received seven Academy Awards. It deserved more.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best film ever?,"I think Lawrence of Arabia can be not summed up, but described in one scene. A British officer, T.E. Lawrence is in Cairo, and has just been re-assigned to the Arab Biro. As he lights his friend's cigarette, he then takes the match, holding it up in front of his face, watches as it slowly burns. He then softly blows the flame out, as we cut to a dark orange horizon on a desert plain. We are first stunned by the vastness of the deep horizon. As we watch, the faintest hint of yellow sun is seen coming over what seems the edge of the world. As the masterful score quietly begins to play, the sun slowly works it's way into the world's view. As the music reaches a climax, we cut to what seems the most beautiful shot of desert land space that we could possibly imagine. Through the massive dunes and thunderous mountains, we see two riders appear in a valley of sand. And so thus begins the greatest epic of all time.After watching Lawrence of Arabia, it becomes impossible to call any other film epic. Even the modern classics such as the Lord of the Rings are no where near the shear size and scope of David Lean's masterpiece. If only every movies were this well made. The 5 month shoot that was planned spanned into a 2 year marathon of film making brilliance. In current Hollywood, if we are to be shown a massive epic army, we are given 2000 CGI soldiers on a totally made up landscape. This is not the way David Lean saw the way films are made. In Lawrence of Arabia, we a blessed with armies and extras upon the thousands, each one with a costume, makeup, most of the time horses or camels and most importantly, a character to embody.There are few words to describe Peter O'Toole as Lawrence and one of them may be ""best performance ever?"". Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and the legendary Alec Guinness, all give spell binding performances in this already massive master work. David Lean's vision is beyond epic. There is no word to describe it. There are very few films that truly stunning cinematography, with this being the very best. No film has as beautiful and stunning visuals as Lawrence. Lean's capture of the heat and vastness of the desert is simply unbelievable.This film is beyond amazing and truly something that is beyond a miracle. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 1962 and winner of 7, this is one classic that will never die. Lawrence will always be a legend.""Nothing is Written""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest epic ever made,"With Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean proved beyond doubt his complete mastery of filmmaking. This is the most visually impressive and beautifully made film I have ever seen. Made on an enormous scale and meticulously directed, it dwarfs other epics and succeeds in providing a clear insight into all of the main characters which is where many epics have failed in the past where the spectacle dominates and characterisation is forgotten.It is obvious when watching this film that every single scene has been thoroughly worked out and slaved over until it has been perfected. Stanley Kubrick's films often give the same impression but Lean has managed to avoid forgetting about and ultimately dehumanising the story and characters which was Kubrick's greatest failing.Lean's task is helped considerably by the cast. In a film of this scale there is often a temptation to fill it with movie stars in order to help recoup the vast budget. Thankfully the original intention of casting Marlon Brando as T.E Lawrence and Horst Buchholz or Alain Delon as Sherif Ali was soon dismissed and the then unknown Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif were chosen, both of whom were perfect for their roles.It is hard to believe that another unknown actor, Albert Finney, actually turned down the part of Lawrence, the role of a lifetime, before it was offered to O'Toole.As great an actor as Finney undoubtedly is and despite giving a superb screen test over four days, I simply can not see him capturing the eccentricities and mystique of the enigmatic Lawrence. Finney is also too powerfully built to look a misfit in the British Army in the way the softly spoken, painfully thin O'Toole did.O'Toole has the ideal appearance for Lawrence who indeed looks and acts like a clown as one officer pointed out to him whilst performing his initial role with the army in Cairo. However once he is in the desert and has found a cause he believes in, he becomes an astonishingly beautiful figure in his elegant white robes and is a million miles away from the suffocating stiffness of the British Army.Omar Sharif as Ali provides an exotic Arabian companion to Lawrence, the two of them educating each other in the ways and customs of their respective countries. The contrast between them is emphasised by Sharif's dark hair and brown eyes and by O'Toole's blonde hair and staggeringly blue eyes.Arthur Kennedy is excellent as the cynical and often bedraggled Jackson Bentley; the journalist based on Lowell Thomas, who makes Lawrence famous around the world.Anthony Quinn is ideally cast as Auda abu Tayi, the boisterous leader of an Arab faction whose hatred of Ali's tribe is likely to explode at any moment.If there are weaknesses in the cast they will probably be found in the performances by Anthony Quayle who is slightly wooden as the compassionate Colonel Brighton and surprisingly Alec Guinness, miscast as Prince Feisal, whose make-up looks unconvincing when standing near Omar Sharif.What makes the story particularly interesting is that there is no undoubted hero but several villains. No major character comes through this film free of blame or criticism.Lawrence is indeed the shameless exhibitionist' as Jackson Bentley stated after his funeral whose arrogance leads directly to his brutal torture and sexual abuse at the hands of the Turks. Sherif Ali often seems to have more compassion for the Turks than for his fellow Arabs. Auda's interests in the Arab revolt are primarily fuelled by greed.The British Army and its subjects, perfectly portrayed by Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains are deceitful, manipulative liars looking to exploit Lawrence's achievements in Arabia. Prince Feisal is cruel in his condemnation of Lawrence at the end.The Arabs themselves are incapable of resolving their tribal differences in order to unite and gain their freedom. The Turks are brutal, bloodthirsty savages who slaughter and rape their innocent and defenceless victims.Despite the fascinating politics and excellent characterisation there are some clear weaknesses in the story. The scenes with the British Army in Cairo are poorly written particularly Lawrence's scene in the nasty, dark little room' and Lawrence's return to Headquarters after the victory in Aqaba. The scene depicting Lawrence wandering around, lost in thought as he searches for the miracle Feisal desperately needs is a tacky piece of Hollywood melodrama that is untypical of Lean.However, these occasional shortcomings are completely overshadowed by the unforgettable images that make this film stand out head and shoulders above any other.Everyone remembers Ali's entrance, appearing as a mysterious, tiny spot on the horizon but the two finest scenes in the film belong to Lawrence.The rescue of Gasim is an amazing piece of editing as the loyal Daud waits for Lawrence to return. The soundtrack is wonderful as Daud approaches the distant figure he hopes is Lawrence, the music changing with each cut to compliment the action, culminating in the spectacular shot of their two camels meeting and crossing, the only figures in a vast desert.The most remarkable scene perfectly sums up the story of Lawrence and the unsolvable mystery that surrounds him. O'Toole striding triumphantly along the top of a recently derailed train, the adoring Arabs following his shadow as El Aurens' jumps onto the next carriage and blocks out the sun creating a dramatic silhouette of an untouchable God-like figure.",,Anonymous,Biography

Too Long,"I recently watched this film hoping to see a great classic.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations.Firstly, I thought the film was far too long, and could have very easily been cut down to make a shorter, more entertaining film.  The beginning was good, but by the half way point I couldn't wait for it to end.  It's not just that I don't like long films (many of my favourite films are more than three hours), but I thought that the same story could have been compressed to a much shorter length without losing anything important.Secondly, although the acting was good, I didn't think that the main character, Lawrence, was anything of a hero.  In my opinion, he seemed sadistic and insane (especially by the end), and for this reason I felt it hard to enjoy the film.Thirdly, the fact that the film opens with death of Lawrence, I think hangs over you while you're watching it.  In my opinion, this scene was unnecessary, and the way he dies seems unfit for the hero he's made out to be.I didn't enjoy this film nearly as much as I thought I would, and although there are some good parts so it (like the amazing setting, good acting and the first half), it was far too long and boring and I didn't like the story or the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Excellent Effort on Many Levels,"I won't try to compete with the superlatives of others and am less certain that this movie was the best flick of the 1960s. In that decade, American ""culture"" enjoyed a true renaissance, and our films were as much a reflection of it as was our music, our literature, and our science. As many good movies were made in a single year back then as have been made ever since, which is perhaps why Peter O'Toole didn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor --he had too much competition (Gregory Peck won it for ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). Obviously, however, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was one of the best movies of its time and one of the best movies ever made. To me, the real star of the movie was the Arabian Desert (although technically, it was filmed in Morrocco and Jordan). There was dramatic and arresting physical beauty in its sense of limitless space and its bleak, wind-whipped desolation. The dunes with their swirling sands, the dramatic barren mountains, and the isolated ridges far off in the distance yet easily visible all contributed to a dreamlike world. Perhaps even more important, and certainly more relevant to the theme, was the spiritual element inseparable from the vast emptiness of the broiling desert wilderness. The gorgeous and highly effective landscape photography firmly established the setting early in the film. Not unexpectedly, it was Lawrence's determination to leave the desert that signaled his eventual demise. His return ""home"" to England and the shallow, conventional life it offered led to the motorcycle accident that ultimately killed him. It seems he had ceased to follow his heart, perhaps because his experiences in Arabia, which had inspired him to greatness, had at the same time transformed him into someone he no longer believed in, understood, or felt he could keep living up to. By war's end, therefore, he seemed to have outlived his usefulness, if not so much to his Arab friends (who apparently worshiped him), than in his own mind.The outstanding performances by Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn (and even Alec Guiness) threatened to upstage O'Toole's Lawrence, but he held his own and made the movie his. As such, it was probably the defining role of his career. It wasn't long, however, before Omar Sharif starred in ""Dr. Zhivago"" and Anthony Quinn in ""Zorba the Greek,"" no doubt these opportunities arising from their significant part in the making of ""Lawrence of Arabia."" After watching this movie again, I had a new sense of the Arab's plight, yet had to remind myself not to get carried away. The film was set during WWI, long before Israel became a country, and in that day, the Arabs were the oppressed people fighting for their independence from the Ottoman Empire, a civilization which at the time was well ahead of their own tribal existence and encroaching upon their seemingly cold and detached wilderness ethic. Much has changed since then.By the way, many years ago I had the opportunity to get a good look at a beautifully restored ""Bruff"" motorcycle (actually spelled b,r,o,u,g,h). That was the type that Lawrence owned and on which he had his fatal accident, shown in the opening sequence of the film. It looked to be all engine, with a surprising amount of horsepower for motorcycles of that era, which is why it was the fastest racing bike of its time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The sand is like gold dust carried on the wind,"I just watched this film today on DVD. It's one of my favorites and I'm just amazed every time I watch it. God, what a beautiful film . . . Although, I have to say, I wasn't crazy about it at first. I came to appreciate it more after watching it two or three times. I know epic films aren't for everyone, but I keep returning to this one time and again. The way the film is shot and edited is breathtaking. The acting is top notch and played to the hilt. What I find most fascinating about this film is the metamorphosis of T.E. Lawrence in the process. He's a man who rises to become a legend who is then repeatedly reminded that he is just a man. How does one face this? It's an interesting journey (and worth watching 100 times!).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Classic, Epic Fillmmaking","I have finally sat down to watch the entirety of Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean's 1962 classic film.Watching this film, it is easy to see how today's epic films (from Braveheart to Lord of the Rings) owes so much to David Lean's brand of storytelling. This film is a lesson in how to make an epic film. He sets the standard and shows us how it's done.The cinematography in LoA is absolutely stunning. Shot setups are superb, and the beauty of the photography belies the fact that desert shootings represent some of the worst possible lighting conditions. And Lean really uses the scenery, the desert setting is really a character in the film. Shot choices in this film have been used in other desert films ever since, you cannot help but say ""Oh, they copied this shot for Hidalgo"" as you watch this film.The action sequences are also superbly shot and exciting. Again, David Lean sets the standard for such sequences, and without all the high-tech gadgetry available today. The cavalry charge on Aqaba show real mastery on the part of the wranglers and stunt coordinators, as does the train attack. This action seems ""toned down"" by today's standards, but is perfect for this film: it is exciting to watch but does not distract the viewer from the story or the key characters.For it's not all about the epic, it's really all about the characters (in this case, Peter O'Toole's T.E. Lawrence). Lean doesn't forget this film is about this character, and does a great job keeping that focus, and not getting lost in the vastness of the scenery. Clearly this is O'Toole's movie, he does a great job portraying the transformation from slightly arrogant but thought-provoking lieutenant to the fractured war hero known as Lawrence of Arabia. This is O'Toole's first major work, yet it seems he was built for the role. He does it brilliantly. Clearly he had something to prove, and prove it he did.I only have mild criticism for this film. First of all, Alec Guinness as Arab Prince Faisal was really bad casting. Sir Guinness is one of the greatest actors of all time, but I found his performance here distracting, not embellishing. It's not one of his better performances, he seems to try to hard to be Arab, but can't hold it together.I also found the musical cues out of place at certain times. Maurice Jarr's score is striking, and did set the tone for all desert pictures since, but not all the cues work well. Sometimes the music is overdone for no reason, and other scenes call for music where there is none. Film scores have advanced since that time, and credit should be given to a pioneer in the epic score, but it was still distracting at times.Otherwise, this is a top-notch film, and a must-see for fans of epic film-making.9 out of 10 Barky",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
If only they made movies like this now,"From the ill-fated beginning, through the singly unique cinematography that even now, forty seven years after its production, would still send film makers into fits for its technical demands, the superb acting and exquisite story line, this movie still holds my rapt attention. Having read enough on T.E. Lawrence's life and his own works, this movie still provides the viewer with an in-depth look into the complex life of a man that literally changed world society. How would the Middle East be now if this man hadn't fulfilled his destiny? I dare anyone of Hollywood's greatest to make a movie like this without cg graphics now. And Peter O'Toole?

"""Florence of Arabia""","My reaction after seeing this desert epic is one of conflicted perception. We have a grandiose visual story that is written for a man who leads men into the untried and untrue. Most cast were standouts and need no further immortalizing here. I enjoyed their clear approach to their characters. But while T.E. Lawrence was certainly not Moses, as was adeptly noted by his detractors, the role certainly was one of a leader, a defiant one, but still one whom men would follow into battle. How it was cast with Peter O'Toole, and effeminate English boy trying to be noble beyond country affiliation, seems to be a contradiction of that absolute requirement. I wouldn't follow him into a bar, no less the dessert. Who does he serve? Petulance, adventure, intuition and self-righteousness. A well-spoken scholar with ideas outside of the box makes for a great strategist, not a war general. Politics are also in the same realm of books read by Lawrence, yet he was so overcome with himself that the subject of oil could not be breached? Who could be so naive to think the English would leave Arabia to the Arabs once they had it in their hands. I watched the film as a boyish fantasy, and enjoyed it as the mis-cast adventures of T.E. Lawrence",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An epic masterpiece and portrait of a great man.,"Without serious qualms as one of the greatest stories ever brought to film, Lawrence of Arabia shine bright and long throughout as the portrait of one of Britain's finest heroes and of a man who attempted the impossible and nearly accomplished it. More than just a fascinating story though, it is also one of the most well-made films with breathtaking cinematography in virtually every scene and flawless acting that more than carries the weight of the film. The heavyweights are of course Peter O'Toole as the title character, who perfectly captures the feeling of isolation and detachment Lawrence felt from his own people (English) and those he tried to help (Arabs), as well as Omar Sharif as Lawrence's ally Sheriff Ali, Alec Guiness as the determined Prince Feisal and Jack Hawkins as the loyal yet sly General Allenby.Perhaps the real heroes of this film, though are those working behind the camera, particularly screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson who cover lots of territory yet conceal it into a very cohesive script with some excellent scenes of dialog. And, of course, director David Lean shows his true talent at telling epic tales by flawlessly directing and keeping pace so that the film is long but never boring. If you love or even like movies, this one is a must-see. Long considered one of the finest films ever made, you will not be disappointed by any of it. Rather, it will leave you breathless, amazed, and dazed at the wonder of the desert and the history that took place in it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Distorted history,"Yes, the movie never mentions why British military is on the Ottoman lands in desert and trying to start a rebellion with Arabs? What is the British doing there? Lawrence is so called a hero and Turks who reside there to govern for about 500 years are colony? Turks are shown as rapier and savage but note that Turks were living there for about 500 years, governing the region just like their lands in Balkan and Europe. Arabs kept their culture and language pretty well during Turkish governance. Please also note that since Turks have left the region the blood never ends in Middle East thanks(!) to capitalist powers. Turks were mainly spending what they earn from the related land and were also paying expenses on top for these far region. Arabs killed 100k Turkish soldiers there and for me it is a cursed region with blood. I advise people to check the Turkish history first before watching this movie otherwise yeah British are peace bringing where Turks are barbarian.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I hate to challenge people, but...","OK, so everyone knows that T.E. Lawrence was a most impressive guy who was sent to colonize the Middle East and in the process began to identify with the people there. In the title role here, Peter O'Toole certainly does a really good job. The question is how accurate the movie is. Specifically, I mean the scene where Lawrence attacks the train and the Arabs cheer him on; I get the feeling that it didn't really happen like that, given that Lawrence was sent as a colonizer. And one has to wonder why Lawrence is always wearing white while everyone else wears black.Oh well. Other than all that, it's a pretty impressive film. One weird thing is that it has pretty much an all-male cast (actually, that's not surprising given that it's dealing with war). O'Toole, along with Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, and the rest all do a great job. I don't think that anyone can argue with ""Lawrence of Arabia""'s status as an epic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Freedom from the shackles of ""civilization""","David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia may be well over 50 years old now, but it stands the test of time like all truly great works.The movie details T.E. Lawrence's experiences as a British liaison who inspires the Arab revolt against Turkish rule during World War 1 (1916-1918).At 3 hours and 47 minutes this is a LONG movie but somehow strangely hypnotic. The awesome music plays a huge part in this effect.If you're weary of the moronic approach of too many modern films (too much CGI and roll-your-eyes action, etc.) Lawrence of Arabia is the perfect antidote.It's mainly the story of a European man who sheds his stuffy ""civilized"" upbringing to revel in a new-found freedom in the desert wilderness as he integrates with the Arabs and basks in their glowing acceptance. He accomplishes this by, first, disregarding his superior's orders and honestly relating to the Arabs and, second, by proving himself unbiased to any specific tribe and willing to risk everything in helping them to defeat the Turks.Those spoiled by modern blockbusters won't likely appreciate ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but those who have an eye for artistic cinema will revel in it.GRADE: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Masterpiece and still a masterpiece to this day,"Lawrence of Arabia is a historical drama film documenting the adventures of T.E. Lawrence fighting the Turks in the Arab Revolt during the First World War during 1916-1918 directed by David Lean. The film was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 7 of them at the 35th Academy Awards in 1963, which were the Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Art Direction.The David Lean film is wonderfully and beautifully put together and edited with an outstanding image and picture (NOTE: the film was restored in 1988 and 2012), I was also stunned that the movie instead of having a typical 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio which is mostly seen these days, it had an aspect ratio of 2.20 : 1 as the film's format was originally 70mm, in addition it gave the film a more cinematic feel and made the image of the film a much more panoramic look which I loved. Not only in my opinion was the film fantastically edited and put together but the soundtrack and original score of the film was outstanding and completely matches with the film.T.E. Lawrence is played by Peter O'Toole who delivers an outstanding and seamless performance through the entire 3 hours and 45 minutes of the film, other characters of the film including Prince Faisal who was played by Alec Guinness who also delivers an outstanding performance throughout the film.Although the film included some fictional characters including the Turkish officers who T.E Lawrence, the movie wonderfully documented the adventures of T.E. Lawrence In Arabia and bringing the Arab Tribes together despite the current differences and conflicts they had against each other and then fighting together against the Turks to capture parts of Arabia including Aqaba and Damascus.Overall, even though this film is surprisingly and overwhelmingly long, this film is nonetheless a masterpiece and considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and in my opinion one of the best classic films ever made, and honestly whoever rates this film lower than 9/10 should go see a doctor as this film is nearly perfect in every single aspect from editing to the story. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must go watch it, it truly is one of the greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,"Sam Spiegel who began his career as 'Sam P Eagle' reverted to his birth name and produced some of the greatest films of the 50's: The African Queen, The Wild One, Bridge On The River Kwai and Suddenly Last Summer. Spiegel's greatest triumph would come with this film in a new decade the 1960's. Columbia Pictures gave Spiegel's great discretion as he worked from London under his Horizon Film's banner. Stars like Brando, Hepburn, Bogart, Taylor, Clift, were in Speigel's films. Taking the story of T E Lawrence, Sam Spiegel once again joined forces with His great collaborator on The Bridge on River Kawi David Lean and together they made in my assessment the finest film of all time ""Lawrence Of Arabia"".Casting Peter O Toole after Marlon Brando declined the role, Lean and Spiegel created a worldwide star and to me O'Toole's Lawrence is the finest performance I have ever seen from an male star. (Gloria Swanson's Sunset Blvd gets my vote as best femme performance). O Toole while nominated lost the Oscar to Gregory Peck. (Jack Lemmon's searing Days of Wine And Roses was also nominated)Maurice Jarre created a memorable score, one of the best if not best ever. David Lean assembled a cast of Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn and in a star making performance, Omar Sharif.One cannot praise this film enough, including the magical photography in the desert, and the performance of a lifetime from Peter O Toole.I consider this the finest film I have ever seenWilliwaw",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not Really an Epic !!!,"First the plus points :-1- David Lean's superb direction is a masterpiece for other directors to learn and copy. 2- The screenplay/cinematography is excellently penetrating and the desert in shown in its full splendor, vastness and magnificence. 3- Great actors like O'Tool and Omar Sharif make a memorable debut in this enigmatic rising of the Arabs.The negative Points :-1. Peter O Tool's frail and feeble physique does not hold true to the legend of Col. T.E. Lawrence. A warring protagonist should had been a physically strong actor. 2. The legend of T.E. LAWRENCE IS OVER BLOWN, because the Ottomon Empire was on its own decline, since the mid-19th century. The death blow to its bygone glory had already struck during the WW-I. Mr. Lawrence merely aided a natural and native Arab uprising against the self defeated Turks. The British have made the movie to create a national hero out of nowhere. 3.

"The Arabian Pennsula, Crossing the Devil's Anvil, Winning the Middle East War, Only to watch the Peace Fail.","That this film is photographed in brilliant color tones may well be important in a symbolic way as it is to the physical properties of this as a motion picture. The main character, the World War in the Middle Eastern Theatre of War against the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the treachery from his own country and his Superior Officers are indeed very complex and deserved something more than a black & white, right & wrong portrayal.The story starts out wit Mr. T.E. Lawrence, private citizen, taking a spin on his motorcycle, a short ride from which he would not return. We move to the Funeral, and like all funerals of the famous who die in tragic circumstances,* there are a lot of Big Wigs present, not to pay respects, but rather just to be seen.We also are privy to a roving reporter, stopping all the high governmental folks, asking of their knowledge of the deceased former 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Though the audience was then unaware that Director David Lean's cinematic device to both introduce us to characters from Lawrence's past, who we will be seeing again, later in the film.Among those who we meet are General Allenby(Jack Hawkins), now a Lord and an American Newspaperman & Newsreel Maker, one Jackson Bentley(Arthur Kennedy)which should be most interesting.This Mr. Bentley character is the one responsible in the film version for making Lawrence known to the world. This was essentially true, but for some reason the true name of this Press Agent for Lawrence and the Brits.The true identity of this American Newspaper Man is Lowell Thomas (1892-1981). He had been very active as a Newspaper Writer, as a Radio Newsman and a bit of a film maker, for it was two of his newsreel specials that made 'Lawrence of Arabia' into a household word. A sort of documentary compilation WITH ALLENBY IN PALESTINE AND LAWRENCE IN ARABIA (1919)was released after the War, and it started Mr.Thomas on the road to fame and fortune. (Also a very long career in Film(FOX-MOVIETONE NEWSREEL), Network Radio News and Television right up to the 1970's.(I well remember his HIGH ADVENTURE WITH LOWELL THOMAS as a 7th Grader,1958-59).Now getting back to LAWRENCE OF ARABIA(1962).A multi-faceted character would certainly require a multi-level, extra long epic sort of a film to tell the story properly. Well, they sure did that thing! We were all treated to a 216 Minute Epic which had the good sense and decency to have an INTERMISSION inserted right in the middle! And it sure seemed that the hour plus of viewing an awful lot of Sand and Dessert sure must have worked on our minds as pop sales in the lobby seemed quite brisk, indeed! As for the casting of Lawrence, Sir David Lean went with a newcomer, young, good looking and promising as an actor in Peter O'Toole. The very blonde haired and very blue eyed Mr. O'Toole gave us a T.E. Lawrence who was a sort of genius, who was out of step with the rest of the World, though Lawrence would definitely hold that it was the World that was out of step.He was highly educated and possessed super knowledge of Middle East History, Arabian Peoples, Islamic Religion and Arabian Language. It was while he was on staff a British Army HQ in Cairo that the idea of sending him on the mission to find Prince Feisel (Alec Guiness) was formulated.The eventual formation of the Arab Milita, which too forces loyal to Feisel and added more and more tribal warriors as time went by was a far cry from stories we are used to. The brutality of the dessert warfare and the frightful methods employed are most vividly portrayed. And what immediately comes to mind is a scene of an attack on a Turkish Railroad Train and its aftermath. As the attackers are 'taking inventory' of the goods on the train, a man in a bloodied up suit walks by in a seeming trance, obviously in a state of shock.The brutal blood letting scenes seem a little much at times, but it is done purposefully and not just for the sake of gratuitous violence. This David Lean was masterful in weaving a tale with some distasteful elements and maintaining a very mature, grown-up view and attitude. All the way from the start to the very end, this attitude is constant. There is no false glorification of War, nor is there any message that one could interpret as being pacifist. War is just there, we have to put up with it as best we can.The same sober realistic attitude is maintained with the alleged homosexuality of T.E. Lawrence. There are several parts of the story that sort of hint at it, but it is not mentioned, nor does the Director avoid the issue. His scene with Lawrence's being picked up and fondled by the Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer) was brutal, shocking and went far enough to get the point across; and to explain the great change in Lawrence's personality.If made by some lesser Director today, the whole sequence would be far different and much more graphic. A ""modern"" movie maker would have to 'draw a picture' for the audience, for the old fashioned virtues of subtlety and implication are not in the arsenal of film weaponry of these guys.And we must make mention of the beautiful, powerful and most memorable original score from the London Phiharmonic Orchestra, which makes our sense of hearing a full partner of our enjoyment.The Verdict on Sir David Lean's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is ****1/2 (four and a half stars.) See it for the first time or see it again!NOTE: * The ceremonies like this; Military, Policeman Slain in the Line of Duty, etc., always get turned into a sort of ""Show for the Pols and Police Brass.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Historical Epic Ever Made,"There is a moment in Lawrence of Arabia when the hero, T.E. Lawrence, and his guide, after a long trek across the desert, stop at a well to drink. Lawrence turns around to see a distant speck in the far distance, reluctantly shimmering in the desert heat, like a mirage. The speck reluctantly approaches the camera, before materializing into what looks like a man. There is absolutely no music, only the sounds of the desert winds and the footsteps of the man approaching. What are his intentions? We do not know. But judging by the reaction of Lawrence's guide, they must not be good. The man comes closer to the camera, until the suspense becomes so unbearable that Lawrence's guide runs to the nearest weapon--only to be shot. On television, this shot doesn't work at all; nothing can be seen, nothing can be heard. In a movie theater, looking at the stark clarity projected on the screen, the sound of the desert surrounding us, we lean forward and strain to bring a detail out of the waves of heat, and for a moment we experience some of the actual vastness of the desert, and its unforgiving harshness. I myself have only experienced 4 movies in the theater: Lawrence of Arabia, which remains one of my favorite films, Shazam, which wasn't half bad, and Home, which was. My family also went to see the sequel to Percy Jackson, and quite frankly, the first one wasn't even that good. And despite the fact that these movies may not be very good, the experience of watching it in the theater was enough to make them a memorable experience. Unfortunately, despite having huge blockbusters last year, ticket sales have been going down the past few years, and, given the current circumstances, it is unlikely that new generations will be able to experience the magic of the cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Magnificent,"Absolutely magnificent. There are so many awe-inspiring shots in this film, from the grand sweeping desert vistas, to the horseman emerging out of a mirage in that glorious long shot, to the three figures in the distance with a huge sun rising on the horizon, to Lawrence on his camel at the Red Sea after the Battle of Aqaba ... it just seems like I could go on and on. Also beautiful are the little shots that are so poetic, such as that moment when we see Lawrence's shadow as he leaps nimbly atop a Turkish train he's just derailed. The scope and grandeur of what director David Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young accomplished here can't be overstated.There are historical inaccuracies but it seems to me that the gist is reasonably correct, and I liked how the flaws of British politics, British racism, and Lawrence's personal issues which led up to the Tafas massacre were all exposed ... even as we are blown away by some aspects of his character (and certainly by his bravery, and his desire for Arab independence and self-rule). The fact that to take Aqaba from its unguarded side he really did go through 600 miles of desert by camel over a two month period with only 45 rebels, each carrying only water and a 45 pound sack of flour at the outset, is mind-boggling to say the least.Peter O'Toole leads an extraordinary cast, and perfectly looks the part (who cares about the height difference to the real Lawrence?). Robert Graves wrote that T.E. Lawrence's eyes ""immediately held me ... they were startlingly blue, even by artificial light"" - and that's certainly true of O'Toole. More importantly, he delivers an inspired, nuanced, and ambiguous performance, one that's as elusive and tortured as the desert sand being whipped up into spirals by the wind. Alec Guinness is similarly striking as Faisal, future king of Greater Syria and then Iraq. As he stares into the prospect of the British and French divided up the Middle East for its oil per the Sykes-Picot Agreement, he says so wisely:""There's nothing further here for a warrior. We drive bargains. Old men's work. Young men make wars, and the virtues of war are the virtues of young men. Courage and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace. And the vices of peace are the vices of old men. Mistrust and caution. It must be so.""Great film, and truly worthy of being dubbed epic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Agony and Ecstasy,"As others have commented, the visual aspect of Lawrence is indeed almost overwhelming, but another aspect stands out too. The love theme. As was pointed out, Lawrence is a film with no women. Despite that it is the love tension which feeds the whole plot from beginning to end. That Lawrence himself was homosexual, is alluded to throughout the film, but the deeper love for the land and the people, is the one that carries him mercilessly onwards. The tragedy is that Lawrence is continually rejected, both physically and ultimately spiritually. The film is one of a few which manages to show the reality of love in both its pain and it's glory.",,Anonymous,Biography
Bloated classic,Still looks spectacular especially the first 1hr in the desert. The sunsets glimmer in a radiant orange and by day the briilant blue sky cuts the horizon perfectly against the golden sand.

Best looking epic ever made,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Nothing is written"" - Lawrence.To me personally ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) is first movie that comes in to my mind when word Epic cinema is being pronounced. I think this is the best word that describes this great movie. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is epic in every meaning of this word. I saw this masterpiece 3 times and every time this movie blows me away due to its panoramic scenery. There isn't another film like this.

The only minor complain i have about this 4 hours long masterpiece is its ending which is kinda sad and abrupt. Maybe that was the point.

"Outstanding Screenplay and Visual Storytelling, but Split into two Differently Paced Movies","David Lean's immaculate level of visual storytelling through vivid colour and depth of field is top tier throughout. He directs every scene with an artistry that is sorely missed but perfectly encapsulated in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.The acting is breathy and flows with believable realism set against the beautiful environments and sweeping landscapes that for its time, and by today standards, are timeless. Peter O Toole's eyes are the greatest to behold in their vivid blue in contrast to the dusty desert hues.The first half is magnificent. Although slow paced, the introduction new characters is full of intrigue and mystery while the world building is told in a fascinating manner. It's well scripted and the dialog is thoughtful.However its second half is in too much of a rush and it is difficult to understand where the characters are and exposition is largely pushed aside in haste to hurry to its conclusion; it feels like a completely different movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
most overrated movie ever,"this movie was awful. it was at least 2 hours too long. it would have been decent had they not shown the crossing of the desert in real-time... jeez talk about a waste of time. you could have watched half of the movie with fast forward oni don't understand why they felt it was necessary to spend so much time focusing on the dialog-free desert crossing, rather than spending the time developing characters or better explaining the political ramifications of what was occurring. the overall quality of the movie was greatly depleted by this. it would be interesting to see a remake of this film, but only if it were at least an hour shorter",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Desert loving English,"One cannot really add much to the superlatives heaped upon this undisputed masterpiece, adapted by playwright Robert Bolt from T. E. Lawrence's 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom'. Director David Lean himself has admitted that he 'got it wrong' on a few occasions. Firstly in not having the courage to hold Omar Sharif's entrance for longer and secondly in not making it clearer that Lawrence was not only beaten but also buggered by the Turks. The film suggests that Lawrence did not know about the Sykes-Picot Treaty but only 'suspected'. He almost certainly did know hence his burden of guilt at having betrayed the Arabs. These are minor quibbles of course and do not detract from the film's magnificence. It would be nigh on impossible of course to assemble a cast of this quality now. When Lean and cinematographer Freddie Young met on the set, Young said 'Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs'. Lean very wisely took his advice. At the premiere the Duke of Edinburgh enquired of Lean:'good flick is it?' Lean's response? 'I hope so, sir'. This would turn out to be something of an understatement for, despite its flaws biographically, as a purely filmic experience it remains unsurpassed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Search for Purpose,"Lawerence of Arabia is a spectacularly intimate rendition of a sort of loneliness that comes from having absolutely no idea who you are or your purpose in life beyond others interpretation.

Only One Word Describes This Film: Epic,"Cairo during World War I: T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is a misfit British Army lieutenant, notable only for his insolence and knowledge of the Bedouin. Over the objections of a skeptical General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.This film asks: what makes England great: guns or discipline? And that's a question any nation or empire can ask. America today holds the power England once had, and what makes it great? Seemingly, the guns... military advantage does gain a country economic advantage. But a country can be great in other ways, such as its arts. Was England great in that way?Lawrence had a way of understanding the Middle East that few of his time -- or today -- really did. He made a map of the region and suggested on how to divide up the area. Tribes are given more credence, the Palestinians have their own land, as do the Armenians. Had England listened to Lawrence more, perhaps we would have fewer Middle Eastern disputes today. Perhaps...Historically, Lawrence was seen as asexual and a masochist. It's hard to show his asexuality, though we can say that the film does not portray him as a ladies man. Likewise, while we never see him being an outright masochist, the beating scene does suggest he is capable of taking great pain. To hint that he enjoyed it, though, may be going too far.This film is fantastic. It's a bit hard to get through in one sitting, coming just shy of four hours. But if you use the intermission for a bathroom break or to make a sandwich, it's well worth catching it all in a relatively short amount of time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Transforms you into a new world,"I only had access to the directors cut so with all the unnecessary scenes and plot points I found it hard to appreciate the film until seeing many videos on the beauty of the film I remembered how utterly beautiful the cinematography (Possibly the best shot film I've seen). And while on my first viewing I did see the glory of the characters and the performance of Peter O. Toole (Who easily should've won best actor) I didn't see how well constructed the film was and how fitting and great the score was, I couldn't even think up a different score to fit the infinite dessert feel of the film. My compliant is only that the dialogue seemed somewhat simple and while it always serves a purpose it was dull and quick it was like an awkward conversion but maybes that's the point of it, it's quiet and they don't have much to say. It had a great bittersweet ending, he got what he wanted but not what he needed.

At times it's beautiful to watch.But it's boring.. there are some good sequences but for most part it's actually hard to follow because it's not interesting enough and too much desert, desert, desert. The story could most probably have been much easier to digest if it had had half the running time. Or at least cut 60-90 mins.The acting is ok. O'toole does a decent job in the title role (despite some strange moments) and I can see why Omar Sharif was cast as Doctor Zhivago a few years later. He is great.Alec Guinness as an Arabic prince however.. at least that wasn't right for me. He is ok but it feels so wrong.All in all an epic that is great to watch and it has some epic scenes.

One of All Time's Best Epics!,"Over the course of six decades, Lawrence of Arabia have been given names such as ""the epic of all epics."" People always mention this film when talking about influential movies or favorite movies. In fact, this film gave way to famous directors such as Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and Martin Scorsese. These fore-mentioned directors based their films off the style of this film. No one knew it in 1962, but this film would be one of the most influential films of all time. Believe it or not, I actually didn't think too much of the film the first time I saw it. I thought it was overlong and boring. I must have been in a bad mood that day, because I simply loved the film upon my second viewing. The scope of the film is incredible and I love the lush, gorgeous cinematography. The film is sweepingly beautiful and I still love seeing the shots of the desert sun. Everything in the film has a gentle beauty to it, even the violent battles featured in the film, so it's no surprise the film won an Oscar for its cinematography.The film itself is based off the historical adventures of T.E Lawrence. The movie begins with Lawrence's death at the age of 46 due to a motorcycle accident. Then it flashbacks to 1916 with Lawrence as a young intelligence officer stationed in Cairo, Egypt. Around this time, the Arabs began a revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Turkey. Lawrence is given leave to investigate the revolt. However, he creates an army on the side of the Arabs and he uses his army to fight against the slowly-weakening Turkish troops.Despite many people loving this spectacle, this film had its share of controversies. Mostly in the way of historical inaccuracies. For example, the Lawrence depicted in this film does not resemble the Lawrence of reality. The Lawrence in the movie, portrayed by Peter O'Toole, is taller, skinnier, has a very boyish face, and speaks in a sarcastic way. His mannerisms also are different, and the story goes that Lawrence's family found the film to be stupid and that it insults the memory of Lawrence. Also, new characters were introduced such as Sheriff Ali, who was a Arab soldier fighting alongside Lawrence in the movie. Other notable differences were in the movie, Prince Faisal, the Arab leader was depicted as a middle-age man when in reality he was barely 30 years old. Also, General Allenby, the boss of Lawrence, was depicted as cold and mean to Lawrence. But there is enough evidence to prove they actually may have been good friends in real life. Also there have been complaints that not all of Lawrence's exploits were mentioned in the film.Now what is my response to all these controversies? I think it's a load of bull. I am always for one for filmmakers to try to make their movie accurate as possible. But the bottom line is that the purpose of a movie is to entertain. If that means a film has some inaccuracies, so be it. If I needed to learn about a topic, I would watch a documentary. That being said, movies are always a good starting point to learn about a particular subject (in this case, T.E Lawrence).This film was directed by David Lean, a master when it comes to epics. We have already seen his 1957 feature, Bridge on the River Kwai. This film is his follow-up to Kwai's success, and it's interesting because this film is even more successful, critically and financially. Lean is an excellent director, although he is known for his old-fashioned methods and clashing with his actors on set. There is no denying he created a powerful, influential film. He created a straightforward narrative on the outside, but he raises complex questions on the inside.The performances are all wonderful. Peter O'Toole, although boyish-looking and does not resemble the real Lawrence much, does an amazing job. he does bring to life the eccentric ways of Lawrence. A powerful scene he brought to life is after a rather suicidal trek across the scorching desert, he goes back to help a fallen comrade and bring him to safety. Omar Sharif, a major star in Egypt, does an exceptional job as Sheriff Ali. I bet if you didn't see the cast list, you would have never recognized Alec Guinness. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't because he does an exceptional job as Prince Faisal, the calm leader of the Arabs. Guinness was very immersed in his character, which isn't surprising because he always gives his very best. Jack Hawkins does a good job as the manipulative commander in General Allenby. The whole cast does a great job; Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, Arthur Kennedy as the American reporter who turns the exploits of Lawrence into a myth, and Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton.It's a wonder that Lawrence of Arabia was ever made. It was a 216-minute movie plus intermission. It was a film that had no love story (or women for that matter), not a lot of action, and was filmed in the desert. Usually, the big man with the money would have refused, but this film was given a chance and it was quite a chance to take. People adored this film from its release all the way to today. The performances and the cinematography are always singled out. I personally must single out the score by Maurice Jarre. He composed an incredible piece of music, and it's one of my top soundtracks ever. The film won 7 Oscars, including the well-deserved best picture. It's a beautiful film about an eccentric man who did a lot to help his country and to help developing nations. There are battle scenes, but the film is not about the action. It's about T.E Lawrence.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lawrence of Arabia is not a classic,"There's good acting, good cinematography, and good music, but it's just too long, boring, and painful to watch! It's nowhere near as epic as Lord of the Rings, but it's only considered ""epic"" because of the fact that there was no film like this back then, and the fact that the director was so ambitious and wanted to cram in all this crap that this movie accumulated the length of 4 hours to do so. It's also too slow that the first part (2 and a half hours!!!) felt like 5 hours. I stopped watching it right then since it drives me mad.

"This film won the Best Picture Oscar at the 35th Oscars on April 8th, 1963","Director, David Lean does something incredible with this film. First off, he kills off the main character right at the beginning of the film. He then, through three and a half hours worth of flashbacks, tells the epic story of the rise of T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), in the deserts of Arabia. This is a historical biopic of sorts, based off of the book, that Lawrence had written before his death. The film then goes back to the days of WWI. The British need help against the Turks and the Ottoman Empire, during the Middle East theatre of WWI, so Lawrence is sent to Arabia in order to create an allegiance with the Arabs, by assisting them with their fight against the Turks, thus opening up shipping lanes for the British and French to Syria.As Lawrence begins to tally up victories, survive life threatening situations and makes himself the leader of men, he begins to really believe he is the chosen one. His success was going to his head. Before the madness could take over, he successfully captures the port city of Aqaba on the Red Sea. This opens up things for the British and French, thus sealing his promotion to Lieutenant Colonel. This also sets up the fight through the rest of the war, his return to Britain, and the successes and tragedy of his post-war life. Along this epic journey, he meets a wide array of classically great actors, who give this film their all.Sir Alec Guinness plays Prince Faisal, who is key to the alliance between the British and the Arabs. Anthony Quinn is Auda Abu Tayi, the man who aligns himself with Lawrence, but really is just in this for his own pound of flesh. The most brilliant performance, I felt, was from Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden. Rains' character was fictionalized, but contained a mix of many of the real-life people that Lawrence met during this time. In other words, there were so many influential people, who took part in this piece of history, that even three and a half hours of film couldn't cover it all. They blended some of the contributing figures into one person for time and plot sake.David Lean uses the widescreen space beautifully in this film. Lawrence of Arabia (1962), was that film that explained why wide-screen was invented. When you see this on the big screen it is almost like you are there in the desert. It works even when you watch it on your flat screen tv at home. The vastness, barren wasteland of the desert presents itself as the true god of the film. It is the desert that is the biggest enemy of any soldier there. This is a brilliant film to watch and it is no surprise it is hailed as one of the best ever.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is truly one of the best epic movies of all time, thanks to great acting, great cinematography (that it makes you feel like if you are in the desert) and great soundtrack.The movie is focused about Thomas Edward Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), an English Army officer who united the Arab tribes during World War 1 for fighting against the Turks. Alongside O'Toole there is a great all-star cast as the various different politicians and arabs of that period: Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif are very convincing as the Arabs Prince Faisal, Auda Abu Tayi and Sherif Ali. Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Josè Ferrer, Anthony Quayle are all good as the political figures that Lawrence meets in his period of time.

He achieves less than he intends but still achieves a lot.Also, he is an everyman at the bottom of a big powerful rigid bureaucracy and very poorly regarded.

"""A man cannot always be in uniform...""","A thinking man's spectacle that continues to divide opinion as to whether it marked the apex of David Lean's career or simply a further stage in his decline.Albert Finney having declined because it would have meant signing a seven-year contract, the role instead went to a young fellow named Peter O'Toole starting to make his name in the theatre (who gets an 'introducing' credit despite having already made three earlier films).With flaxen blonde hair and blue-eyed good looks and a good foot taller than his subject he wasn't exactly obvious casting (we briefly see an accurate rendition of Lawrence at his memorial service) and never suggests a man who so craved anonymity he adopted the name 'Ross'; but to see his affinity with good-looking young arabs, the obvious pleasure he took in sweeping about the desert in a robe between attacking trains vouchsafes his embrace of the love that dared not speak its name about which Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson's screenplay is otherwise extremely circumspect.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Classic about a man, consumed by the desert...","It's funny how the production of some films actually goes onto mirror the subject matter. Fitzcarraldo was the story of one man's attempt to bring something beautiful to the masses, at whatever count. The adventures of Baron Munchausen was the story of an aging dreamer, trying to ignore defeat and go on one last escapade before he was crushed by the higher powers, and then we come to Lawrence of Arabia. David Lean's look at a man consumed and fascinated by the desert.In his story of the life of British lieutenant T.E. Lawrence and his quest across the Saudi Arabian desert, David Lean realised his true cinematic power for the first time. Painting his epic on the biggest 70mm canvas, filling it with hundreds of extras, every performance on the mark, this wasn't just a film to Lean, it represented himself, the single minded vision of Lawrence struck a cord with Lean.And despite the fact that this is undeniably Lean's film, the cast should not be ignored. This was back when an epic meant, EPIC, in every sense of the word, and Lawrence has an epic cast to die for. Peter O' Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins and the mighty Alec Guinness, there's also Freddy Young and Nicholas Roeg's stunning cinematography, making the vast and empty desert seem almost claustrophobic.This is full of memorable moments and images, the huge black locomotive moving through the desert, Sharif's first entrance as a shimmering mirage, Lawrence's questioning... And even if it does slump a little in the middle, and it's length will mean this isn't a film you will want to watch every week becomes enough for it lose points, Lawrence of Arabia is still a true classic, too often ignored by today's' MTV standards. See it once, and you will never forget it, and there's a good chance you'll be humming that Maurice Jarre theme tune for weeks.8/10 masterpiece marred by a weak mid section.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic Puts It Lightly,"The thing that I admire about ""Lawrence of Arabia"" above all else is the absolutely beautiful photography. The film was shot in an admittedly already stunning location, but it's the way that long shots are used so thematically, as if the screen itself were a barren desert that stretched on endlessly. This is another one of those old Hollywood epics where they just cram the frame with hundreds of extras and it adds so much to driving up the stakes during battle sequences. Bravo in particular to cinematographer Freddie Young.So many great performances here as well. Peter O'Toole as the titular T. E. Lawrence, Omar Sharif as Sherif Ali. The great Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal.It's a long movie but it was very encapsulating to me and it kept my interest the entire time. Lawrence is such a fascinating character, and his inner grief and transformation throughout the nearly four hour runtime is awesome to watch unfold.Admittedly, this one isn't for everybody. As mentioned before, it's long. It's also a biographical picture. But you will get a stunning visual treat with very good acting and a compelling story above all else.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sweeping epic film,"Sweeping epic film. Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable, the scale vast. In many ways, it defines ""epic,"" but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies: a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this, and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T. E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him. The desert is a recurring image, but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative, characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film, without the long, lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes, shimmers and conceals, as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's performance is mirage-like, with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert, others linger on his face, frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together close-ups and wide-angle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait, as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance; Lawrence's eyes, lit up in relief and vindication; the man, who has expected to die, almost literally rising from the dead; they move toward each other, two specks becoming one; and finally: the impersonal specks become human beings again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Better than Ever. And Yet....,"I had to read several other reviews to focus on what seems to be the important elements of this film. I'm grateful to the reviewers.I first saw the film at the age of 17, thought it was a great flick, and then pretty much forgot about it. I didn't understand the plot (what were the Brits and the French after, anyway?) but I did feel the gorgeous beauty of the photography and the locales, which formed a good basis for appreciating the film as I grew older.I have just seen the film again, in its socalled restored version. One technical word (as something of a technician myself): I say ""socalled"" because of the audio. Rarely have I seen a British film that gets the sound right. American films get it wonderfully right, with a sense of presence and clarity that the Brits somehow manage to mangle. That's a severe weakness of this film--even if it was restored.But getting to the heart of the matter.... My impression, in view of rave reviews of O'Toole and his acting, is that Sharif was the real star of the show (almost, that is). His character enters as a ""cruel and barbarous"" murderer but then slowly and convincingly evidences the humanity that makes his character virtually fall in love with the difficult Lawrence. In contrast, I found O'Toole's changes (not growth, but devolution) in the course of the film rather stilted, as if O'Toole lacked the experience and depth of his costar (and that's probably true). I can see how Sharif later turned into Zhivago, while I doubt that O'Toole could have handled such a role nearly as well.Lawrence of Arabia is about life, and it takes decades of life to appreciate its meaning (at least it did for me). As was said at the end of the film, young men make war and old men make the peace--and it must be so. The world is an old, old place, and our youthful dreams and aspirations and perceptions must eventually turn into the more sober and dejected outlooks of the mature. But that doesn't mean that older age is full of depression: appreciating the undulations of life and of our dreams is just part of the deal we get from God and the cosmos.Somehow, in some inexplicable way, I sense that this was Lean's message, and he delivered it well.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rise and Fall of a Philosophical Warrior,"The sandy front of World War I, set amongst the dunes and political turmoil of Syria, Egypt and Jordan, as seen by a cocksure British army officer with maybe a little bit of a messiah complex. A true epic, from the breath-stealing long shots of an unimaginably vast desert to the explosive, well-outfitted battle scenes, it lives up to the billing and then some. I was mesmerized by the photography in particular, which constantly discovers new ways to portray what could have been a rather redundant, flat, boring landscape. Truly beautiful, almost ruminative at times, with an appreciation for the artisanship of film.As for the plot, well... it's a bit slow. Particularly so in the nearly four-hour director's cut, which feels completely unnecessary. I've never seen the theatrical release, which is noted for being incomprehensible in places due to the awkward cuts, but it seems suspicious that half an hour or more couldn't have been lopped off somewhere to improve the pace. It's an exhausting watch, and not just because of the draining personal transformation we see in Lawrence himself. There's good material, of course, plenty of it. The hopeless inner squabble of an Arab population that's desperately close to the unified independence they seek. The protagonist's progression from philosophical humanist to enraged berzerker to shattered shell.

Looks great on the outside but when you open it, it is completely worthless and puts a frown on your face, exactly what I got with this movie.The director primarily decided that with movies, cinematography is best, everything else is secondary, especially dialog. There were very few lines in a movie of mammoth length, which is absolutely pathetic. I was not able to connect with either Lawrence, his friends or his enemies. The film became lazy hiding behind a beautiful shroud of desert and camels.Let me say this, movies are stories to be told. Cinematography is crucial to this, but if you add very little story to one, it becomes a hollow log that appeases to people who love vision only enjoyed by the eye. I am not from that crowd unfortunately.Here are some thing that could have made this a masterpiece:1. Less time filming treks through the desert...This got on quite a few people's nerve, despite the beautiful scenery we saw. We became bored and disconnected with Lawrence, like as if the long journey told an important story.2. Include more dialog...This is perhaps the worst part of the film, there wasn't any stuff to think about other than ""I will do this job, yes"". Through only Lawrence's actions, we could only determine that he fell in love with two Arabs going on a maverick's job to capture a Turkish hold, he killed a man who he saved earlier for murdering an Arab and was first reluctant but then enjoyed it? Never going into detail why. He gets abused by turks and...without any thought dialog other than a couple of expressions and the audience knowing he got abused, how he became so cold and angry?3. Try to be a bit more historically accurate if you don't care about story...This film was more like an amalgam of bits than a movie or history lesson. They didn't even include captions or dates to inform the audience how Britain came to be affaired with the campaign or Lawrence's past history.And to top it all off, a cheesy ending with a bunch of soldiers driving by in a truck singing on how they miss home, obviously saying that Lawrence will miss the middle-east, but we never became connected with why he will miss it so much.A huge disappointment of a movie. Yet a good example of cinematography, how long a movie should be (movies should be very long) and a good cast selection. But other than that it was more of a pretty picture with tons of money bursting out the frames.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The cinematography, the production design, the acting, the colors, and costumes were all beautifully strong and breathtaking to watch.

At 1960; Great. At 2007; OK.,"This wasn't a bad movie. Though I like faster action and dialog I could watch it to the end. Scenes were from time to time boring and this film wouldn't get as good review if it was published today. Music was nice and once I had to stop watching movie to get inspiration to guitar-riffs ;). Acting was OK with these lines the actors we're given. I could get only some messy ideas of the actors feelings. Battles were cool with all those camels and horses running around.. lot's of money gone to shooting fer sure.Scenery was really nice, whirlwinds and that fusion ball rising at the edge of desert.. Most people probably gave the rating 10 stars out of nostalgia. In the 60's there was probably not many better movies than this. Movie created some interest to know about the history aspects of Middle-East in early of 2000 century. Have Arabs really being so scattered? I have no idea of what really has been.Probably in right mood and bigger screen this could be better.

"A great epic of cinema, full of remarkable scenes and that, even at almost four hours long, manages to captivate the viewer without becoming tiring","David Lean knew it would be a tremendous challenge to adapt the unlikely achievements of Thomas Edward Lawrence, one of the British Army's greatest soldiers during the Cairo campaigns against the Turks in World War I. Not only because of the great controversy surrounding his figure, but also because of the extremely difficult faithful representation of the events that occurred in Arabia between 1916 and 1918. The task of scripting the deeds of this very pertinent historical figure was the responsibility of Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson. Basing the entire narrative on the events described by T. E. Lawrence in his memoirs and notes, we have the creation of one of the most epic stories ever brought to the seventh art, despite its relatively simple approach. The merit of the simplicity of the story of Lawrence of Arabia lies in the point of interest that Lean and the scriptwriters wanted to focus on: the historical figure and nothing else, leaving aside any importance regarding the historical context of the War nor the disjointed situation of Arabia, which was not a Unified state, even more under strict control of the Ottoman Empire.During World War I, Lieutenant T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is sent as an observer to the region of the Turkish Empire dominated by British troops. There, the English army works to convince the Arab prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) to abandon the desert and head to the coast, where the Arabs would be trained and armed. The prince resists the idea. Contrary to official guidance, Lawrence begins to work for the Arabs to stay. To show that victory is possible, he leads 50 Bedouins on a risky mission across the desert to take control of Aqaba, a strategic city held by the Turks.The mission is successful. Upon returning to England, Lawrence is promoted to colonel and obtains authorization from the command to lead the Arabs in the fight against the Turks. As in real life, Lawrence has spectacular victories. As he lives with the Arabs, he begins to respect their culture. He starts working with the British government so that the Arabs form an independent nation after the defeat of the Turks. He receives the guarantee that the Arab regions will not enter into the territorial partition between the victorious powers. With redoubled spirit, he takes on the role of liberator of the Arab people, transforming himself into the myth that he actually was. However, the soldier is unaware of the intricacies of politics. While he fights for Arab independence, the British government works for the victory of the interests of the great powers.In the first few minutes of the work, director David Lean can deceive us by showing Lawrence as an insubordinate idiot, a young man with a rebellious spirit, but this is soon dismantled when we discover the lieutenant's intellectual airs and great egocentrism. However, these characteristics become very useful when he interacts with the Bedouins, also revealing the anti-imperialist message of the first part of the film, in addition to praising the beneficial exchange of culture between peoples. In this way, we understand very well how Lawrence managed to unite several Bedouin tribes due to his interest, respect for others and thirst for knowledge, in addition to being free from prejudice. But there are several ironies for the first act of the feature, depriving the power that Lawrence believed to have when winning over his first friend who is soon murdered by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) who, in the future, ends up being a great companion of the protagonist.Lean thus advances the narrative by exhibiting rhapsodies of the barbarities committed by Bedouins addicted to violence as Lawrence tries to unify everyone to fight enemies. There is also a structure that is inspired by achievement in the dialogue so well presented in Akira Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. That is, allies are never conquered by force, but through promises made by Lawrence's fierce language, which seeks to control everything and everyone, in a clear manifestation of desire for full control over men and nature. This is recurrent through the enigmatic images of small tornadoes observed on the horizon of the deserts and through the bad selfish choices that Lawrence assumes, always choosing the path with greater danger. The character wants to explore and become master of his own destiny - which makes the beginning of the film quite ironic. Incidentally, this point of ""a man does what he wants"" is the most exposed in very concentrated dialogues in the first half of the feature.Without worrying about compressing the narrative into the traditional two hours, David Lean takes the time he deems necessary to explore the desert, creating beautiful shots that take advantage of the sunrise and the exuberance of that sea of sand. Also counting on the dazzling photography of Freddie Young, the director creates a breathtaking look, which is confirmed even in the night scenes, skillfully lit by Young and which serve to create a contrast with the powerful light of the daytime scenes. The director is also competent in directing scenes of strong impact, such as the wars (which we will return to in a moment), and in intimate moments, such as Lawrence's slow walks through the desert. Also notice how the silence increases our anticipation seconds before the Bedouin Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) appears on the distant horizon. When Lawrence rescues Gasim (I. S. Johar) in the desert, the triumphal trail indicates in advance that he saved the boy - Gasim still stars in another remarkable moment, when we discover that he is the murderer who must be executed by Lawrence, shortly after being killed. Saved by him. These two moments in which someone appears on the horizon demonstrate how Lean works with our sensations, making us share the harrowing experience of walking in the burning desert as if we were there, looking at the horizon without knowing if what we are seeing is real or just a mirage.While the first part of the feature is practically sublime, the second is slightly inferior due to the more stationary degree of Lawrence's narrative development, in addition to a great fragmentation via ellipses that can make everything too rushed. However, it is important to note that this does not negatively interfere with the experience, after all Lean manages to explore the dark side of Lawrence's mind a little more, marking his complete transformation. The character quickly enters into contradiction and, in order not to lose his feeling of grandiloquence, ends up doing the impossible to unite his allies again, resorting to superficial loyalties that make his leadership totally false, despite the British army still admiring his accomplishments. Soon, Lean builds two very impactful sequences showing Lawrence as one of wild passions, placing him as a false prophet, an unscrupulous military man and, worse, a war criminal responsible for one of the most visceral massacres of the confrontation.The last act epitomizes what makes Lawrence just a normal human, a flawed and very questionable hero and, worst of all, just an Englishman, an exogenous element who would never be able to lead the Arab people. Precisely for this reason, the end of the film is so powerful in contrasting the silent misery of one man with the happiness of another, completely ignorant of the pain of others. This question of whether or not to be British is practically supported by Lean and O'Toole's performance. Just notice how the character behaves when wearing the military clothes of his country, walking awkwardly and behaving childishly. However, when he receives the iconic white robes, Lean presents us with an intimate moment of the hero as he leaves his army to dance alone, feeling completely comfortable with the garments, believing himself to be a true Arab.Among the great scenes in ""Lawrence of Arabia"", it is worth highlighting the invasion of Aqaba, a breathtaking sequence, captured in a beautiful long shot by Lean that, in the end, reveals, through an elegant tracking shot, the cannon pointed towards the sea (and what a beautiful sea!), just as Lawrence had predicted. Another sensational battle takes place before arriving in Damascus, in a sequence that well illustrates the large number of extras used, demanding a lot of skill from the director in conducting the mise-en-scène - it is worth remembering that, contrary to what happens today, the battles do not used digital effects. And in addition to the striking war scenes, the melancholy death of a boy in quicksand deserves to be highlighted, which seems to serve to harden Lawrence's heart even more. An interesting curiosity: David Lean decided to show all the scenes from left to right. According to him, this was necessary to make clear Lawrence's tireless journey in the desert.Played by the charismatic Peter O'Toole, Lawrence initially emerges as a mysterious man, capable of captivating many people who barely knew him. Thin and slightly effeminate, O'Toole's Lawrence is a character full of nuances, who, contrary to his fragile appearance, slowly finds pleasure in killing his enemies. Despite being scared at first, Lawrence confirms this feeling in one of the battles, something that O'Toole conveys very well with his insane countenance during the conflict.""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a great epic that portrays the life of a complex character, full of qualities and defects like any human being. His leadership spirit and his charisma united the Arab peoples in the fight against the Turks, but he also underwent profound transformations in this trajectory, skillfully captured by the camera of David Lean - a specialist in large-scale productions and remarkable plastic beauty. The result is an exciting film, full of remarkable scenes and that, even at almost four hours long, manages to captivate the viewer without becoming tiring.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly a masterpiece on every count,"Back in 62, my brother came home after watching ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and proclaimed to me that it was the best picture he had ever seen and will likely ever see. After hearing this, I had to see it! After watching it, I now find myself saying the very same thing to anyone who will listen. Every element that I use to judge a movie was met and surpassed leaving me astonished that I couldn't find a single flaw in the movie. Yes, it's a bit long but if you get caught up with it like my brother and I did, that doesn't bother you in the least. Every character was perfectly cast and delivered brilliantly. T.E. Lawrence was unknown to me prior to seeing this movie and it was great to get a glimpse of this character out of that era who was so different than his counterparts. If any other British Serving Officer had been given that assignment, history in that region would have turned out quite different. David Lean, so I understand, prepared himself for this project for several years because he wanted to get it right and oh my what a great job he did.

Lawrence of Arabia,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is one movie that you never get tired of rewatching. This film is based on the writings of T. E. Lawrence (a close friend of Virginia Woolf.) I have to confess I have not read any of his writings at the time of this review.This is the story of a British officer who led the Arab armies against the Turks in the Middle East during World War I from 1915 to 1918. However, the film itself is anything but basic. It is one of the classics still of our time.As the media gets better this film has been remastered and given the Blu-ray treatment. It may one day be a candidate for 4K. However, you will be so impressed with this film that the presentation media whether Blu-ray discs or streaming that the technical adjustments will be negligible to your viewing pleasure.I will not go into too much detail of the story as it is possible someone really has not seen this film before.The basic story is about a British officer that sees past the varied politics of the time and is able to find unique ways to help the Arabs create their own homeland whether they want it or not. However interesting the story is what makes this film unique is the stable of star actors, including of course Peter O'Toole, and extraordinary cinematography. The underlying music will stay with you for years.Many people have unique values as to what they would like to see in a movie. For me this film was excellent.

Not a great as I hoped and wanted it to be,"Story Summary: the story is about Thomas Edward Lawrence, dubbed
Lawrence of Arabia. A military Intelligence Officer from Great Britain, who united the Arab tried against the Turks during the WWIAnalysis: whilst not everyone will be familiar with the story of Lawrence of Arabia, the name surely will have some recognition. It's an epic tale that has been done justice enough in the 1962 version. One would hope that the story will not receive a remake or reboot. The beginning seems much stronger then the second and latter part.Dialogue: 6/10 while the script is good, sometimes it does feel a bit one-sided from the English perspective. A bit more Arab perspective would have given the story more body and thus more realistic dialogue. It's by no means bad, just not perfect. What is lacks sometimes is the feeling of being in Jordan when it comes to the conversation especially when the locals are talking with each other. The characters sometimes feels 2 dimensional, including LawrenceActing 7/10: the acting is well done. Theatrical, but that was where movie making was at the time. It does feel like the movie looses some focus towards the last hour. The main character is camp but kinda interesting too, but not likeable or relatable.Costume & Make up 7/10: most of the actors look like they belong in the movie. On the make up. The movie was produced in a different time. The bigger roles, like Prince Faisal and Auda Abu Tayi are played by non Arab actors.Local actors surely would have taken it to a different level. But the movie was made in a different time. That said, the effort to make English actors kind of look Arab is well done. What gives it away is not the look per se, but the mannerisms and voices. The whole film seems to have no female roles. There is an American journalist, who is a bit over the top and doesn't come across realistic.Camera, Visuals & Editing 8/10: Having been to the deserts in Jordan myself it looks good. The backdrops of Jordan and England are amazing. The movie has tried to film on as much places possible where Lawerence had been. For the other parts Spain and Morocco had been used. And it all blends amazing. Without revealing too much, but some of the shoots are stunning. Sometimes the footage is a bit dark, but this occurs during the night, so it is realistic although not always as clear to seen what is going on in detail. The interval goes on so long that I though some footage was missing.Special Effects 9/10: nothing bothers, which is surprising for such an old movie. It look all realistic.Music 8/10: very scenic and epic. Some more tribal Bedouin music would have made it perfect.Note on realism: As someone who has travelled through the Middle East, the depiction of the resentment between tribes is recognisable. The movie is a great attempt to be faithful to the memoir or Lawrence. Who seems to have acted in good faith. Whilst later the real world land borders were drawn by France and the UK, leading to some of the lasting tensions in the Middle East today. As mentioned before there's understanding for Arabic people who would not enjoy some depictions and aesthetics.Overall summary 6/10: the movie is clearly dated and has some interesting moments. Analysis of this movie being the best one of all time seems melancholic. The movie has many flaws especially the desert crossing scenes. The pace there is high and it lacks the absolute suffering of what it should have been in real life. The film does well to highlights issues and for that it can be praised. The depicting of Arabs is interesting, but far from always correct.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

In an age when sumptuous set-pieces can be effortlessly conjured-up by computer programmers, this truly authentic feast of cinematic vision still possesses the power to blow your mind. This is the real thing. The wide-sweeping vistas of desert wilderness are not special-effects; they are REAL. And they look real. Long views, sweeping pans and takes sustained over minutes are realised with a clarity, colour and vividness that absolutely melt your heart. That imagery is a more believable conduit to this complex man's evolving obsession with Arabia than the narrative itself.Every scene is a breathtaking study in light and colour, character and dialogue. Every second is worth seeing and every word worth hearing. And its theme music is as iconic as the man himself.The inimitable Peter O'Toole with his blonde hair, steely-blue eyes, haunting expressions and mood swings, commands your attention in every take. His Lawrence is a man swallowed up by a personal sense of destiny, striding between his cynical and prosaic taskmasters and a doomed belief in what might be achieved with superhuman effort. Omar Sharif never played a better role as foil to his capricious hero. Unusually, there are no leading ladies. And they're certainly not needed. A love interest would have cheapened the entire presentation. Here is a story about the romance of time and place. As that other great Arabian traveller and admirer of the ideal - Wilfred Thessiger - once remarked; ""women spoil everything"".This is a long movie. Those with short attention-spans raised upon sausage-machine editing are doomed to find it dull, tedious, boring, slow and all of the other criticisms that fall from the lips of a generation accustomed to x-box action sequencing. But if you are blessed with a longer vintage, then Lean's masterpiece will swallow you up as surely as the desert itself.",,Anonymous,Biography

Sometimes I think that line was crossed.I won't engage any of the anachronistic criticisms I see here. The film was made in a different time with different viewer expectations than those of our own. Deal with it. At the same time, yeah, the attitudes toward ""the natives"" are a bit much at points.I do feel sorry for the families of those who come off somewhat badly and were in real life much better people than the film allows. As often, it's done to set up the lead actor in opposition to second-rate people and a harsh environment that must be overcome, when either or both were actually more benign than shown.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The endless epic,"The voyage of a conqueror starts with an affection and curiosity towards a place. T. E Lawrence's s story is that of a conqueror and his voyage starts in the desert of Arabia.Lawrence of Arabia Is a fascinating epic that can be viewed in more than one way. The story starts with T. E Lawrence played by Peter O. Toole, dying and the following story is then told as a flashback. The story that follows is that of the middle eastern campaign during WWI and we follow Lawrence on his epic adventure to help the Arabs fight against the Turkish and gain their freedom.As we follow Lawrence through his journey, he becomes somewhat corrupted as his humanity is tested several times during the movie. Lawrence goes from a passive being afraid of violence, to a being that ravishes in it. His character arc still to this day says a lot about how once's surroundings can affect your mentality and how your mentality and psyche can become corrupted. We even get a scene in this movie where Lawrence asks the general to be reassigned as he fears his mind is being lost and therefore him becoming a dangerous person.The dialog in this film is unusual for its time, given that many films from that period have a dialog filled with references that becomes dated. The references and dialog in this film appears in many ways modern, and it adds so much to the film. The moral of this story and Lawrence's moral code is: ""Nothing is written"" and ""your fate is not determined"".When it comes to epics, this alongside ""2001 a space odyssey"" stands as a somewhat definition of the genre, and yet they are widely different. This movie has a linear structure in the way it is told, and it is therefore an easy experience to follow the plot, even though the duration of the film is very long. Lawrence of Arabia features some truly magnificent shots all filmed in 70mm Panavision which makes every scene look like a work of art. The locations used in the film is easily one of the best in movie history and they are so memorable.With a straightforward plot and beautiful camerawork, the cinematography and music certainly do not let the film down. When it comes to great cinematography this movie is in its own league and features some top of the shelf camera work. Every scene is as I said a piece of art and the director David Lean went to great length, to make them that way. You get beautifully shot scenes of sunrises and astonishing scenes of the dunes featuring mirages. The scene in which Sherif Ali appears in the distance almost as if he is sailing on illusionary water is one that stands out among a frighting number of great scenes.You can't review this masterpiece without mentioning its musical score. This film won a much-deserved Oscar for its score, and it is one of the best in movie history. The melody is of a simple nature, yet it's almost as it is tailored to fit each scene specifically. Maurice Jarre composed the score, and he truly made a score fit for the masterpiece that is the movie itself.While I understand that watching a 3 hour and 40-minute film may seem like a daunting task, this film is nothing other than a pleasant viewing all together. There is so much to take away from this movie and I could talk for literal days about it. I enjoyed the viewing of this film thoroughly and I highly recommend it.My rating: 95/100.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A masterclass in storytelling, however..","A Masterclass In Storytelling, but..First, let me just say I thought the cinematography was beautiful. Absolutely stunning. The acting was fantastic, the storytelling was majestic, the culture clashes, the brutal violence, the gorgeous and completely unforgiving lands.. All brilliant!That being said. This picture is often described as ""one of the best films of all time"". No.. There, I said it!As I said the acting was top class. My issue was Peter O'Toole's portrayal of T. E. Lawrence. Often I felt the performance was just too effeminate to be believable. I mean, hinting at homosexuality is one thing but he was being portrayed as the most camp and flamboyant man in documented history. I find it hard to believe these hard men would've followed and taken orders from someone if he was truly prancing and floating around quite like that.Also, the run time of nearly 4 hours was just too long.",,Anonymous,Biography
A saga of epic proportions..,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" had been on my must-watch movies list for a long time. There was so much I had heard and read about it. A lot had been written about this epic saga of T.E. Lawrence as being one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, revered by many great directors including Martin Scorsese.I finally got a chance to see it recently, and considering all the good things I had heard about it, I must admit that my expectations were quite high.""Lawrence of Arabia"" tells the story of Lt. Colonel T.E. Lawrence, focussing on his war experiences in Arabia during World War I. A topic of such vast proportions needed an equally ambitious project to pull it off, and indeed, the filmmakers have put in a lot of efforts in painting this huge canvas and achieving what they'd set out to. Peter O'Toole plays the eponymous T.E. Lawrence. The film starts out with the accidental death of T.E. Lawrence in the present. The film then flashes back to narrate the story of how Lawrence was sent on a mission to evaluate the situation in Arabia, pertaining to Prince Faisal and his revolt against the Ottoman Turks.Rest of the film then shows Lawrence's own involvement in leading the Arabs in the battle against Turks. So needless to say, you are presented with extravagant battle scenes, and long, never-ending desert treks, Lawrence's new-found friendships, his emotional ups and downs and some difficult choices that he is presented with. The director heavily indulges in showing off the beautifully shot desert landscapes (with the excellent Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young).""Lawrence of Arabia"" lived up to my expectations during most of its long running time. In fact a lot more during the first two hours of the film. But something happened in the final act. Somehow the whole film seemed to go a bit awry and disoriented for some reasons which I am finding difficult to put in words. Suffice to say that it wasn't the overwhelming experience I thought it would be. For one, I think the film could have easily been cut short. A lot of time has been spent on desert treks and their long journeys through it. Yes, these scenes do require detail to show the hardships these men must've faced while crossing those perilous desert lands. But I somehow feel the director went too far in his attempt. So much so that the events taking place in the final 30-45 minutes seem too abrupt and disconnected.There have been films as long as this and longer, but they have enough substance to fill those long hours. There are sufficient examples ('The Godfather Part II', 'Schindler's List', 'Seven Samurai' to name a few). ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has enough substance, yes, but a running time of 216 minutes, was simply not necessary.That aside, the film, of course has plenty of plusses: As mentioned earlier, Freddie Young's cinematography is superb, so is Maurice Jarre's inspirational score. David Lean does a great job in directing this script by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, but falls a little short of expectations in terms of distribution of the content. Nonetheless, this was in itself a magnificent, ambitious project and a difficult one at that, so it is not fair to nitpick too much.The cast: Peter O'Toole's performance is widely talked about. For me, frankly it was somewhat inconsistent. Not to take away any merits from the Legendary actor's acting talent. He was, in fact, great in some scenes. But I was slightly put off by the sometimes nervous, sometimes excessively confident behaviour. Then there were some scenes in which he went way over the top in displaying his emotions. Maybe it was the director who wanted O'Toole to act like that and O'Toole gave the director what he wanted.The supporting cast is great, especially Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness. I had seen Anthony Quinn in Fellini's ""La Strada"" earlier and it was great to see him display such versatility.All said, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a great film, but falls a tad short of being a masterpiece in my book.However, it definitely deserves to be watched at least once by any serious lover of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Every Grain of Sand,"David Lean is probably the most famous English movie director of all time (with the possible exception of Alfred Hitchcock). Initially he made small, tidy pictures from English classics, often co-directed with playwright-performer Noel Coward. And then, in an unlikely partnership with producer Sam Spiegel, he became an international star. His film ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" became a worldwide success.Five years later, the two men decided to collaborate again. This time over ""Lawrence of Arabia"", which Sam Spiegel had bought the rights to a few years earlier. However, the film was close to not being made at all. Spiegel didn't think the unknown Peter O'Toole was the right man for the lead in such a large production. It was only after having seen O'Toole's screen test that the producer gave him the thumbs up.The film takes place during World War I. It describes how Thomas Lawrence, a young English officer, participates in the Arab revolt against the Turks. His bravery soon makes him a respected leader.Due to David Lean's obsession with details, the making of the movie became problematic right from the start. The first, seemingly simple scene, where O'Toole is riding through the desert on his camel, took a month to shoot. And things weren't made easier by the fact that Lean used a newly invented Super Panavision camera so heavy that the film crew had to mount it on a small locomotive to be able to move it.However, the film was a great success, at home and internationally. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" filled cinemas in London and Madrid for over a year. It also won Oscars in seven different categories, one of which went to Spiegel (as producer) and one to Lean (director). But sadly, they had a terrible falling out in the following years. After David Lean accused Sam Spiegel of grabbing too large a share of the movie's profit, the two men never spoke to each other again.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Grand Epic with Stunning Visuals, Elevated by Omar Sharif's Presence","Lawrence of Arabia is undeniably one of the most visually breathtaking films ever made, a cinematic achievement that captures the vast beauty of the desert and the complexities of war and identity. David Lean's direction is masterful, and Peter O'Toole delivers an iconic performance as T. E. Lawrence.However, what truly elevates the film is Omar Sharif's commanding presence. His portrayal of Sherif Ali is a testament to his talent and charisma, making him one of the greatest Egyptian actors to leave a mark on Hollywood. From his unforgettable entrance in the desert to his layered performance, Sharif adds depth, nobility, and emotional weight to the story. His chemistry with O'Toole is compelling, making their dynamic one of the film's strongest aspects.While the film's length and pacing may feel overwhelming at times, its grandeur, cinematography, and historical depth make it a classic worth experiencing.A visually stunning epic that showcases Omar Sharif's undeniable talent and Hollywood presence, even if its pacing can be demanding.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""...Nothing is written""","What a gigantic cinematic boom Lawrence of Arabia makes. It's an epic that's controlled by one of the most assured and basically visionary directors that the material could have asked for. And it leaves its final thirty minutes not with a totally triumphant hero, but one with more conflicts and despair than one might expect. Not that I would really expect a lot of Lawrence of Arabia on total fact, even as it is based on T.E. Lawrence's writings. Like with any other given number of biopics, we're given the 'character' of Lawrence, not the full-on man himself. And in Lean's ultra-masculine, heroic take on the man, it's got enough great scenes to knock others in other films out of the park.Why then did I feel as if I hadn't seen one of the very greatest films ever made? It's definitely not that i can't understand why some would say it so, as it contains that great need to tell a story that's worth telling (in the context it's presented), and with a cast of characters acted with the most finite of professionalism and passion. It's also the sort of picture, rarely made today it seems, that without a doubt is one of those meant to be seen on the big screen- practically all of the images captured by Lean and his crew out in that desert make a very convincing kind of metaphor for the picture, as man, no matter how much he ambitions or seeks out this or that or might think he is invincible for a little while, is quite small when seen in the 'grander scheme of things.'But like some other epic works I can think of, like Alexander Nevsky (albeit its short length I think of it in epic terms), or even more contemporary the Lord of the Rings, amid such a brave and undaunted work of superior craftsmanship there are some things that, subjectively, aren't totally in synch for me. One of those, chiefly, is Peter O'Toole's performance. It was his first big starring performance, and it's sort of mixed for me how I view him in this character. He ends up, by virtue of his own talents, being terrific in many scenes, like when he has to come to a fate with the same man he previously had saved en-route to Ackaba, or when he returns back to Cairo to tell of his ""impossible"" victory.Even the last half hour or so that I mentioned before is better than expected, as we see more of an opening up of the sort of mythical representation of the character of Lawrence. But for a lot of it I just didn't really see him as much as a conflicted and ambiguous legend as I did as a, well, light-voiced British guy. In some scenes I almost felt as if it was someone still coming to terms with playing such a larger-than-life guy, and with the same attitude and mannerisms of someone doing (not to put him down too much but) lesser-ring theater. He's actually kind of 'neat' for the role, and unfortunately in comparison with his counterparts he's not one of the most notable parts even as Lawrence himself is the main juice of the picture.Meanwhile, other actors get their time on screen wonderfully, with Shariff probably never (or rarely) better as Sheriff Ali, as he and Lawrence have the most fascinating connection of all. Quinn is quite good, if a little hammy (as to be expected) as the Tayi, the rival warrior who first wants gold and then goes along with what Lawrence might have in mind. It's always great to see Guiness with such control and nuance with a character who gets such limited time when compared with the other supporting players. They're all pit in a story that has a great energy in the first half, as Lawrence goes from shuttered in soldier to a near prophet for a whole mass of Arabs by crossing a desert deemed uncrossable, and storming a city thought to have been impossible to take. Then, as he continues military campaigning in part two however, things start to change, if maybe a little too fast one might think following his tense scene with Jose Ferrer's character.And all the while this is put to Lean, with his DP Freddie Young, in creating a larger-than-life atmosphere for a man who has highs and lows of how his perception goes, including to himself. A lot of times as Lawrence and/or his men went across the desert, or a character looked into the near abyss of sands, it was nearing being too picturesque, as if the style vied to overtake the substance. But Lean is always in service of the story, and the deliberate but wise screenplay. Not matter how grandiose Lean can get, he shoots with a sense of some conviction. One more note that makes Lawrence of Arabia quite worthwhile is the musical score, the kind that you rarely hear in big studio pictures with the exceptions of maybe John Williams or Howard Shore. Of all the Oscars given out to this film, the only one probably more deserved after Lean was for Jarre's compositions, which compliment the images and add just the right touches of emphasis.It's not un-probable that I could come back to Lawrence of Arabia some years from now and maybe even find it greater, even more towering an achievement of using insane lots of money to add flesh and bones to adapting history onto celluloid. For sure, if it ever does get re-released again, I probably would even check it out. That I might not put it so high in my favorite films though is also hard to deny: it is, like Lawrence, ""not perfect"". But it is still quite a ride getting through it all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Very Good Film, but...Perfect? That's Debatable","There are way too many reviews here labeling this film as ""the greatest ever,"" ""perfect"" and/or containing similar such effusive praise. And while I can't argue with the cinematography (which truly is impressive), or the acting (++), there are a few issues I have with 'Lawrence of Arabia' that prevent me from joining others who want to put it on the highest shelf. Hear me out.Plot In a Nutshell: British officer T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) aids the Arab cause in their struggle against the Turks during the Great War.For starters, this is a flawed hero at best, and not an emotionally attractive one. It's easy to get behind the cause of Ben-Hur, for example, or Spartacus (which, by the way, are veritably epic films in their own right which preceded 'Lawrence of Arabia,' and which most reviewers here seem to have forgotten). Both Ben-Hur and Spartacus are wronged, we see it happen and we feel for the characters. Then they spend the rest of their films trying to right those wrongs, which they largely do. The same can be said for more recent epics like Braveheart and Maximus in 'Gladiator.' What exactly is so emotionally appealing about Lawrence? He hasn't been wronged in any way. He's just a soldier doing his job. OK. That's nice, but it lacks the powerful impact of Maximus getting revenge on Commodus or the slaves all standing up and saying ""I am Spartacus"" in a show of unity with that titular character. LOA just doesn't have this. There's no impetus to care about Lawrence as there is for the 'heroes' in those other epic films.Secondly, the depiction here is wildly inaccurate. Lawrence's own brother said he couldn't recognize the character that was supposed to be his kinsman, and he actually went 'on tour' appearing on talk shows to denounce the film! That's not good. No one is around to tell us who Spartacus really was, or William Wallace, but we do know about Lawrence. And what we get in this film is, simply put, a very loose interpretation of reality. I was surprised to learn that several other British officers were already embedded with Arab tribes and were already carrying out commando raids prior to Lawrence's arrival. Watching this film you get the idea this was his brainchild and it absolutely was not. Anthony Quinn's character (Auda abu Tayi) does not abandon the cause as is shown here. It goes on and on. You can read all of the many inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article of this film.Lastly, the film limps to a conclusion. The 2nd half, or specifically the last hour, is not very captivating. It portrays the political differences and difficulties between the various Arab tribes and the British Army as they all vie for control of Damascus. It's actually kind of tedious. And then....it just ends. Lawrence decides to go home. Credits roll. That's uh....interesting. But one thing it's not is perfect. Anyone watching knows this.""Lawrence of Arabia"" was a highly influential film (for George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and others), and it certainly deserves a place in cinematic history, but beware of those stating that this film is 'unmatched' or that it's 'the greatest film ever.' That's extremely high praise and difficult to prove. In my book, having just watched it, it's neither.8/10. Very good but has some baggage. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Because of its length and less-than-satisfying ending, not for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best,"Definitely one of the best films ever made. The other films apart, this was the masterpiece for David Lean, Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff.

To outsiders the movie can be deemed as long, sprawling and slow-moving, but it's truly wonderous in its scope with A++ acting from an A+ acting ensemble and the locations were second to none, but that's what one would expect from a David Lean production.Women might not like it as there were no speaking parts for them, but tell me where would even one line fit for a woman?A must see and one of the essentials in movie history.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Scenic, boring, incoherent gay fantasy.","The reputation of this movie is amazing. Yes, it has some arresting desert scenes--though far too many. But otherwise it is in almost every way a very bad film. There's an interesting story behind it, but that story is barely suggested by a thin and wooden script.Mainly it's about the British superman, Lawrence, who out-Arabs the Arabs with his ability to endure pain. Beyond that it's a gay fantasy, in which Lawrence gets to parade around in flowing robes, with a phallic dagger at his waist, exchanging soulful words and glances with Omar Sharif, accompanied by his adored young boys, and even get sodomized by a Turk. The gay man triumphs over the manly army types, so he's a double superman.Since this love can't speak its name it comes out in the unexplored, weirdly incoherent suggestions of inner conflict in Lawrence. He kills and says he likes it. Why? Who knows. The whole movie is a set of dots too far apart to connect. A few map shots might have helped understand the military situation, but all we get is names. That desert is too hot to cross, so they cross it. They trudge and trudge. Then they get there. The episodes, and the dialog, seem to float in the ether, without adequate context for understanding or emotional involvement. While Lean's camera caresses O'Tooles swishy sashaying, ice-blue eyes and golden hair, O'Toole emotes with a scenery-chewing extremity unseen since the silents. I think Valentino was more subtle. Alec Guinness contends for honors in the overacting contest, with his blue-eyed, over-enunciating sheik. Only Jack Hawkins gives a decently restrained performance.Jarre's music is jarring. Too loud and poured over all like syrup. The movie screams EPIC with its big shots and cast of hundreds, and apparently a lot of people buy it. But this emperor is naked, and after all these years, badly sunburned.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece,"This film is an absolute classic. It's an amazing story of one man's influence on an entire culture. A great cinematic portrayal of the Arabs' life in the vast expanse of the desert. It very deftly depicts the political waves of the time, how the colonizing nations of Europe tried to exploit the less civilized nations of Asia and the middle east.But the theme and crux of the film is about one man: Lawrence. A man with the guts and bravery to inspire Millions, yet a man who was psychologically tormented. Lawrence, essentially, seems to be a manic-depressive. Most of the time he has a courageous nothing-can-kill-me attitude, with unending hope and optimism. But then he falls into a pit of depression and loneliness, and even hopelessness.I found this apparent dichotomy in the man to be most fascinating, and it is portrayed very skillfully by the actor who plays Lawrence. The contrast in Lawrence is an interesting historical perspective on the man, and a great allegorical perspective on men in general.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Great Character!  A lot of Camels!,"I missed this film when it came out fifty years ago. I was just a kid. I've seen portions of it on TCM at times. I finally got a copy and saw it. It is is a wonderful story of one the most interesting figures in history. It is intelligent and exciting and frustrating. I began by accepting the verisimilitude of this film. I then watched the incredible effort put forth by Lawrence as he barged his British rear end into the affairs of the Arabs to meet and defeat the Turks. For me, the politics were the most interesting. The British Empire with its pack of windbags, bringing the world to its knees. We speak of the Nazis. What about the way the British treated the Bedouin populations in the name of imperialism. Still, as a snapshot of the strange landscape of social expansion, this movie is wonderful I found Lawrence's character utterly insufferable at times, his arrogance and insensitivity; but, by the same token, he was great to watch. I wish I'd had a chance to see this on the big screen. One issue I would take is that there is an awful lot of time following camels running across the desert.

Amaze Yourself: See Lawrence of Arabia,"Lawrence of Arabia is an amazing cinematic experience. You sit there and you are completely drawn into the story. The cinematography is simply breathtaking.

He plays a reluctant hero, who is eventually thrown off his rocker by his power. And yes the film is something like four hours long. And it is also true that those of you who have short attention spans may hate this film and claim it is boring. That is what today's movies have done. People think that something like 'Smokin' Aces' is amazing. I just generally feel bad for them that they don't have the capacity to view something like Lawrence of Arabia.

The battles were all done in reality, which gives the film a sort of richness. Something that films like '300' lack.If you have any doubts about seeing this, let me just say this.

Epic (role),"With a stellar (male) cast, this movie can deservedly call itself an epic.

The acting could be called overly dramatic, but it fits very nice with the grand scope of the whole story(line). One of the most interesting facts and something people mostly don't realize: There's no speaking role for a woman in this movie.

"Stunning in so many ways, grand and intimate and surprising!","Lawrence of Arabia (1962)Funny, but this epic masterpiece starts with a bit of clumsy direction, an almost (almost) corny motorcycle crash. And then the movie begins in more earnest with the rise and triumph of the title character. The production values seem to never flag from the moment we arrive in Africa (shot in Morocco and Jordan, mostly), with embracing scenery, huge casts of extras (and horses), unusual levels of excitement that seem historically about right, and some intensely wonderful acting.This is a gutsy, highly polished British movie from the end of the great Golden Age of this kind of great dramatic style. The story is fascinating and grand, and the scenery is absolutely one of the central points throughout. You get sucked in and swept away with all the huge wide and often silent desert landscapes. And most of all, the story is astounding. It's about a man who is exceptional--a real man, not Bruce Willis in some office tower.Peter O'Toole is at his best here. David Lean, the director, seemed to know how to keep him both rebellious and restrained. (If you see a later film, like ""The Ruling Class,"" you'll see a typical overcooked performance from O'Toole, equally remarkable I suppose but less finessed.) This portrayal of the daring British military officer in the Arabian desert is not meant to be perfectly factual (there are lots of battles about the facts, online and even in the opening scenes of the movie), it's meant to be moving and historically significant, and historically close enough.And it's personally impressive. This is a story that takes place on two main levels. One is the man's new understanding of the politics of the mideast in the 1910s and 20s. The other is the man himself, this wild and cunning and sometimes fearless and sometimes almost insane man who is able to adapt to Arab life and enter its problems from within and yet still remain thoroughly British in his attitudes. It's quite something to see, and O'Toole makes it believable more than you'd expect. If you met the real Lawrence of Arabia you might object that he's not playing his part quite right.The movie also has lasting importance as the Arab world (or the Middle East as it is still called) goes through more political change. It makes what Lawrence accomplished all the more profound. You might say that if he hadn't done it someone else would have, that the rise of Arab power we inevitable. Maybe. But that's not what happened, and this is. In a way, the whole movie is about Lawrence trying to unify the Arabs. His goal at first is to defeat the Turks who are occupying Arabia, but it eventually becomes more personal. He identifies with the plight of the Arabs but never quite becomes one.There are things that bring this down to earth a little, especially the playing with clichés (the photographer is good but sort of patched on, and some of the Arab characters are thinly sketched). But there is a host of wonderful actors, the one true Middle Easterner being Omar Sharif (he's Egyptian by birth, and he's quite good here). The other main ones are such good actors you don't quite remember they are English to the core--Alec Guinness and Claude Rains (quite old here, but still wonderful). Anthony Quinn (originally Mexican) is really good though his fake nose needed some better color--a weird thing for them to mess up on in a hugely complicated movie like this.Most of all it's O'Toole and more O'Toole, appropriately. A penetrating, original, almost possessed performance within a gorgeous, long but not too long film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence of Arabia,"'Lawrence of Arabia' is in many ways a tale of two halves, with the first being much better and even in quality than the second which, at times, verges on the comedic, and ultimately fades away, leaving you with a certain empty feeling. Perhaps that was the point. I thought certain key scenes and characters were overplayed, especially those involving sheik Auda.Like all epics it has its moments of vulgarity in the mass action scenes - these are unavoidable I guess - but the beauty and harshness of the desert have never been captured more perfectly on film.All in all, a film of rare excellence and vision.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Miraculous,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a classic among the classics, unanimously praised for its dazzling imagery, haunting music and the hypnotic performance of Peter O'Toole. And how David Lean got the guts to shoot a 4-hour long epic film in the desert, with no female role, no romance whatsoever, with more meditation than sheer action, to create one of the most glorious cinematic experiences is a miracle like only the magic of film-making can provide every once in a while, like ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""The Godfather"".As said Roger Ebert in his most interesting review, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a masterstroke of genius in the way it went against all the movies' conventions for the sake of pure creation. To make his film, Lean had probably to visualize how photogenic would the immensity of the desert be, how a sunset in a red sky would amaze eyes, how the iconic entrance of Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali would challenge every viewer. And Ebert couldn't have been more accurate because while watching ""Lawrence of Arabia"", I couldn't stop imagining the magical effect of these shots in the darkness of a movie theater, seeing this vague little strain in the middle of a mist turning into a thin silhouette until the figure of the black-clad Sheriff Ali emerges on the screen: pure magic Lean trusted both his minds and our eyes.See it's impossible to dissociate ""Lawrence of Arabia"" from the sensational experience each frame conveys. And Lean, who had just directed another acclaimed Best Picture winner, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", handles his material with much more confidence if it was ever needed. Think of the overture in the dark. Imagine yourself sitting in a movie theater and hearing the heart-pounding drums of Maurice Jarre before the violins let escape one of the most iconic movie themes. Imagine your ears transported by this melody, visualizing in the dark, a majestic and frightening sun, an endless desert, a mysterious Oriental Goddess that scares as much as fascinates  after such a set-up, the rest is history and I don't think I would bring anything new to the debate. This is why I want to develop the aspect that can easily get unnoticed in such a grandiose epic: the script.In ""Lawrence of Arabia"", the lines flow with the poetry of a Greek tale with some shadowy truths resonating when you put them in historical perspective. T.E. Lawrence was the man who guided the Arab Revolt against the Turkish colonization during World War I. In a way, he embodies this quote from the New Testament: ""No prophet is accepted in his own country"", he's not a prophet of course in the literal meaning of the word, but he ignited an extinguished flame, the flame of a pride, distancing himself from the decadence of the British Empire to embrace a romantic cause, romantic because lost. It's not an Englishman leading the Arabs; it's an outcast leading an outcast people. And pay attention, there is this incredible mix of madness and inspiring masochism in the eyes of this man who plays with fire without even minding the pain.O'Toole's eyes are pure and his face like graved in a vivid marble, as if he incarnated heroism in its most classical personification, he speaks the truth and acts according to it. In his first encounter with Sheriff Ali, he delivers an unforgettable and powerful rant: ""So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe... so long will they be a little people, a silly people. Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are."" These lines still resonate as true and it seems like the Arabs didn't learn from History, earning them one of the worst reputations in all the Western World (not everything is to be blamed on Arabs though, but that's not the point). You can tell in O'Toole's voice that he's sincere and this sincerity is displayed in the next crucial scene when he overtakes his roles and encourages Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) to fight. The scene features another powerful saying: ""Great things have small beginnings"". This very line echoes another of the film's many extraordinary moments.After having miraculously survived the crossing of the implacable Nefud desert, Lawrence rides his camel back to find a man lost in the Desert and he succeeds off-screen, leading to one of the greatest moments in the film when one of Lawrence's two servants rides his camel toward him, screaming under the triumphant core of Maurice Jarre. This exploits earns him the respect of the Arabs, a people that value bravery. Lawrence becomes 'Awrence, one of them, finally wearing his iconic white suit. His act showed how even the greatest conquest start with an act of brotherly love and solidarity, and the Arabs couldn't defeat the Turks, before defeating their own selfishness and dividing tribalism. The romanticism of the fight scenes and their exhilarating effect on Lawrence who dances his victory on a Turkish train and enjoys the madness of the war contrasts with the pessimism of the end, where the old politicians replace the young warriors.Men like Lawrence would only incarnate dreams, lost in the lies of political calculations, greed, profit and power, condemning the Arabs to fantasize over and over again on Cordoba and its ""two miles of lighting in the streets, when London was a village"". It didn't last as much as Cordoba but Lawrence of Arabia represents a beautifully romantic parenthesis in Arab history that makes the rest of the Century extremely depressing. But given the events of the Arab Spring, the Arabs are conquering their pride back like the Spanish did for Cordoba, there is still a light of hope after all.At least, one of the most revered films in America and most defining of American Cinema would be about the Arabian pride how delightfully ironic!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The GREATEST Epic Ever Made!!!,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962), is possibly the Best Film ever made in the Epic Genre. The film is directed by David Lean (Steven Spielberg's Mentor), who has made another Best Picture and Director win in the 1957 Classic, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'Toole and Alec Guinness. Lean is very unique, especially when it comes down to the cut of a scene, rather than a fade. Lean uses these methods to make the film more engaging instead of putting the audience on hold.One thing that I love about this movie is not just the sand, desert, costumes or camels, but mostly the Cinematography. The Scope of this film is gigantic in every way. The filmmakers used a special anamorphic lens to enhance the scale of the desert, which is breath- taking to the audience. The Scenes that were filmed are all real. David Lean had to wait for the right moment for the weather to hit its' mark.The movie is 3 hrs. long, with an Intermission, but it's worth the watch. Lawrence of Arabia is the kind of film that should be made today. Definitely in my Top 5 Favorite Films List!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Epics of All-Time,"Lawrence of Arabia is a classicist Epic directed by David Lean, and starring Peter O'Toole as the titular character T.E. Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it's use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.At almost four hours it's hard to imagine a film that wouldn't feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.The film deals with age old themes such as the ""fish out of water"" theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the Arab culture, Water is so precious it's worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it's masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Film At Its Finest,"This is without question, my favorite movie of all time. Alec Guinness and Peter O'Toole always captivate me in almost every movie they're in, but when they act together these two famed Shakespearian actors are the essence of what all actors should strive to become. The cinematography in this movie is unbeaten by anything in its time, or our time for that matter. The film-score is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The moment at the beginning with black screen and music playing set the mood for the film perfectly and amplified the feeling of anticipation and exhilaration. The plot of adventure and the story of T.E. Lawrence was exciting to the very end. Of coarse there were historical inaccuracies, but those can be overlooked for a movie like this. It's not a biography after all. See this movie and witness film-making at its finest.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Movie,"What can you say about such a great movie, that can give the reader an idea of the quality of the visuals, the acting, the story etc ? I had watched LoA before on TV; but as usual with widescreen movies on a 27 inch TV in the 80's, the film didn't leave any impression on me, except, that it's damn long. When in 1989 the remastered, means longer version, came back to the movie theater, I went with friends to see it again. What a difference. Already the prelude with the red curtains still closed beamed me back to the 50's/60's, when all big movies had music to create the right feeling before the movie really started. Great photography, wonderful music that stays with you for weeks, and of course the acting of all the great names make this movie one of the few films, that I can watch over and over again. This film made Peter O'Toole known to the world, as well introduced Omar Sharif to the western world, although he was already a big star in Egypt and other middle eastern countries. The added material - missing for the better part of 27 years - gives a whole new insight to the person of Lawrence and the circumstances of the creation of an Arabic world with united countries, in contrast to hundreds and hundreds of tribes, that were fighting each other all the time. Some critics didn't like the violence, that take place in several scenes; but I believe these scenes of murder and violence only add to the feeling, to watch actually a documentary of what was going on, instead of just watching a mainstream movie. And besides, any PG 13 movies from the last 15 years has far more violence, than any scene in this movie. If you also feel dizzy after couple of minutes, watching modern movies with their in average every 0.8 sec edits and you would love to see wide visuals, that give you the feeling you are in the desert or by the oasis etc, watch this movie and enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A History lesson,"A History lesson - no, not about the Arabs and WW I - about film history and the history of film criticism and possibly public taste in film.How could such a mind numbing film win so many awards and draw the crowds that it did? Possibly, the public is influenced by critics and award granters. I wager many came out thinking - such great reviews - I must have missed something; too bad I fell asleep. Others probably came out thinking - I'll never be hoodwinked by critics again!Some films can be thought of as acceptable/good or even excellent when view only once, but upon subsequent viewing loses much of its appeal. The fist time I saw the film, I was quite taken by it, and viewed the director's cut to enjoy the few minutes of deleted scenes. I couldn't identify the cut scenes and viewed it again with no success. Upon reflection I noted that those added minutes did not add to the enjoyment of the film and that the film might be even better with more scenes deleted. (Since then I have been unable to stay awake during an entire screening in about a half dozen attempts.) A quick perusal of IMDb rave reviews found that virtually all viewers had only seen the film once, and while very young. If seen again, most (I think all) would marvel at how different their memories are from reality.So, the recommendation is if you've not yet seen it, enjoy a peek into yesteryear and marvel at how tastes were so different and how lucky we are not to have such films anymore. If you saw it years ago, remember the old saying - You can never go home. Don't disappoint yourselves; it isn't as you remember. Everything was bigger and better when you were young.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A stunning feat of film-making unwearied by age,"Regularly regarded and spoken about as one of the greatest film-making feats of all-time, David Lean's seven time Oscar winning epic (clocking in at a bum-numbing three hours and 48 minutes), Lawrence of Arabia, remains to this day a staggering achievement, unwearied by age or the advancements that have come along since its release over 50 years ago.A director whose place amongst the most well-regarded artists in cinema is well earned after this effort and other features such as The Bridge On the River Kwai and Doctor Zhivago, Lean and his willing cast and crew went through well over twelve months of sweat inducing work to bring to Arabia to life on the big screen but their blood, sweat and no doubt tears were well worth it as the end results on screen showcase a film full of heart and soul.Filmed in the unforgiving wind-swept landscapes of Jordan where the films subject matter T.E Lawrence once roamed, Lean alongside his DOP Freddie Young (whose work here has become the stuff of legend) crafted a magnificent cinematic spectacle for the whole world to enjoy as we follow Peter O'Toole's career making turn as the renowned British officer who defied the odds to unite warring Arab tribes in a fight against the Turkish armed forces in the conflict of World War 1.We don't get to see anything of Lawrence's backstory or history leading up to his plight in the dusty lands of a country he has studied and appreciated for years leading up his charge, but thanks to O'Toole's lived in performance and Robert Bolt's finely considered script (which was based heavily on Lawrence's own written recordings), Lawrence is one of cinema's most fully realized portrayals of an historical figure, one that lived a life most would only dare but dream of.Focusing largely on Lawrence's relationships with Alec Guinness's Prince Faisel, Anthony Quinn's Auda Abu Tayi and Omar Sharif's trusty offsider Sherif Ali, Lean's film takes place across an incredibly vast canvass as we get intimate character studies taking place around the unforgiving surrounds of the environment these men find themselves in, a world that is dangerous in itself and torn apart by a violent and constantly foreboding war.An inspiration to many a filmmaker in the years following on from its triumphant release (the worlds most esteemed director Steven Spielberg has long said this is his favorite film), one could spend hours analyzing every portion of Lean's grand opus, from the achievements it had in crafting its set pieces, the designs of its 100's of costumes through to the wrangling of the elements that played out around its conception, but simply put, Lean's film remains a touchstone epic that would never be bettered should someone dare attempt to replicate its tale.Final Say -A ground-breaking piece of cinema, the years have not wearied Lawrence of Arabia, a career high-point for all involved and a stunning piece of film history.5 camels out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

""" Nothing Changed at Dara, . .  He was The Same Man! ""","The true story of T.E.Lawrence is hidden somewhere inside his personal memoirs. For the adventure-seeking Englishman from Oxfordshire, the Middle East was a land so remote from his that surely a man could become a hero, if he found the right location or conflict. Lawrence himself was a self taught expert in many of his interests. Having graduated from prestigious places, made him even more sought after by authorities, both academic and military. The film "" Lawrence of Arabia "" is laced with many actual events taken from Lawrence's own accounts, and it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. That is not really important for the Hollywood version in which Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence with such uncanny precision, the character overlaps the actual man. To add to the authenticity are the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal who is superb in his part. Anthony Quinn is Auda abu Tayi and is so convincing, many actual Arabs on the set accepted him as one. The main actor who gain hundreds of accolades while filming is Omar Sharif who plays Sheriff Ali. Jack Hawkins plays, General Edmund Allenby and Anthony Quayle is Colonel Brighten. The Turkish General is played by none other than Jose Ferrer. Claude Rains is the sly and slippery French minister Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy is the American Newspaperman Jackson Bentley, seeking a story for his readers. When one views the film, it cannot but overwhelm as the vast but beautiful desert scenery and dramatic events convince the audience this film is fantastic in breath and scope. So highly recommended, it has achieved Classic status. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,"""Lawrence of the Arabia"" is not historically-accurate movie as one may think, judging by the title. However, it manages to prove itself as one of the greatest movie classics ever created.First of all, the movie achieves to portrait the vast landscapes, where the story takes place, in an adventurous and even romantic colors. The cinematography shots are definitely at its' peak in this movie. One may even feel like time-traveling back to those glorious events with the protagonist just to watch the beauty of the scenery that lies ahead of him or her.Second, the acting is mind-blowing, giving depth to the characters involved in the historical saga. Sometimes, it might be difficult to understand whether you see a real life person in front of you with incredibly complex character or is it just an actor portraying him. Anyone can clearly see how the values of main heroes affect every tiny bit of their difficult decisions.Third, the plot is not only perfectly executed, but is tightly connected to the scenery and personal struggle to make every single dream they have to come true. Actually, the events that take place make probably even more impact on main characters, leading to the final titles of the movie.Finally, the movie has one of the most memorable soundtracks, that will lie deeply in many hearts. Only a truly epic tale deserves to have such wonderful music.To cut the story short, this is a masterpiece created by David Lean. Forget about history for a while.

Epic.,"Yesterday I finally saw this amazing film. Long before seeing it, I was told several times that I can gain the best experience out of this film, by viewing it with the biggest screen possible. I'm sure that's probably true, but sadly I did not have the chance to do so. Instead, I watched this film on my personal computer. I do however hope, that I will have a chance to see it again, only on a much bigger screen. But I'd like to think that I got what this film was trying to achieve(and frankly, it did). And that is to be the most epic film ever made. The cinematography, the battle scenes, the music, the mood that is created by the surroundings(particularly the desert) - it all helps to create a grand epic masterpiece.The acting is mind blowing, too. Peter O'Toole's performance is convincing and it's amazing to see how the character slowly develops and becomes obsessed with the desert and in the end becomes completely lost in it's embrace. Alec Guinness' performance was also quite amazing and he acts his character out smoothly. Omar Sharif does a great work at portraying a strong character who is forced to watch his friend slowly plunge into madness.Possibly the only problem this movie has, is the length. It comes close to four hours, if I am not mistaken. But in my opinion the length is necessary. It is slow paced, but it just couldn't be any other way. It helps the film slowly develop to a very melancholic and somewhat bittersweet ending.It's a shame I didn't have the chance to see this film in the theaters, when it was originally released. See this film. It's basically the definition of epic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
As Close to Perfect as a Movie Can Get.,"Last week, I received the awesome privilege of being able to watch Lawrence of Arabia on the big screen at a local theater. I have seen this film multiple times. In fact, I own a DVD copy, but I have never seen it magnified. And yes, it makes a difference. You can actually see the grains of sand blowing around the Nefud desert. You feel the sun burning down as Lawrence rides through the scorching Devil's Anvil. And more than once, you see those blue penetrating eyes staring straight into your heart and know how a skinny, white British soldier inspired the Arab people to almost free themselves once and for all from imperialism.This won't be so much of a review as a reflection. Truly reviewing this movie would be a daunting task which I won't attempt now.If you haven't seen Lawrence, it is an experience worth having. True, at 216 minutes, it is longer than your average film. But unlike some films of this length the viewer stays involved. In fact, at the end of this film, I am always wanting more. It seems impossible that a people group could get so close to their goal only to turn back. And I want to see Lawrence and Sheriff Ali continue their strange, endearing fellowship past what this film shows. And unlike some biopics, we don't see some long drawn out story about how painful Lawrence's childhood was or follow him past his prime to see him sighing over lost opportunities. The ending is abrupt with no sense of conclusion. The whole thing seems like a big buildup to failure, but no one ever said Lawrence of Arabia could be put into a nice, neat box.At the beginning, T.E. Lawrence is stationed in Cairo in the maps room. He is portrayed as messy, reckless, and somewhat masochistic. He enjoys letting a match burn down to his fingers and ""not minding that it hurts."" He is called to the general's quarters by Mr. Dryden, of the Arab Bureau, for his knowledge of the Bedouin people. They want to send him to look for the Bedouin people and Prince Feisal. His mission is to assess the situation. That's a somewhat nebulous task, but Lawrence is enthralled. He gets to come out of his hidey hole in the maps room, out into the desert, and away from those stodgy British military folks. Lawrence has an obvious obsession with the Arabian culture and the desert. As we watch him riding his camel, he looks around him like a kid with his first slingshot.Lawrence's initial encounters with the Arabs are mixed. He gets along well with his guide only to see the man get killed the next day by another Arab merely for drinking from a well. Lawrence sees this as somewhat barbaric, but we can see his eyes sparkle when it happens. This is a physical tell. He has been raised to be a civilized British conservative, but his heart longs for the feuding and bloodthirst of the eastern world.Lawrence finds Prince Feisal and his people in the midst of a Turkish air strike. He is invited into the tent and speak out of turn. Feisal wants to hear what he has to say. Lawrence seems to desperately want to please this man and to ""out-Arab"" the Arabs. What is his motivation? Does he truly love the Arab culture so much? Does he wish to glorify himself as the one who could make it work? Is he just suicidal? Is he out to prove an agenda? Director David Lean (genius) makes the wise choice to leave this open. He never attempts to ""explain Lawrence."" This is why people are still obsessed with this movie 40 years later. Lawrence is a mystery.Lawrence breaks with his orders by deciding to do more than assess. He decides to help the Arabs take Damascus and will stop at nothing to make this goal a reality. Not ridicule, not the impassable desert, and especially not ""what is written"" will keep this white boy from dreaming the impossible dream. He dares to hope, to dream and creates a believer out of Sharif Ali and the rest of the Bedouin peoples.The film contains moments of grandeur, such as the battle scenes and the train raids. It also includes quiet moments around the fire, like when Sheriff Ali tells Lawrence he can choose his own name. This movie is a symphony, which has dynamics of highs and lows. This is a lost art in the film world today. Above all, there is the desert, which is more than the setting of the movie, it is a living thing which invites Lawrence into its danger and secrets. The desert is the seductress which pulls Lawrence into his long arduous path from conquering hero to possible madman to a man resigned. The dessert brings out the very best in Lawrence, and the very worst.The dialogue is precise and memorable. The music is gorgeous. The acting is superb. The only problem with this film is that I will never be able to understand who Lawrence truly was. That is the maddening genius of this film. I am going to make a bold statement here. I believe this is as close to being a perfect movie as one can get.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Simply the Best,"Epic biography of English colonel TE Lawrence who led the Arab revolt against the Turks during World War One.My candidate for greatest movie ever made. Superbly crafted in every way; sterling performances from the cast, a literate script by Robert Bolt, dazzling camera work by Freddie Young, detailed production design by John Box and a beautiful music score by Maurice Jarre. It is all seamlessly assembled together by director David Lean in a masterwork.The story follows Lawrence's un-military like beginning as a mapmaker in Cairo at the start of the war and his subsequent mission for the Arab bureau to report on the Arab revolt in the desert. While there, he gets the factional tribes to unite and gradually assumes command leading them on a series of daring military raids against the Turks which lead to his fame and legend.Then unknown, Peter O'Toole plays the lead and carries the film in a star making performance. He is ably supported by newcomer Omar Sharif in a large supporting role and a who's who list of seasoned performers. Claude Rains as a dapper politician, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal and Anthony Quinn as a fierce Arab warrior, Auda come off best but there is really not a false note in the entire group - everyone is solid.Leans previous editing experience is also on frequent display in the film as he composes his shots with the discerning eye of an editor and it shows in almost every scene; blowing out the match and transitioning to the rising desert sun, the dazzling motorcycle ride thru the English countryside during the opening sequence, Sheriff Ali's mirage-like emergence from the desert at the water well - its just one great scene after another.It is also a rare film that while epic in scale it never loses the intimate details of the characters or story - always holding your attention despite a length of almost four hours. The story itself still maintains relevance as it shows the factional nature of the middle east who's countryman are able to unite during war against a common enemy but can't keep it together while at peace.Anyway, watch this movie on the largest screen you can with the best sound system you can and prepare yourself for a mesmerizing journey through the desert.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lean's Grandest Spectacle,"To watch ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" is to be refreshed anew with the power of film, a visit to a pleasant oasis of perfect delight and contentment after crossing the arid desert of today's movie scene.I don't blame modern movie makers. I blame David Lean. He set an impossibly high standard with this film, an epic that plays like serial adventure, with rousing action sequences, multi-layered dialogue, gorgeous camera work, a deep-bodied musical score that feels at one with the desert, and a cast of exceptionally good actors all working at their absolute peaks, led by then-newcomer Peter O'Toole in the title role.His Lawrence is both bigger than life and quaintly eccentric, rubbing his fellow British officers the wrong way when we first meet him as a humble mapmaker in Cairo.""I can't make out whether you are bloody madman or just half-witted,"" says the general who sees him off on his new assignment, ""appreciating the situation"" among Bedouin warriors fighting the Turks in a World War I backwater.""I have the same problem, sir,"" is Lawrence's reply.O'Toole plays him as a consummate dreamer, unhappy in his Western skin and desirous of challenge and change, and for that ultimately no small risk to himself and others. This is soon revealed when he generously presents a revolver to his Bedouin guide Tafas (Zia Mohyeddin does a lot to establish the film's early exotic tone before bigger names arrive to play the Arab parts). Later, Tafas is killed by the gift when he attempts to use it on a strange figure approaching him and Lawrence across the mirror-like horizon. As time passes, we discover how dangerous Lawrence's gift of military power can be for other Arabs, too, and how that doubles back on Lawrence. ""Lawrence is a sword that cuts both ways,"" observes Alec Guinness's sly Prince Feisal late in the film, at which point Lawrence himself is about cut to ribbons.Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are very, very good playing off Lawrence and each other. Sharif is a revelation as Ali, shifting from dangerous adversary to calming ally and finally disaffected brother of Lawrence, the moral center as Lawrence strays into bloodlust and self-deification. Quinn provides much of the comedy as rival chieftain Auda, yet also the embodiment of Lawrence's unstable situation as he seeks to make a nation of Arabs. Auda doesn't understand the concept of ""Arabs."" He just sees rival tribes to chivvy with.One thing you are struck with watching ""Lawrence"" is it runs nearly four hours but feels more like 90 minutes. That's of course testament to a lot of things, but the editing by Anne V. Coates is not pointed out enough. No scene feels too long, and while that is a product of Lean's direction and a story by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Coates' clever cutting sets a standard for epics by working ""off-the-beat"" as it were, anticipating a scene change by making it a half-second early, as in the famous one where Lawrence blows out a match and leads us into the desert. Coates had great fabric to work with, of course, but tailors it perfectly. It's a wonder and a shame she and Lean didn't work together again.Some films, very good ones, start strong and fade in the stretch. Others build momentum as they go along. ""Lawrence"" is different. The film grabs you right away, and even as we lose some things we miss, we gain other elements we enjoy, creating an ever-changing spectacle that defines the Hollywood epic in its purest form (made by a Brit in Morocco, I know.) It keeps building like a symphony, unfolding with patient vibrancy like some perfectly realized life outside nature.Picking the best parts of ""Lawrence"" may be difficult, but it's easy for me to name my favorite scene. It's whatever part of ""Lawrence"" I am watching whenever I watch the film. Which isn't often enough!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies that I have seen,"Although I am big fan of David lean but somehow this movie remained unseen for a long time. Maybe I was afraid that it won't live up to the expectations and it was like ""yeah I will watch it sometime"". And when I did finally watch it, I kicked myself for not having watched it earlier. Over 200 minutes of movie but it was as if I never wanted it to get over.Based on the life of a Controversial British Officer T.E. Lawrence who helped Arabs fight Turks during World War I, this movie is a master piece in every aspect. No words can describe the brilliance of Peter O Toole, one great Shakespearean actor of our times, and his portrayal of Lawrence. His eyes said everything and the voice was just an asset which he used brilliantly as well. I can never forget the pained look in his eyes after he led the massacre of train full of turks. And then there is Omar Sharif who was born to do the role of Sheriff Ali.I have watched it twice and will watch it again whenever I get a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic of all Epics,"Lawrence of Arabia was directed by David Lean and stars Peter O' Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Guiness. It is rightly regarded as a masterpiece of the epic genre. The direction and cinematography emphasize the vastness and beauty of the desert. Characters are often depicted as tiny specks on the screen to give the impression of a never-ending landscape. This movie does not have a complex plot and is not dialogue-heavy. The epic score, the beautiful landscapes and the excellent performances are what makes this movie great. O' Toole is especially good as the larger-than-life T.E. Lawrence. The result is an amazing movie with great psychological complexity.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie that leaves you with the feeling,"Yesterday, at 24 years of age was the first time I watched the movie - the awards list, reviews and legendary Peter O'Toole were the fair and noteworthy reasons I had the movie on my watchlist for a long time and finally decided to dedicate my Saturday evening to it. It is a rare thing that a movie with running time of over 3 hours keeps you captivated all the way through it. I kept guessing and missgeussing what would happen next. The movie is wonderfully paced - Keeping the audience engrossed and intrigued all the way through it. The other thing to point out is that despite being a war, adventure and biography movie - there is never too much of action or too much of fighting - the movie is perfectly blanced. The last bit mot the least is that the desert scenes, the awesome actors make the movie beautiful and pleasant to watch - a rare occurence with the war movies.

The Best of the Best,"Lawrence Of Arabia will go down as one of the greatest movies ever made - if not THE best...i can't think of a simple flaw in this movie; everything in it is just powerful and astonishing. The cinematography was highly advanced for its time (especially the sunrise clip - which, for all you people who are a fan of modern CGI cinema, was a REAL clip..not fake!) Artists are what created this masterpiece. I am extremely pleased that LOA was a huge success with the academy - especially with David Lean who deserved the Oscar immensely, as he represents the honour of the British; considering British film-makers/actors have been ripped off by the Academy (Hitchcock,Harris, Burton, Sellers, and NOW O'TOOLE!!!!). Now talking about the Academy ripping off the British; this movie is the perfect example - Peter O'Toole!!!! His performance in this is ranked 1st on many lists of ""The greatest movie performances of all time"" (above Brando's 'On the waterfront' performance) and yet he was never acknowledged properly...his performance was memorizing. He made T.E look eccentric and strange, but truly special and unique in the first five minutes on screen!...his performance developed throughout; from the moral genius and good man - to the arrogant and war-obsessed general (he basically BECAME one of the barbaric Arabs). His performance is in my opinion THE greatest ever! The supporting roles were also stunning - Omar Sharif's superior warrior presence, yet emotionally vulnerable Sheriff Ali and Anthony Quinn's bad ass Auda Abu Tayi really captured the mentality and human environment of arabia during Lawrence's campaign. Guinness and Hawkins were also excellent...The screenplay is also incredible; Spielberg said that it was ""the greatest screenplay ever written for a motion picture"". Tis movie is truly the best of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE!,"I have watched Lawrence of Arabia only twice (and I own a home video of it) and all I can say if it is one of the best movies you can ever hope to seen in your life. Perhaps this is one of those timeless, flawless movies that will have an enduring effect on you as a moviegoer. David Lean is one of my favourite directors...I have watched many of his movies and have loved them all. However, I think the two David Lean movies that have had the greatest effect on me are 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.Based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence, the movie takes us to the depths in epic storytelling. From the beautiful Arabian deserts...and the horror of wars...to the trauma faced by the human heart and mind. The breathless cinematography is brilliant...it carries you away to Arabia with Lawrence. The story is so involving...the strategies needed to be devised, the problems needed to be faced, the fight to unite one race to battle against foreign invasion, and the greatness of a legendary man.I think the beautiful scenic locations are not the only things that make this a great movie. What matters is the human struggle in this movie. T.E. Lawrence faces the most traumatic elements that he cannot forget; his torture in a Turkish prison, the deaths of the two young Arabian boys who admired him (and whom he had adored so much), the moment when Lawrence had to kill Gasim to keep others satisfied, and the ultimate war itself and the killings of so many people. This in now way had been easy for him and these brilliant expressions are brought to life by Peter O'Toole in a performance that deserved an Oscar but never got him one.The actors are all magnificent. O'Toole is brilliant and plays Lawrence to perfection, Sharif is so expressive and admirable as Sharif Ali and who could forget the wonderful Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal. I watched this the first time thinking that Guinness was a real Arabian! A wonderful ensemble of actors...out of whom I found none to be less deserving of praise.David Lean's talent unleashes in this grand epic tale which has all the beauty a film should have...ranging from brilliant locations to emotions and elements going far beyond that. I call this a masterpiece and I am sure many would agree. Brilliant movie. A must for all to watch! Just be careful though...some elements are a bit disturbing.My rating- 10/10!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doesn't hold up over time,"I've been hugely disappointed with the best picture selection in 2022 and 2023. I was starting to yearn to experience a certified classic movie to see if the art of movie making was being lost. I picked ""Lawrence of Arabia"". I have not seen this movie before.Well, I sat through all 3 hours and 38 minutes, and have to say I was not impressed. The movie would have benefited from serious editing. A lot of the desert traveling scenes could have been cut down. I would say an hour could easily been edited out and it would have been less boring.I found the story of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" to be an emotional letdown. I was not drawn to the story or the character of Lawrence. The way the movie ended felt really incomplete. I thought the way O'Toole played Lawrence to be strange. Was he humble or war crazy? I also thought the big battle at Aqaba to be lame. After long scenes of them traveling through the desert, they just charge through Aqaba with their camels, and then it is over.To put it simply, I just couldn't emotionally connect with the story or the characters. It was a struggle to finish.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The camera work plays into the central brilliance of LOA which is the evocation of emotion. The breathtaking revolutionary score does this effortlesslyThe acting and plot
Lean captures the audiences hearts and feelings with a gut wrenching narrative that is so perfect so human and so empathetic. We believe in Lawrence trust his intentions grieve with him in his failings and celebrate uncontrollably in his victories. Peter O Toole unequivocally deserved an Oscar for this I performance as it would be an injustice not to rank this performance as one of the greatest landmarks in Hollywood acting and storytelling. It is O Tooles expression strange yet believable manners is so and unfailing charm that draw the audience in to the enigmatic eccentric character that is Lawrence of Arabia. His work is art. O Toole showcased the entire range of human emotion and did so not just convincingly but empatheticly. We understand sympathize and grow with Lawrence.

Incredible epic adventure based on fact!,"Peter O'Toole's first 'starring role'...and, he strikes gold!This movie is an absolute masterpiece that incorporates everything a great epic movie should be made of. It set a standard for how epic movies 'should' be made; and, David Lean later did it again in 1965 with ""Doctor Zhivago.""Peter O'Toole is just perfect in the role of Thomas Edward (T.E.) Lawrence, a simple young British Army Lieutenant sent to speak with Arab tribal leaders in an attempt to get them to fight the Turkish who are conquering their territories. Instead, he's not simple at all, but, very complex, and, exceeding his orders, Lawrence convinces these Arab tribal leaders to set aside petty squabbles with each other and that each tribe is weak by themselves...but, strong if they all unite.This is a heavenly masterpiece! To me, definitely one of the greatest epic movies ever made. It rivals another 'later' David Lean movie classic, ""Doctor Zhivago.""Although completely different in subject, this movie is in the same '11-Star Class' as ""The Godfather;"" ""Schindler's List;"" ""Star Wars;"" ""The Man Who Would Be King;"" ""Rocky;"" ""The Longest Day;"" ""A Bridge Too Far;"" ""Cross Of Iron;"" ""The Wild Bunch;"" ""Das Boot;"" ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" ""The Good, The Bad, and, The Ugly;"" ""The Lord of the Rings;"" ""The Green Mile;"" ""Silence of the Lambs;"" ""Goodfellas;"" etc...IT'S AN EPIC CLASSIC!It's film-making excellence! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic but....,"This is a great movie, and I agree that it is lost in todays fast paced world filled with movies of fast paced editing techniques, which OBVIOUSLY started with Eisenstein, this is not argued by anybody. But the editing of this film is sloppy, and it could be tightened into a two hour and forty five minute to three hour movie. It drags in certain parts, shots are held too long. The character development is obviously the most extraordinary part of this film, watching you feel like you are getting to know Lawrence as if you are actually with him. However, despite the fact it is a classic, which no one argues, with great acting and wonderful cinematography, I think that older people glamorize some of the negatives of movies like this while not giving newer movies their due credit. The editing techniques that have been developed in the last twenty years are masterful and astonishing, and while some of these techniques have their roots in older masters like Eisenstein their originality and style are all their own. I am tired of hearing that everything is a copy of this or a knock off of that. While all film is influence by other film (simply because directors emulate those they admire) each director new and old (of consequence) adds a personal flair that cant be considered a ""copy"".

Top Class Movie,"I first saw this movie in the cinemas in the late 1960's and was very much glued to the screen and thoroughly enjoyed it.Based on the time that TE Lawrence spent in Arabia, the movie unusually begins with him getting on his motor bike and minutes later he has an accident is killed. Then comes the back flash and his time in Arabia during the desert conflict during the First World War.Filmed almost entirely in Jordan, the movie has some brilliant piece of cinema photography which can only be enjoyed in the cinemas to see the full effect, brilliant acting by Peter O' Toole - it was his first movie, as well as by all the others including Omar Sheriff and Alec Guiness. The music score by Maurice Jarre is well supportive to the movie and especially where the Arabic style is concerned as is the script by Robert Bolt. And finally, what can be mentioned about the director, the late David Lean except he is excellent.Conclusion: Nowadays we don't get to see such classic movies in a cinema. For the simple reason is that they don't make them anymore. Lawrence of Arabia is one movie that is worth to watch whether on a video or a DVD and if at all possible, make sure that you are sitting in front of a large screen,",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Extending beyond the usual or ordinary, especially in size or scope.""","My ""Summary"" is one of the definitions of Epic, and it applies to this film perhaps more than any other. The life of T.E. Lawrence is shown as few other men have ever been presented.Born Thomas Edward Chapman, the bastard son of Thomas Chapman and Sarah, the governess of his children, the man we know as T.E. Lawrence rose from what could have been the lowest possible social circumstances to become the best-known English-speaking warrior of his time. How much of his fame is deserved, and how much is due to the publicity generated by the newsreels of Lowell Thomas is hard to say now, but there is no denying that Lawrence was an extraordinary man. David Lean was an equally extraordinary filmmaker.As the reader may've guessed, I'm a student of the life of Lawrence, inspired as a young teenager by seeing this movie. I now know that the movie is not a precisely-accurate historical document, but it imparts the basic chronology of the best-known era of Lawrence's life, as well as a feel for the nature of the man. His physical appearance -- 5'6"" and plain of face -- was nothing like the handsome, 6-foot Peter O'Toole, but he clearly possessed at least some of the personal flair ascribed to him in this film.Creation of the film was a monumental task, with much of the filming occurring in temperatures exceeding 125 degrees Fahrenheit (!!). The crew had to invent ways to cool the cameras, to keep the film from being destroyed by heat before it was processed. The fact that the crew's shared suffering resulted in this excellent film and not mass murder is a tribute to the director.I won't rhapsodize about the cast, the scenery, the sheer mass of people required to make Lawrence of Arabia, I'll just sum up with this: this is an all-time great film, and should be seen by everyone.

Breath Taking!,"Lawrence of Arabia is a biographical film, directed by David Lean, of T.E. Lawrence, taken from the autobiography ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom."" T.E. Lawrence is a British lieutenant who is stationed in Arabia. He was sent into the deserts to report about the conflicts in Arabia concerning national movements from 1916-1918, but Lawrence comes back loving the Arabs, and decides to help them fight for their freedom against the Ottoman Empire.I thought this film to be absolutely magnificent, especially in respect to the breathtaking scenery captured. Lawrence of Arabia is made in the deserts of Morocco and Jordan. The scenery is very big, most of the time the characters in the shot are tiny in comparison to the large mountains, canyons, desert sands, and etcetera. The view is great, and makes you want to jump into your TV screen.The soundtrack is also brilliant, composed by Maurice Jarre. He uses orchestra filled with very bold sounds, a lot of the time glorifying the Arabs and their victories. It really fits the mood with the film, however a lot of times the soundtrack is overwhelming, and I had to turn down the volume at certain moments. There are also a few scenes in which silence is used, in moments of uncertainty and nervousness. This technique was used very well and we really get a sense of the anxiety that is felt by the characters.The cinematography and editing was also very creative and unique. A lot of times the camera uses shots to jump further into time. For example, the dust in the desert fills the screen, and once it is blown away, we are taken to an event further in the story. There aren't many close-up shots, but the shots that are close-up are on faces, which are full of expression.The performances of the characters were captivating. Peter O'Toole, Lawrence, was actually a new actor, but his performance does not show it. His facial expressions are amazing, and very down to earth. Through his expressions and body movement, we get a feeling for his glory filled personality, as well as his confusion about who he is, and what he wants. The performance of Omar Sharif was brilliant. He portrays his character with much enthusiasm, and we really get to know his character. One scene in particular was his encounter with Lawrence for the first time. We really get a sense of his motivation to protect his well and his lands by foreigners and other tribes. However, once he is a best friend of Lawrence's, we are able to see his loyalty and bravery towards those he loves. All of the characters were very down to earth, and in a way, easy to connect to, in a sense that they seemed real.Lawrence of Arabia was pretty much a glorious movie, and should be seen by everyone. I have been studying movies, and have watched a few of David Leans films, and I believe this is one of his best. It has a lot of different aspects that could intrigue all movie lovers. It joins adventure, drama, and war all into one to try and get to know this T.E. Lawrence who is struggling with loyalty to his country and his love for a people. In my opinion, this movie should be rated at a 9.0, and I would recommend this to everyone; it is a ""must see"".",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Struggling with desires,"""I can do what I want, but I cannot want what I want.""

The supporting characters are rich and varied, with not a single false note as long as you can overlook Anthony Quinn's mustache. The British generals, French diplomat, Saudi royalty and American reporter all use Lawrence for their own ends and yet they cannot help being in awe of his abilities and the conflict that rages within him for all to see.David Lean's work has been restored and occasionally will tour the larger screens still playing in the United States.

It stand on its own,"Ignoring all the hype surrounding the star performances and the endurance it took to make this picture, Lawrence of Arabia stands firmly on its own as an incredible film.Told with exactitude, David Lean chose wisely the long story of TE Lawrence and his time helping to bring an end to the last of the Turkish Ottoman Empire by bringing together disparate tribes of Arabs.The casting is excellent. From O'Toole, Sharif, Guinness to even the lowliest servant, this is a movie where the acting is lean and on point. O'Toole's Lawrence is astonishing. Boyish, idealistic and in the end, on the verge of cracking, he brings a full character to the screen. The one thing about O'Toole that you see in this picture that follows him through ""Lord Jim,"" ""The Ruling Class"" and ""Becket"" is that he is fearless. In all of his roles, he brings forth both the admirable and the less pleasant aspects of a character's emotional life.

Did Jesus overact?,"Anyone foolish enough to think that this is not one of the best movies ever to have been made  embodying the very essence of what makes cinema stand out among all other cultural forms of expression  should stick to Matrix, Disneyland and Diet Coke. Pointing out its historic inaccuracy is simply redundant as it never claimed to be a documentary, and biopics generically put an emphasis on story development rather than truthfulness (cf. JFK, Patton, etc.). Lamenting the movie's pace is, at best, indicative of your dwindling attention span  you might as well ask yourself if the Bible's too long. Finally, bemoaning the over-the-top acting of the entire cast, but most notably O'Toole, is an anachronism as you're dealing with pre-method-acting Hollywood and there's no concern whatsoever with realism, let alone naturalism; besides, the film, more than anything else, is a psychological portrait meant to express (as in ""expression"") the inner turmoil of its main protagonist in the face of events bigger than life. Not to forget that O'Toole's character is ripe with homo-erotic innuendo, and subsequently his struggle against his inner demons must also be read as a self-denial of his sexuality, as is made obvious in the rape scene. Indeed, not least thanks to O'Toole's ethereal performance, T.E. Lawrence is portrayed as an outsider in every sense of the word, a pariah of both worlds whose acceptance he is desperately seeking. One of the countless merits of Lean's desert western is to make evident this struggle of the individual against society and conventions  but also its shortfalls , revealing itself in extreme situations that command extreme feelings. And rather than serving up an insipid happy end (as it would no doubt have to were it produced today), Lawrence of Arabia tells of the factual prevalence of pragmatism over ideals, of society over the individual, of tribalism over humanity, and not least, of war over peace  a gloomy message that couldn't possibly be more to the point, here served by a Homeric plot, a legendary score, sweeping photography, and immortal actors.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Long, spectacular David Lean epic.",David Lean's 1962 blockbuster filmed on a grand scale still remains one of the most influential blockbusters of all time with battle scenes that still look amazing today. It tops even The Bridge on the River Kwai in terms of epic storytelling. Peter O'Toole hits the character of Lawrence right on the nose and Guinness also gets a great role that allows him to expand with his acting technique. Yet the budget and the sheer effort that went into this filmmaking is what really makes this one so interesting to watch for over 3 hours.

Epic in every way,"Epic in every way.The story of TE Lawrence, the English officer who united and lead the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War 1 in order to fight the Turks. This unity and fight for freedom ultimately lead to the independent Arab states that we now know.Grand in its ambition, grand in its scale, grand in its scenery and cinematography, grand in its running time. Director David Lean captures well the adventures and achievements of Lawrence, as well as his personality, contradictions and inner conflicts.Superb cinematography - the desert vistas are a key positive of the movie.The running time - 3 1/2 hours - does make the movie a bit of an endurance test though. Not that it is ever dull, it is just the sheer amount of time you need to set aside to watch it. Usually I would say, for something like that, that a bit of editing is in order, but there is very little that can be edited out. Almost every scene is integral to the plot.

The sets and locations looked authentic and real, the scope of the film was immense. The film was shot in location in Jordan I believe and follows the true story of a British officer who helped leads to Arabs to revolt against the Turks during WWI, fighting with guerrilla tactics. The film also explores the darker side of war, what it can do to an ordinary person's mind. The film is also not afraid to touch upon the imperial ambitions of the British leadership and how their version of the of the Middle East after WWI looks a little different the one Lawrence expects.

But then it did not work, because the circumstances were higher. Well, now I got there, because I was carried away by old paintings (thanks to the beautiful Audrey Hepburn). I was almost completely delighted with the picture, well, here's my short opinion - His Majesty's Partisan. Despite this, there was one drawback in the picture, which I will definitely mention, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this epic historical drama.
So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the film tells about the life and service of Lieutenant (future colonel) of the British army Thomas Edward Lawrence, who received the nickname ""Arabian"" for his military exploits in the desert. The script is based on his autobiographical book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. It was he who played a key role in the Arab uprising of 1916-1918 in the Middle East. This topic is quite interesting, where the interests of the leading powers of the world and the aspirations of the local population for independence collide. And it is interesting to follow this, although it will take a very long time (the picture goes for almost four hours). Politics, emotions of people on both sides, clash of cultures of two different worlds, personal experiences of the hero, and so on. Well, about the final, I can only say one thing: ""The Moor has done his job, the Moor can leave."" Vital, partly tragic, but true.
2. Lawrence of Arabia is a rather strange hero, I would say, even extravagant, we have here. He is brave, sometimes decisive, but his behavior drives into a stupor both his fellow British and Arabs, for whom he is a mystery. His reflection goes throughout the whole picture, but it's not boring to watch. Sometimes you are perplexed by his actions, but mentally you build a logical chain for this, and even find an excuse for the hero.
3. Two worlds - the picture shows the British and the Arabs, two completely different cultures and even worldviews in a difficult situation, when both peoples had common interests and they acted together against the once mighty Ottoman Empire. Moreover, the picture respects the customs of the Arab tribes, and does not exhibit them in a caricature. Yes, and the British shows who they were, especially politicians (who are the same in any country and under any political regime).
4. Scale - the scale of this historical event is felt in the picture, because there are a lot of extras here and everyone performs verified movements and allows the viewer to believe in what is happening. Trains, planes, armored vehicles - everything is real, although it fires blank cartridges of course. Almost Lord of the Rings, almost!
5. Costumes, decorations - I can't say where exactly the picture was filmed, but definitely in the desert and adjacent territories. For everything looks realistic, because I watched the restored version. The costumes are of the highest standard and look authentically of the sought after era. Although there are clearly exaggerated details, this does not spoil the image.
6. Gorgeous music - what else catches in this picture is the musical accompaniment. Where the London Symphony Orchestra played a key role. And you can listen to it for a long time and even separately from the picture, and have fun. Music creates the right atmosphere and perfectly underlines the key moments of the story being told. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
7. Politics is a cynical and insidious craft, which played its role here too. Cruel, unfair (although not without a certain logic). She is present in the whole picture, like the shadow of Hamlet's father, and enters the stage at the right and most logical moment, throwing her dirty hands into the desert that has not yet cooled with blood. That's all right. For the soldiers, politicians always come, who will bury the young guys with honors, and after an hour they will forget about their existence, drinking brandy in their office.
Now about the minus. Why are there no large-scale battles? After all, you have an epic canvas on a historical theme, right? So why are there practically no battles here? A couple of camel races and some tinsel on the railroad doesn't count. I understand that in Lawrence's book it was, but you are shooting an artistic picture, where the genre itself allows you to deviate from the canon and show staginess. So why didn't they? It's a shame, because the potential was revealed, but not completely.
And yet - the picture is very long and at least forty minutes can be safely cut out and the meaning and logic will not be broken. The godlessly stretched scene spoils the overall impression.
A little about the main characters:
1. Lawrence of Arabia performed by Peter O'Toole - an officer in the British army who became the organizer and symbol of the Arab uprising. A brave, daring commander who earned the trust of the Arabs and even fell in love with them. The hero is non-standard, and therefore deserves attention. Peter did a great job with the role that opened up Hollywood for him, but I first saw him in the great comedy How to Steal a Million. Moreover, outwardly, Peter is very similar to Lawrence. Bravo!
2. Sheriff Ali, played by Omar Sharif, is an influential Arab of one of the many tribes, who at first disliked Lawrence, but later became his best friend. A brave, decisive and colorful hero who glorified the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif all over the world, and deserves it. Bravo Omar!
I cannot fail to mention Anthony Quinn, who played the role of the charismatic leader Audu ibu Tayi.
The picture received seven Oscar statuettes, and each is absolutely deserved!
This is exactly how you need to approach the restoration of the classics. Why can't domestic publishers do this? We don't have our classics? Yes, there is, only there is no desire.
As a result, he has a good historical drama, with an excellent script, grandiose scale, great costumes and sets, great music and great acting.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best Film ever made,"The best film every made! Astounding! The desert scenery is spectacular and Peter O'Toole's performance is amazing. A must see film, 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece,"This film could be considered David Lean's magnum opus, in other words his masterpiece. The late David Lean was a talented British director who made his name with films like Oliver Twist (1948) and The Bridge on the River Kwai. However in 1962 he released Lawrence of Arabia to the masses. This film was the one that won him the Oscar for best director.The film tells the story of real life British soldier, T.E. Lawrence. The movie is partially based on Lawrence's autobiographical account, Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Lawrence is sent to Arabia by his superiors to help the Arab revolt against the turks.The film has great cinematography by Freddie Young, and an epic music score by Maurice Jarre. This film swept the Oscars in 1962, and it deserved each and every one of them. This is one of the rare films that deserves the praise it gets. After you watch it you can see how it influenced other directors like Martin Scorsese, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.The film features a breakout performance by Omar Sharif. And it made Peter O'Toole a star. After this Omar went on to do the extremely successful Doctor Zhivago, also directed by David Lean, and Peter went on to do other critically acclaimed films like Becket, Lion in the Winter, and Man of La Mancha, among others. Anyone who enjoys a good old fashioned epic with a lot of great performances then this is the film for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably the best camel movie ever made.,"This is a wonderful, wickedly beautiful and superbly made film with an amazing story attached to it. The film constantly hits you with exciting moments and menacing shots of the desert, incredible music included.The amount of extras used in this film is haunting, some of the most spectacular scenes have hundreds of people on camelback riding around through the incredible landscapes of Jordan, although the last desert bits of the movie were filmed in Spain. The moments of suspense when you see a character approach from afar, barely visible yet aching closer and closer is just amazing.Our main character is very interesting, conflicted about his loyalty and traumatised by the violence, yet he seems to be obsessed with the almost godlike status he receives from the Arabs. I thought this film was going to have this 'white saviour' complex, something you might expect when looking at the plot and the year it was made. Luckily, this only becomes really apparent near the end of the film, so good job on keeping it woke for like three hours.It's only real issue here is its length. 220 minutes is just too long. Yes, you will the story is very engaging, but I still felt exhausted at the end. There are only so many epic desert shots a man can take.This film is incredible, go watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic film,"Classic film. This is really an oversimplification of a very complex film. This movie is so multi-faceted that you could tackle reviewing it from several angles. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the complex relationship and contrast between Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif), fellow tribesman and counsel to Prince Feisal, and T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole). When the two first meet Ali shoots down Lawrence's Arab companion who is taking him to first meet Feisel because the man is drinking from Ali's well and does not have permission to do so. An outraged Lawrence chastises Ali citing that Arabia will never be great as long as they war amongst themselves and that he is ""barborous and cruel"". Towards the end of the film, though, there is a reversal of roles as Ali tries to stop a massacre that Lawrence is not only allowing his troops to participate in, but seems to be genuinely enjoying. Ali is a man who has a good bead on who he is and what he believes. Not having this quality is Lawrence's greatest shortcoming. Lawrence either believes he is much less than he is or much more, depending on his latest exploits and who has talked to him last. Ali clearly sees this problem, and by the end of the film Ali is Lawrence's fast friend - in fact his only true friend. You see, Lawrence is being used by both the Arabs and the British. This becomes immensely clear when at the end of the film Prince Feisel, who has always seemed to be genuine towards Lawrence, says during negotiations with the British ""Lawrence is a double-edged sword - We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?"". By the way, the role of Ali has to be Sharif's finest hour as an actor. I always thought Dr. Zhivago was that finest role, and it is still a great performance, but this one is even better.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I just wish I could see this on a big screen,"I watched it once on IMDb TV with commercials and thought it was brilliant. I knew I had to buy it on Amazon prime in 4K. The desert scenes in 4K are amazing and jaw dropping; hands down, the most beautiful cinematography ever presented in cinema. The only thing I wish would be to see this on a big screen on Broadway. The Irishman from 2019 played on Broadway on the biggest screen I have ever seen - that is how Lawrence is meant to be seen. If you watch it, do it in 4K - it's worth it. A truly amazing and unique epic and one to cherish.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A grand entertainment,"This is one of the titans of cinema. A movie so large in scope and in reputation that it becomes a bit of a hopeless exercise to talk about it because so much has already been said. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, David Lean's epic portrait of T.E. Lawrence is a monument of what an epic can be in terms of scale and sweep that it often gets overlooked that at its core is a rather telling story of a man's descent into a madness, much like Colonel Nicholson's own descent in The Bridge on the River Kwai. It's also a piece of historical fiction that may or may not have a whole lot to do with the actual characters involved. Some family members were so aghast at the portrayal of General Allenby that they lodged a formal complaint with Columbia Pictures.Based on Lawrence's own account of the Arab Uprising in the First World War, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, the movie begins with Lawrence's death on a small country road in England, jumping back in time to his days as a lieutenant and clerk under General Murray. One thing to be said very early about this film is its incredible use of transitions. The most famous one is of Lawrence blowing out a candle and the film instantly cutting to the shot of the rising run over the desert, but I think the transition from the funeral to the small basement office where we find the young Lawrence is indicative of Lean's control over editing from his years as a leading editor in Britain's film industry.We go from General Murray talking to a reporter about how Lawrence had some minor position on his staff in Cairo to a shot of a hand coloring a map. Based on the dialogue we just saw and the sudden change in visuals, we instantly know that we're not only somewhere else but that we're in Cairo and that hand is Lawrence's. We don't need a long establishing shot of the city to understand exactly where we are and when we are. We know that we're at a point before Lawrence got famous because of how Murray talked about Lawrence's insignificant position there. It's instantly conveyed in a single cut, and it's a great use of the tools of cinema.Now, a comment about the film's length. It's just shy of four hours, and I think it earns every minute. The first hour or so builds up to several things, selling the reality of each of them to the audience. The first is Lawrence's vision. He sees a united Arab population in Arabia able to govern itself. The second is the reality of the desert. It's hot, it's big, and it's punishing. The third is the political reality of the different Bedouin tribes that make up the Arab population and how they are almost always in conflict over some reason or another. Those reasons don't matter to Lawrence, of course, because his vision is what's important.Lawrence's inability to see reality because of his vision is really at the core of everything in the movie for him. It's most obvious in his desire to become an Arab, something that's never really said explicitly but shown repeatedly especially at his lowest moment when he reveals his white skin to his friend Sherif Ali late in the film after his torture at the hands of the Turks. He had snuck into a Turkish controlled village thinking that he was invisible dressed as an Arab, able to simply disappear amongst the locals, and he was found out easily. He's not an Arab, and he never will be. It manifests other ways like in how Lawrence fought against the cruel impulses within him but he cannot deny them. When he executes a man, the very man he had saved from death in the desert, he's horrified that he actually enjoyed the act. He runs from that until the final charge against the retreating Turkish column towards Damascus when he orders an attack that's not necessary and he gets into the thick of the battle like he had never done before, getting covered in blood much to Ali's horror.The final big fantasy that falls apart is Lawrence's vision for the Arab world. It ends up falling apart for two reasons, one internal and the other external. The first is that the Arab world of Bedouin tribes are simply not cohesive enough to come together. Presented with their first seat of government in Damascus, they can do nothing but bicker over slights both current and past. There's going to be no way for them to come together the way they need to in order to overcome the external forces of Britain and France coming to an agreement to split the Turkish Empire, including Arabia.Underlying all of this is the common motif in Lean's work of the temporary giving way to the permanent. Lawrence's vision gives way to the original reality of the tribes fighting each other. They were together momentarily because of the war, but it falls away as soon as it's over. Lawrence's embrace of his deep tan on his face and the dressings of a Bedouin give way to his white skin underneath and the uniform of a British officer. He goes through these massive events, and in the end very little seems to have changed. The Arabs still are disunited and under a colonial power, England and France instead of the Turks. Lawrence has led the Arab army, but he still has to go home to England.The movie is simply impeccably made, the result of a craftsman learning his trade over decades and applying the tricks of that trade intelligently. The opening up of his camera that began in The Bridge on the River Kwai goes exponentially further in Lawrence of Arabia. Vast vistas with tiny figures feature prominently throughout the film, and they never feel extraneous. These are moments where the hugeness of the desert needs to be sold to the audience. The smallness of the characters needs to be felt acutely. The journey across the Nefud Desert needs to feel arduous, dangerous, and deadly, and you can't do that in a couple of quick shots. Letting those moment linger as the audience begins to feel the heat of the sun on the Sun's Anvil is key to selling the audacity of the plan Lawrence had pursued with Ali to reach Aqaba by land. The action needs to feel big, bold, and monumental. It can't feel easy. Lawrence needs to suffer through it, and showing the audience the hugeness of the expanse is part of doing that.David Lean grew up in the industry with his small films about people, usually married people dealing with marital problems. That focus gave him a great gift with actors, something one might not expect from a director who arose from a technical field like editing, and he applies that gift to every actor in Lawrence of Arabia. The newfound Peter O'Toole won an Oscar for his performance as Lawrence, and he deserves it, showing us a flawed man who grows to believe his own myth and has it come crashing down. A man who is at war with his own impulses and his own desires. Omar Sharif is wonderful as Sherif Ali, the companion who grows to understand not only Lawrence's greatness but his great flaws as well. Alec Guiness in brown face is great as Prince Faisal, the closest thing the Arabs have to a leader, with cool, intellectual control of every movement of a king to be. Jack Hawkins embodies the smugness of General Allenby perfectly. Anthony Quinn is maniacal, violent, and deeply felt as Auda abu Tayi. Universally, the cast is fantastic.The music is strong from the young Maurice Jarre with a theme that seems instantly recognizable decades later. The battles are filmed clearly and from afar, showing off the incredible scale of the production without ever losing sight of the intimate feelings of the characters at the center.It's a production of the highest order with an intelligently told study of a man at its center. This is more than just a critics' delight, this is grand entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Spectacular Marvel,"Lawrence of Arabia (1962) is a bit of an oddity everywhere its title is listed. Considered by the American Film Institute to be among the best American films, Lawrence of Arabia is hardly an American film. Its protagonist is decidedly British and the film was a co-production between Horizon Pictures in London and Columbia Pictures in Hollywood. In addition, the British Film Institute also claims it as its own, so there's that.While considered an epic and features breathtaking natural vistas, the film is an epic quite unlike any other. Lawrence of Arabia isn't Gone with the Wind (1939) and it's certainly not a production of the Hollywood hagiographical machine churned by Cecil B. DeMille. It's a movie that has no equal and apart from maybe The English Patient (1996) has no real imitators either.The film is based on the true story of T.E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), a British intelligence officer who fermented Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during WWI. Lawrence is considered a very controversial figure both in his native Britain and in the Arabian Peninsula. His personality alone isolated him from his fellow officers in the British Army who found his assuredness awkward. When he gained the loyalties of King Faisal (Alec Guinness) and helped unite Arab tribes under the Arab National Council to occupy Damascus, the British and the French became worried of his intentions and reined him in.Those who know the history of the region will recall that after the events depicted in the movie, the French occupied Lebanon in 1920 thus fulfilling the Sykes-Picot agreement. The Arab National Council was disbanded in 1930 though were never the most competent administrators, and the region didn't enjoy the fruits of free determination until the 1940's.While politics and political brinksmanship is an aspect of Lawrence of Arabia it isn't the only aspect, or even the most important theme in David Lean's masterpiece. Lawrence of Arabia aspires to embolden the unconventional. To make us aware of an individual who, while being a small cog in a big machine, was too unique to be replaced, altered or replicated. The famous tableau in which Lawrence slowly moves towards the frame from a mile away against the harshness of the desert is a visual metaphor of such an aspiring theme.Heck, even Peter O'Toole's physical shape and body language is a visual metaphor for the value of unconventionality. His frame is lanky and frail and his body language and speech patterns balance between discreet and cocksure. Yet while his physical appearance is the antipathy of modesty, his every action is done with grandeur. While everything he says is said softly, what he says is self-assured. He has the heart of Othello born in the body of Iago.At 216 minutes long, Lawrence of Arabia may not be for the huddled masses populating today's movie theaters, but the film has been a must see for the last 50 years for good reason. Anyone who claims to love films and does not like Lawrence of Arabia must loose all credibility. Tough talk coming from someone who didn't think 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) was all that and a packet of bubble gum. But the plain truth of the matter is Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece in storytelling, in filmmaking, in entertainment and in artistry. The fact that it's an hours-long sprawling epic just makes it all the more impressive and all the more required viewing.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie is 60% lies and distortion,"A movie with a lot of nasty mistakes. And if only it were that innocent, it's a downright lie-filled movie. I don't know how accurately Lawrence himself reflects his experiences, but; Neither the cause and consequences of the event, nor the Arab side, nor the Turkish side were reflected correctly! There are too many lies to try to decipher one by one. A historical movie, even a movie, has to show what is honest and close to the truth!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lawrence's complex character with charm, intensity, and vulnerability.The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking-every shot of the desert is a visual marvel, immersing you in the vastness and beauty of the landscape. It's hard to believe this film was made in 1962; it feels as fresh and captivating as any modern epic. This isn't just a movie-it's an experience, and arguably the best journey film ever made.

Awesometacular,"Lawrence of Arabia stars Peter O'Toole, Alec, Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and many other stars of their time - 1962. It's about Colonel T.E. Lawrence and he's assigned by the Arab Bureau to act as an adviser to Prince Faisal, the leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks.Let's start with this - Lawrence of Arabia is my favorite movie of all time. Everything from the directing to the acting to the cinematography is stunning an worth experiencing.Everyone in the cast does their best in their roles. My favorite one, however, is Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe, and he succumbs to the Arab revolt soon after Lawrence promises him money stolen from the Turks at Aqaba. Quinn's portrayal of a greedy yet powerful Arab chieftain is great, and makes for some of the best scenes in the movie. What's even cooler is that Quinn is almost an identical copy of Tayi. If you look up how the character looks in the movie and how he looks in real life, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference.However, despite the acting powerhouse this movie is, the main character and the best one is the setting - Arabia itself. The stunning shots provided by cinematographer Freddie Young captivate you and make you wonder how such ambitious shots were actually taken. You actually end up feeling for the Arabs because of the development of their land. Via this movie, it's obvious why so many people fell in love with the scenery. Lawrence himself is quoted with saying that he fell in love with the desert because ""it's clean.""When I first saw this, I was fifteen and I had the bought the 25th anniversary edition Blu-ray and watched it in my room by myself. When it was over, I had a similar reaction to what Steven Spielberg had in that I didn't know exactly what I saw other than that it was a masterpiece. So I gave it some time. And within a week, it surpassed Interstellar as my favorite movie of all time.Definitely go check this one out. You'll have to have the patience of a striking tiger, as it's damn near four hours long, but every single minute was worth it. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic. Really really epic.,"I finally found a day when I could sit and actually watch this enormously long film. Was it worth it? Umm. Yes.I think it was an enjoyable movie. It certainly had this amazing quality to it that made it seem grand. Perhaps it was the 70mm film that they used. While watching it, I kept wishing that I could stretch the picture to fill up the whole wall. It's one of those films that really just needs to be seen on the big screen.It's a film with a very large scope and an interesting story that speaks about culture and identity. Destiny and chance.?A lot of interesting stuff in there. It also has beautiful pictures of the desert.All in all, I rather like it. It doesn't over-dramatize too much (at least for a film made in its time period). It doesn't try to wrap things up too neatly. It takes the time to show how a character changes, doesn't have a problem exposing his flaws.It's not the kind of movie you'd want to watch over and over again (unless you have a lot of free time), but it does what it wants to do. And I enjoyed it. And I got to see some desert. And some Arabs. And not one mummy in sight. Nice.Good stuff. If you have a nice block of time to catch it, I'd say it wouldn't be bad to try. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top Gun in the desert,"It is clear that David Lean did know that indeed film is a visual medium. However it seems he was completely unacquainted to the fact that film is also a storytelling device. Filming sand is one thing, having characters or situations that you care about is another. This movie has gorgeous vistas of the desert and impressive battle sequences, but it also presents characters that are so badly characterized that it works against it. No character is likeable; they are all shortsighted, narrow-minded, vexatious individuals. That is basically the only real issue of the movie. I would argue that you need some kind of empathy in order to sit still for more than three hours, the movie offers none.It is somewhat of a relief to learn that the movie is an adaptation of Lawrence's memoirs, because I was wondering who wrote a script this badly. It is very bad, but it makes more sense when you realize they blindly transposed the story without connecting anything together, like with themes or motivations. The misunderstanding that a book and a movie should tell their story differently is, unfortunately, very common, but this film goes even further than that. It is further removed from reality and common sense.It is a film that does not understand what it shows us, except when it is the poetic beauty of the dunes. So much so, that thematically it ends up being exactly the opposite of what it purports to be. It results in a film that wants to be this epic romantic war tale, but ends up being a lousy adventure film. I am not entirely sure what it has to say about British Imperialism, but what is clear is that the Arabs are shown as barbaric savages. Even Omar Sharif's character, he is the closest to a well-defined character, with an arc and everything, is first shown as a cold-blooded savage. And maybe they are, I would not know, but the movie treats them visually as if they were the heroes and wants the audience to cheer for them while showing them being bad, ignorant or doing bad things.On that topic, one of the central, yet hidden, themes is homosexuality. On that aspect this movie is precisely like Top Gun: a war movie that is so macho and trying to be cool, that is becomes overtly gay. It is so ""dumb"" that you almost start to think it is parody. This film however cannot escape its own pretention; it could never play at parody.So gayness and being gay is kind central to this war movie for some reason. Lawrence is not explicitly gay; rather Lawrence is gay in what people in the sixties though gay people were. He likes to dress up; he has these weird relationships with boys. It's unsettling. But the biggest gripe I have is when we are explained that Ottomans sodomize their prisoners. Therefore, the movie argues, Arab fighters won't let themselves be captured and will prefer death to being left behind wounded. This is the type of characters, ideology, culture the movie asks us to root for.This is the movie for people who love to see sand, and for no one else.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Turkish armies are legendary for their valid and skill for 800 years. Defeating them was no easy thing. The guerrila campaign waged by Lawrence and the Arabs was brilliant.The film shows this, and tells a story about broken promises of full independence to the Arabs as well, matters which have had repercussions to the current day.A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most carefully made and interesting movies of all times,"With not many good biography movies nowadays, Lawrence Of Arabia really stands out as one of the most important films in the history of film-making.

A film that must be seen on the big screen,"At the moment of writing this review ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the top rated movie of David Lean. In nearly every review you can read that you must see this film on the big screen, because the essential part that the unique landscape is playing. To be honest I have not seen this film on the big screen, but I can imagine what the other reviewers mean. Especially the scene in which the Omar Sharif character appears for the first time, a tiny vague spot vibrating in the hot air at first and only gradually becoming a recognizable person, lost much of its magic on the small screen. The landscape remains beautiful but is no longer unique. After all Monument Valley is also very beautiful in many of John Fords films.With respect to the story line ""Lawrence of Arabia"" fits in the standard format of the David Lean epics from the second half of his career. A rather excentric main character is situated against the background of an imposing landscape. In ""The bridge on the river Kwai"" (1957) this excentric main chracter is Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), in ""Doctor Zhivago"" (1965) it is Doctor Zhivago (Omar Sharif) and in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) it is of course Lawrence (Peter O'Toole), based on the historical person of T. E. Lawrence (1888 - 1935).The story is situated during the First World War in the battle between England and the (declining) Ottoman Empire. England is using Arabian tribes to attack the Turks.The first layer of the Lawrence character is a layer of loyalty. More and more Lwarence starts to identify with the Arabian tribes and wants to liberate them from the Ottoman Empire. Deep down inside however he knows (or at least suspects) that the English only use the Arabs as a weapon and will never allow them independence. Late in the movie Lawrence is called a ""half liar"" in this respect.The second layer of the Lawrence character is a layer of introspection. Lawrence starts with viewing himself as an idealist, but more and more (and to his own shock) discovers hints of narcism and bloodlust in himself. With respect to this second layer Peter O'Toole is, in my opinion, repeatedly guilty of overacting. In this respect I am less enthusiastic over his performance than most reviewers. The thing he does rather well however is giving hints about the possibility of Lawrence being gay, without being too explicit about this (which, in 1962, was still a problem for the star of a movie with (also) the character of an adventure).To conclude, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is for me not the best Lean epic. This is ""The bridge on the river Kwai"". If it would be shown in my neigborhood cinema however, I would be the first to buy a ticket to see the film finally on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Historical epic of all time!,"In the years of the big historical epic films, from 1957-1964, some of the most spectacular and costly films in Hollywood history were made. The creators lay much effort in an accurate depiction of the time the film was set in. A large fraction of those films where set in the Roman empire. These films, with standard features like a horse race, a gladiator combat, etc. have grown out of favor (not me!).The most of 'Lawrence of Arabia' is set in the desert, avoiding the extravagance of Roman empire epics. There is no shining marble here. When Lawrence is asked ""What is it that you find so fascinating about the desert?"", he answers ""It's clean"". The sand dunes make a clean and yet exotic backdrop to the drama. This is one of the reasons why 'Lawrence of Arabia' doesn't look dated.By any measure, the acting of Peter O'Toole is superb. His somewhat twisted and high tempered acting fits like a glove. Who can imagine any other playing the Godfather than Marlon Brando? Same thing here. Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins....who can ask for more? And of course, there is no real epic from the desert without Omar Sharif. The entire cast is rock solid! However, this is the early 60's and the movie screen was very much a theater stage in contrast to films today where the acting melts more seamlessly into the action. This may be a barrier for some.'Lawrence of Arabia' is a full night's entertainment, almost 4 hours. I love it! The story is told in a continuous time line with no flashbacks or side stories. To make a 4 hrs straight time line drama work is hard, but done right it's pure joy to watch. There is a climax every 30-45 minutes and the timing of the highs and lows are perfect.Most people will recognize the orchestral music after three tones. Avoiding fanfares and other features so typical for Roman epics, the music is grand and sweeping, but never boring. The main theme is developed through the film in various ways. Bits of oriental tunes adds the right atmosphere.Historical epics are not for everyone. 'Lawrence of Arabia' will surprise many new viewers because it doesn't fall into the same category as Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Cleopatra. If the age of the film is not an issue for you, it's a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

We can't all be lion tamers,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been over 50 years since the film's initial release and more than 20 since I last viewed it on the big screen. When Cinemark announced it as part of the Classic Film Series, I circled the date on my calendar. While most movies are best viewed in a theatre setting, no other film absolutely demands such a setting.There are many elements that contribute to the well deserved ""classic"" label: David Lean's direction, Freddie Young's photography, the star-studded support cast, the historical significance, Maurice Jarre's iconic score, and of course, Peter O'Toole's standout and unusual performance. This is an action-adventure film with up close battle scenes filmed with no CGI aid. The famous shot of Omar Sharif's Sheriff Ali slowly making his initial appearance on the desert horizon is breathtaking on a 60 foot screen. Watching Lawrence's victory dance on top of the train is majestic in the theatre, and the big screen provides the necessary ominous feeling as the Arabs slowly navigate the blowing sands of the Nefud Desert.T.E. Lawrence was a fascinating man, though there has been much debate about the film and his legend. Lawrence's own writings in ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" provided many details used by screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, as well as the writings of American photo-journalist Lowell Thomas ... depicted in the film as Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). The real life Thomas was looking for a hero and likely sensationalized his story of Lawrence, but most believe the foundation is fairly accurate.While the story of T.E. Lawrence is incredibly interesting, the story in the film is somehow just part of the experience. Director David Lean's movie is a true experience for movie lovers. This was Mr. Lean's middle film of an incredible streak of three ... The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) being the others. Lean insisted on filming on location, rather than in studio despite the nearly four hour run time. This decision drove the cost up, but allowed for the stunning visuals that set it apart.In addition to O'Toole's performance, it is quite exciting to see the dynamic Omar Sharif, the powerful Anthony Quinn (as Auda abu Tayi), the classy Alec Guiness (as Prince Faisal), the kinda creepy Jose Ferrer, the familiar Jack Hawkins and the slightly slimy Claude Rains. Missing from this list is any actress. The movie features exactly zero speaking roles for women.Maybe the only two actors of the era who could have competed with this fabulous landscape were Peter O'Toole and Marlon Brando. Brando was actually first cast as Lawrence, but soon dropped out to star in Mutiny on the Bounty. O'Toole's blue eyes and white robe created quite the contrast to the sandy desert. Speaking of contrast, the two times he admires his reflection in his knife are visual keys to his evolution from God complex to broken man. After attending the premiere, writer Noel Coward told O'Toole, ""If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia.""The movie received 10 Oscar nominations. It walked away with 7 wins including Best Picture, Director, Cinematogapher, and Score. O'Toole lost out to Gregory Peck (To Kill a Mockingbird). Mr. O'Toole has received 8 Best Actor nominations without ever winning. Watching this film (more than once) is a must for any movie lover. The opportunities to view it in a theatre setting are quite rare, so please seize the chance should it present itself. Your four hour commitment will be rewarded with a movie memory you'll never lose.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Greats,"Lawrence of Arabia is truly one of the greatest films ever produced. It is the definition of the word ""epic"". It is a hug story with incredible acting, is very well written, and both dramatic and touching. Every scene is a masterpiece.

They don't make them like this anymore,"As far as classics go, Lawrence of Arabia carves a mark in the epic genre as one of the best epic movies out there.Based on the life of T. E. Lawrence, this movie depicts in full detail Lawrence's experiences in Arabia during World War I, with focus primarily on his attacks and conquest of Aqaba and Damascus and his involvement in the Arab National Council.The movie has well rooted scenes that take you through a journey of self discovery, we get to see the emotional struggles Lawrence faced and how the resulting violence caused by war can change a man completely.The desert scenes were shot in Jordan and Morocco.During filming Peter was having difficulty with the camel saddle so he bought rubber foam and placed it on the saddle, many extras copied him and it has become wide spread even till today.Later, during the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel during the charge, but fortunately, it (the camel) stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him.Many Arab countries including Jordan banned the film. Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success.Peter O'Toole who played Lawrence delivered a much awarding performance; although he didn't win the best actor role in the Oscars he was nominated.Broken into two parts each over an hour and 40 minutes long, Lawrence was a British soldier whose flamboyant attitude made him popular among his fellow colleagues, he was sent to the desert plain to see to the Arabs, and from there he made friends with the Arabs.He fought with them and led them to victory, but his loyalties come into question as he was cutting across two territories the British government and his new found love, the Arabs.The script of the movie is well plotted and the screenplay is marvelous, add to that the cinematography, the musical score and the directing.Lawrence of Arabia is a complete package, a masterpiece waiting to be seen by anyone.What I really love about the script is how we get to see Lawrence move from nothing to hero, from hero to god and from god back to man.This movie launched Peter into the limelight and the character that catches your fancy may end up being Omar Sharif who played Sheriff Ali ibn el Kharish.The movie is fun to watch, I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I admit that the Godfather and Shcindler's List were great movies, but the arabesque sounds of a desolate wilderness, juxtaposed to an exotic military barracks, combined with lots of action, but not over the top like Kill Bill vol. 1. It is truly stunning. By far one of my favorite movies.So, just to any prospective viewers for this grand cinematic, let me say this, that, although it is one of the longest movies you would experience, you will not move of your seat of you enjoy a good, classic epic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A bitter sweet ride through the deserts of Arabia,"Lawrence of Arabia - A pursuit of life by a irregular British officer during World war I in Arabia as he becomes a revolutionary leader, capturing hearts of almost every Arabian - Great visuals right from the word go; the technical aspect is almost amazing and it is far ahead of its time (released in 1962?? cant believe!) Detailing of Arabia and its desert is just outstanding! what is peculiar is the lead actor's performance! Mass!!! no wonder it got 7 Oscars!!The editing is almost same throughout the movie giving a soothing but bitter effect towards the end. The soundtrack is one of the greatest one which makes waves though the desert which will surely attack us.David Lean (Director) scores aces with this one.His another movie - Bridge on the River Kwai - was the inspiration for the great Tamizh filmmaker Late Balu Mahendra!!Don't miss this if u wanna enjoy a desert holiday at home!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The nearest thing to a perfect action film yet made.,"Circa World War One a low ranking British officer somehow manages to unite the rival tribes of Arabia to drive the Turks out of their yet unmapped country.Whether you like the work of David Lean or not you cannot begrudge him his chapter in cinema history. And note I said chapter and not page. While any review of a film is personal and depends on such factors as ""getting involved with the characters"" you have to admire this for guts and determination alone.Scenes from this film go beyond the word epic, you feel that you are watching a documentary with no corner cut or no cost saved. Like all the great films you feel that you have gone through the experience rather than merely watched it.While O'Tool became an instant world star, plenty of respect goes to the mostly British support cast. There isn't a bad casting here everyone is perfect for their roles (bar Alec Guinness who is merely ok) and is giving it their all. If there is bum note or bad performance anywhere I didn't see it and special praise for Omar Sharif, his support work here is pin-sharp and perfect.The battle scenes are nothing less than some of the most perfectly realised pieces of cinema ever created. Quite frightening descends in to a world of carnage and madness that few of us - thankfully - will go for real.There has to be a whole generation of people that have never seen it on the big screen and quite a number that have never seen the film full stop. Every city in the world should show this film in its full restored version to show what cinema can be when it gets it all totally right. It is one hell of an experience.What makes it all more amazing is that it manages to be both literate and insightful - especially in regards to how  much easier it is to unite on the battlefield than it is in the conference chamber. That self-determination is only possible if you wish to have self-determination and not let stupidity and anarchy rule. And more importantly, the lesson that has still to be learned: that the third world cannot be run by first world rules.This is David Leans best film by some way, it is almost frightening in the way that everything works and fits together. It has to soft peddle some of the imagery to get a family friendly certificate and the language might be a bit a lot milder than that used, but this has enough truth and truths to be used a history lesson - if you remember that all tellings of history are loaded and that includes important and respected history books.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Epic On A Grand Scale, But.......","This is not the greatest movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, this is still the father of all epics and it won't get any grander than this, but I felt like something was missing. Maybe it's the length or excess of plot material, but Lawrence of Arabia misses being perfect, but not by too much. At nearly four hours in length, the film is beautifully shot and loved the perfect, CGI-less desert sun. It's well-acted with stand-out performances by everyone involved and David Lean expertly directs an epic a lesser man could not get right.Lean's film is a biographical look at the adventurous T.E Lawrence who is known for his famous exploits in the Arab world. During World War One, British officer Lawrence is sent to the Arab world to unite the warring tribes against the Turkish empire.This film features perhaps the greatest acting achievements in film history. Peter O'Toole is just magnificent as Lawrence and this is the role that sent him down the road of stardom. Omar Sharif, no stranger to David Lean, is nearly as good as Lawrence's Arab buddy. Alec Guinness also delivers a strong performance as Prince Feisal.Overall, this is certainly the father of all epics. It has everything you want to see, especially in these older movies. A sweeping cinematography, a beautiful score, masterful acting, superb directing and great editing. However, this is not the greatest film in the world. It's overlong and sometimes a bit stuffy. But it's close and that I can definitely see. A film that shall not be forgotten for the ages. I rate this film 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Spectacular, fascinating character study. The Legend lives on","They don't make screens big enough for a movie like this. Hell, they don't make Actors like these anymore... Being born in the 80's, I must have seen ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in my childhood but didn't understand what the fuss was all about (except for Peter O'Toole's beauty and intense radiance). I have reluctantly revisited it recently. It took me several viewings to fully appreciate it, and it's probably the greatest movie ever made.Much has been said about this film, and usually people who have something to criticize are getting into pissing contests over its historical accuracy. I couldn't care less about those ""controversies"", they are missing the point. This is a fictionalized account, not a history lesson. I'm only interested in Peter O'Toole's Lawrence and the way this particular story is told. Historically accurate or not, I don't care.Not only ""Lawrence of Arabia"" hasn't aged one day, but it's light years ahead of recent productions. Cinematic perfection is what it is, and it's a miracle. There must have been a rare star alignment 50 years ago, that made everything click so perfectly - cast, acting, script, music, editing, scenery, costumes, all within a remarkable direction. Every scene is an invaluable lesson of filmmaking, a demonstration of superlative acting. What strikes me is that sensitive issues like sexual identity and violence are beautifully explored with a subtlety, intelligence and elegance that are no longer to be found in film today. I'm afraid to imagine how the ""Deraa sequence"" would be depicted these days. Filmmakers today just lack the talent and sensitivity to make it compelling without resorting to obscenity and gore for cheap shock value.Peter O'Toole is splendid, sophisticated,larger-than-life, and leaves you breathless with every movement. You will notice the subtle touches of his performance, the nuances of his ambiguous identity, constantly shifting. The portrayal of Lawrence is somewhat inconsistent, inexplicit, and he remains a fascinating puzzle, which is both frustrating and also the key to the movie's overall success.You will be blown away by the power of Lean's imagery and his ability to define a character so precisely and memorably through purely visual means. There's no CGI, so everything looks and feels real. But it feels real mostly because we see the alien Arab world through Lawrence's eyes. It's amazing how introspective, how personal such a grand-scale epic can be.So who is O'Toole's Lawrence? What is it that drives him to do what he does? I still don't know, but with each viewing there's something new to discover. I believe that David Lean's respect for the mystery, for the ineffable of human personality is something to be admired. But it's more than respect, it's Lean's intelligence that prevents him from ""explaining"" Lawrence. That's why people are still crazy about this movie 50 years later.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The mother of all Epics is a true cinema miracle,"The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence.""Lawrence of Arabia"" was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema.By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war.Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence (""T.E"" get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other.Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery.The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film.The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection.If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lawrence of Arabia is a visually stunning epic.,"Lawrence of Arabia is a visually stunning epic from acclaimed director David Lean (The Bridge on the River Kwai) On the visual side of things, this film is made to be shown on a big screen, with it's jaw dropping desert vistas and blue skies. It also helps to have the whole home cinema experience because the dramatic score by Maurice Jarre is incredibly beautiful and really sets the mood. For those unfamiliar with the movie, i'm sure you've heard the soundtrack sampled many a times in pop culture shows such as The Simpsons. On the acting side of things it features an incredible performance from actor Peter O'Toole who portrays T.E Lawrence in the film. O'Toole gives Lawrence quite a bit of depth and humanity and his unique mannerisms make him fascinating to watch. One thing to note: Be weary, the film goes for a whopping 3 hours and 47 minutes, so clear your schedule before sitting down to watch this classic film.

Why Lawerence of Arabia is time,"I have viewed and written on Lawrence of Arabia since it came out in 1962. I taught to my classes then and later. I did see it on the big screen when it came out twice, and many times after on laser disc, DVD, and the Blu-ray package that came out recently. I am wring this review to remind viewers the LOA has more relevance now than it did then. The concern then, 1962, was the Cold War. Today, it is the disastrous conditions on the locations where David Lean discovered the tracks of trains T.E. Lawrence blew up during his campaign, exactly 100 years ago. Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson authored the script, but is was Lean's direction that created one of the greatest films of all time. The film should be honored now for its prescience. Lawrence wanted to united the Arab tribes. There is no need to remind the current viewer who might take a look at the film and make the appropriate and illuminating comparisons.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This epic is one of those films which oozes quality,This is another one of those films that I don't watch very often and one of the reasons is I know how great it is. The real T E Lawrence apparently looked unremarkable compared to Peter O'Toole and yet his presence at the places he visited during his life resulted in genuine life changing repercussions for a enormous number of people. This film is a journey as the director puts it and if Steven Spielberg regards this film as his all time favourite then it is a journey anybody should make. It is a long film between 3 and 4 hours depending on which version you see but it oozes quality and if you lose yourself in it from the start you will barely notice the time. I watched it for the first time when I was in my early twenties and I was blown away by everything about it. I am not that bothered which individual won this or that award for their part in it because it is a team effort and potentially there were hundreds of professionals involved and they should all be congratulated for producing this wonderful film. This film was made almost fifty years ago but quality is always enduring and fortunately for the viewing public this epic is sheer quality. This film is not artificially high in the IMDb listings and if anything deserves to be higher but more people need to see this classic and if after seeing it you agree with me then please register your approval.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Revisiting it many times over the years, I have come to appreciate its finesse more and more, and rare it as one of my favourite films alongside The Shawshank Redemption, The Deer Hunter, 2001; A Space Odyssey and Breakfast at Tiffany's. The attention to even the minutest detail is stunning, as if a Michelin-starred chef had built the most exquisite dish whilst adding the tiniest of infusions to layer the taste. The scope of the film demands the viewer to sit back in a comfy chair, with a glass of Pimms and lemonade, and watch the spectacle in its original format; to view on anything other than letterbox view loses some of the detail that, whilst almost un-noticeable, is essential. Like a great painter, Lean laid down exquisite layers of images that make the film almost second to none in this department Iconic images abound, and ones eyes are treated to a visual feast, not only during the action sequences but also in the quieter, more reflective moments.

In the desert...,"IMDb Top 250: 54Continuing my David Lean unit, I devoted an afternoon to watching Lawrence of Arabia: one of the most iconic, legendary, and celebrated films of all time. Widely regarded as Lean's masterpiece, I was really excited: The Bridge on the River Kwai exceeded my expectations. The number one 'Epic' movie according to the AFI, I expected a roaring tribute to success, an aura of victory and grand scale, and lots of sand. I got 2 of those.Lawrence of Arabia follows Lawrence's life during World War I, with one scene after his death. Right from the start there's something different about the film: for 4 minutes, there is no picture, only sound- the overture prepares you for the atmosphere of the desert, and for the nearly 4 hour journey ahead.The first scene is very interesting, and anyone who knows any history won't consider it spoilers: after his crash, the viewer objectively sees Lawrence's funeral. There, reporters ask people about him, and they call him a great man- but almost none have actually met him. By showing his funeral first, a viewer doesn't fear for Lawrence's safety throughout the film: we can focus on his character and his actions.From there, there is a hard cut to many years previous, and the adventure that is the middle eastern theatre of WWI begins. The Middle East is an interesting setting, virtually unexplored by Western film. In this film, we see enough of it to make up for the deficiency. We also learn about the belligerents of the conflict, Arabs who unite to displace the Turkish, who Lawrence describes as ""silly people"" who will be small until they can stop arguing between their tribes.Lawrence had a fascinating life that makes for a great story, but it's good that we only see the WWI section of it: the film couldn't be any more sprawling without losing all cohesion.The film takes its time, and that's something critical to a viewers enjoyment of the film. We see Lawrence trekking through the desert a lot. The length of the film is quite daunting, but it never feels slow, because of the sweeping scenery and fantastic soundtrack. The pace is like a jog: it never really quickens, even in battle, but there's always the sense that movement is happening.Arabia jumps from scene to scene like a roller-coaster. There are sequences of talk, then walking through the desert, then a battle, followed by talking... it covers all the bases. Great scenes include Ali's entrance, Aqaba, and the massacre (a surprisingly dark scene). For such an epic film, I expected more depth to the battles. They are skimmed over, and one key fight isn't even shown at all!If there's one thing I've learned so far from this unit, it's that David Lean can shoot a beautiful film. Lawrence of Arabia has the most stunning photography, I dare call it the perfect visual film. Be it desert in every direction, canyons, huge camps, horses charging to a city, or just the sun, this has the most massive scale in film. It's a shame, and one cannot stress this enough, that this film as of December 2011 does not exist on Blu Ray.Equal to the visual is the audio. The music is perfect for the desert, with a sweeping band playing the overture that has middle eastern flair. The sound effects are brilliant, like the wind, explosions, or even the sound of the heat of the sun.Lean does a very good job of directing. This film has a marginally larger scale than Bridge on the River Kwai, but loses the focus that film had. However, as your teachers once taught you, quantity does not equal quality, and in this case, grand does not instantly equate to great: I can't just love the movie because it's so big.Finally, the acting. Unless you live under a rock, Lawrence's portrayal, and his character in general, is legendary. In his tour-de-force, Peter O'Toole (I was shocked this was his first major film) portrays the outspoken and impulsive Lawrence. His motives are complicated, he is a difficult to understand person. *******SPOILERS FOR A 50 YEAR OLD MOVIE******* Over the course of the film, he develops, at first for the better, but then he deteriorates. His ego gets the better of him, and he finds himself in a terrible situation. This situation, in which he is implicitly raped, is far too vague, even for the 60's. What makes that worse is that it is a key part of his development, and would be far easier to understand if even a small visual cue was added. In the end, he goes home dejected, a failure to himself, despite being a hero of the people. This is a central theme I picked out, which is the myth vs. man. Ironically,the whole film represents that theme. Perhaps things happened Lawrence didn't write about, and we see only the good and (perhaps) relatively bad. ***END SPOILERS***The film has good support, but it is clearly O'Toole's show. You can learn a lot about someone through their interactions, and the point of the film is to learn about Lawrence. Hence, Sharif Ali is Lawrence's closest friend. We see their initial conflict, gaining of respect, and relationship. Through Ali, we see when Lawrence's fragile mental state is apparent.Where Bridge on the River Kwai was about the waste of war, this is about the glory of war- until it's not. As Lawrence says, ""Nothing is written"", sadly ironic for the passionate young man.I don't think a film like this will ever be made again. Not at this scale, not at this length. Unlike many biographical films, LoA leaves in the true ending, with his rise and fall. Despite the unhappy end, Lawrence of Arabia is a spectacle of cinematic achievement. 9.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
No happy ending!,"I can't really add anything more to the postive comments already made here. I saw it on TV as a child then the restored version at the cinema. I would ask you ignore one or two people who have bemoaned the lack of a 'happy' or 'clear' ending. Sitting for 3.5 hours and missing the point completely must be frustrating. The last scene, as Lawrence is driven away, his dreams of helping to form an arab state in ruins - passing arabs on camels and with a motor bike overtaking him is a moment of regret and a hint of further doom like no other. The psycological depth of the film has few parallels and having read Seven Pillars of Wisdom it certainly reflects Lawrence's psyché well. In terms of script and cinematography there is a short analysis by Sam Yates of one scene on You Tube that brilliantly shows the genius of Lean and why almost 60 years after it was made the film is still utterly mesmeric. I am watching it again this week with my 18 year old son who is joining the military. As a guide to politics, power, individuality and regret it has no equal.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If you haven't seen it, you're missing out","""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a grandiose film that's a must watch; even if you're not a huge movie buff, it resonates with so much scale and spectacle that you will be blown away. This epic adventure drama is based on the life of T.E. Lawrence, played here y Peter O'Toole. The bulk of the story centers around Lawrence's experiences in the Middle East during World War I, particularly some of the large battles he took place In and his Involvement in the Arab National Council. There's more than just action here though, Lawrence is a deeply conflicted man who struggles with some internal turmoil as well as the inevitable violence that arises during war times.Don't settle for watching it on your rink-dink phone or even your TV, take the time to seek it out and find a theatre near you that's showing it on a giant screen because this movie features such breathtaking sights that you will be missing out otherwise. Oh, you'll still be able to appreciate the scale and cinematography elsewhere, but it won't be the same. Regardless of where you see it, the excellent performances and epic storyline will have you cheering. What struck me in particular Is the cinematography. Several shots show armies rushing through enormous landscapes high above, and In one particularly memorable scene a tiny dot on the horizon reveals itself to be a lone rider, coming towards the camera. Writing it down just doesn't do it justice.Consistently, I found myself scratching my head wondering ""how did they do that?"" All of these enormous crowd shots or scenes featuring raids on trains featuring clockwork-like coordination make me wonder. It looks like the film was either done in one take or the sand was painstakingly cleaned to look like it was undisturbed between re-shoots. There were no computers in 1962 and yet this looks as Impressive as the $150 million CGI fests that we get every summer. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole's performance is amazing. He really portrays the feelings of someone who is tortured and divided inside, but almost isn't allowed to worry about it because of the huge burden on his shoulders. The story, despite its multiple characters and multiple locations (several of which have foreign, difficult to pronounce names that you will probably have trouble remembering) is clear and easy to follow. If there's any fault it's that at times the film is overwhelming. So much goes on and there's so much that happens beneath the surface of our hero's exterior that you will have to watch it multiple times to get a real handle on all of it. There is so much greatness here it's hard to describe it all. It's a landmark in filmmaking and you've probably seen countless parodies and clips of the film over the years, so for that reason alone it's worth a watch.It's a long show, but you won't mind thanks to the intermission and it will really stick with you. It's more than worth your time. I feel guilty admitting this but I almost had a bit of pre-conceived negative feelings towards it because I'd heard people almost trying to guilt me into watching it because they called it ""The greatest movie of all time"". Now the only person I feel resentment towards is me for not checking it out sooner. Even if you don't absolutely fall in love with it, there's no doubt you will be very impressed.

"Great piece of filmmaking, but Lawrence's yo-yo behavior hard to imagine!","First Thoughts: Lawrence of Arabia is one of those classics I've never watched all the way through and so I picked up a 2DVD series for a song on Amazon.com. Though it's rated as one of the top films of the 20th century, I was not that impressed. Story & Plot: Love the cinematography of this film! The amazing desert sunrises, the mirages, the authentic costumes! The crazy Arab played well by Anthony Quinn! The sleek Prince played by Alec Guinness! (Yes, he did many films before Star Wars); Omar Sharif as Ali, the only character who, somewhat violent, had to keep running after Lawrence and guide him.Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is a bit crazy. I mean here you are as a British soldier who nearly ""goes native"", very independent, does his own thing, ignores warnings and crosses vast deserts and attempts the impossible.It's really sad, his character! Lawrence is one time a hero, fancies himself ready to walk on water, then next moment he wants to throw it all away, can't handle the responsibility of freeing Arabia and just go back to England to ""get a job"". I mean really now! He lets a mad lust for killing take over and mows down the Turks. Nowadays this film would push the PG rating since there's plenty of death for the even the most die-hard film fan.My DVD had a great interview with Steven Spielberg on how he was impressed by the film and how he met the director and picked his brains on the making of the film. Several documentaries and lots and lots of praise for the technical quality of the film.Final Thoughts: It's a hard film to watch, with an ending that is somewhat disappointing. How a man can rise so high and crash down so hard is tough to imagine. Excellent authentic desert scenes and a new look at Arabian culture; but the cons include Lawrence himself, a conflicted man who can't decide if he is just an ordinary guy or an extraordinary being.Worth the watch, won 7 Academy Awards, but I would not clamor for it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Regardless of your opinion of the historical veracity of his portrayal, Peter O'Toole is magnificent as the highly-educated, erudite British officer who 'went native' only to be deceived by his own countrymen. The casting of Sir Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn as Arabs may raise hackles in these sensitive times but both are excellent, as is the entire cast, especially Omar Sharif (in his first English speaking role) as Sharif Ali, whose first appearance as a distant rider in a vast expanse of desert, is iconic.

How can this movie has gotten so much Oscars???,"The only explanation may be that this was 40 years ago...It certainly has nice acting, camera and music and so, but the story is transformed to some Walt Disney grease-pot: The Arabs are shown as naive guys whom Lawrence has to explain the superior culture of the west.

One of his comrades has - other than in reality - to be wounded so we can have Lawrence to tragically has to shot him.

The Legacy Of An Epic,"After adapting a novel called The Bridge On The River Kwai and adding a Hollywood feel to it through the controls of Sam Spiegel, master film craftsman David Lean set out on another search for his next grand feat of cinema making. After garnishing 7 oscars, Lean thirsted for a new challenge. He found it in the book called, 'The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom', by Major T.E.Lawrence. An autobiographical account of his time in World War I under the command of Prince Faisal and his campaigns against the turk, the legend of Lawrence could have made for more than 20 hours of filmmaking.Rounding up an all star cast including Academy Award Winner Alec Guiness, Anthony Quinn, the remarkable Omar Shariff, was a debuting actor named Peter O'Toole. Lean was wise to choose a so-called 'beginner'. For no actor of the time could play Lawrence without letting it go to their heads. But Peter O'Toole personified Lawrence to a staggering point of clarity. On film, he IS Lawrence.David Lean has the power in his films to envoke a sense of grandeur in natural landscapes, and how the environment reflects the characters. One only needs to go so far as to watch A Passage To India, Doctor Zhivago, In Which We Serve or The Bridge On The River Kwai to see such an effect.In the scene where the Arab party cross the Sun's Anvil in the mighty Nefu desert, the sweat builds up on the audience's skin. And when they finally storm Aqaba, the adrenalin builds in a panning long shot, as the Arabs sweep towards the seaside like a rollicking wave.Robert Bolt's debut screenplay is the best debut screenplay ever. The intensity of his characters on paper is staggering. Auda abu Tayi's dialogue can send shivers down anyone's spine.Made for the last generation who preferred different films than those of today's (with Titanic, Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship Of The Ring and Gladiator slight exceptions) and with a running length close to four hours, Lawrence Of Arabia remains one of the greatest films ever made and in my opinion, the best.Lawrence of Arabia is the story of a man changed in the desert, and in watching it, so too are we changed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Film Ever Made,"David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is about T.E Lawrence, an English Officer in the British Army who led the Arab Revolt against The Ottoman Turk Empire during The First World War.Lawrence of Arabia is an underrated film. Despite critical acclaim, box office success and seven Oscars, rarely does it receive the stature and acclaim that it deserves; quite simply Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. There have been many attempts since the films release in 1962 to capture the epic scale of this production. Whether it's Ridley Scotts's ""Gladiator"" or Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy no movie or franchise has come close to achieving this goal.In modern epics (how hallow this word is in comparison) we are bombarded with images of armies and battles generated at the touch of a button by computers and the artists who operate them. Lawrence is different; indeed in the dark ages of 1962 it had to be so. Despite all the technological advancements in movie production why does Lawrence still stand head and shoulders above its peers? The answer is simple, because everything we see on the screen in Lawrence is real; watching two thousand men on horseback smash through the Turkish defences to take Aqaba is more powerful and awe inspiring than a bunch of pixels bouncing around a blue screen.The screenplay of Lawrence of Arabia is, for all intents and purposes, perfect. There is not an ounce of fat on it. Every word is measured, considered and delivered with passion and professionalism by a stellar cast of some of the generation's finest actors. Peter O'Toole as T.E Lawrence gives what is arguably the greatest central performance in a movie by any actor ever. It is a performance that, in my mind at least, surpasses that of Alec Guinness's in another David Lean classic ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". O'Toole is magical as the English soldier caught between two worlds. The depth of his performance is staggering; he presents us with a fascinating and unlikely anti-hero. O'Toole's Lawrence is a man who is tortured by the contradictions of warfare, the hypocrisy of the British perception of the Arabs at that time and a destiny that once achieved, becomes less desirable than an ordinary life. Omar Sharif as Ali also gives a truly excellent performance as does every one of the lengthy supporting cast.There are many films that blur the boundaries between art and cinema. Lawrence of Arabia transcends both. As a piece of entertainment it's engrossing, action packed and seamless. As a work of art it is a beautifully crafted and perfectly executed masterpiece. Savour every shot, love every minute, feel the excitement and enjoy the adventure of a lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Feast your eyes on this!,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a film that is commonly ranked among the best of all time. Epic in scale, masterful in execution, it is the sort of film that transcends entertainment and enters the realm of art.The most striking part of the film is the visual aspect. The sweeping desert vistas are breathtaking but it is the technical expertise that elevates the visuals to another level entirely. If there is a single fault with the direction, cinematography or editing I didn't see it.The film also boasts an instantly memorable score by Maurice Jarre, justifiably lauded as one of the best of all film scores. It would be difficult to imagine a piece of music that could match the stellar visuals but this is it.Peter O'Toole is excellent as the title character and the supporting cast is also quite solid. Particularly good is Omar Sharif, who received an Oscar nomination for his efforts. Jack Hawkins and Anthony Quinn also deliver fine performances.I have to admit, though, that the first time I watched this movie I wasn't particularly keen on the story. However, on a second viewing the script revealed itself to be a complex portrait of an enigmatic figure.

Every line of dialogue is at least interesting, and often beautiful, in itself, but almost every line echoes, resonates, elsewhere in the film, or in our memories of Biblical, legendary and desert things.

With the movie's incredible locations and cinematography, Arabia almost feels like a different planet. While I was watching this movie it felt like I was transported to another place.Moving beyond the visuals, The main thing I liked about this movie was the performances and the characters. Lawrence has to be one of the more intriguing historical figures I've seen on film, and I think Peter O'Toole does a great job portraying him. I also like the chemistry and the dynamic between Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif's characters in this movie. The way their relationship changes and develops throughout this movie was extremely compelling.The transfer of this movie was also incredible.

In Return of the King, which I compare it to only in regard to its length, I was almost yelling at Frodo to get on the boat and get it over with. Lawrence I could watch campaign across the desert for a couple hours more, at least. This is also one of those movies that seems to have gained more meaning as it ages. Take, for example, the scenes of Lawrence teaching young Arabs how to make bombs. A little more unsettling than it was originally intended to be, perhaps. But the real story of course is not one of nations and wars, but of Lawrence's struggle with his identity in the face of the horrors he witnessed, and indeed, committed. How strange that after all of the killing and plundering he experienced, he was most horrified by the lies he half-knowingly told his Arab allies.

Majesty in the Desert,"The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in ""Lawrence of Arabia.""  Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out.  Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon.  It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in ""Lawrence of Arabia.""The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them.  Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.""Lawrence"" feels unlike other historical epics of its time.  In most ""big"" films--I'm thinking of movies like ""Ben-Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Cleopatra,"" all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as ""Lawrence""--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses.  One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction.  Everything feels static and wooden.  But in ""Lawrence,"" Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces.  In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set ""Lawrence"" apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole.  He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable.  He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform.  He carries ""Lawrence of Arabia"" almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders.  That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all.  O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshipped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" again.  His later films are certainly more than watchable, and ""A Passage to India"" is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another ""Lawrence."" Even more reason to appreciate it now.My Grade: A+",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

multi Oscar winning epic,"Superlative multi-Oscar winning biography of T E Lawrence (played by Peter O'Toole), the Oxford-educated lieutenant, who united Arab tribes against the Ottoman Turks in WW1The idea of Lawrence (O'Toole) as a wilfully self-destructive character is established in the credit sequence which presents his death in a motor-bike crash as something close to suicide. We flash back to Lawrence as a young, energetic, slightly mad man stuck in a job as a military cartographer, desperate to put his knowledge of and passion for all things Arabian to practical use. Then in a breathtaking cut we move from a lit match to the sun burning over the film's real star, the Arabian desert. Lean and cinematographer Young clearly fell for the desert as much as Lawrence himself, and they ensure that the audience shares their love.The film strips down the story to its basics, following the struggle of the unhinged anti-hero to help establish a united Arab nation. O'Toole is wonderfully intense in the lead, but his characterization of a man of unfathomable motivations gets lost in the grandeur of his surroundings - the vast, exquisitely composed desertscapes and breathtaking battle scenes. Sharif is served better by a more conventional role and, emerging like a shimmering mirage on the horizon and slowly approaching the camera, is given one of cinema's great first appearances.",,Anonymous,Biography

Lawrence of Arabia,"Lawrence of Arabia is a biographical film, directed by David Lean, of T.E. Lawrence, taken from the autobiography ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom."" T.E. Lawrence is a British lieutenant who is stationed in Arabia. He was sent into the deserts to report about the conflicts in Arabia concerning national movements from 1916-1918, but Lawrence comes back loving the Arabs, and decides to help them fight for their freedom against the Ottoman Empire.I thought this film to be absolutely magnificent, especially in respect to the breathtaking scenery captured. Lawrence of Arabia is made in the deserts of Morocco and Jordan. The scenery is very big, most of the time the characters in the shot are tiny in comparison to the large mountains, canyons, desert sands, and etcetera. The view is great, and makes you want to jump into your TV screen.The soundtrack is also brilliant, composed by Maurice Jarre. He uses orchestra filled with very bold sounds, a lot of the time glorifying the Arabs and their victories. It really fits the mood with the film, however a lot of times the soundtrack is overwhelming, and I had to turn down the volume at certain moments. There are also a few scenes in which silence is used, in moments of uncertainty and nervousness. This technique was used very well and we really get a sense of the anxiety that is felt by the characters.The cinematography and editing was also very creative and unique. A lot of times the camera uses shots to jump further into time. For example, the dust in the desert fills the screen, and once it is blown away, we are taken to an event further in the story. There aren't many close-up shots, but the shots that are close-up are on faces, which are full of expression.The performances of the characters were captivating. Peter O'Toole, Lawrence, was actually a new actor, but his performance does not show it. His facial expressions are amazing, and very down to earth. Through his expressions and body movement, we get a feeling for his glory filled personality, as well as his confusion about who he is, and what he wants. The performance of Omar Sharif was brilliant. He portrays his character with much enthusiasm, and we really get to know his character. One scene in particular was his encounter with Lawrence for the first time. We really get a sense of his motivation to protect his well and his lands by foreigners and other tribes. However, once he is a best friend of Lawrence's, we are able to see his loyalty and bravery towards those he loves. All of the characters were very down to earth, and in a way, easy to connect to, in a sense that they seemed real.Lawrence of Arabia was pretty much a glorious movie, and should be seen by everyone. It has a lot of different aspects that could intrigue all movie lovers. It joins adventure, drama, and war all into one to try and get to know this T.E. Lawrence who is struggling with loyalty to his country and his love for a people. In my opinion, this movie should be rated at a 9.0, and I would recommend this to everyone; it is a ""must see"".",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Magnificent Motion Picture,"This excellent epic is the biography of T.E. Lawrence. A newcomer named Peter O'Toole plays the title role. O'Toole gets a job as an observer with Alec Guinness. Guinness plays the leader of an Arab tribal army.O'Toole helps Guinness and his actions are recorded by a journalist played by Arthur Kennedy. The rest of his life is a legendary one. And you'll have to see it to get the greatness that the film is.It really is a grand spectacle that you have to see to believe. Every scene is like a painting by the best of artists. The film again shows what David Lean can do as a filmmaker.The film won seven Oscars including Picture, Director, Art-Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Score, and Sound.

One of the best films ever!,"I was put off of watching this movie for a long time, due to its' length; but having seen all 3 Lord of the Rings movies back-to-back, well, 3 1/2 hours is a cakewalk. (And this movie even has an intermission!)This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The swelling score, the cinematography, the sound, the action sequences...everything was spot-on. The first half of the movie was most enjoyable to me. I felt like I was riding alongside Lawrence in the Nefud Desert, and I was absolutely afraid for his life (even though I knew he doesn't die in the desert). Peter O'Toole blew me away with his portrayal of a misfit who found a home in such a dangerous and beautiful place. His eyes were hypnotic, his body language was so bizarre, and spoke volumes. You could see why the sheiks and princes of Arabia liked him, and why Lawrence was so different from his English countrymen. All of the supporting actors were great, especially Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif.The scope of this movie is HUGE. When I think of how long ago this movie was made, I can only think that everything in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was REAL. All of the extras are real people, all of the animals are real, the trains were really blown up, etc. What a massive undertaking it must have been, and how sad movies nowadays will never be allowed to do that again. Why hire costly extras or destroy expensive sets when a computer can do it for much cheaper? (The only plus side of this being that real animals don't get hurt) Even in the ""Lord of the Rings"" epics, my favorite movies, there are times you can tell a blue screen is being used, and for a brief second I'm pulled out of the movie.Firstly let me say that everyone should see this movie. It was long, yes, but absolutely no scene felt unnecessary. None. Everything in this film was crucial to painting a portrait of T.E. Lawrence.Lastly, I was very thankful I have a widescreen high definition TV. I couldn't imagine watching this on a small screen. You would be missing so much. Even my set felt too small sometimes. I can only hope that this movie will be released in theaters again some day so I can see it in a format worthy of its beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the finest movies ever!,"I saw ""Lawrence of Arabia"" when it opened in NYC and was simply swept away by it.  Seeing it on the big screen was an event in itself. Nothing has come close to this movie for the quality and richness of the production.  Back then there were no digital images or other techniques of today.  David Lean did it the ""old fashioned way"" and the effort shows.  Simply a great film!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Screenplay,"This is not simply a review of this very fine movie but an important historical note on it. You should correct the screenplay credits of your listing. Until their deaths the director David Lean, the producer Sam Spiegel and the co-writer Robert Bolt all denied the immense contribution to the script by Michael Wilson. In 1995 the Writer's Guild of America West finally acknowledged that the blacklisted American screenwriter Michael Wilson officially deserved co-credit with Robert Bolt, as he did for Bridge on the River Kwai and several other great American films. Wilson was one of the finest screenwriters of the 20th century and richly deserves this belated credit.",,Anonymous,Biography
Quintessential David Lean,"Based just on ""Lawrence,"" ""Zhivago,"" and ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" David Lean must certainly be counted among the greatest directors ever. And, while Peter O'Toole and the other fine actors in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, Jose Ferrer among them) help make this a great picture, this film -- more than the others -- belongs to Lean himself. The scenes in the desert, the panoramic camera shots, the unhurried pace of the action are knock-your-socks-off brilliant. In fact, I'm hard put to think of another movie that rivals ""Lawrence"" in this respect. As someone else has remarked, this is a film that needs to be seen in a theater. The small screen can't begin to do it justice. I'm inclined to doubt that a giant TV screen (which I do not possess) will do the job. This is a BIG picture in every respect. A great picture in every way imaginable. In celebrating Lean's contribution, I don't mean to slight the acting which is superb. Peter O'Toole deserves all the superlatives that have been lavished on him. Guiness is Guiness, one of the finest actors of his generation. And enough can't be said about Anthony Quinn. Quinn does unlettered, vital,virile and larger than life better than anyone else ever has. I'd have to think very closely about some of his other performances, but this may very well be Quinn's best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

O.K. those of you who have seen the movie continue...The acting, writing, dialogue, cinematography, editing and editing of this movie are nonpareil.

Simply beautiful eyecandy.,"The combination of the superb cinematography, fantastic direction and huge sweeping orchestration make this movie a delightful treat for the senses. You cannot make a movie this beautiful these days, especially with directors focusing on tv-sized shots and bad-sitcom-worthy performances from ""actors"". This movie is a refreshing and sometimes startling contrast to anything of recent 'worth'.There's violence, adventure, battle scenes, clever dialogue and yet everything is done tastefully. The cast is amazing, especially Peter O'Toole. With one look you know how he feels, and you can see his character progress and change throughout the film. Omar Sharif gives a passionate performance that actors would kill for these days. There is not a performance in this movie that's less than perfect.And if anyone's worried about how long it is, they really shouldn't be.

Classic,"I have trouble understanding some of the earlier commentators who thought that this movie is boring. I had no trouble with its length although I did  have a break between disc 1 and 2 (DVD).

"Who are you, Lawrence?","It is wonderful to learn from the DVD of the movie that it was David Lean, assuming the voice of the motorcyclist, who shouted across the Suez Canal to Lawrence those significant words ""Who are you?"" How appropriate!! The director asking the question to his protagonist. What is fiction, what is history?Watching the movie some 25 years after I saw it the first time, one begins to wonder if the real T E Lawrence will ever stand up. In the movie, in his writings ""The Seven Pillars of Wisdom"", Lawrence will remain an enigma both to the West and the Arabs.The ""real"" David Lean does stand up. He is a great director of epics and Lawrence, Doctor Zhivago, and Ryan's Daughter are his three best films, followed by Bridge on the River Kwai, which unfortunately does not affect you as much as it does on the first viewing on repeated viewings as the other three.Lean, Jarre, and Bolt--what a combination! Hats off to the restorers of this film. The only odd-ball was Anthony Quinn who seemed artificial 25 years ago and even now when we learn his costume was not authentic in color. I always wondered why I S Johar was picked by Lean to play the role of the guy who falls off the camel, is rescued, and is shot later. I have met Johar in real life. He was well read for an actor but I never rated him as a great actor. But for Johar this was the greatest performance of his career.All in all a great movie with great performances--each time you watch it you appreciate it better.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I especially love this film because I used to live in the Middle East and know the history pretty well. I personally felt the heat,emptiness and vastness of the desert while living in the Middle East and I think this film captures that feeling perfectly. Lawrence of Arabia not only ranks right up there with great action epics such as GUNJA DIN, THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING but holds its own against such classic movies as CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER AND SCHINDLER'S LIST.

Impressive and boring,"I hate to say it but I couldn't keep my mind on this one. After wanting to see it for so many years it was disappointing. And I like old movies too. I have earned the right to have an opinion of movies from this era. There is a certain amount of leeway given to a movie from long ago. Understanding what was happening or hadn't happened yet is very important to enjoying movies from long ago. But there's a point when enough is enough when you can't enjoy your time. Because after all, isn't they why they're there?It's very hard to say something bad about a movie like this because it's so important and influential and I can see why. But, it's boring. So much that I couldn't tough it out for the visuals and to watch it for it's historical significance.I think people have a hard time separating a movie's accomplishments from if it's an enjoyable watch or not. These don't always go hand in hand. I have many examples but let's just focus on one movie at a time.I do find it very ironic that people always bring up the visuals as the reason why this movie is so good. They are amazing. But this is like saying that a movie is good because of the special effects. I hate to say it's a gimmick or gratuitous but the 70mm is even mentioned in the opening credits.... I get it for the time, this is when Hollywood was making epics. Big movies in cinemascope that weren't made on the back lot with rear projection. They went on location and did this stuff for real. It's all very impressive. But that doesn't make the movie watchable. You have to remember the this was an Oscars movie. And the Oscars are no different then as they are now. This movie was the Cold Mountain of 1962.I'm not knocking the accomplishments of this movie but maybe this should be put in historical context more than it is. I think people that watch this movie these days feel like they have to say they like it so they don't lose their movie credit. But the point of a movie is to entertain. Whatever that means to you. I'm sure some people actually do like this movie. But the roaring acclaim makes me feel that a lot of people just don't want to be excluded from the club.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lawrence is a film of such unimaginable beauty, that one really has to see it several times before they can fully appreciate it.

Suddenly every other film just pales into insignificanceSpielberg cites it as one of his favourite films of all time, and you can easily see why.

one of the grandest epics of all time. David Lean's masterpiece.,"Three of my favorite films of all time fall under the category of the epic genre. What they all share in common are their grand scale, a large scale of popularity, and a running length of over three and a half hours. And while The Ten Commandments (1956) is my overall favorite of the three, David Lean's masterpiece Lawrence of Arabia isn't far behind, nor is Akira Kurosawa's marvelous Seven Samurai (1954).Lawrence of Arabia tells the slightly fictionalized story of T.E. Lawrence, a Welsh soldier who inspired and led an Arab revolt against the Turkish Empire during the times of World War One when his native country was more concerned about fighting the Germans. The film stars Peter O'Toole in the performance that made his career and he commands a supporting cast that includes great actors such as Academy Award-winners Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn as well as Omar Sharif, who was nominated for his performance in this grand epic. While some elements and characters are entirely fictional, invented for the film, director David Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt did a fantastic job at bringing this true story to the screen so that people other than historians can remember what the real man did.Like many classic films, Lawrence of Arabia underwent many editing changes after it was first released. Scenes were dropped, plot holes were opened, and somehow the film reel was reversed so that David Lean's intent of making it seem like a journey was lost. Of course, during the eighties, Hollywood went in to restore the film, reinstall the scenes that should have never been taken out in the first place, and flipped that reel so that everything looks like the way Lean intended it. Now the true masterpiece can be seen.The film is brilliantly made from its acting, to its scenery, right down to the fabulous music score that accompanies it in the background. Many scenes are composed of nothing but camels trekking across the desert under the heat of the sun and yet these scenes do not drag. One thing I really admired about Lawrence of Arabia was the way the filmmakers chose to represent the Arabs. While they did in a few instances cast a Caucasian actor, most of the time, the Arabs are portrayed by people of Middle-Eastern descent. For example, Omar Sharif, who is Egyptian. And in the cases where a Caucasian actor is used, it's still convincing. Anthony Quinn is so heavily clad in makeup that I didn't recognize him until I heard his voice and then I had to check the credits to make sure. Apparently, Quinn was very enthusiastic about making himself look like an Arab since he was portraying a real-life person. That is completely admirable since wearing makeup as well as putting it on is far from comfortable.Unfortunately, film industries do not make movies like Lawrence of Arabia anymore because audiences these days seem to seek the more modern style, but at least these grand masterpieces are still available for viewing. This is a very long film and I did feel slightly worn-down at the end and I did spot one scene where Lawrence visits a Turkish hospital that really served no purpose in the film and could have easily been cut, but still, I highly recommend it.This is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of only a few  'All time greats',"There are'nt sufficient superlatives to describe this film, a work of absolute cinematic class from the masters master 'David Lean'. A feast of scenic beauty and acting talent seldom seen on screen.To appreciate this film it should really be seen in the cinema, preferably on as wide a screen as possible with state of the art sound, and get yourself in the front few rows if possible.No TV set or home sound system will ever do it justice as it relies heavily on visual impact in numerous sequences, the absence of which detracts somewhat from the storyline, the harsh dangerous and fascinating beauty of the desert and desolation is essential for your enjoyment.

My opinion after having watched the movie,"Is is magnificent, I think this is one of the movies that we won´t see again. Hollywood productions on the 50´s 60´s and almost 70´s were a high quality ones, they considered from the biggest to the smallest detail! and of course the casts were extremely well-chosen. Lawrence of Arabia is a great example of the Hollywood I miss deeply. Although I watched it at the first time in Spanish I almost felt what the director wanted to make on the audience: Feel the power of the story, the acting and the score! I think the score (made by Maurice Jarre) and the Director of photography have done a great job of course led by legendary David Lean and hardworking Sam Spiegel!Then I watched the film in English and on a high quality DVD and I just got too impressed! The union of music, photography, great crew and unforgettable and legendary cast have made this film one of the best in time, Oscar winning, and stay in every decade of our lives!

This film is so beautiful and the script so literate, that I recommend it to all those who have never seen it. Lawrence came from a rather unusual family and was one of five illegitimate sons of Thomas Chapman.  The film was based on his books ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom A Triumph"" & ""Revolt in the Dessert"".  He never wanted to be a hero and remains an enigma.

It's an epic film in every sense, and I have a suggestion the next time you see it. Look carefully at Lawrence's face, especially his eyes, in scenes where someone is speaking to him one-on-one and he is listening (his first meeting with Allenby in Allenby's office is an excellent example). His constant inner struggle that ranges from terrible self-doubt to an almost Messiah-complex is fascinating to watch.

This is what an Epic is supposed to be - absorbing AND audacious.,"There were all kinds of huge Hollywood productions in the 50' and 60's, beginning with 1952's THE ROBE.  Their common traits were that they were mostly biblical or Roman in theme, ran well over 3 hours, and were shot in CinemaScope or Super Panavision 70, both massive wide-screen processes. LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not biblical, nor is it an ancient Roman story.  It is a 20th Century account of one man's personal fight to change the face of history and third world politics.  It is far better than the films of the previous mold, because it is far more believable and timeless.  We may not learn much about T.E. Lawrence as a man, but his actions and incredible ambition tell us a lot.  The monumental look of the film does not overshadow our involvement in Lawrence's plight and we do care for this strange, intelligent little man who may have become a God to his Arab counterparts, and, to himself.David Lean is a great director, period.  This man takes his cast and crew to excruciating locales (BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI - jungle, LAWRENCE- the middle of one of the largest deserts in the world).  The desert, ""the anvil of the earth"" states Omar Sharif as Ali,  is as much a character in the flick as any actor.  This is not a criticism.  You will NEVER see such rigorous performances in the most horrific of earthly conditions.  Lean and co. spent over 2 years out there making this amazing picture and it shows. Peter O'Toole's appears to grow older and wiser as the film moves along (and it moves along at a refreshingly fast pace for a 4 hour epic).  He is perfectly cast to play a mysterious historical figure, a man who was reportedly gay, a topic that could not be tackled on-screen at the time. There are 2 hints I found, however.  See if you can find them, especially in one scene with Jack Hawkins.  His mission to observe the Arabian efforts during WWI turn aggressive, until it eventually consumes his very being. This is personal to Lawrence.  He becomes Lawrence of Arabia because he wants his place in history and he wants to ""give these people their freedom"".  We, in essence, are no longer observers, but become entrenched with Lawrence's fight.The mind-boggling cinematography is so rich and dry, we feel like getting a drink whenever possible.  The night-time shots are as awe-inspiring as the day shots.  The blowing sand over the rigid desert suggests the winds of change about to happen in Saudi Arabia.  The first half of  picture is a bit slower than the second, but my favorite sequence occurs.  Lawrence, against all human odds, goes back to the heart of the desert to save 'Gasim', risking all he is fighting for, as well as his own life. He teaches the Arabs that nothing is ""written"", and Lawrence truly wrote his own history almost single-handedly.  Later, he has an unexpected, yet necessary duty, to perform with the very man he saved.  The blinding sun shots and look of the actors in these conditions contribute to the realism of the picture.Serious film buffs must see LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, because of its influential importance.  Steven Spielberg claims to watch it before he starts every new project.  It is all over RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The sheer grandness of its look and feel will change your cinematic values.  It demands viewing because it is the cinema in its purest form.NOTE: This is another wide-screen format must.  It is not even worth seeing without it.  Lawrence's victorious trot across the wrecked train, probably the most celebrated sequence, cannot even be seen in its proper perspective in pan and scan.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a film where the natural, wild beauty of the desert, provides the perfect set for the unfolding of T.E. Lawrence's adventures. The splendid photography, both beautiful and meaningful, revealed the life and soul of the landscape, while the unmatched music score gave the blood for the heart of the film. The actors. Peter O' Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and the rest of the cast, directed superbly by David Lean, gave one of the best performances of their rich careers. Maybe the best. Each sentiment, each feeling expressed in the film, is so vivid, so genuine, that creates the impression that you're watching NOT just a film, but the real thing!

"Way, way, way too long and boring!!!","As this was at no. 24 in Imdb's top 250 I didn't exactly expect it to be superb, but at least watchable. Well, I thought it dragged on for way to long. It lasted three and a half hours and it maybe could have captured me if it had only been one and a half hours. I think the first while it was alright, had a good mood and so on and didn't feel too long (which maybe also had something to do with that I had a couple of small breaks to get juice and so on), but when it got past the two hours/two and a half hours it dragged out. Nothing exciting happened, it got dull and just wanted it to end. I've seen other movies that has been this way, but a good ending came in and dragged the movie up. I didn't really see such and ending in this movie. It just went downhill and didn't really have a climax in my opinion. So all in all a disappointment in my opinion as it was way too long and boring, so I can't really give more than 3 out of 10, I'm afraid...",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FILMS,Unique in so many ways. David Lean's direction is easily among the greatest of all time. Peter O'Toole leads the way in a great performance of a grade A script. Only just losing out in the Best actor category to Gregory Peck.Playing a junior British officer who is sent to assess the situation and becomes the greatest British soldier of all time.Omar Sharif in the second lead role provides delightful support as his sober companion which set him to the stardom which gave him a part as Dr. Zhivago and the whole cast are a pleasure to watch.This film finds itself in my top 10 easily because of the mixture between wit and tragedy. One of the best films of the 60s.,,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!,"David Lean´s magnificent biography of T. E. Lawrence is a fantastic epic.I think that the film is about 3 hours and 40 minutes and it´s not the kind of film you see 5 times in the same week but it´s still a masterpiece.It won seven Oscars and I think that it deserved every one of them.""Lawrence of Arabia"" is masterfully shot in the desert and it´s one of the most beautiful films ever made.The direction,Cinematography and the Editing is perfect and the music is great.Peter O'Toole does one of the best roles I have ever seen as T.E. Lawrence.I was also very impressed by the rest of cast.Stars like: Alec Guinness,Anthony Quinn,Anthony Quayle,Claude Rains and Omar Sharif.A epic masterpiece.Perfect and I don´t know which film I like best this or David Lean´s other film ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
unparalleled excellence,"In spite of its length this remains the film I have watched in its entirety more often than any other. It's faultless. Robert Bolt's script is pristine in its economy. Every scene is composed with painterly magnificence and the main acting performances are nuanced in a way that you simply rarely see these days.It is slightly unnerving in the 21st Century to watch a movie in which white men black up to play Arab characters such as Auda and Price Feisel. However, it seems to me that for a film of its time, it remains fairly untainted by essentializing views of the Eastern 'Other'. All the main characters are portrayed with respect for their intelligence and complexity.Anyway, that point aside, this film is really a textbook example of great cinematic storytelling, and storytelling that serves a useful purpose. Current political distrust between the West and the Middle East makes a lot more sense when you know something of the seeds of European political meddling in the region.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest epic of all time.,"An enthralling masterpiece. T.E Lawrence, one of history's most astounding figures, is wonderfully played by the illustrious Peter O'Toole. This movie entertained me from beginning to end; from the beautiful score in the beginning, to the bittersweet ending. Wonderful characters emerge throughout this grandiose film.  Omar Sharif, in the film that made him a star, plays Ali brilliantly.  His raw emotion and chemistry with Lawrence is mesmerizing.  King Feisal is played by the always magnificent Alec Guiness, who shows us that great actors only get better through their movies.  And let us not forget Anthony Quinn, playing Auda abu Tayi.  Quinn has to be one of the greatest actors of his generation.  With Jack Hawkins as Brighton, a star contrast to Lawrence, and Claude Rains who plays the very dry Mr Dryden. Containing some of the most violent scenes of it's time, the battle scenes seem to become larger than life (especially on a home-entertainment system like I watched it on!) and depict the Arab cavalrymen in all their glory.  The desert scenes are beautifully shot, and the exasperatingly large amount of work that director David Lean puts into the film comes out wonderful. One of the top five greatest movies ever made, and the greatest epic ever made.  I recommend this movie to whomever wants to watch a film that will take you to Arabia in WWI, surrounded by the greatest actors of their time, and all time. Makes sure you don't miss Lawrence of Arabia!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic masterpiece of a man struggling with his identity,"The movie begins with the overture playing over a black screen. In reality, it is an important start to the movie- we are faced with a wavy, dreamy piece full of different undertones that relate specifically to the main character of Lawrence, alluding to the different forces in his mind and allowing the viewer to imagine, if not dream, of expectations of things to come. We have a man who grapples with his identity: he has a deep interest in the desert and in the beginning tries hard to fit in with a culture and peoples he feels are his own. He has an illusion of what he would like to be, an idea already mapped out in his mind, of what the arab peoples are, and how he, too, can hopefully become one, assimilate himself where he feels at home. The rigid constructs, however, of this illusion begin to fall apart as he fails to understand or admit to certain aspects of the culture he cannot deal or cope with: constant violence, the ever-present idea of death, and the lack of the peoples to come together and progress as a nation. He slowly begins to change, as little by little he becomes frustrated with the way things are, a way completely different than what he would like to be, a way that in the end lead him to take a pessimistic view on life, a hateful anger that he turns to the world because things have failed to go the way he chooses. The open desert, the beautiful landscapes, are all the setting for the freedom to do what one dreams to do- so long as he believes he can do it. But as he soon learns, there are things that he cannot change, and his character, his own sense of self, deteriorates.He wishes at one point in the movie to be ""ordinary"". This comes about from his inability to cope with not being able to have things the way he wants them to. Ordinary people are happy because they accept the way things are, they are subservient to tradition. Lawrence is a man who believes nothing is written- he believes a man can do anything so long as he puts his mind to the task. The movie is a constant struggle between realizing things are not always as one would like them to be, his innermost desire to be something that doesn't exist- his idea of an ""arab"", is only an illusion he has created. He is an Englishman, who had wanted to be what he thought of in his mind of a man of the desert, and learns the hard way that it is not all beautiful camel rides and the people do not have the same ideas for progress as he does. After realizing he is an alien in what he felt was his home, he begins to undergo serious repercussions and isolates himself from the world, from his friends, and most importantly from himself. He treads on with the conviction that maybe things will change, but realizes every time that they will not, it is beyond his control, so he must leave.Everyone has an idea of what they would like themselves to be, or an idea of how they imagine things to turn out, but as always, one can only write his own terms so far- we must yield to forces beyond our control.

Magnificent!,"Imagine my surprise at seeing 393 comments for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, but due to watching this film for the first time in my 32-year life, I feel I should add my own comment.Echoing everyone else, this film is a magnificent masterpiece in many ways: screenplay, cinematography, on-location scouting, sound, acting, devotion to T.E. Lawrence' life.I have not read Lawrence' tale that sparked this film, and while I feel the film expertly told his life albeit from a skewed perspective, I don't think I need to read the book to understand the man.There is plot and there is narrative, and both are wonderfully told without any doubt to their purpose. From the silence of the eastern sun rising over the desert does to the battle scenes' clamor, this film is a clever look at the intricacies of the human element.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
impressive,"This David Lean epic is often classed as a movie for the boys' but it has a lot to offer a mixed audience  topping his other lengthy work such as Dr Zhivago' and A Passage to India' this biopic of TE Lawrence took a gamble in casting the then relatively unknown (and extremely striking) Peter O'Toole in the lead role alongside Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer, and Anthony Quinn.  I think I am right in saying there are no women to be seen anywhere in the three hours plus of this film  it is to Lean's credit that the viewer doesn't necessarily notice this.Remembered for its strong visuals  the mirage scene in which Sharif appears from the desert mist, for one; the scene when Lawrence returns in Arab garb and is cheered by his army colleagues as a hero, for another  and stirring musical score (certainly among the greatest ever written)  this film doesn't shrink from presenting Lawrence as a rounded character with human failings like everyone else.  The longer cut released in the last few years underlines this complexity even more; and it still remains probably the best performance ever achieved by O'Toole.You do however still wonder what a version starring Dirk Bogarde would have been like (an abortive attempt some year before this version fell by the wayside).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not an accurate portrait of Lawrence the Man,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie the way Citizen Kane is a great movie, all the elements add up. BUT please read Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Lawrence's fabulous book. Could you have guessed from the movie that Lawrence was a great prose stylist? In reality he was short, not conventionally handsome, but funny and shy; it's very hard to believe that he was a homocidal maniac. This movie was made at a time when homosexuality was shocking (remember Advise and Consent?) and writers were compelled to see it as a character fault that led to other faults.

An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.,"An epic film that deserves an epic viewing.A film that's 228 minutes that is 3 hours and 48 minutes longs should have been exhausting. But this one is endearing and thus deservedly has been one of the greatest films ever made. To understand this film and appreciate it more than just the film, one would better be acquainted with the history. It has a great history behind the story. Though, there are few factual manipulations to include more drama, the whole experience of viewing this, is rewarding. It's rewarding to know that such a person existed who fought a war merely on the basis of humanity. He was completely impartial and non-judgmental.This was based on World War 1, now when we compare to films made on World War 1, with those made about World War 2, I found that they are very few in number. But this one stands above all other films that are based on World War 2.David Lean, the master behind the making of this film, shows his efforts in every frame of it. Indeed, he builds a whole world for the camera and it has great beauty in each shot. Each angle, each move is just so detailed and precise that it's tough to find fault in any frame. From the sun rise in the Arabian desert to the landscapes filled with sand dunes. From battles to closed door discussions, there is a certain magnanimity to each frame. The grandeur can be attributed partly to the choice of shooting of the film 70mm cinema scope (Super Panavision 70). For me the greatness would go to the director David Lean and to the cinematographer F A Young.Peter O Toole perhaps, was remembered as Lawrence more than his own name. Such was the impact of his character and his depiction was pitch perfect in every aspect. Peter showcased equanimity while there was war being shown, or while grappling with his own emotional internal conflict. War is brutal but more brutal is the war within. In a war of arms, you are killed for once. But in an emotional war, each moment is deathly. Peter showcased a rare poise and I am certain the whole film experience could have been so exhausting that he would have considered it an experience of a life time that more worthy than life itself.Amongst other things, I liked the music which was given by Maurice Jarre. The music was right up there and in such a long movie, music was very much needed to keep the emotional quotient. The music had the much needed variation. Be it the English war themes, or one to amplify Arabian desert sounds or even Arabian traditional music or the pathos of Lawrence too. There was a music needed for every bit and it was there all over the place. Never I felt it was over the board or too loud, it was just right.All the actors have done a commendable job. Above all others, I loved Alec Guinness as Prince Faisal and Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali.Thanks to David Lean and the producers of this epic. It's one of the most courageous decision of all those involved in the making and thankfully it paid great dividends in terms of awards and rewards. A definite 5/5 for an epic of a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The cinematography alone is breathtaking,"I watched El Cid last week and Lawrence this week and you could not see two more different films: both may be about heroism but one is old-fashioned, theatrical, and exploding with action and color; the other is an extraordinary canvas of film filled with simple, devastating images that invade and linger, that takes its time and creates some of the best shots on film.From a technical viewpoint Lawrence is extraordinary, it really does look and sound and feel like it was made now. The film looks fresh, there is none of the artificial colors of films prior to Lawrence: it is truly a masterpiece of film and one that deserves a very special place in film history.I firmly believe that David Lean changed film: films after Lawrence are simply more lifelike more real less theatrical less acted, but are also more carefully shot, with the color and lighting far more subdued and real.Of course, Lawrence, is also about heroism, character, and a unique individual: but it is in the combination of both the film and the story that the film's greatness lies.Simply stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Acting, script, direction, cinematography, music score....I am with the school of thought that a great film can never be too long, and a bad film can never be too short.

A revelation in old school epic film making,"Although I'd seen LoA on TV many, many years ago, I finally sat down with the Restored Director's Cut DVD and it was frankly a revelation to see how they used to make epic movies before the days of CGI and special effects. Strange to think that this film was made more than 40 years ago and yet it still towers over a lot of much more technologically advanced films that have come out in the last 5-6 years since 'The Matrix' supposedly raised the bar on film making.In some ways LoA has lots in common with modern epics like Lord of the Rings (particularly the first half with the long journey to Aqaba), but when you consider that everything in LoA was filmed 'live' so to speak (well apart from the shoot of the sun in the desert, but that was because the real sun kept burning the celluloid film in the camera) then you begin to appreciate the mastery that went into making this film, which must count as David Lean's masterpiece imho.In todays world, where we've seen developments like Weta Digital's Massive software(for creating huge CG armies), John Gaeta's Bullet Time, or Sky Captain with its CG Sir Laurence Olivier avatar, etc. the idea that Lean went into the desert to shoot the mirage scene 'as is' or the charge into Aqaba with real horses and riders, etc is just amazing. (You also get a similar sense of this old school film making in Sergio Leone's 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' when you hear how Eli Wallach was very nearly decapitated while filming one scene near a railway line.)Easily scores 10 out of 10 just for the sheer audacity of the film-making process.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfection,"This is absolutely on of the best films I've watched and will probably see in my life time. This movie has the most majestic beauty I've seen on the screen and I'm so touched and in awe over watching this movie. David Lean created the greatest epic of all time by focusing on a character so complex and human, but magnificent.1st off don't let the time put you off from watching. It's nearly 4 hours which even for me is quite frankly long. But the film flows by and you lose yourself in the world created for u. The cinematography is incredibly breathtaking. The landscapes and figures that inhabit this film hare beautifully shown with an almost halo to how good it looks. Seriously the most beautiful cinematography not by a guy named Terrence Malick. Peter O' Toole gives a commanding performance as TE Lawrence. Easily one of my favorite performances of all time, and maybe the most fleshed out pre-New Hollywood Era movie. The cast is also just as great too and highlight the movie. The soundtrack, which comes in the Delux 50th Aniversery set, is so enchanting I would be satisfied with it alone if I listened to it. (Great driving music btw)I really can't say anything bad about it. It's perfection on film. It's one of the most beautiful and inspiring movies I've seen, not from its message or ending but of what you can do on film. This is above all the best epic of all time, and possibly my favorite movie of all time (its a toss up between my top 5). Seriously something everyone that says the like movies needs to watch.

One of the greatest films ever made.,"As films go, this one is by far one of the best ever made.  I'm always blown away by the first entrance into the desert.  As the sun rises and as the score reaches a crescendo, the scene dissolves into a vast rolling sea of sand.  Cresting the immense dune is Lawrence and his guide, dwarfed by the desert that surrounds them.  The film goes on and continues to impress.  The raid on Aquaba, the score and the performances from Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are fresh and vibrant now as they were almost forty years ago.  This is one film that needs to be seen in a large theatre, or if one is not available, the letterboxed edition.

Most overrated film I've ever seen! This is so boring!,"I really can't understand why anyone would like this film. I can't say much good about this. First of all the film takes much too long. It is so boring, there are almost no interesting scenes in the whole movie. Even the action scenes are boring. Director David Lean could at least have made the fight scenes exciting. There's also not much dialog in this movie. More than half of the time we see nothing but desert. Actor Peter O'Toole is acting like he has a face of plastic, his face expression is always the same. I don't know if the film is completely historically correct, but I doubt it. The Arabs are very stereotyply portrayed. The only thing positive to say about this film, is that the cinematography is very well done, certainly for a film from 1962. The music is sometimes quite good, but the music doesn't always match with the scenes.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, except to people who have insomnia.

Simply Outstanding!,"Lawrence Of Arabia is a remarkable film and paves the way for other adventure epics to come. About a man's struggle with identity, heroism, murder, and even homosexuality(the real Lawrence was a homosexual).  David Lean does a great job presenting this epic.  There are some of the finest scenes shot in the desert in this movie.  For example, the intense scene when it shows the sun then Lawrence then the other man in rotations. This movie is extremely exciting and you are always hanging on the edge of your seat to see what happens next.  It is amazing in the theater( I was lucky enough to catch it while in theaters for two days).  Lawrence has brilliant cinematography, great directing, amazing acting, and an extraordinary screenplay.  The way it shows Lawrence changing and becoming insane is remarkable.

wow,"So I watched the award winning Lawrence of Arabia from 1962. Well is it a classic well yeah that's an easy one. This movie stars Peter O'toole as the sexually ambiguous T. E Lawrence who led the Arabs to freedom in the early part of the last century. This movie was directed by David Lean who also won an academy award for ""The bridge over the river kwai"". What both these movies have in common is a grand scope and an eye for detail that is unparalleled in most movies. The movie has one problem it is 3 hours and 35 minute before the final credits start. It is only a big deal if you are planning to watch it in one sitting, but in general it doesn't play long. The long slow scenes don't play so because you really are brought into those seemingly infinite deserts and feel the struggle for survival experienced by the characters. This movie is about as well made as you can get, there is a fair amount of testosterone thrown around but this movie should appeal to both sexes.

LOTR Doesn't Come Anywhere Near Close,"Given the recent spate of apparently excellent biographies - ""The Aviator"", ""Ray"", ""Finding Neverland"" (I'm yet to see any of these) - and also a rediscovered delight of moviegoers in watching movies on an epic scope and length, the effect of Lawrence of Arabia on any competent movie lover is even stronger. It is without doubt the best film in both of these popular categories.There are so many great things to say about this piece of brilliance: music, editing, acting are all top notch; but ultimately it is all about David Lean - one of the best directors of the 20th Century. There is never any doubt of the deserving ""epic"" tag that so many people place upon it, but is the study of character which sets ""Lawrence"" above all other pretenders. Character vs scale is a balancing act that is extraordinarily hard to pull off in a movie of this scale. Modern audiences have to compare it to recent examples: Peter Jackson tried - and failed - to do it in his brilliant LOTR adaptations, Mel Gibson butchered history in Braveheart, and Spielberg has never married the two perfectly, but David Lean shows both here and in Doctor Zhivago that he was the consummate master.Spielberg himself adores this movie (praise from a director who's movies have grossed more than any other is high praise indeed!) and it's not hard to see why. At a length of over 4 hours, ""Lawrence"" flies by, which considering there were moments in LOTR which had me fidgeting in my seat in potential boredom is testament to the brilliance of the storytelling.There has never been anything better than this - except perhaps another of David Lean's very best.

"A Memorable, Expertly-Crafted Epic","Worthwhile for any number of reasons, David Lean's filming of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a memorable, very entertaining, and expertly crafted epic. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of T.E. Lawrence works even better than you could have hoped for, and the entire cast of talented actors is given first-class material to work with. The script, settings, and the entire production are of fine quality.O'Toole's distinctive, original style is a good match for such a complicated and unusual figure as Lawrence, who was one of the most complex historical figures of his generation. Even in the nearly four hours of running time, you could not cover the entire life of such a man, yet because of the way that O'Toole is able to capture the character so memorably, you come away from the movie with the feeling of understanding more than just the events themselves.The rest of the cast likewise could hardly be better. Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Omar Sharif, and all the rest bring their characters to life believably, and they are an indispensable part of creating the world around the main character.Lean's own ability to film this kind of large-scale story was never put to better use. When watched in widescreen, there are times when you can almost feel the sand and the desert heat, because of how carefully the scenes and settings have been rendered.To be sure, it's a very long movie, and it defies a lot of the movie conventions that normally apply to such a large-scale production. And as a period piece, it shows us some things as they have not been for a long time (yet that still have some significance). But because of all this, it rewards careful viewing, since many of its subtleties can be even more satisfying than the exciting action sequences.",,Anonymous,Biography

Beautifully shot epic,"I've heard plenty of things about this movie before I ever found out what it was about. The moment the music now famous as the piece that plays when we first see the desert came on, I recognized it from several movies and TV-shows. Though I didn't realize it until I saw him wearing them, I've seen Lawrence's Arabian clothes many times, several of these before I knew of the movie at all. I think that's what defines a true classic; that you know of it... before you're told. That it's ""everywhere"", in a sense. You can't really go anywhere without hearing about it at some point, because it was such an experience, it had such an impact on people. Everything that came later was in some way influenced by it, affected by it. The first thing that struck me about this film is how beautifully shot it is; at first, I couldn't quite muster up the effort to pay full attention, thinking about how long it would be(ADD victim = yours truly), but when I finally did, I couldn't take my eyes off it again. It was mesmerizing, captivating. I couldn't possibly express through mere words how amazing the visuals are... you have to see for yourself. Some say that the film is 'flashy', but every masterpiece has its critics. I'm certainly not one of this masterpiece's. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was hardly bored at any point watching it(though it is quite a behemoth of a viewing experience... three hours and twenty minutes). The acting is top-notch, and Guinness, Sharif, Quinn and O'Toole are all magnificent. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography and editing are both state-of-the-art. Writing in general is excellent. The dialog is truly great, both as far as writing and delivery goes. This movie contains some highly memorable and impressive war scenes, as well, for anyone out there looking for that sort of thing. The film is a timeless classic that should be seen by just about anyone, regardless of their interest in fine film-making(which this is a prime example of) or historical accuracy(which this film seems to have more than its share of). I recommend this to anyone, but I suggest you make sure you have the patience for it. Put it on and watch it until the end. You won't regret it. I certainly didn't. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent movie that needs to be seen several times in a row.,"Is there a better reason why you should watch this movie than being an admirer of classic films and having a great interest in good war movies? Sure, there are plenty, but I didn't know them before I watched this movie. In fact, I didn't know all that much about it except for the fact that it was made in the sixties and situated in Arabia during WWI. I'm almost ashamed to admit this, but I didn't even know that it was made by the same director who made the excellent ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"".T. E. Lawrence is a lieutenant in the British Army in North Africa during World War One. He doesn't like his current assignment (coloring maps) at all and is thrilled when he is offered a job as an observer with Prince Feisal, the leader of an Arab tribal army. From that moment on his life takes an unforeseen twist as he becomes one of the greatest leaders of the Arabian revolution against the Turks.Watching this movie is a journey back in time. Not only because the story is situated about 90 years ago, but also because this is a movie from a time period in which they still knew how to make epic movies without too many special things around it. They didn't have computers to enhance all their images, but had to rely on excellent acting, a great story and what nature provided them with. And all these things are amazing in this movie. Take for instance the acting by Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn,... who are all excellent. Not that I expected anything less from such a cast, but sometimes you can end up very disappointed when you have very high expectations, but that's certainly not the case this time. What I also liked a lot were the magnificent landscapes which seemed to be accentuated by the terrific music by Maurice Jarre. Those landscapes wouldn't have looked that great if they hadn't been shot well of course, but it's clear that the entire crew knew what it was doing.I could go on for hours about this movie, but that would bring us too far. All I still want to say about it is that I'm convinced that this movie can no longer be made. Not only aren't there enough great and magnificent actors to play the many different roles, the makers would probably add a lot of computer animated graphics to it, spoiling the purity of the entire film by adding a fake sand storm or something like that. No, this is a movie the way they made them in the old days with some very fine acting, a good story, some nice music,... I give this movie at least an 8.5/10. If I ever get the chance to see it on DVD, instead of watching a badly taped television version, this rating will probably go up. But despite that 'problem', I can assure you that I'm already a fan and an admirer of this magnificent epic movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
More educational then our most of your history classes.,"If you haven't seen this movie or studied the region in college its a safe bet that you have no idea why most of the wars and problems across the entire middle east and beyond really happened and after you watch it hopefully this will make you realize just how bad our own people can lie to us (or more specifically neglect to include any kind of actual truth anyways and inturn replace this with wild interpretations based upon nothing), despite all our flag waving and claims of being the good guys. Wish i was being overly dramatic here, but the fact that this is edited or even omitted from our normal educations should make you more than just a little upset. Oh and this film is widely regarded as one of the most accurate historical films ever made and shot on location in syria on the saudi border, and has a good cast and crew which should help you get through the long run time. but im about ready to start pleading people to watch this movie when today ignorance can be so unbelievably common and aggressively belligerent.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The story of my experience.,"I wrote this review back in May when I started writing reviews here and I gave it a 7/10- stating that even though it was critically acclaimed(Roger Ebert gave if 4/4 stars and called it a great movie, Steven Spielberg calls it his favorite movie, it won Best Picture, etc.), I thought it dragged way too much.It shocked me MOST that it won Best Picture-To Kill A Mockingbird and The Music Man were deemed less great than this?My problem was not just with the dragging plot, but also how there is so much focus on the desert without any dialogue. I thought this could have been easily shorter than 227 minutes!These were my thoughts when I saw this when I was 18-which was 2 years ago. Now I'm 20, and I had gotten rid of my old DVD. But something about the movie made me want to see this ""7/10 movie"" again.So on New Year's Eve I bought it, and last night I got around to doing so. I find myself riveted with the opening, and yes, some parts did go longer that it should have, but like 2001: A Space Odyssey, such moments should be simply experienced and taken in, and then it is not so bad.Seeing it again, I noticed many powerful moments, such as: the cut to a sunset, the quicksand scene, Lawrence getting his robe, etc.There are also great lines, like(paraphrases below):""What do you like about the desert?""
""It's clean.""(after pinching a lit match)
""Ow! That hurts!""
""Of course it hurts!""
""So how do you deal with the pain?""
""The trick is to not MIND that it hurts.""The latter quote is probably my #1 part of the movie, by the way!I apologize for my previous 7, this truly deserved more! Lawrence of Arabia deserves to be called a classic, despite it's slow pace. It's a wonder to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An outstanding achievement - but not for modern viewers,"I watched this movie for the first time about 2 days ago, and id like to share my thoughts on the film. first allow me to explain my summary comment. (I'm not giving away any spoilers because i don't think there are any to give away) L o A was made during a time when movies had the word 'epic' rubberstamped all over them, in 1962, only three years after ben hur, 2 years after spartacus, 6 or 7 years after bridge on the river kwai, you get my point, when movies were made not necessarily to satisfy audience cravings, when visionary directors like David lean wanted to tell a story and the studio gave them whatever they wanted in order to achieve this. the movie runs in at very nearly 4 hours long, and i wont lie here, sometimes it feels like it. the length of the movie is, however the only criticism i can find, as acting, script,and cinematography are quite frankly out of this world and the sweat will run off you as lawrence frazzles in the heat. my point is that a great deal of young people will be unaccustomed to such attention to detail in a movie, when the answers are not thrust down your throat and somebody is not slaughtered every 5 mins. i realise I'm been cynical but the days when you could whack out a four hour masterpiece and expect your audience to lap it up are long gone.. but that does explain the low ratings, obviously from youngsters who viewed (part of)the movie and were bored stiff. well what did you expect? independence day? if your over 65, this movie is probably one of your all time favourites, but if your under 25, well, just avoid.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the very best,"LAWRENCE OF ARABIA contains the most epic cinematography I have ever witnessed, coming from a generation free of CGI. The visuals are breathtaking, and the musical score is no less rousing.Similarly triumphant are the performances of Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, and most of all Peter O'Toole. O'Toole utterly captures the audience with his portrayal of TE Lawrence. He becomes Lawrence, complete with pomp and quirk in one of the defining performances of cinematic history. To ignore the supporting cast is neglectful however. They were all flawless.Billed as an action movie, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA far transcends such classification. The astounding depths of the many layers of this film delve into serious consideration of war, politics, history, and humanity. Each action and each spoken word hold true meaning. Each scene is laid out with an air of importance. Despite this, the movie never feels heavy, and never drags on. There is the finest balance between the gravity of the subject matter and the free spirit in which it is delineated. Expect to be captivated.This is David Lean's masterpiece - a monument of cinema equaled by few, and surpassed by none.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Best Epic and Movie of the 20th Century,"From the cinematography, the acting, the story, the characters, the action and the overall atmoshpere of Lawrence of Arabia we witness brilliance in film making. Ben-Hur is an extraordinary film, but this is the pinnacle of expert movie-making.Peter O'toole gives one of the most intense performances of the century and all of the supporting actors are first-rate.What is most commendable about Lawrence of Arabia is that it is a brilliant piece of film without the pretense of most modern films. The story and the actors are the key elements; there is no ""epiphanic"" or ""relevatory"" moment--that spoil so many current movies--that change the story from its true telling.If you want to watch film-making at its finest, watch this movie. It's four hours long, but you will not be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great, but could have been greater","""Ben-Hur"" won more Oscars, ""Spartacus"" had a more accessible cast, but ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" David Lean's 1962 biography of the enigmatic British officer known as much for his flamboyance as he was for his bravery, is regarded by most critics and film historians as the greatest of all epics. Originally 222 minutes long, then cut and recut for various re-issues, the winner of 7 Academy Awards was restored to a nearly intact running time of 216 minutes and re-released to great acclaim in 1989.  What makes ""Lawrence"" so special?  The general consensus seems to be that the film is ""literate,"" while so many of these big scale epics are not.  True enough, but it seems to me that ""literate"" is often a euphemism for ""dull.""""Lawrence"" does make good use of its 3 hours and 36 minutes, so it isn't dull, but I am at a loss to find one truly exciting moment.  Even the battle scenes are subdued, and nothing really stirred my emotions the way ""Spartacus"" managed to do. What is fascinating, however, is the portrait--fairly ambiguous--drawn by Peter O' Toole, who achieved international stardom as a result of this role.  His Lawrence is somewhat ethereal, yet brave and compassionate. The alleged homosexuality of the real Lawrence--a taboo for on-screen exploration back in 1962--seems to be suggested by O' Toole's occasionally fey manner and by some of the dialogue in the script.  ""I'm not an ordinary man,"" Lawrence tells one of his superiors in the British service.  The man's reaction is enlightening:  ""I'm not talking about THAT!"" he says.Otherwise, ""Lawrence"" features the usual roundup of British actors one usually finds in these things (Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle, et al), and Arthur Kennedy, basically reviving the newspaperman role he essayed two years earlier in ""Elmer Gantry.""  Does it sound like I'm panning Mr. Lean's epic film?  I hope not.  ""Lawrence of Arabia"" IS a great film, but it would have been greater if it had worked on the emotions as well as it does on the intellect.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
No words can describe this movie.,"The word brilliant doesn't even come close to describe this movie. It's beyond brilliant!""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a big epic movie about an even more epic person. The character of T.E. Lawrence is portrayed perfectly in the movie, not just by the actor Peter O'Toole but also by the director David Lean. Ignore the story, this movie is simply about T.E. Lawrence the at times complex and interesting character that really carries the movie even though the story itself is also more than fascinating.The movie is full with wonderful scene's that never get boring even though the movie is almost 4 hours long. The best way to describe some of the scene's is that it feels like a poem. Some of the scene's will stay with you forever and you will most definitely never forget this movie as long as you live.There are also some other wonderful characters besides T.E. Lawrence that are brought to live by great actors such as Sir Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif. All together they make this movie even more grand, interesting and great to watch. Add to this the magical Maurice Jarre musical score that is one of the bests ever and you even have a more brilliant picture!There are also some big battle scene's that are beyond you imagination. This movie gives the word epic truly a new meaning!This is perfection!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch it for the last 89 minutes,"The DVD I watched of this movie was divided into two parts: the first 132 minutes before the intermission and the last 89 minutes after the intermission. I watched the first part one night and the next part the following morning. My reaction? To tell the truth, I was sort of dreading those 89 minutes before I actually sat down to watch them. The first part of the movie had some good parts, but was so incredibly slow that I could hardly stand it. Take, for example, the scene where Lawrence meets Sheriff Ali. We see Ali as a dot in the distance--perhaps 1000 feet away. Guess what happens? The camera stays trained on Ali for all 1000 of those feet, not once cutting away. It takes 2 minutes for that man to ride up to Lawrence on his camel. Believe me, there are many other scenes like this in the first part. It is torture. The first part could have been shortened by at least 45 minutes, if not an hour.But, for some reason, the director decided to be more sensible with part two. The battle scenes became better, the pace a lot quicker, the characterization a lot more skillful, the emotional impact a lot stronger, etc. Those 89 minutes are what made the movie--all 221 minutes of it.If you want to watch this movie, I'm sorry that you're stuck with the first 132 minutes. But you'll consider it at least somewhat worth it once you get past the intermission.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The boring masterpiece.,"Lawrence of Arabia is a masterpiece. The visuals are stunning - back in the day when they did things the real way, not using CGI and other special effects to put together a movie. The acting is wonderful. The cinematography has a Kubrick feel to it, which in my opinion makes it excellent. The music is classic. Pretty much everything about Lawrence of Arabia is masterful.The only problem is, for me at least, is that it is simply boring. This isn't because it is old. Old movies can be plenty entertaining...it was just a long and boring film. It is a perfect movie that just isn't entertaining.9/10, the boring masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Funny tale,"Here's something funny for all you Peter O'Toole fans. In one of the last scenes Peter O'Toole is driven out of the desertby a driver, the actor Bryan Pringle. In real life, these two were great friends. Pringle could not actually drive and so as he pretended to O'Toolehad to do the pedals beneath the view of the camera, also as they were getting ready for the long shot, they were milesfrom anyone, O'Toole turned to Pringle and said ""Does this heatgive you a rash?""

"A great epic, best appreciated in more than 1 sitting","I first watched Lawrence of Arabia when I was about 10 years old with my parents. We had some sort of movie renting coupon from Rogers and were planning on nailing all the best picture films. I remember watching part I and II on separate days, and falling asleep both times because the movie was so long.Now, 11 years later, I've watched the full movie again. The full 3 hours and 30 minutes of this film can't be watched in one sitting for me. The long scenes of Lawrence and the Arabs trekking across the dessert are hard to watch and stay awake in, especially at night. This film is better appreciated in more than one sitting, and in sections.I think one of the major downfalls of this movie is that it is so long. But I'm noticing that this might have been some kind of trend in 60's epic cinema (2001: A Space Odyssey is a good example). The focus is more on showing dramatic and beautiful landscapes (considering when the movie was made, this is very impressive cinematography). Cutting out all those long scenes and focusing on the actual plot reveals a complex narrative of a complex man.Peter O' Toole gives a stunning performance as a transformed man after his experiences in the dessert. In Part I, he is a noble man, afraid of bloodshed, representing law and order. By Part II, he completes his descent into insanity, becoming bloodthirsty and damaged beyond repair. The tragic irony of all this is that his own ego is what led to his personal downfall, even though he is glorified in public opinion.One critique I've read is that Peter O'Toole's character is not an accurate representation of the real T.E. Lawrence, so if you're looking at this film from a historical standpoint it might not be enjoyable. But taking it as an epic exploring themes of loyalty, violence and adventure this really is a great story with incredible acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most beautiful film ever shot,"A few days ago I was lucky enough to see Lawrence of Arabia uncut on the big screen shown in a gorgeous 70mm print. It re-affirmed my belief that this is probably the finest film ever made. Previously to now having to put up with murky VHS prints I could never appreciate Freddie Young's photography, the level of detail is outstanding and the colour a wonder to behold. The size of the image allows you to see the real skill of the cast, as subtle expressions and movements are so easily lost on the Television screen.Although it rather dramatises the events that took place in Arabia during the Great War, the condensing (and inevitable intensifying) of events was essential in order to bring T.E. Lawrence's 700 page tome The Seven Pillars Of Wisdom to screen. Although approaching 4 hours in length is not a moment too long. Lean's captivating direction never allows to rest as you constantly fed visual treats and mental stimulation (regrettably many viewers these days like a film to do everything for them, rather than to raise questions and provoke intelligent thought)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An outstanding, colossus of a picture","Lawrence of Arabia has been rightly celebrated as one of David Leans Masterpieces. It is massive and tremendous in every sense of the word- massive in length, massive in scope, and massive in scenery. Cinematographer Freddie Young has a filmed a gargantuan movie which has the rare ability of bleeding out of your screen- anyone viewing on a small screen will feel woefully inadequate. Young has succeeded magnificently, for he captures in stupendous waves of sand and sky, both the magnificence, the wonder, and the endless, vast expanse of forbidding the desert presents. The battle scenes are also captured in great detail and in great scope, thousands of men filling your entrie screen. An astounding feat. The extraordinary music by Maurice Jarre brilliant in accentuating this atmosphere- Jarres score evokes the grandeur of the desert, and also conveys a unique exoticism in its atmosphere. The acting and writing also deserves praise. Peter O Toole is astonishing as Lawrence. Lawrence becomes a veritable prophet, a messiah in the desert, but he is far from invincible. The film breaks him down using a harrowing experience with a Turkish general, and does well in humanising him. Lawrence is not portrayed as infallible- he is emotional, and liable to tantrums and emotional outbursts. Omar Shariff is also excellent as his conscience, his ally Sheriff Ali. The writing does well in maintains a lively pace. The dialogue is always intelligent, crisp, and sharp, which keeps the audience interest. The film runs for almost 4 hours but it feels nothing like it's length. However my issue with the film is here- while it does not feel like 4 hours, it does feel long. I find around 40 minutes could have been cut from this film. The scenes in the second part(after the intermission) also loses a bit of pace compared the preceding section. Whereas the first section was a stunning masterpiece of not only great beauty, but also of taut pace, the second part does slog on a bit, with what little plot stretched too thinly. Perhaps this is because the freshness and intrigue of the desert is starting to dissipate, as the movie slows. All in all, Lawrence of Arabia and its visual splendour is something I have not seen on screen before at all. But it's second part keeps it from being something truly great, something which can, like Lawrence, unify and conquer the disparate tastes and hearts of all.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic Epic,"Though the eponymous character is a dull enigma from beginning to end (and is played in an annoyingly mannered way), and that the political / sexual angles are insufficiently detailed, this remains one of the director's greatest triumphs and the best of his five latter-day epics. Its brilliance is entirely visual - deserts, mountains, palaces, cities and trains have rarely been filmed with such compositional flair or dramatic feel.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The man still remains an enigma after more than three hours...,"Yes, this epic of a British soldier assigned to Arabia during World War I, is every bit as brilliant as previous viewers state. But at the end of this gorgeously photographed epic (with great score by Maurice Jarre), we really are left pondering what his true motivations were--and what his true character was. The screenplay doesn't give us a clue, nor does the enigmatic performance of Peter O'Toole in the title role. Somewhat of a cheat, after watching with rapt absorption all of his exploits and wondering if there will ever be a revelation of the man who ventured into the desert--and into the history books.Despite this major flaw, the film is totally absorbing and, of course, should be seen in a theater on a large screen. The combination of great performances, photography and music makes for a stunningly majestic epic. The other significant flaw is the length--it tends to bog down during the final phases of the story, indicating perhaps some judicious editing would have helped.Peter O'Toole here gives his greatest performance--as does Omar Shariff. Their performances alone are a major reason for watching and appreciating David Lean's magnificent film. Watching it unfurl, you'll realize why it won seven Academy Awards in 1962.",,Anonymous,Biography

Also, It warms my heart to see that Peter O'Toole has finally received an honorary oscar for this film (in case you're not familiar, he lost his 1962 Best Actor Oscar to Gregory Peck for ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). It's also amazing to me that this is O'Toole's first starring role, in which he did such a smashing job.
