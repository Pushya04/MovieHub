The Seeds of Displacement...,"It's a time that you are glad you were not given, forced from your land to make a big transition, as a journey on jalopy, not at sea but very choppy, presents a family with an awful proposition. It's as if you are a refugee at home, as you're treated like vermin where you all roam, no one cares about your plight, the authorities just fight, encouraging you on your way, so you're just gone. It may get you cogitating on today, that the world has not moved on that much to say, there are those still dispossessed, living a life engulfed by stress, with little help, support or welfare where they stay.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Not the Book, But Beautiful in Its Own Right","It's difficult on a first viewing of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the ""gee whizz"" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,History
The definitive Great Depression film,"Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake ""Hollywood"" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clichés. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west.If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere.Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
"My experience of living  the movie, its so true to life","This movie is so real..at least to this person, who lived these things that happened in the movie. I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the ThirtiesI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money.We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hutthis was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.Gene McDaniel",10.0,Anonymous,History
Everyone should see Grapes of Wrath and be thankful for what they have!,"In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the ""writing types"". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the ""lies"" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation. Wanna get down on your knees and thank the Lord for what you have, Americans? You will when you view this amazing film!",10.0,Anonymous,History
John Ford's stark portrayal of a poor family in the depression remains one of the most moving films in history.,"The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time.Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad, a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film, only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior, otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation, as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country, on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about, provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely well-structured.The family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey, from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there, at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as `Okies,' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending, because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film.The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns, and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place, while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together, seeing it as the only thing that they really had left, but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing, which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers.The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film, but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless, and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn, but there comes a point, at least once in a great while, when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing, and in such cases, The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Economic Dislocation,"John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs.America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review.Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The First Great Film of a Great Decade for the Cinema.,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" was a huge novel so it only made sense to turn it into a feature motion picture.

Thus they decide to leave the midwest of our nation's Great Depression and go to California. The film is an intensely dramatic affair that is first-rate in all cinematic departments.

Depression Era America,"Featuring some really excellent b&w cinematography - 1940's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a fairly faithful screen-adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel of the same name (which had won its author a Pulitzer Prize For Literature).From my perspective - One of the most refreshing aspects of this picture (which clearly depicted the harsh realities of the ""Great Depression"" in America) was that it completely steered clear of injecting any glamour into its plot-line (which was quite the opposite practice in Hollywood films of that particular era). And, this, in turn, really appealed to me in a big way.All-in-all - I'd definitely say that ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is certainly worth recommending to other viewers for its overall significance in the history of American cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A marvellous production of Steinbeck's epic.,"Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad captures perfectly the humanity and compassion of the Steinbeck character, an ex-con who breaks his parole conditions by joining his family in their epic journey across the southern US to a ""better life"" in California.This is not the usual Hollywood fare. Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out. Fonda's role is particularly understated, and we see, as in Steinbeck's masterly epic, the maternally robust figure of Ma holding the family together.The performances all round are wonderful, and Ford's direction and sense of space under the big sky of the Midwest is breathtaking.This film is now largely a testament to the time in which it was set, but like the war movies that were soon to follow, a story that needed telling lest we forget.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This Land Is Our Land,"At 20th Century Fox, the management was worried when producer Darryl Zanuck bought the movie rights to John Steinbeck's latest book. And you can understand why. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" doesn't sound like a suitable story for the cinema. But Zanuck convinced his executives that, in the right hands, the film would be artistically and financially successful. It was just a matter of finding the right director.The film is set during the Great Depression in the 1930s. It focuses on a poor family driven from their Oklahoma home by drought and bank foreclosures. Due to their hopeless situation they head for California along with thousands of other ""Oakies"" seeking a future.After working with Steinbeck's book for several months, Fox Studios sent over a finished screenplay to John Ford. Many feared that the story would be too left-wing for the famous director, but luckily he had no such problems. On the contrary: John Ford thought the tale reminded him of his own family's plight in Ireland during the potato famine. He was more than happy to work with it.Ford and his photographers immediately began shooting the movie on the Fox Studio lot. They tried to get the picture to look as bleak and harsh as a documentary, and it worked. Without using any makeup or diffusion, the actors came across as hard-edged, dirty Dust Bowlers. Finally, Zanuck selected an accordion version of the old standard ""Red River Valley"" to be the film's theme song.After a successful premiere in New York, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" went on to become one of Fox's biggest pictures of 1940. Steinbeck himself wrote that the film was even better than his book. But not everyone was equally happy. The FBI began an investigation of John Ford, John Steinbeck and others involved in the film for suspicious Communist activity. In the end, of course, nothing came out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"California, Super Cool To The Homeless","The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of ""homicide"" could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as ""people are going to win rich, people are going to die"". - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece...,"During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In ""The Grapes of Wrath"", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed ""Stagecoach"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" in less than 12 months. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Triumph in Record Time,"They say that you should wait 20 or 30 years before attempting to capture an historical event on film.  That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the ""feel"" of Viet Nam (in ""Platoon"") so soon (13 years) after America's withdrawal.  Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.But, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 ""dust bowl"" to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.Of course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man.One of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society.  That completely misses the point.  Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.This is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Down but not Out,"Anytime you are tempted to feel down and out, watch this movie. I personally have seen it many times and are currently reading the book which I highly recommend. I cannot emphasize this enough. This is as down as you can get and still survive. We are taught to be grateful when watching this and to also consider the other guy, whoever he is and at the least, do not add to his burden. Actors are on their game as is the Director. Of course, none of this exists if it wasn't for John Steinbeck and his book. I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls. Have something to eat while watching to appreciate that you have food and the people in the movie do not, a tasty drink and a snack which is unheard of back during the depression days will help you connect more to the movie theme. There is humility, gratitude and lessons to be learned while being entertained. Its called a TEN thank you",10.0,Anonymous,History
Fine Cast & Production,"This classic adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" features a fine cast as well as a skillful production headed by director John Ford. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film. Ford clearly appreciated the potential in the material, and he and the cast work together to make each character count, and to give meaning to each scene.",,Anonymous,History
"Good film, terribly dense/heavy - boring","As subjective as it may seem, I cannot avoid making the comment this film was a bit boring. Painful to watch. There's a strain that the narrative builds over the watcher, the pressures of an incredibly tough and depressing series of life events, where a viewer may be left thinking: ""well I don't have an issue with dramas or tough films, but why focus on such difficult and common life events ?"" It's one of these things about historical movies - a particular event having occurred doesn't necessarily make for a great film plot or story to tell.The incredibly rough Great Depression years were awful and all, sure, but to make 2 hours plus of film based on the Steinbeck novel... this is like an American Emile Zola, an American Germinal. That monotonous old naturalism/realism narrative of exploring the misery of the working class... why, out of everything else there is to write about or make a film about... You'd ask yourself why an author would focus all his energy on something so bleak and real, there's such a lack of fantasy, the story telling is just totally flat and linear. What, we're barely given 30 seconds of poetry at the end from Fonda and then a speech from the mother in that last scene, but 2hrs10 for that ?...Good film.

Is it me?,"I hesitated before writing this, because I really didn't much like this movie, and I assumed at first that it was because I find its politics so appalling.But the more I think about it, the more I realize that even cinematically, I found it compelling only on a purely visual level (Ford's movies are always at least visually compelling).I think Ford spent so much effort trying to make his characters into symbols that he failed to make them people. At no point did I care whether the Joads made it to California; the deaths of the old folks made no impression on me. The villainy of the local cops and those who ran the work camps was much mitigated by its obvious artifice. The only emotion any of these people inspired in me was a deep desire to punch that self-righteous jerk Tom Joad right in the mouth--which I don't think was what Ford was going for. I have to admit that I did like John Carradine, but I always like John Carradine.And when the Joads drove into that federal government work camp, and it was like arriving in heaven with an obvious FDR lookalike (sans wheelchair, of course) as God, I completely lost it. That was about the unintentionally funniest thing I've ever seen in a classic film.Am I just too cynical?",4.0,Anonymous,History

One Of The Best Films Ever Made!,"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is a Drama History film in black and white starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned. He learns that the land is no longer producing enough crops to provide for their family and the whole family heads to California to look for work. The best parts of the film are the acting, the plot, and the cinematography.The acting and casting are excellent. The entire cast is full of life and they deliver their lines with perfect execution. When Tom Joad returns home to see his family, they are all lit up and full of smiles. You are able to see the happiness and utter joy that they are feeling to be reunited with a family member and you can sense the fear and anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move.The plot is riveting. Rarely do you see a historical film that is as much of a work of art as The Grapes of Wrath is. The story will take you into the Great Depression years ago and give you a glimpse at what a poor family during that time might have gone through. The timing of the script is great and will have you hoping for the main characters to be able to keep their home some way or at least find a nicer one. The plot allows for many emotional performances.The cinematography is excellent and professional. It proves that not only the cast and actors were perfect for the jobs, but the crew must have been as well. There are no shaky shots and there are no scenes where something is out of view that should be able to be seen by the camera and there are no scenes that were too zoomed in that you couldn't see anything. The camera pans between characters based on who is talking.I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested in history. Although this film is long (over 2 hours), there are no boring or dull parts in the film and it is definitely worth taking the time to watch it. Also, this film was made in the early 40s and it is in black and white. Even if you usually don't like or watch black and white films, I would recommend that you watch The Grapes of Wrath. This would also be an excellent film to show in history class when teaching about The Great Depression.The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent classic film that I would recommend to anyone regardless of whether or not they enjoy old films or black and white films. This film is worth the 2 hours that is takes to watch it because the acting, plot, and cinematography are phenomenal. The emotional scenes were executed to perfection and will leave you feeling sorry for the characters. The plot will have you interested in the beginning and the cinematography makes it easy to understand and see what is going on in the film. Overall this is an excellent film and deserves 10/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Grapes of Wrath (1940),"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) was a very well-made look at the experience of an Oklahoma farmer during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. It is hard not to feel sympathy for the families who are losing their homes and farms. It was an intensely emotional scene when Muley and his family have to watch their homes be plowed to the ground. There were some scenes that it was easy to tell that there was a painted backdrop ( for example when Tom is arriving back home for the first time, he is walking through a field and there's an obvious backdrop.)The fact that the director was able to create a convincing look at the dustbowl so soon after it occurred definitely speaks for his talent.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!,"The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford from a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was the film adaptation of the very well known and renowned book of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film like the book is set during the era of the Great Depression in the 1930s and follows the Joad family from Oklahoma as they deal with poverty on their way to the 'promised land' of California after being thrown out of their own land and property.The themes of the film revolve around the concept of the loss of home. After the Joads get uprooted from their home like many other farmer families, they head out for California in their truck. This truck becomes their mobile home. They become wanderers in search of a real home. It is unreal how the issue of migrants that enrich Steinbeck's novel and Ford's film is still extremely relevant to this very day. We see the local officials mistreat, mislead and exploit them and all the poor migrants like the Joads go along with it with the hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. The Darwinian concept of the 'survival of the fittest' also comes very much into the equation. Once the Joads leave their land, some members of the family lose their grit, hope and conviction like Grandpa, Grandma and Pa, while on the other hand, the misery and sorry plight of the circumstances emboldens Ma and makes her the source of strength for everyone including Tom. Tom Joad is a very interesting character. He starts out as the angry loner. He then comes into contact and becomes a part of the family unit. But the misery and struggles force him in an ironic sense to re-embrace the identity of the outlaw loner to bring about a change. The purity and sweetness of the mother-son relationship between Tom and Ma is given a lot of attention by Ford and Johnson, even more so than Steinbeck did in the novel.Ford's direction in the film is understated and not very flashy. There are moments of great artistic imagery, eg: the 3 shadows trampled by the tractor marks, Gregg Toland's brilliant cinematography under Ford's direction involving shadows specially in the scene where Tom and Casy meet Muley, the brilliant shot where the Joad family leaves on their truck bidding adieu to their home and Ford decides to hold the shot a few seconds longer after they have left to show the wind, dust and garbage blowing towards the house,etc. Ford's direction in the scenes in the Transient Camps is absolutely brilliant. He uses the moving camera from the perspective of the Joads to introduce them and the viewers to all the other migrants. The other aspects of those scenes involving the hungry kids are very touching.But the film I thought is flawed. First of all, clearly due to all the restrictions that films of that era were plagued by, there are a lot of crucial aspects of the original novel that get watered down a bit. I am certainly not someone who gets annoyed when the film is very different to the original source material because I have the maturity to understand that cinema and literature are two completely different fields. But I do think if the political aspect of the novel was explored more boldly in the film, it would have worked to its benefit. Another aspect of the film that put me off a bit is some of the hokey nature of the written lines. Nunnally Johnson's writing at times gets too cheesy and overt. The overt nature of some of the lines spoken by the characters might work on the page of a book, but on screen, it does stick out in an ugly way. The acting by the ensemble cast is also a bit too theatrical at times which made it difficult for me to maintain a constant emotional attachment with the characters.Although the quality of acting is not consistent from everyone, but Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Qualen as Muley are the ones who stand out. Fonda accurately conveys the repressed anger and frustration that makes up Tom's character with moments of touching emotions. Darwell is as likable as ever as Ma. She exudes a caring and loving quality that is impossible to avoid. She also plays the character with some strength as Ma does in a way become the backbone of the family after they leave their home. Although John Qualen has a peculiar appearance, but the power of his performance forced me to really empathise with Muley's pains and struggles.'The Grapes of Wrath' is not flawless. In my view it has its fair share of issues much of which was down to rigid restrictions that were imposed upon the films of that era. But even with its flaws, it still is a very solid John Ford film which made me feel for the characters. Just like the novel, it forces the viewer to put themselves in the shoes of the central characters and live the struggle with them.",7.0,Anonymous,History

If superb acting from the lead character to the bit parts entices you to watch, then do so. Every part is played to perfection. It would have been easy to overact.

I simply couldn't get into this film,"Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) has recently been released from prison and returns to his family home to discover that his family have been kicked off their land as it has been bought out by greedy developers. Joad and his family head to California to start a new life, but this journey proves to have more hazards and pitfalls than they could ever have anticipated.The Grapes Of Wrath is a film adaptation based on the John Steinbeck novel. I'll start by saying that I haven't read the book, but I can safely say that the 'cinematic' version of the book fell well below my expectations....For starters the film takes an immensely long time to get going (one could actually argue as to whether it ever gets going). The problem is that the first half is awfully slow and dull with very little happening to drive the narrative forward. To me, The Grapes Of The Wrath came across as a character-driven film but when the film is filled with uninteresting and poorly developed characters it became very hard for me to remain interested or give a damn about anything that happens to them on their journey to California.The second half of the film is slightly better (in the sense that it has a bit more urgency about it). Although the better pacing made the second half more tolerable than the first half I still felt that the whole film had a superficial feel to it - we get to see glimpses of the suffering and pain that has been bestowed upon the family, but it's never really examined in much depth and this resulted in a film that just never seemed to take advantage of all of its potential.The cast are all OK and whilst Fonda wasn't particularly brilliant here I appreciated that he tried to give the film some emotional weight (which again probably would have worked better if both the narrative and character dynamics had been stronger and more interesting).So yes I didn't like this film but will say that this was more down to the slow-paced first half, poor characterisation and the missed potential in fleshing the story out and making it more interesting.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The director (Ford) has nailed that episode of American history (or just a slice) deftly jumping from the hopeless to the hopeful that these folks lived through.

When the wind storm was rolling in it was extremely loud and if you looked around not everything was moving from these terrible winds. another thing was I liked the fact that they used a montage effect of all the signs when they were traveling from Oklahoma to California.

John Ford's Classic On John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize Bestseller,"Writers are often very leery about what Hollywood does to their work when they're adapted to the big screen. That was the case of John Steinbeck when he sold his 1939 Pulitzer Price novel to 20th Century Fox for the January 1940 film ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Steinbeck agreed to the hefty $70,000 purchase price of his book to the movie rights on the condition ""the producer agrees that any motion picture based on the said literary property shall fairly and reasonably retain the main action and social intent of the said literary property.""Steinbeck's novel on Oklahoma farmers who experienced tough times during the Depression in the early 1930s while their land was ravaged by the Great Dust Bowl was controversial in blaming greedy capitalists for removing large numbers of tenant farmers from their long-held properties. The author met with studio head Darryl F. Zanuck and scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson for the first time by relating how he heard the studio was planning to eliminate all the social commentary in his book and producing a simple tale of impoverished farmers migrating from the Midwest to California to pick fruits and vegetables. Zanuck, an ex-screenwriter himself, promised Steinbeck he was giving special attention to insure the script faithfully followed his book, no matter what the consequences were.Once word got out 20th Century Fox was producing the Steinbeck book into film, two powerful California agriculture groups organized a boycott telling rural newspapers not to run ads for the movie. Besides changing the ending and reversing the camps of the Joad's, scriptwriter Johnson was faithful to the best seller. Johnson defended the more sanitized, yet optimistic conclusion to the film ""The Grapes of Wrath"" than the book's. The screenwriter said, ""There had to be some ray of hope, something that would keep the people who saw it from going out and getting so drunk in utter despondency that they couldn't tell other people that it was a good picture to see."" Steinbeck agreed on the necessity for a more hopeful ending after seeing the film's pre-released version. He praised the studio's work, saying it's ""a hard, straight picture in which the actors are submerged so completely that it looks and feels like a documentary film, and certainly it has a hard, truthful ring.""The Academy Awards nominated ""The Grapes of Wrath"" in seven categories, winning two Oscars. Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune wrote at the time of its release the movie ""is an honest, eloquent, and challenging screen masterpiece. Great artistry has gone into its making and greater courage, for this screen tribute to the dispossessed not only has dramatized the large theme of Mr. Steinbeck's novel in enduring visual terms-it has demonstrated beyond any question that the cinema can take the raw stuff of contemporary living and mold it to a provocative photoplay pattern.""One of the more interesting choices in Hollywood history was Zanuck's selection of John Ford to direct the socially-conscious tale. Ford, whose political leanings were right of center, was approached to direct ""Grapes of Wrath"" while in the middle of filming 1939's ""Drums Along the Mohawk."" Ford agreed, later stating, ""I was sympathetic to people like the Joads, and contributed a lot of money to them, but I was not interested in 'Grapes' as a social study."" The short one-month break between the director's productions required the studio's front-line film crew, including cinematographer Gregg Toland and art directors Richard Day and Mark-Lee Kirk, to do all the pre-production mapping, including casting. Their detailed work gives ""The Grapes of Wrath"" the look of the film that exists on the screen.Jane Darwell, 61, was an interesting choice to play the Joad's matriarch. The veteran film actress who first appeared in on the screen in 1913, was known for her five appearances in Shirley Temple movies. Her plump frame went against the iconic photos taken by photographer Horace Bristol of thin, practically starving women existing in the barren fields of the lower Midwest. Henry Fonda, as the lead character in the Joad household, lobbied for Darwell to play his mother. Darwell won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, her only time nominated for the Academy Awards. Film historian Tim Dicks noted, ""Jane Darwell is marvelous as the strong center and backbone of the migratory family that must leave its ancestral land.""Ford's legendary temperament on his actors flared up during ""The Grapes of Wrath's"" filming. In one instance the director was particularly hard on actress Dorris Bowdon as Rose Joad. Darwell took Bowdon aside before one planned scene and told her she was nervous ""being such a fat old lady and I have to dance and say lines at the same time."" Standing on the sidelines watching Darwell dance, Bowdon broke into applause after Ford yelled ""Cut!"" so happy her friend was able to get through the difficult scene. The director turned to Bowdon, yelling several expletives, sending the shocked actress running off the set in tears. Ford the next day approached her by brushing off the incident with some bawdy humor, and he eased up on her for the remainder of the shoot. ""I was glad I never had to work with him again,"" Bowdon rejoiced. But like many actors who got the severe Ford treatment, Bowdon appreciated his coaching through some very difficult scenes, praising, ""He was a superb director. I never saw another director work in a way that was as skilled."" Bowdon later married scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson soon after filming wrapped, a marriage that lasted until he died in 1977.John Carradine, a regular Ford actor, played the former preacher-turned-activist Jim Casy. Despite the eleven movies over 28 years the two made together, Ford always aimed to deflate the huge ego he felt Carradine possessed. But Carradine's skin was thick and always deflected the director's barbs. Ford's philosophy was some actors needed to be chewed out to get the performance he required for certain scenes. During one tirade Ford dished out in front of those on the set was directed at Frank Darien, as Uncle Joe. The director didn't let up on him until the actor physically was seen wilting from all the abuse. It was exactly the look Ford wanted from a dejected Darien during the stew eating scene with starving children. Ford's psychological games paid off by winning his second Best Director Oscar, the first since his 1935 ""The Informer.""In poll after poll until 1958 ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was consistently ranked the number one film made from 1940 until Orson Welles' 1941 ""Citizen Kane"" finally gained recognition, superseding it. Film reviewer Gabe Guarin wrote, ""Truly deserving of its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time, this movie is a poetic and haunting slice of Americana that hasn't been matched since it was first released, and might just be the best work of everyone involved."" Beside the two Oscars, the movie was nominated by the Academy for Best Picture, Henry Fonda for Best Actor, Johnson for Best Screenplay, Robert Simpson for Best Film Editing, and Edmund Hansen for Best Sound Recording. The American Film Institute ranks the picture as the 21st Best Movie of All Time, the seventh Most Cheerful Film, Tom Joad (Fonda) as the 12th Best Hero in Movies. AFI also nominated it for the Best Movie Quote, Tom's closing statement to his mother before leaving the family fold, ""Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.""

Misrepresentation Of History,"This hyped classic has a number of problems seldom acknowledged by reviewers and serious film historians. Only the first 45 minutes or so take place in Oklahoma. Well over half the plot is set either on the road or in California. This is a curious plot structure for a film about ""okies"".Very few of the Oklahoma scenes were actually filmed in Oklahoma. Indeed, the Joad farmstead and surrounding landscape look nothing at all like Oklahoma; these scenes were all filmed in California. In point of fact, John Steinbeck was born and raised in California. His novel is based on second-hand information, distorted even more by a Hollywood cinema machine interested only in money.Viewers have come to assume, implicitly, that Steinbeck's book is factual. It is not. The story is fiction. The Joad clan is fictional. Their journey to California is fictional. The specific worker camps are fictional. The only elements of the film that are based on truth are the era setting and the struggles that most people from the Great Plains endured during the 1930s. That part is real.There was genuine hardship and suffering. But it's a mistake to assume that everyone who migrated to California during that period were as destitute as the Joads. I personally have ancestors who lived in Oklahoma in that era; some moved; some stayed in Oklahoma, but none were indigent. The Joad's decrepit car is a symbol of the film's visual misrepresentation, in addition to the fake Oklahoma landscape.The exaggerated impoverishment of script characters results from a Hollywood establishment eager to send a political message about social class inequity, a way to manipulate viewer perceptions. But the downside to that manipulation is that it has had a profoundly negative effect on Oklahoma and other Great Plains states in the subsequent sixty years. The resulting cultural bias against these dust bowl states has caused damage that far surpasses the damage done by nature and the economy. Such is the power of Hollywood and the gullibility of viewers to trust filmmakers.That said, the film's B&W cinematography is quite good. The story is rendered mournfully bleak, largely as a result of Gregg Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and dim lighting. The song ""Red River Valley"" is ideal for the locale and era. I also like the absence of actors' makeup, which adds a subtle touch of realism. Casting is acceptable and so is acting, except for the two most elderly of the Joads (Grandpa and Grandma), who overact dreadfully. Their portrayal of old people is insulting.I consider ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" a Hollywood sacred cow, critically untouchable. But Steinbeck and Hollywood combined to do far more damage to the dust bowl states than the hardships that actually occurred. The cultural residue this film has left has been most unfortunate.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Still powerful,"The Grapes of Wrath follows Drums Along the Mohawk, which in turn follows Young Mr. Lincoln. What a period for John Ford! Historical films, which tell the history of the USA, as desired by John Ford, seen and perceived by simple individuals. And all three with Henry Fonda.What marks the mind at the vision of these grapes of wrath, it is not so much the story and the subject, hard, but the plastic beauty of the film, the framings, in particular in the medium and long shots. Of course, this story of poor people who immigrate to find work and to be able to live remains a contemporary concern and subject, factually and unfortunately, eighty years later (for the film), one hundred years later for the diegetic story. Here we follow the journeys of a family of farmers who have their farm taken away from them, towards hypothetical work opportunities, and how they are exploited. John Ford focuses on the family, its individuals, and all those who modify it negatively, that is to say those who exploit them, by force, enslave them. John Ford avoids the ultra-maudlin by focusing on the character of Henry Fonda, who is in a way the point of view of the spectator who discovers, and gradually understands how people like them are exploited.The film and the screenplay constantly show the state of pariah and embarrassment that these poor people and immigrants cause: the scene of the bombs in the store, or with Ward Bond, a policeman of the same origin who also repels them.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Joads On The Road,"In which John Ford holds up John Steinbeck's black mirror to America at the end of a decade which started with the Stock Market Crash, continued with the Great Depression and ended with the nation contemplating its world position as Europe entered into war. The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.The story is naturally episodic but the simple journey that the Joad family has to undertake to the much heralded promised land of California after being evicted from their land by the bank gives the movie a natural flow, although with this tale there are many more ebbs for the family to endure.My criticism of other Ford films has sometimes been the sentimentality and forced masculine humour he frequently inserts but there's no room for either of these traits here. The nearest we get to one of his familiar tropes is the weekend dance at the ""clean"" government camp at which the Joads eventually arrive and are for the first time treated humanely by the staff, but even amongst the high spirits there's danger in the wings as the state troopers seek to gatecrash the party to make an arrest.While there are twelve in the extended family which first hits the road, there are only eight of them alive by the time they reach the relative safe haven at the end as the elderly grandfather and grandmother expire on the journey and two others drop out. The main characters though are Henry Fonda's Tom Joad, the family matriarch Ma Joad played by Joan Darwell and the idealistic lapsed preacher Cristy, played by John Carradine. They each come to very different ends but the film does at least conclude on a vaguely optimistic note with stirring speeches of defiance and even hope by Fonda and Darwell, both of which in fact were interpreted by the soon to be all-powerful House Un-American Activities Committee as evidence of a Communist propaganda subtext.Oscar-nominated Fonda is excellent as the combative, already road-hardened Tom, just released from jail for killing a man, who soon becomes the head of the family and so supersedes his father and his father in the hierarchy. Darwell won the Oscar as the Mother Earth character whose indomitable spirit drives the family on while Carradine memorably portrays a man who has lost his faith and who now channels his energies into human rebellion.Ford (and screenwriter Nunnally Johnston), even if he does bend to the box-office by editing and tweaking events in the book to afford at least a smidgeon of optimism at the end, treats the text in a starkly realistic almost quasi-documentary style as befits the seriousness of the subject matter, aided in this by the masterful black and white photography of the acclaimed Greg Toland. The sense of abject poverty is manifest in the way Ford and Toland frame their cast's often gaunt portraits against dark skies and blasted landscapes.This classic movie is a literary adaptation, history lesson and cry for social reform all rolled into one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Classic That Stands Tall Today,"The Grapes of Wrath is one of those great American classics that manages to get on most of the big lists. With that in mind, I was expecting a minor let-down because of all the great things I'd heard about it. Yesterday I had one of those rare experiences watching a film where all of my expectations were met and exceeded.I found myself mesmerized by the people in the story; I wanted them to succeed. The Grapes of Wrath is a depressing film, which I knew coming in, but I was surprised by the little instances within the film where kindness was shown. In a film peopled by crooked cops and harsh times, it was refreshing to see these acts of kindness and integrity.The lighting in the film was also superb. In the opening scene where Tom is in his old house at night it really looks like it's at night. And in another scene, where he has a candle at night, it looks real. I know The Grapes of Wrath is the text-book example of natural lighting, but there's a reason for that. :) And without spoiling anything, I love how the film ended.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It Could Make You a Socialist,"Steinbeck's classic comes to life. It's the dust bowl era and the depression. People are driven of their property by the banks. Of course, those banks got those people help getting that property and the depression was a complex collapse. Still, it's sad to see a portrayal of human misery. The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song ""If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me."" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them."" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help.",9.0,Anonymous,History
its not so bad.,One of those movies everyone says is brilliant though it seems a bit plain and dialogue heavy at first glance.With very melodramatic and stylized dialogue and performances all round this does hit home the brutal reality of people pushed to the edge by nature and pushed over the end by the desperation of people.It's easy to miss out on the nuance but it's over all a likeable enough feature that composes itself very well visually even if it is a bit over eager to shove the poverty down your throat.,6.0,Anonymous,History
"While a tad too sentimental and not always accurate historically, it's a very impressive and heart-rending film","This is an extremely sentimental and worthwhile film that fans of Hollywood's Golden Age should see at least once. While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as ""Ma"") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as ""the Preacher""). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the ""Okies"" had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement.

There are now 11. At the migrant camp the preacher is arrested and Connie leaves. There are now 9.When they find a place to work Tom is asked how many persons are with him he says 8 now. They are Pa, Ma, Rose, two children, Uncle John, Al and himself. So who is missing. It is Noah. There is no explanation of what happened to him.The last time we saw him was when he was swimming in the Colorado river on the border of Arizona and California.Even the writer, John Steinbeck, almost left him out. He was far along in the book when he was questioned about Noah. Realizing his mistake Steinbeck went back and inserted a bit about Noah wanting to stay on the Colorado river and make a living fishing.At the end of the movie Tom has to leave because the law if after him.

Still relevant to our day and age,"This is an amazingly engaging film, even though it's more than 80 years old. Real characters, a storyline that makes sense, great acting, beautiful cinematography and a nuanced view on a what was an ongoing situation at the time this film was made.Interestingly, the plight of the Joad family and the thousands of other refugees who were forced to move by eviction and poverty, struck me as still very relevant. As a European I saw clear similarities to the present day refugees coming from war-torn or desperately impoverished areas to find a better life in Europe, where they are mostly not welcome. They are often dehumanised, considered as useless riffraff and also frequently misled by stories of the mountains of gold that await them in Europe.The people in this film were victims of the 'dust bowl' which was largely caused by human mismanagement of the great plains. Another parallel to the present, with more and more people being forced to move because climate change is causing extreme weather, rising temperatures and damaged ecosystems.Seeing this story from the perspective of the downtrodden who have the choice between starvation and migration and who each have their individual, often heart-breaking, story was a sobering and moving experience.

Good Movie,"The Grapes of Wrath is a must watch film due to its parallels to The Dust Bowl and The Great Depression of the 1930's. The movie also portrays thoughtful cinematography and excellent choice of music which brings the whole movie together. A major theme in the movie is the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a series of major winds and drought during the 1930's that spread throughout the southern US which led to the death of all crops and livestock. The main characters of the movie, the Joad family loses their farm to the Dust Bowl and travel from Oklahoma to California in an attempt to rebuild their lives. They encounter many struggles along the way and have little money due to their crops being demolished from the unforgiving winds. In 1929 the worst economic downturn in US history hit, the Great Depression. It began when the stock market crashed and immediately impacted the rest of the US. During this time unemployment rose to 25% and many people lost their houses, cars, jobs, etc. This major economic downfall is portrayed so vividly in the movie when you see the characters struggle to find a job to make enough money to provide for one another. The American dream portrayed during the roaring 20's is now gone and reality has set in for the characters knowing they may not make enough money to live. As well as it's significant connections to history The Grapes of Wrath also should be recognized for its flawless cinematography and music score. Director John Ford uses storytelling through the cinematography of this movie with subtle hints shown in every shot. During the scene where the caterpillar passes over Muley's house the cinematographer slightly pans to show the shadows of the farmers going through the tractor tracks. The use of the shadows portrays an underlying theme of defeat coming from the farmers, only putting the shadows in the shot left a feeling of emptiness in the viewer, exactly what the farmers were thinking in the scene. The music in this movie compliments the theme almost perfectly, with songs such as ""She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain"", and ""Going Down The Road Feeling Bad"" Alfred Newman does an incredible job of placing the music within the movie. The entire soundtrack of the movie fits perfectly with the theme of hopelessness and traveling West which enhances the entire experience of the movie. This films tie ins with major historical events and incredible cinematography and soundtrack make it a must see for anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Modern Films Should Be This Good,"What a powerful and moving story this is!  Steinbeck's novel of the harsh conditions that were faced by the migrant farm workers during the Great Depression is brought to life in a very convincing way in this movie.   What is especially good is how the victims are portrayed as real people with real faults and passions.  Tom Joad was a convicted murderer whose past crime is trivialized because he was drunk when he killed another man in a fight.  But yet, he was basically an honest man just wanting to make his way in the world without causing trouble.  The preacher is a fallen man whose sin destroyed his faith.  In the book, Grandpa was a vile and obscene man.  The mother put up with all the faults of her family as she fought to keep them together.  They were real people who were simply caught on the wrong end of the stick.Life was very hard at that time, and unfortnately the ""have nots"" were at a serious disadvantage.   Human nature being what it is, there are people of all political stripes who will take advantage of one another in the name of economic necessity.At the same time, the movie shows the real struggle of people on both sides of the problem when faced with limited resources.  One fact of life is that those who are most educated and know how to work within the system are the ones who are best able to survive.  This movie is excellent at showing the struggle of one family who is unfortunately caught up in forces that they are unable to understand and are unable to get themselves out of.  It's more than a story of ""good poor people"" versus ""bad rich people.""  It also shows the real fears of the land owners who did what they thought they had to do to protect their rights and property from an invasion of homeless and hungry people.The person who wrote the review here saying that George Bush stole the election seemed to be writing his own ""sour grapes"" of wrath.  There was no stolen election.  His swan song about the glories of the Clinton economy ignores the fact that it was the previous administration's climate of moral decay and ""it's the economy, stupid"" policies that created the environment for all of the Enron-type corporate crimes that are just now being uncovered.   He blames the current administration for the recent recession but evidently doesn't realize that the economy had been heading for the tank during the last year of Clinton's watch; it is now coming back under Bush.I only mention these inconsistencies because it is tempting to view this film as a condemnation of conservative politics, when it is nothing of the sort.  The person writing that review is simply irresponsible to suggest that a George Bush presidency fosters the same conditions that caused all the suffering depicted in The Grapes of Wrath.   Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter:  Those who own wealth will do whatever they can to keep it, while those who don't will do what they have to do within their means to get it.  Some people are just more honest than others in how they go about it. That's the human condition, and this movie depicts it in a very powerful way.Watching the movie, you can identify with the hopelessness of the Joad's circumstances.  You can also identify with the hope that no matter how badly they get pushed around by forces they can't control, they will ultimately survive.Very highly recommended.  IMO this is Henry Fonda's best role!",,Anonymous,History

It is a slanted logic that dictated men's lives as worthless where local justice is involved....in America. Never seen a message so ridiculous in film, the opposite being the truth--abuse and lack of justice within centralized government (just read the news).The question in the beginning of ""who is to blame"" for taking the farms points to the evil bankers, the evil overlords all up the ladder of capitalism, as if the owners had no rights to their own land, and their own financial mismanagement wasn't the fault of the grassroots- decision-maker. But, never mind that: details get in the way of a good leftist message. By the end it portrays a world that will never change and the people who try will just wither and blow away for the sake of cigar smoking, besuited fellows in brand new cars with extensive peach orchards and businesses.When I moved to California in the early 90s I met a lot of the old transplants who moved to CA in that time of need. They did pretty well for themselves. Ultimately, a displacement creates need and need is sated by people creating work and making things, people finding their place in the world.

Possibly John Ford's greatest film,"When you watch the opening credits of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" you'll see a veritable parade of legendary names in multiple areas of production: Fonda, Steinbeck, Toland, Newman, Ford. Living up to a lineup like that is a tall order but this film manages it.For those unfamiliar with Steinbeck's novel, the story concerns a family of depression era farmers who are forced off their land in Oklahoma. They resolve to travel to California in order to seek work but are continually beset with hardships as their hopes are dashed time and again. The screenplay, adapted by Nunally Johnson, was rewarded with an Oscar nomination.The cast features Henry Fonda in one of his most iconic roles, that of recently paroled Tom Joad. He instills his character with a keen sense of justice, matched with the will to fight back when driven to do so. He was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to James Stewart for his performance in ""The Philadelphia Story"". I expect that was mainly due to Stewart losing out the year before for ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". Jane Darwell, on the other hand, saw her Oscar nomination turn into a win. As Ma Joad, she was an effective counterpoint to Fonda's character. A couple of other standouts in support were John Carradine as a disillusioned former preacher and John Qualen in a small role.In terms of technique, the film is practically flawless. John Ford's direction is impeccable and the Gregg Toland cinematography is excellent. Ford took home an Oscar for his work but, strangely, Toland wasn't even nominated. For that matter, Alfred Newman's stirring score wasn't nominated either (perhaps because it's mostly based on the song ""Red River Valley"").I haven't read the novel but I know that the storyline of the film deviates from the novel somewhat, particularly when it comes to the ending. Ultimately, though, the movie's grueling enough already; I can't imagine it ending as miserably as the novel supposedly does.I haven't seen Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"", either, so I can't say whether or not this movie deserved the Oscar for best picture, though it certainly would have been a worthy choice. Simply put, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an essential American film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Political social commentary of the early 20th Century,"I've heard about this movie and novel for a long time but didn't know the details. Just saw this movie on YT for free. I've seen a lot of old movies and this one certainly stands out as being unique. It's gritty and focuses on characters who belong to the lowest classes. As soon as I saw the scene with a farm run by the US Government, I knew there was a political message being made. The message was clearly that capitalistic farm owners only seek to exploit their workers, whereas the government is more like the workers' friend and ally. Was this the reality and big picture taking place in the 1930s? I don't have a clue. I suspect the real truth is far more complex. It would be interesting to see how proponents of the current Critical Race Theory would view this movie, since all the exploitation shown is due to socioeconomic class and not race. All the characters were white. It was all about white people being cruel and exploitative towards other white people. Performances were credible although at times the script and direction were too ""theatrical"", veering from stark realism to performance directed at an audience. Very bleak and somewhat depressing social commentary, but worth seeing once.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Communist propoganda,"Most movies of Ford are good, not this one.The whole theme of the movie is basically ""Rich men are bad"" , "" Rich men are exploiting poor men"" .The movie does not deal with any subject other then that.The movie is not about the hardships of a family moving to California but rather the exploiting system that they claim existed (it did not).As in most propaganda films the dialogue is somewhat shallow, focusing almost entirely on the films subject instead of a ""feel real"" dialogue. When watching this film it did not feel like any real world, but rather like I mistakenly stepped into some Communist rally : monotonous passion-lacking repetitious shallow words.This should not be a classic.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A genuine American classic,"A testament to the power of its source material and the skill of director John Ford and his able bodied cast, despite its age creeping ever closer to 100 years being in existence, black and white Great Depression set The Grapes of Wrath remains a poignant and gripping tale of one families battle to stay afloat in an unfair world, with the themes at the heart of author John Steinbeck's novel and Ford's adaptation sadly just as relevant now as they were then in a global system that doesn't make it easy for the common folk, the ""people"".Following the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they embark on an uprooting of their lives from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the green pastures of California after the Great Depression has decimated their farming lives and sent them on a desperate search for a chance at a new life, Wrath may not have an overall plot as such but Ford's understanding of the material his working with and care in ensuring that the Joad's feel like living and breathing creations gives his film a personal touch that will resonate with a varied collection of viewers.Centring its main attention towards Henry Fonda's recently freed from jail Tom, a man who returns to a whole new world to the one he left when first entering into prison, Wrath never settles too much around one sole protagonist as the Joad's and their close contacts get time in the spotlight as their cross country car trip to a fresh start involves run ins with the law, death/illness and above everything else hope, all documented by Ford (in an Oscar winner directional outing) and captured by some truly stunning cinematography from frequent Ford collaborator Gregg Toland.Importantly for the film, while it's unlikely many have ever experienced such hardship and overcoming as the unfortunate Joad's (to be absolutely clear Wrath is far from a jovial watching experience), the characters here and their motivations and drivers are all relatable and understandable and while there are times the narrative may enter into slightly soapy or over the top territory, for the most part Wrath feels true to the type of people it's documenting and has a carefully considered understanding of the human condition and the plight we are all on to make something of our lives.Throughout the film we as viewers are also gifted an array of memorable performances with Fonda as good as he ever was as the softly spoken but deep thinking Tom with the legendary Hollywood figure ably supported by the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as lovable motherly figure Ma Joad, John Carradine as ex-preacher turned wanderer Jim Casy and Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, giving Wrath an all-round winning ensemble that helped bring Steinback's classic words to life in a meaningful and memorable way.Final Say -A deservedly praised American classic that tackles themes and subjects that are still topical and relevant in today's climate, The Grapes of Wrath is quintessential cinema and one of the best cinematic examples of a classic piece of literature coming to life on the big screen.4 1/2 loafs of bread out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Grapes of Wrath,"Resveratrol for the soul. Like an evolving species, now the western hero has a family, picks fruit, drives a truck, packs no pistol, won't abide a bully but still buries his dead along the way.

Studio chief and producer Darryl Zanuck (20CF) wasted no time in buying the rights to John Steinbeck's 1939 best selling, highly acclaimed novel (Pulitzer / Nobel 62) that promoted people over gross profits, then picked Nunn Johnson (Three Faces of Eve) to convert it to film, John Ford to direct, he finishing the 4 state shoot in about the same time (one month) it took the overload of Joad to navigate the road to a pickers paradise by the Pacific.An indictment of the unregulated greed that led to the Great Depression and left un-educated, a farming population whose tilling techniques saw their top-soil turn to black tornado, Grapes was well received by viewers ($800k / 1.6M) and media critics, taking two prestigious Best Film awards (National Board, NY Film Critics) and seven Oscar nominations (Zanuck Fonda Johnson Toland Hansen Simpson), wins for its director and literal leading lady Jane Darwell (Ma) (BSA), the movie's sage and spiritual center (""We keep a' comin!'), her soup ladle and keepsake scenes some of filmdom's best.

And contrary to what at least one favored critic claimed (Ebert), it was not the onset of World War II which sold the mass of America on Grapes' themes in labor and freedom of interstate, its declaration of war nearly two years away, but rather, their satisfaction with six years under the New Deal, made clear by Franklin Roosevelt's landslide re-election to the second (Jan 37) of what would be four wins, a President who, had he sought divine authority, could've been made king (4/4).",10.0,Anonymous,History
A left wing parable directed by a right winger.,"Less than a year elapsed between the publication of John Steinbeck's novel and the premiere of John Ford's film. Even by Hollywood standards this is pretty astonishing but nothing in the finished work seems rushed.I must confess that I am not among those who worship unreservedly at the altar of this director as his films are variable and range from the sublime to the ridiculous but it has to be said that he has really nailed this one. Here the stagecoach is replaced by a junk pile truck but the same desert has to be crossed and the same hazards faced. What has been termed Ford's 'rigid purity of visual style' suits this material perfectly and it remains arguably his greatest achievement.It is one of those rare films in which everything works. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck believed in it totally whilst Nunnally Johnson has done a brilliant job on the adaptation. The film is blessed to have Gregg Toland as cinematographer and his low level lighting is wondrous to behold. It is well known that Orson Welles was a Ford devotee and could surely not believe his luck when Toland offered his services on that little number called 'Citizen Kane'. The editing by Robert L. Simpson, one of the finest and longest serving at 20th Century Fox, is exemplary.You certainly won't catch anyone 'acting' here and every performance is of the truest. Henry Fonda as Tom Joad seems born to play the part but that is probably because he succeeds in making it his own.Memories are short and it is difficult now to appreciate the impact Steinbeck's novel once had and naturally later critics in their infinite wisdom have declared it overrated and that his Nobel Prize was undeserved. They are of course fully entitled to their opinion but as long as there exist those who exploit and those who are exploited, the power of both novel and film will never be diminished.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A Memorable Film Of Its Era, 'The Grapes Of Wrath' Is A Deserving John Ford Classic.","Painting a gritty yet authentic portrait of family life ravaged by economic hardships, The Grapes of Wrath covers the strenuous ordeal faced by one family as it struggles to keep itself together when everything around them is falling apart. Steered by John Ford's assured direction & powered by a couple of stellar performances, it remains one of the most memorable works of its era.Set during the Great Depression, the story of The Grapes of Wrath follows Tom Joad who's out of prison on parole, only to find out that his family has been forced off their own land. Managing to reunite with them eventually, Tom & the Joad family set off to California in search of better work, opportunities & a hopeful future but face one misfortune after another, each testing their strength.Directed by John Ford, the film doesn't even try to sugarcoat any of its events and brings back the gruesome memory of living through the Great Depression for its viewers. There's constant friction between hope & hopelessness in the script but it is deftly written & wonderfully balances the arcs of its characters. Ford's direction also makes sure that the narrative is always on point & not tread around the edges.The production design team & location setting work in tandem to recreate the era that devastated thousands of lives while further assistance comes from its smart camera-work & patient editing to help the movie achieve its desired look n feel. But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda & Jane Darwell, especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.On an overall scale, The Grapes of Wrath is tragic, heartbreaking & harrowing but, despite its bleak appearance, it isn't entirely devoid of hope & optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a strongly-bonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed, deftly written, brilliantly performed & culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues, The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended.",,Anonymous,History
Handsome,"Adapted from the novel by John Steinbeck, John Ford reunited with the star of his last two films in The Grapes of Wrath, the tale of a family of Okies moving from their lost sharecropping home in Oklahoma to the promise of a new life in California, only to find that reality is not the promise they had expected. Sanding down much of the more pointed political points of the source material, the end result is a very handsome, well-performed, but somewhat flagging portrait of life on the bottom rung of the Great Depression.Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns home from four years in the penitentiary for killing a man who had stabbed him in a bar fight. Returning, he meets the former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who tells him that everyone is emptying the area, the sharecropping farms no longer making any profit and being gobbled up by...somebody, the company. The Joads are preparing to leave as well, Tom's family having made it over to Tom's uncle's house for the final few days. Tagging along together, they collect the last of their things, lash them to the top of an old truck, and they head out west towards the promise of work for eight hundred pickers of fruit. The most notable member of the family is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), the hearty matriarch who has to find strength to hold the unit together in the face of increasing oppression from circumstances and, later, outside forces.The odyssey to California is a hard one on the family. Grandpa Joad dies on the first night, unable to accept the loss of his home of so many decades. Grandma Joad dies the night they pass into California, providing Ma some solace in that Grandma will get buried in a place so pretty and verdant. Tom's younger sister Rose (Dorris Bowdon) is married to Connie Rivers (Eddie Quillan) who leaves the family once they reach the first camp, presumably to find work in radios like he had spoken about on the road. Most of the members of the large family are window dressing, though, the focus falling on Tom and Ma most particularly.I like the film through the odyssey to California most. It's the story of a family torn down by forces beyond their control, trying to keep it together with the promise of a new life over the horizon. I think this stuff works really well. It's when they get to California that I begin to feel a certain disconnect, like the story is finding easy villains and escapes in order to provide the cleanest possible conflict for our completely blameless and virtuous family of Okies.The first farm they get to work on is a peach farm, and the owners of the farm run it like a prison camp. People are behind fences, disallowed walking at night, and they only have use of the company store to spend their wages on, five cents for every bucket of non-bruised fruit. When Tom sneaks out and discovers Casy hidden just outside the fence with some agitators, the wayward preacher having lost his faith in God and replacing it with an amorphous faith in...the unity of man, I guess, the authorities find them. Tom kills one of the police officers after they strike and kill Casy, the scene happening in the dark to give Tom enough time to escape the setting but not before receiving a compromising cut across his face. The Joads have to flee or else Tom will be found out, and when they go they find a new camp run by the Department of Agriculture. In contrast to the hell on earth that was the place they just left, there are no gates, it's clean, everyone's happy, and they're greeted by a kindly old man Mr. Thomas (Roger Imhof) who lays out the rules of the place.All is well until the police, for reasons that are unclear, decide that they are going to take this happy little place and destroy it by staging a riot at the weekly Saturday night dance, but word gets to the inhabitants who are able to quell things before the police can arrive and get in without their warrant.It all just feels too easy. The antagonists are footmen of something larger. The nice guys are squeaky clean. It's amorphous dramatically, and I find it hard to get really involved emotionally.And yet...gosh darn it, this movie is pretty. Lensed by Gregg Toland, the man who would go on to be Orson Welles' cinematographer on Citizen Kane the next year, The Grapes of Wrath is flat out gorgeous visually. It struck me first in an early scene where Tom and Casy are asking Muley Graves (John Qualen) in the abandoned Joad house about what happened in the area. It's nighttime, and the scene is only lit by a single candle that Tom holds in front of him (knowing what little I do know about cinematography and lens aperture, I'd assume that the candle isn't the thing actually giving off the light we see but that it's enhanced by well placed and hidden electrical light sources), and it's beautiful to simply look at. There's a similar scene late in the film when Tom decides to leave to protect his family and he has to say goodbye to Ma. There are beautiful shots of the countryside with our characters right in front (they may be rear projection, but it's hard to tell because they're so well done), and the framing is always on point. Ford made a whole lot of these decisions, but it was Toland who executed them. His work made this Ford's best looking film, for sure.This is the film where Ford won his second Oscar for director (he won his first for The Informer), the film itself losing Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca, and I can see how the Academy would split the awards. Ford's direction is really great, the practiced hand of a master craftsman applying every cinematic trick to a story he could in order to elevate it, but Rebecca is simply the better overall film. Not that the Academy ever really thinks like this, but I get it nonetheless. The Grapes of Wrath is a movie about the message of justice for the migrant worker first and foremost by the end. The craftsmanship of the construction helps it tremendously, but I end up feeling preached to instead of entertained or enlightened. It doesn't help that sanding down the rough edges of the book's politics created a kind of mushy point in the film that's hard to discern on its own.It's respectable, really well-made, and pretty solid, but I end up feeling like it's kind of empty at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Propaganda,"The Grapes of Wrath sounds clearly like a propaganda film for the liberals of the 30s and 40s (Thankfully, John Ford became more of a conservative in his late days). It often tends to be ridiculous, as, for example, with the character of John Carradine and the camps of the government managed by kind people versus the bad guys of the private companies. It is definitely an overrated movie going back to the cinema's first steps.

"Just a taste of Steinbeck - flawed, but great enough","John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" undoubtedly ranks among the greatest works of American realist literature. It stands as a testament of the Great Depression era where tenant farmers of the dust bowls suffer under drought, then are brutally dispossessed and driven from their Oklahoma homes, forced to find their luck elsewhere. In the end all they have is themselves, as the trip to find the blessed land California demands a heavy toll, is accompanied by tragedies and setbacks and the outlook is bleak in the face of the greed that exploits honest workers to make a buck. John Ford tries the impossible - to go for an authentic rendition of the multilayered, detail packed, all around magnificently written Steinbeck material, and definitely succeeds in delivering an indispensable heart-wrenching film portraying the never ending struggle of the Joads. Any direct comparison between book and film however is moot, enjoy both for what they are. On board in this road movie of the existential kind are Henry Fonda as an ex-convict, John Carradine as a disillusioned preacher and the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, all first-rate acting with strong support of an array of bit players who help the crude reality take shape. Highly recommendable! There are downsides, though. For one the two hours of screen time can barely correspond to the epic proportions of the novel. However, the entry is still much more complete than Kazan's adaption of Steinbeck's other epic drama ""East of Eden"", starring Jimmy Dean, which only shows a fraction of the story. The one real liability however is the diluted ending which was tucked on as a concession to the mass audience while Steinbeck's epic hits you with full force. Well, if you want the real thing, read the book. With the film you get a pretty good taste of it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

One Powerful Film,"When I first saw this in the 1970's I was an impressionable teenager and it affected my social thinking greatly. The performances stayed with me for years, and the power of the film too. I read the book and it showed how great a film they had made from a long, wordy, social tale. Recently re-watching the movie, it looked fresh and just as powerful as when I first saw it. Henry Fonda, John Carradine and especially Jane Darwell, give career heights performances and they add truthful weight to the characters. The story challenges the way we treat migrants and how we force them to be what we think they might be, in England we have a lot of this in recent times. All the character parts are effective, for example the caretaker of the government camp, who at last shows some understanding of the migrants problems and quietly helps them settle in. Unfortunately he is virtually the only kind soul the Joads meet on their journey. It is a solid drama, never adding any comedy or music to heighten the action, sticking truthfully to its source. I am sure Steinbeck was proud of this version.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Timeless,Although I normally hate black and white films. This had its educational purposes and highlighted many of the problems we face today. I would love to see this film remade with a present day twist and maybe some color. The actors sold the script and the filming added the drama to the film While everybody learned about the Great Depression and even California Migration resulting in the dust bowl in the Midwest. This movie teaches you what every day life was like for migrant workers. The abuses that ordinary citizens faced everyday just trying to provide food and shelter for their families. Big businesses were profiting millions of dollars while paying workers measly wages and providing no benefits or safety. The film does carry a political tone against big business and anti-regulators.,7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the greatest films ever made,"John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" stands tall in the history of cinema. Many critics would say it is the greatest Hollywood film ever made, even better than Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane."" Whatever stance the viewer takes, it is a must-see movie. A few scenes in this masterpiece were actually shot on location around Sallisaw, Oklahoma. Though many from Oklahoma were offended by parts of the book and film, especially calling the Joads ""Okies,"" others realized what Ford and the author of the book, John Steinbeck, were presenting. The Joads are depicted as honest, hardworking salt of the earth Americans knocked down by Old Man Depression and the Dust Bowl, not as ignorant hillbillies as some believe. The so-called respectable agricultural conglomerate heads and big businessmen are the ones shown as malevolent heartless persons, with the law, especially hand-picked deputy sheriffs, being represented as brutes and murderers. Sallisaw today honors the movie and the book by having a Grapes of Wrath Festival each year.Henry Fonda in a role of a lifetime--and he knew it--turns in his best performance. In one of the great film portrayals of all time, Tom Joad, Fonda is able to capture the essence of this set upon human being who is trying to survive in a world he never made. Pulled apart by society's pliers, Tom speaks for the common people with heart and soul. The viewer knows that this young man with somewhat of a chip on his shoulder who is easy to rile, often responding by violence, is destined to return to the prison from which he was paroled, McAlester, or one just like it. He is admired because he will never surrender, never back down, fighting to end injustice and exploitation of the working man. Amazingly Fonda did not become type cast as a result of playing Tom Joad and went on to play many diversified roles and start a cinema dynasty with controversial Jane Fonda almost equaling her father in acting ability.Though Tom is the main character in both the book and the film, he is not the hero. That title belongs to the indomitable Ma Joad, who is determined to keep her family together come Hell or high water. She too won't back down but she is also filled with Christian love and charity for all God's creatures, even the despicable and cruel. Jane Darwell deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actress for her brilliant performance as Ma. Her final dialog in the battered old truck heading for Fresno says it all. The rest of the cast, consisting of John Ford's regular troupe of actors such as Ward Bond, is fine tuned to the nth degree. John Carradine's key role as Preacher Casy is exceptional as is John Qualen's graveyard ghost Muley Graves.Director John Ford, who also copped an Oscar, with his cinematographer Gregg Toland captures on film the face of hunger by visualizing what it is like to be dispossessed of one's heritage. The most telling image is that of the Joads standing up to unbridled greed when the cats are pushing over their homes. The camera pans away from their defiant figures, a dusty wind whistling through their hair, to focus on their shadows. The wind-blown shadows are all that is left of their previous lives. Their homes gone. Their families torn apart and scattered. All their worldly possessions abandoned. Now they must look westward to California for what they pray is a new beginning.Modern viewers find it difficult to understand how ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was considered so controversial that John Ford and his crew had to shoot it in a surreptitious manner. John Steinbeck's socialistic message was watered down somewhat for the movie, but it does peek through every now and then. Tom wants to know, ""Who are these Reds?"" In those days being associated in any way with the labor movement could get you branded a Communist, even if you did not know what a Communist was. The ending was also changed to make it more upbeat and optimistic.The music is sufficient to convey the feelings and emotions of the Oklahoma refugees, especially the main theme ""Red River Valley."" One of the high points in the film is when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) sings the song to his mother when all are finally having fun once more at the big dance in a New Deal migrant workers camp. Yet had John Ford the foresight to utilize the talents of Oklahoma native Woody Guthrie for the songs the musical score would have been a masterpiece. Woody did write his own score inspired by watching the film. His ""Dust Bowl Ballads"" are among the artistic triumphs of the 20th century.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Human beings wouldn't stand to live that way.,"Forget the politics behind the stories of Steinbeck or the politics of films of Ford. What truly lies at the center of this classic American film is not a socialistic message but rather a universal message; one that says that all people suffer in one way or another and it is the defiance and resistance that separates us from anyone else and our ability to choose not to take this lying down.The story is well-known: the Joad family is forced off their Oklahoma farm along with thousands of other Dust Bowl victims and decide to move to California in search of jobs and wages. Along the way they encounter kindness, hatred, peace and anger. There are times when the tribulations they face in California are more difficult than trying to survive in the Midwest, but push on they do led by the recently-paroled Tom, played quietly and most effectively by the great Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for her role as the mother who also does her best to try and keep the fit together despite serious situations that could force them apart. Every other role is well-cast and adds a rich realistic tone to this movie that only makes you feel even more for these people who are just trying to get by each day, hoping for some sort of break or providence as a sign.I can see how this was such a politically-charged story but I don't think Ford intended that to be the priority of the film. Rather, I think it can all be summed up in the words of the two gas attendants early in the film. One says he thinks Okies have no feelings because no human would live like they do. Really, he was complimenting them as they believed the same way and this whole movie is about them attempting to rise above that which they were previously part of and become part of something better or at least more substantial. All this because they're the people.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Eventually, Tom and his family must escape... which is as suspenseful as things get... And soon enough the Joads find utopia!Once the ""Okie"" clan acquires solace in a village run by the Department of Agriculture (i.e. The Government), where each member pulls his own weight (although there's not much work to be done other than chores within the camp), the political agenda is blatantly unveiled, only this movie, made in 1940, was one of the first of its kind and credit must be given for that alone...But alas, with Henry Fonda's stark realism and Carradine's offbeat charm aside, the performances seem right out of a stage play (especially the overrated Oscar winning role) while the unceasing, melodramatic tragedy is so deliberately overboard, it's difficult to find any real story there at all.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The director John Ford is one of the greatest of that time and still belongs to the greatest now. His direction is great.

An American Epic,"This movie is a masterpiece of a period in American history that people often try to forget but deserves to be remembered.The movie if it had been made today probably would have been a tale that ends happy with sunshine on their faces and hope in their hearts, but that would be a terrible disservice to the Steinbeck work and to the actual people who suffered through the terrible conditions depicted in the movie.This movie has very powerful themes and a compelling story that force the viewer to suffer with the Joad family. When they are hungry, so are you. When they cry, you weep with them. It is hard not to feel like one of the Joads through their trials.For those who enjoyed Henry Fonda in this movie would probably also enjoy his performance in ""Twelve Angry Men,"" which is a great film in and of itself.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Many people believe that this book is discussed by many people continuing to this day. Well they are wrong this book is full of stereotypes that make me sick. John Steinbeck had no idea what he was writing about. The director of this movie picked a horrible source material for making a movie about.

Silver Witness,"I am deeply thankful that Gregg Toland walked the planet and found himself to me in multiple projects. Its somewhat easy to pocket his presence when in the company of a great director. Its why you need to see something like this where his influence is so obvious it is hard to ignore.Ford isn't a BAD director, so much. He's actually something of a genius in taking life and simplifying it into one or two tosses of simple objects, then framing those simplifications in an effective way. His films work, pure and simple. But that's what they are, pure without challenging ambiguities. And simple in the sense that so-called conservatives politicians mime.Once you escape the pull of those simplified values you see that his films are a huge waste, fake values manufactured only to support a story strategy; values that have since taken on their own selfish lives.And here. The story is vapid. The acting trite (excluding Carradine) and offensively staged. Its actually demeaning as if these people suffered not in vain because they can ""teach"" us something. Suffering is suffering, not lessons.But you won't see the frustrating reduced, artificial here, even with all the obsolete stagecraft. Its because Toland has rendered this so with such remarkable richness that the art of photography overcomes the thing. He captures nuance that Ford cannot see. His documentation surpasses the fact that it is film extras and constructed sets in front of the lens; the lens sees beyond that and gives us genuine pathos, disconnect. Its never in the parts manipulated by Ford in the foreground, but the background elements, the world in which our little play is staged.There's something about the quality of the film that I think we will never see again. Even the Coens, when trying to reproduce the textures in ""Man Who Wasn't There"" Had to shoot it in color and print it in black and white. In a few years, it will all be digital. It may even look like this sometimes.But what was happening then, in Kane, here, was that there were chemical memories being formed in catalyzed emulsions in a device, while a master of that device had similar chemical processes working in his brain, and he was able to coordinate the two. Cognition controlled and preserved past death in smoky traces of silver.Bless you Gregg.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent view of hard times; book/movie very influential in effects,"The ""Grapes of Wrath"" film is a somewhat simplified version of Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning book about an Oklahoma tenant farmer family in the Dust Bowl days. After being evicted from the land they'd farmed for generations, they join many other Okie families migrating to California seeking opportunities to work. In California the Okies were often taken advantage of by affluent land owners who promised fair wages but then paid half what they promised. Those migrants who resisted exploitation were sometimes viewed (and treated) as ""reds""; local police (or private security agents) were too often used to intimidate or quell resistance.Steinbeck's criticism of such exploitation of workers led to banning the book in some places although it became quite popular through most of the US and led to reforms. Henry Fonda's role as Tom Joad earned his stardom; Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as did John Ford for directing.Steinbeck was very critical of an economic system that allowed such mistreatment of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by wealthy land owners, bankers, etc., (supported by local officials wherever the owners/bankers resided). But while the movie piles worst case on worst case, IMO it's a fair view of how bad things sometimes got in the Great Depression era (1929-40).I spent 2 summers (1949, 1950) in the Bootheel of Missouri working in communities of former sharecroppers who'd been evicted from their jobs and their shack homes in circumstances parallel to that of the Okie families. These evictions happened when the owners of the cotton plantations, after receiving federal agricultural subsidies for NOT growing cotton, decided to keep all the money for themselves by evicting their farm families (January, 1939), making thousands homeless.The tenant farmer/sharecropper system was based on the land owners providing substandard housing to farm families plus advancing them credit (in their company stores) for food, clothing, and seed. In return the farm families planted, tilled, and picked the cotton. But their share of return from the cotton harvest was never sufficient to get out of debt to the store. The system made the farm families, in essence, indentured servants. Until they were kicked out.While the motivations (land owners' greed, farm families' struggles to survive in extreme circumstances) and conflicts were very similar to what the Okies experienced, the resolution of this Bootheel crisis became far more uplifting and inspiring than the struggles without victors presented in the ""Grapes of Wrath."" But almost certainly, the popularity of this book and movie helped lead to such a different outcome in the Bootheel only a few years later.This video describes the Bootheel situation: http://www1.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=148227By Googling ""Sharecroppers Strike"" and ""Cotton Patch Moses"" you'll find a number of links that describe this Bootheel crisis, its conflicts, significant people, and outcomes.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A Family Faces the Wrath of the Depression,"I never read the John Steinbeck book, ""Grapes of Wrath,"" but after watching this movie I'm realizing I should have.GoW is about the dust bowl of the 1930's that drove many people from their lands. One of the hardest hit areas was Oklahoma. Many Oklahomans went west to California in search of work after being driven from their lands. The movie picks up with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) coming home from prison to find that his family is gone. He was told a story by Muley (John Qualen) how all families were being forced off of their property by the banks. It was a depressing scene to see playout as Muley impotently stood by while a worker bulldozed his home for a $3 payday.Tom Joad caught up with his family before they got a chance to leave and the lot of them headed west to California after seeing a handbill requesting 800 pickers for a farm. When they reached California it was anything but a warm welcome. They faced one adversity after another with the police being the source of many of their woes.It was quite interesting to see the police being depicted the way they were. They were tools of the wealthy as opposed to being employees of the state paid to protect and serve. You couldn't help but feel for the Joad family. They only wanted to work for a living wage and be left alone. This movie showed a cross section of the worst of capitalism with the worst of government officials coming down on the most vulnerable of people.",9.0,Anonymous,History

More like a documentary,"I haven't read the novel so can't compare to it; but I am sure from what I have heard that it is like one of the greatest novels of 19th century, the movie probably falls short of the novel. Expressing emotion in a restrained fashion, without using overtly emotional words or body language is something I have now come to associate with the B/W Hollywood cinema. But even accounting for that, the emotive quotient of the movie could have been a tad higher. The Joad family cuts across the width of America from Oklahoma to California in a dumpster truck, lock stock and barrel. Poor grandpa doesn't want to leave the earth he grew up in and the earth grants him the wish, albeit in a tragic way as he dies en-route. Grandma follows suit, though much closer to California. Her burial scene is unceremoniously skipped and I found her body getting carried along with live people for so long a little macabre honestly. The kids seem to have no context of the whole situation which is again a bit weird given that the girl is pretty grown up. They are just happy-go-lucky all the time not missing a single thing and not regretting any piece of the journey. Uncle John also doesn't show any character, nor does the pregnant women. In fact, I believe the chief character of the movie is the mother, but she symbolizes the all-too-familiar middle class matriarch much more than a woman from the time and space she is required to represent in the movie. The situations themselves are assumed to be already known to the audience with the screenplay not bothering too much with explaining the details of what is going on. So my verdict - one time watch. Also I am going to read the novel now and I am sure after that I am going to understand the movie more and like it even less.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Not a film but an Inspiration to beat out tough time, because ""We are The People"".","Watched ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" (1940)Short Review :-Not a film but an Inspiration to beat out tough time, because ""We are The People"". John Ford is the man who does it and who else it could have been. He brought possibly the most inspirational film for people in the beginning of 40s decade. Next year he also brought another people's film 'How Green Was My Valley"" and these 2 films changed some people's lives forever. When you make a film from experiences of people gone through tough times it becomes mandatory to end the film on high note and if it's inspirational then there's no stopping. The Grapes of Wrath is just not a film, it is something more than that. I can imagine how people would have reacted to the film in 1940 if i am reacting so enthusiastically in 2020. A story of poor family who have been thrown out of thier own land and how they battle out all the difficulties will surely leave you with an heart wrenching experience. In a feature film aspects, The Grapes of Wrath is work of a genius, truly. There are some brilliant scenes in the film that will force to you take a note that this kind of genius filmmaking was done in 1940 and anyhow you have to believe it. Acting of the long studded cast is fantastic but Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are too good. The writing seems fantastic even after excluding few scenes from the novel. Dear John Ford why you so awesome? How did you manage to pull out an inspiring tale in early 40s like never before? That last speech of Tom Joad while leaving the family and Ma Joad's Inspirational words in the last scene will always stay with me. ""I'll be around the dark, I'll be everywhere"" and ""We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out"".

i can't believe this was a film!,"This was the worst film I have ever seen that was taken from a book. It completely screwed up the story and didn't even finish with the book. John Steinbeck is an excellent writer and should have sued for making such an awful movie after his book. What were the movie makers of the time thinking when they thought they could turn this into a film. Considering that the story was a little too racy for films at that time especially the ending. Having to read this for an english class I bet people just watched the movie and were too lazy to read the book. Hollywood can never portray a story from a book.

"We suffer, we rise","Great drought has brought endless dust storms into the state of Oklahoma. Many families have been driven from their homes by banks looking to reap profit despite the miserable conditions. As such the Joad family packs itself onto an aging truck and sets out towards California in hopes of finding a Golden Land. Based on a novel by the same by John Steinbeck, although I've been led to understand that the book is a lot more depressing and politically minded than this film. And if that's the case, what a depressing book it must be. Because the film isn't exactly a ray of sunshine either.And yet it is a triumph, in a sense. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell play the leads as Tom Joad and his mother, and in them crystallize the themes of the film. All good things will end, nothing lasts forever and when hard times come, it's up to us to pick ourselves up and journey through them. Individual humans may falter, may fall, may perish, but humans as people have always survived. The film has some truly great monologues and speeches about this, and as an overall film it's all about that willingness to rise up, to bear the load, to survive. The Joads travel from one tragedy to another, and it is truly heartbreaking, but yet they endure. And that's what matters.The film also questions the basic necessities of life. When it matters, what do we need? We all need to eat, we all need to sleep. And if those basic needs are fulfilled, what then? It's natural for us to look after ourselves, including our families, perhaps our closest friends, but it takes something extra to care for anyone else. And yet, that extra caring has a meaning. Is that meaning needed, warranted or even essential? That's the question.The Grapes of Wrath shines as a rare gem. A film brilliantly acted, brilliantly told, with brilliant themes.

The Great Depression's desolation is effectively re-created,"Besides entertaining, the motion picture can educate, inspire, or raise awareness about important issues occurring or having occurred in the world. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a film about the Great Depression. We don't learn much about it from the film, but the film's quality does something just as good, it raises the viewer's curiosity about it, and he is inspired to look it up. What caused it? How widespread was it? Did anyone actually starve to death because of it? If so, how many? How did it end, i.e. what was the solution to conjure up its demise?Many films have been made about the Great Depression. This is one of the best. It is based on the novel by John Steinbeck (who also wrote ""Of Mice and Men"" and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was nominated for the Best Picture of 1940 by the American Motion Picture Academy (Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" won).Henry Fonda gives the performance of a lifetime as a young man who has returned from jail to discover that his family's spirit has been crushed from their loss of land and home. They come across a flyer advertising 800 agricultural jobs in California and decide to head out west. Unfortunately, thousands of people responded in the same way to the add. Rather than hire only the manpower needed, the abusive employers hired all they could but cut their wages lower than what was required for survival.The Great Depression's desolation both in the environment and in the spirit of the people is effectively re-created.

Review for History of Cinema,"I have been watching many old black and white movies for my history of cinema class and have enjoyed them all. So i did also enjoy ""The Grapes of Wrath"" but i was much less intrigued. I liked the story and the plot and do think all other aspects of the film were good. It was a bit dull at times and seemed to drag on in places.i did completely feel for the Joad family throughout the movie and was always rooting for them to find some sort of employment. I understand that the film is meant to show the struggles of families in the midwest during the depression and it certainly did a good job getting that point across.I perked up at the very end when Tom told his mother that he was going to try and do something about the land and attempt to gather protester's, which would have given the movie a bit more action or just a specific direction. But that is probably because I am so accustomed to modern day movies jam packed with non stop action.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Surpringly powerful for a film of its age,"Somehow I had never seen this film until recently, despite being 50 years of age. However I happened to catch this film one afternoon on tv and seeing as I had never read the book I decided to give it a watch.Most 'social issue' films of the past lose their edge over time, but this is one of those rare films that packs a punch. It boldly addresses poverty, crime, injustice, alcoholism, exploitation of the common man, corporate greed, the good and bad side of workers unions and so much more. No wonder this film was so divisive and controversial. Powerful performances all round the lack of a happy ending. The journey of the Joad family from the poverty of the mid-west to being sold the dream in California only to be exploited is a tough story to absorb but this film does it.It also doesn't shy away from subjects such as death, Police brutality and mistreatment of the poor by the wealthy. If anything this film bursts the balloon of the American dream. Henry Fonda is totally relatable as Tom Joad, the everyman from a simple sharecropping family who lives through and witnesses all this. No angel himself, he refuses to give up trying despite obstacle after obstacle. He meets good people and bad along the way. He sees his childhood friend turn to drink, he sees people in his family die and has to bury them because he cannot afford a funeral, he sees an innocent woman die from the bullet of an incompetent Policeman aiming at someone else. Yet he also meets a straight up government landowner who offers him and his family a fair deal, a policemen from the same county as him offering him sound advice and charity from a cafe owner who sympathises with his plight. The film is unsurprisingly short on laughs but there is some dark humour. The film also boasts some admittedly dated but still strong acting.It's easy to see how this film might be viewed as 'Un-American' as it tells of a life without wealth or comfort. Whilst films like 'The Wizard of Oz' showed a humble existence on a farm, the folk were still happy and content. None of that is in evidence here, just a harsh life firstly a s poor farmers and then on the road as itinerant workers. The film also goes some way to justifying why unionisation occurs and the underhand practices being used to stop it by those who see it as a hindrance to their business practice.Don't let the fact this film was made in black and white put you off. This is a powerful story well told by John Ford. It was also quite brave of Twentieth Century Fox to let him make it, knowing it was bound to be controversial (and apparently the script toned down some parts of the book to appease the censors). Definitely worth watching in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,History
For a Variety of Viewers,"This film surely deserved being nominated in the Academy Awards. Steinbeck's message was butchered and the story of the Okies disgraced. These two viewpoints are both fairly accurate in their own respect. Indeed this is very entertaining and captivates its audience, but it also twists the story Steinbeck conveys in his book. Before considering whether or not to view this movie, you first need to know if it is the right match for yourself.Entertainment: If you are searching for the perfect movie to sit back on a Friday night, maybe reminisce in the past, eat some popcorn, enjoy a classic movie, then you should continue reading under heading. This film did deserve being nominated for best film in the Academy Awards. Excellent cinematography and great actors like Henry Fonda and John Carradine set this movie apart and make the audience really feel for the Joads. After losing their family farm, the Joads set out as migrant workers on their way to California. They overcome adversity as the try to get settled and find work, despite the attitudes of the land owners. This is a story of overcoming odds and no matter what happens, staying together as a community, as the people.Compare and Contrast: If you're looking to see how this movie compares to this book and are hoping that it will accurately depict Steinbeck's novel, then turn around. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it does tell the story of the Joads and shows the problem they are facing, but the way in which the Joads combat this diversity is different between the two works. The beauty of the inner chapters isn't expressed to its full potential in the movie. It's not expected that this can be done, but the effects of the inner chapters is part of what made the novel what it was. In the book, the inner chapters tied the Joads to the entire community and helped set up some context. The movie tells some of the stories of those in the inner chapters, but doesn't give the sense of community that the book has. Along with the lack of sense of community the relationship of the family is not the same between the two entities. In the book the two kinds of families, the Joads and John Davis', are compared. The difference between the two are having the family break up, but have community replace it, or have a family that stays together, but their connection to the community is destroyed. The movie seems to take the stance of Joe Davis' family because the focus is put on the family and the aspects of the family falling apart like Noah's Departure and the Joads connection to their community is downsized. The Joads never meet the Wilsons and the boxcar seen is completely taken out. Also the family farm isn't really shown in detail and there isn't a sense of connection to the agriculture because not a single peach or piece of cotton is shown. This brings me to my next point.Students: If you need to read this book over the summer before going back to school, watch this movie. It seems like a spark note of the book as it summarizes the travels of the family and their hardships. However, if you need to discuss the themes of this book, you might not get a very good grade. The problems of the Joads remain intact, but the solutions of their problems are different. Emphasis is put on the people instead of sacrifice to move forward.This is truly a good movie, but if you are hoping it will reflect the book, you might not enjoy it as much. Personally having read the book myself, I did enjoy this movie and respected it for what it did achieve for its time; however you can't view this thinking that it will be like watching Steinbeck tell his story.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Sad, indelible, relevant and moving...","This film of John Steinbeck's classic novel falls into the rare category of: must be watched by everyone. Everyone will come away with the stark impression of the Great Depression in America, the tragic lives led by families of this era, and the tenant farmer/slave wage and plantation mentality which still thrives (in more covert form) in the U.S today.Henry Fonda as Tom Joad returns to his family in Oklahoma to learn that they are being thrown off their land by a corporation; no work existed in the area, and flyer's proclaiming livable wages for peach pickers in California ostensibly represent a future for the Joad family. They pack up Mother (Jane Darwell, wonderful performance), grandma, grandpa and assorted children including Rose of Sharon who becomes pregnant en route to California.The vehicle they drive thousands of miles is a dilapidated jalopy, and they live a hardscrabble life, stopping at a gas station and barely able to afford a day old loaf of bread. The scene where grandpa buys the two children peppermint candy is particularly sad, the waitress charges him less as she realizes the family is dirt poor. Another telling scene is when Tom (Fonda) stops at a gas station and two arrogant gas station attendants survey his situation, saying. ..."" those Okies just aren't human, living like they do""... the rejection of middle class America of these peoples plight is rancid and prevalent.It still exists today.Eventually the Joads get to a labor camp where they are treated like criminals and live in sub-human conditions. The DP captures the stark images of starving sad children begging mother (Darwell) for food, any food. They are all starving.Eventually the Joads drive on to find another camp, run by the department of agriculture, which at least provides clean water, bathrooms and food. Grandma dies when they finally reach California soil, the promised land.Henry Fonda is frankly flawless in this performance, depicting a young man attempting to make a life, but having no resources, no societal support.A truly perfect film, worth several viewings as you realize there are still impoverished people in America living this way, whether in the foothills of Appalachia, or the sugar cane fields of South Florida. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Average family during the Great Depression endures many hardships,"So much for a story about fruit, The Grapes of Wrath is way much more than that! This film may start off quiet and dull, but it leads to a much more action-packed plot! Although different from the original book, the film still does include the major points and the overall themes of the story. The Grapes of Wrath is a story about a poverty stricken family, the Joads, who migrate from their home in Oklahoma to California in search of work and a better life. The main antagonist is poverty which is enhanced in the black and white color settings of the movie. Because it is in only black or white, it is clearly felt and shown the desperation and lack of hope the Joads have. On the entire journey towards California, the family endures every possible trial they could have faced. They lose family members to death and abandonment, suffer from ""persecution"", poverty and hunger, and have a constant breakdown from their run-down truck. However, their determination, along with Ma Joad's eventual leadership, demonstrates one of the major lessons that strength can be found in numbers and with each other. Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad, the protagonist-a man recently released from prison, portrays Tom the way that Tom is supposed to be received. He acts as a caring, yet strong-willed and sometimes reckless youth- which is then shown in Fonda's vibrant facial expressions and motions. All of the actors portray their roles with an enthusiasm that is then proved in the accurate representation of the characters. Although many times, there is a small form of hope throughout the book, viewers never expect that The Grapes of Wrath will have a happy ending. The film did not include the intercalary chapters from the book but enough foreshadowing is presented allowing us to know that it is a moral story with no satisfying end. Overall, this film is mind captivating forcing readers to think about life in many aspects, and reconsider decisions made. It teaches important values and how to have faith in times of hardships.",7.0,Anonymous,History
What happens when people trifle with nature.,"A revisiting of this movie merely confirms what is already established as fact: that this movie is great. It's grim story about people struggling to survive. That these conditions existed in the United States is a disgrace. To be thrown off the land is bad enough, but then to be humiliated compounds the injustice. The story is told in the form of semi-documentary which gives it further authenticity. The movie is about land. People own it, farm it, exploit it, divide it, fight for it, defend it, plow it, drive over it, drive through it. The people are transiting; the land stays. Tom Joad enters and Tom Joad exits; he is a metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. The only thing stable is the land. Ma Joad is trying to keep the family together but it's a losing battle. Only the will to survive gets them through. This movie is an incredibly powerful story, strongly acted, and told with candor.The Grapes of Wrath is director John Ford's homage to nature and a warning to all - that nature, in the form of rough terrain, inclement weather and immense distances, can be lethal to humans. In this movie the land is more than just mere scenery, more than just a back drop for a story, more than just a passing reference, it is an integral player, indeed it is the story itself. Briefly, the movie is about a family, the Joads of Oklahoma, who, after being evicted from their farm during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, become homeless and, in quest of work and a more secure place to live, embark on a long journey through prairie and desert to California. For them, California is the proverbial land of milk and honey and holds for them a promise of a new and better life, much like the ancient Hebrews may have felt when they left Egypt in quest for their promised land. As the Joads travel west in the their broken-down jalopy they are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the landscape. The movie features several panoramic vistas of the rugged western landscape, prairie and desert, geographical barriers that the Joads must surmount to reach their goal and places where they can die. For the land is not friendly and benign; instead it is a source of contention and a cause for grief, such as that visited upon the Joads as they lose their homes and possessions and are forced to migrate in order to survive. The Joads' vulnerability is further reinforced by the distances they must travel and the stress caused by the move itself. Two members of the family die while on the road and another disappears; nothing is close by. Driving many miles means having to deal with the possibility of their truck breaking down en route and becoming stuck in the middle of nowhere. And like the land itself, the people encountered by the Joads on their journey are surly and begrudging at best. The message is unmistakable. Nature can crush us at any time and must be respected for what it is, an all-encompassing, awesome, stark entity that is both life giving and deadly, especially when ignored, as the Joads learned as the ""wind"" destroyed their lives, perhaps as a pay back for the way the land was abused. And when the Joads finally arrive in California, reality quickly sets in and with it comes more trouble and disappointment, all of this having to do with the land, which again poses a threat to the Joads' survival. The story ends with Tom Joad, who is in trouble with the law, shown trekking across the land and the rest of family again on the move as they continue to seek work. The foreboding mood that permeates this movie is further enhanced by the black-and-white photography that further brings out the stark emptiness and vastness of the land. This movie is a dramatic statement that warns the audience that human kind must be cognizant of the whims of nature for nature is something that cannot be ignored or trifled with. In the 1930s people did not treat the land with respect and the land responded in kind. That the Joads got caught up with that is the stuff for a dramatic story but nature itself is beyond our ability to control as so aptly shown in this movie. We build dams and they inevitably fail. We build dikes to keep out the ocean yet we still have floods. We build huge ships that sink. We build airplanes and rockets that crash. We build mighty bridges and buildings and they collapse. And in Grapes of Wrath, we farm the land and the soil turns into dust. And THAT is the story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie,"I have nothing but praise for this film. It is near perfection. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing acting. Powerful story about survival. Henry Fonda delivers what might be his best performance as Tom Joad a man struggling to get by but who eventually realizes that he is meant for greater things and that there's more to life than just helping yourself. The film is masterfully directed by John Ford and beautifully shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland. The outdoor shots are grand and bleak at the same time, bringing about a feeling of the insignificance of man compared to nature and the grand scheme of things. The lighting will go from very dark and depressing showing the characters in deep moments of suffering only for it to be broken by brightly lit moments where all seems well in the world. See this movie, that is all i have to say. Words almost fail to describe just how great this movie is",,Anonymous,History

Greatly depressive,"This movie is a beautiful adaptation of one of the most important stories of our lifetime. The first time I watched this movie was when I was 6. Of course none of it made sense then but understanding the actual story now just makes my heart break. You couldn't even trust your own family because everyone was just trying to survive. I grew super fond of mama and her character that absolutely warmed my heart. Through losing her parents, house, and livelihood, she still managed to make everyone smile and keep morale up. I adore her and this film makes me appreciate my mama and what I have. Very important movie and an incredible watch.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Dated now, but an important novel in it's time.","The Joad clan, introduced to the world in John Steinbeck's iconic novel, is looking for a better life in California. After their drought-ridden farm is seized by the bank, the family -- led by just-paroled son Tom (Henry Fonda) -- loads up a truck and heads West. On the road, beset by hardships, the Joads meet dozens of other families making the same trek and holding onto the same dream. Once in California, however, the Joads soon realize that the promised land isn't quite what they hoped.I recall reading this book many years ago, before I could properly understand the issues it raised. It was then, just a story about some poor people trying to find work, and some nasty people trying to hurt them. I enjoyed it as a story, but had no real clue about it's implications. Since then I've read a few of his books, and seen 2 films and his themes are repeated in most: that of poor people striving to survive in a world run by rich men. There are very many authors who have written about this subject, many films made to portray it, and all stick to the same theme: that of poor working class who are ruled by a handful of elite, who use the middle class to control everyone. The middle class are happy to be enablers for the rich, as they gain a better standard of living.The theme is as old as humans themselves and will likely never change. Tom Joad is on the cusp of understanding how society works, and of course is unhappy that the 'real people' as his mother said, were the ones that kept going and kept surviving and kept the world turning. The rich just lived off everyone else. Robert Tressell wrote about this exact subject in his The Ragged Trousered Philanthropist 25 years before Grapes of Wrath, and Tressell's book may well have influenced Steinbeck. Sadly the film has aged and despite there being some great performances, I think the book remains a better story than the film.So from 1914's Ragged trousered Philanthropists, to 1939's Grapes of Wrath, fast forward to 2020's Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart. It mirrors Grapes of Wrath in some ways because Shuggie has a close relationship with his Mother as Tom does, and wants to help her see a better life, as Tom does. The point is the same themes echo down history and although we love reading about the great usury of the working class by the business owners and bankers, we make feeble attempts at change, spending more time trying to better ourselves than trying to change an imbalanced system. All 3 books I mentioned follow the same theme. As calls to action they fail. As a portrayal of human social history they hold a mirror to the character of humans and the repetition of both usury and grinding poverty. For those who awaken to the politics of society, it does nothing but open eyes, as nothing ever changes.Anyway, it was a good film to watch although as I said dated now, and with great actors who are pretty much forgotten now. I still give it a solid 6 for the story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great black and white movie,"I would rate this movie an eight out of ten. I really enjoyed it because of how much comedy there was even though it was a movie about the Great Depression. I loved how the car was falling apart every five seconds, how the grandfather was going insane, and how they reacted to different situations. It was hilarious when the grandmother died in the car and how the people only found out when they pointed a bright flashlight directly at her face. It was also funny in the beginning of the movie when they were hiding in the bushes, probably only fifteen feet from the police and the police couldn't find them. The police didn't even take their job seriously, they only threw a rock at the window and asked if there was anyone there and just left. I also really liked how the movie was set in the time period they were in, so we were able to see what the people looked like back then. They most likely did not have any errors in how it was like during that time, so I enjoyed seeing how raw it was. The actors and actresses most likely went through something like that as well, not their farms getting taken away, but the sadness of the Great Depression. This probably helped them act better in the movie because they understood the travesty of it. Most movies that are based off of a certain time period are usually bad because the people who made the movie have not gone through it. The information that they also put in the movie is mostly wrong and they have an inaccurate depiction of what happened. I also liked that they showed how horrible it was when the government forced all the farmers to move out of their farms to go to California. You could see how much grief they went through having known that what their family and ancestors had built up, would get torn apart so easily. Without getting any proper human treatment the government only gave them a day to get packed up and move out of their homes. If someone told me to move out of my home randomly one day and I only had so much time to do it I would be upset too. It is a home that you have spent years of your life or your whole life knowing. Then it gets thrown away practically because you get no profit from moving but a restless lifestyle. Especially if it is a home that has sentimental value and you don't want to get rid of it, plus some people even tried to stand up for themselves. This still didn't work out because everyone was out for themselves and their own benefit. The tractor people did not care if a house was being torn away, they only cared about their own families. I also liked how they showed the family was so untrustworthy when they finally got to the camp. I liked how their characters evolved from being gullible into believing what the government was saying, to processing information and learning from the past what this could mean. I think character growth is important in movies because without it you have nothing to look forward to or anything to be really surprised about. I deducted one point from this movie because it was black and white, which made it unpleasant to the eyes. I also deducted another point because at times I could not understand what they were saying. Sometimes they would say something so quickly I didn't understand a thing and sometimes they just had a strong accent from back in the day.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Education of Tom Joad,"An extended family of Okies are driven from their land where they work as tenant farmers- displaced by corporate industrial farming practices.-forcing them to make their way California, to try their chances in the land of milk and honey.They load up all their belongings onto an old jalopy, with the whole family, and the old preacher who has fallen from grace...and set off on a road trip across America toward the Sunshine Coast.Not everyone manages to make it to the promised land, and for those who do...it's not all it's cracked up to be.They are met with violence, hatred and disdain, not unlike Chinese workers would face, after heading East to the West coast of America, to find a new life in search of the American Dream.Really, all they find is...exploitation...The migrant workers are pitted against one another to drive down wages, and the price of labour by the modern day slavers, in the form of modern fruit farmers.And dare anyone speak up about it...god forbid, try to organize the workers around the principles of justice and solidarity...less they are forced to pay with their lives.We follow the education of Tom Joad- a man who has only been recently released from the penitentiary, after committing manslaughter- as he seeks to reintegrate himself back into society, while making a new life for himself and his family.Life doesn't make things easy for him...as he is constantly met with obstacles and forced into situations where it is quite literally kill or be killed.And as the police start to zero in on him, he's left with a decision...to stay with his family and see if he can make it through the next work contract unscathed...or set off on his own and become an outlaw organizer...fighting for the rights of the lower class working stiff.If he's going to go down...he might as well go down a hero.The whole thing- based on Steinback's own experience working as a sharecropper- is a microcosm of the macrocosm.An example of how those who are lured to a new place under the false pretenses of the American Dream, are left to be exploited by the rich and wealthy landowners of the capitalist class.Here, it is poor Americans, but one could just as easily replace them with any immigrant, coming from anywhere in the world...and things would play out the same.An absolute masterpiece from director John Ford...and a truly important film all around.Because if we can't learn from history...we are doomed to repeat...as we can see in society today.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Moving On And Breaking Down,"The Grapes of Wrath was formally based off a book by John Steinbeck and was adapted to a movie directed by John Ford in 1940. The film is set in the Dust Bowl era in Oklahoma and follows a family who was driven off their farm due to the dust storms and poverty. Homeless and poor, the family decides to leave Oklahoma to find more work to support financial needs. The family ventures out towards California in hopes of finding employment and a better quality of life. The best-known actors that appear in the film are Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, and John Carradine as Jim Casey.I personally have mixed feelings about this movie. I will start with the good first. The lighting in the movie. I thought this was interesting because it makes it feel more real and as if you are also there in person. I also like the story and how it was based off realistic events such as the Great Depression. It expresses to the audience what life was like and how moving with little to no money was a challenge. The overall message of the movie that I got was to keep on going even if there are many difficulties.The terrible things about the movie were how the characters act towards each other, especially when there is a tragic loss. Everyone seemed to move on very quickly or was indifferent after an incredibly sad event. That was overall an unnatural emotion for a particular scene. It was like that event was not important and did not affect anyone. It felt like ""oh well, whatever"" type of deal. Another detail I did not like was that the characters only referred to other characters as their title name instead of their relationship with each other. For example, when a mother calls their husband ""father"" even if there are no children present. It bothers me because a mother would call their husband by their name in private without children in the picture. This movie made it unnatural to keep the character titles such as ""grandpa"" the same and not to going into the family dynamics more.Overall, I would recommend this movie to watch. Whether it's to enjoy the unique candle lighting or making fun of the scenes that have unnatural reactions. The Grapes of Wrath surprisingly caught my attention and held it through the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An epic of the 1930's,"As a film of the 1940's, the Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and beloved work of American Literature.Even seen as a bit dated, the film harkens back to a time in American History when the government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for agriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees to California. They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.This has to be the definitive Henry Fonda film.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath received two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca.All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with Oscar wins for both 1941's How Green Was My Valley and 1952's The Quiet Man, not to mention what I consider his greatest film ever, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne.My rating: 2 and a half stars",,Anonymous,History
There comes a time when a man gets mad,"When John Steinbeck wrote THE GRAPES OF WRATH it became a highly controversial book, which eventually became a highly controversial movie. For my money it's a near perfect film. The direction by two time Oscar winner John Ford is spot on. He tells his story and it moves along at a very brisk pace. One thing I always find that bothers me most about older films is that the pace tends to lag, a result of the film not aging well or it never had a good pace. This film, upon release, was highly successful and earned several academy award nominations including nominations for best picture and best actor for Henry Fonda. Fonda plays Tom Joad, a man on parole who returns home and discovers that his family has been driven off their land and now must leave Oklahoma and head to the promise of work out in California. The film has a dark view of life in the depression, but to view it any other way in regards to this family's story would be doing Steinbeck's material a great disservice. The family has to struggle to stay together. Grandma and Grandpa are quite old when the journey begins; Rosasharn is pregnant and, to leave with them, Tom must violate his parole. The characters in this film are very relatable because of the idea of family. We can all relate to the various things the characters do to help the family and sometimes to get away from it. One of the films biggest assets is Jane Darwell's touching performance as Ma Joad, a wise woman who is the glue that holds together the family unit. This is a film that must be seen, it's a true landmark film and a cinema classic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Like the New York Times capsule TV review used to say, ""the American cinema at its peak""","John Steinbeck's epic novel of the poverty, dislocation, and injustices wrought by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s was unfilmable as is; it's raunchier, more political, and more left-wing than what 20th Century Fox could put in a major release. All the same, what they achieved was a masterpiece. The fraught journey of the Joads was boiled down extremely effectively by screenwriter Nunally Johnson, and John Ford's direction and Gregg Toland's superb photography are, in a word, unflinching. They're not afraid to thrust the audience straight into the suffering of the Joads and so many like them, and those hungry kids clustered around Ma Joad's pot of fried dough don't look like Hollywood extras, they look like real, poor, hungry Depression kids. The violence and capitalistic greed visited upon the Okies aren't soft-peddled, they're real and frightening. And the ending, very different from the book, is the right ending for this journey, especially in Jane Darwell's unfussy, deservedly Oscar-winning delivery. So many of the actors give career-high performances: John Carradine's haunted Casy, John Qualen's blighted Muley, Grant Mitchell's fatherly camp supervisor (the one component that feels a little soft: ""See, the government CAN do good""). Small scenes, like the one with Mae in the diner, have large resonance, and the have- and have-not verities that are with us still have never been more realistically and heartbreakingly portrayed. ""Rebecca"" won Best Picture that year-good flick, of course, but this one's magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Grapes of Wrath: A Touching look into the 1930's,"Grapes of Wrath is based on John Steinbeck's novel of the same name. It was directed by John Ford and features Henry Fonda as the primary character, Tom Joad, whose journey the audience follows throughout the film. The movie begins with Joad returning to Oklahoma after getting out of jail. He soon finds out that families are losing their lands during the Great Depression. We meet Joad's family who decides to travel west towards California after hearing that there are plentiful job opportunities in that direction.The journey turns out to be a difficult one as beloved family members also perish along the way. As they continue their journey, they also discover that life in the west is not as simple as is advertised. However, the family keeps moving forward in the hopes of finding the next best opportunity for them. Despite all the hardships and negative encounters that the family faces, they keep moving towards their next destination. The movie delivers a touching speech where the family's matriarchy says that, despite all the hardships, the family will continue to endure and live on forever.Now, despite being an older film (set in a time that I could not imagine existing in), I was captivated by the overall story. I could feel the characters' emotions and their strife. I even found myself grieving for the character losses. The cinematography and dialogue did an excellent job of depicting what living in the 1930's must have felt like. The overall high quality of this film is obvious throughout.Originally, looking at the film's 129-minute run time, I did not expect to be so focused on the entirety of the film. However, this is such a well-done story where the long run time did not feel as apparent. The pacing was good and after the midpoint I was so invested in the family that I could not turn back. I recommend this film for anyone who wants to experience a different period in America. I would not let the longer run time deter you. It is not hard to understand just why this film is considered a classic and has also made its way on to several lists.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hard times descend on share croppers driven with with the promise of work...Dust Bowl to the fight for a livable wage.,"The cinematography is fabulous in this John Ford film adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel Grapes of Wrath starring the young and handsome Henry Fonda.Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad who as a newly released parole returns home to his family's Oklahoma sharecroppers farm only to discover that like so many other families they have been displaced and their farm taken back by the bank. He locates what is left of his family on his uncle's farm the day before his family is also displaced. Having heard of work in California they sell everything to buy a truck and get cash to make the trip west where they are hoping to work and earn enough to buy their own place...only they are not the only ones with this idea and when they arrive there are thousands of starving farmers vying for these migrant picking jobs, so many that the farmers are not paying a livable wage for the work being done and are in cahoots with the local sheriff's department.At times beautiful, at times difficult to watch...this film really captures a part of American history and is really worth watching.I really enjoyed the opening scene with just Fonda alone standing tall on a very flat horizon. I think Ford told a lot with the cinematography in this film. The big scene stealer has to be Ma Joad played by Jane Darwell...who really knew how to underplay a scene for maximum effect. I think this showcased Henry Fonda who was really at his peak in this film.Again this is an American classic for a reason, you should give it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
How is it possible?,"How is it possible for an American writer to pen a book exposing the exploitation of workers by powerful agricultural capitalists, only for it to be adapted into a film by John Ford-an American director known for his conservative leanings? And yet, Ford brought this award-winning story to life, even daring to unmask the specter of the ""reds"" used as a convenient scapegoat. For the love of God, such an act takes real courage! After all, it was capitalist America that invented and perpetuated the bogeyman of communism-a narrative they so eagerly inflate and consume.What strikes me is that they seem to adore the story told in both the book and the film, yet fail to grasp its essence. Even 83 years later, capitalism is still staunchly defended-not only there, in America, but here in Europe as well. This oppressive regime forces workers to bend and capitulate, driven by nothing more than the primal need to survive. The film is difficult to watch, not for lack of artistry, but because it so vividly portrays a grim and unrelenting reality of its time. And yet, as much as the context has evolved, the core of that reality remains unchanged: exploitation, oppression, and the crushing weight of unbridled capitalism. Today, they call it ""the market,"" but the struggle endures.This is a masterpiece-a film with a profound, haunting, and deeply human story. It is beautiful, heartbreaking, and unapologetically real. And then, those words resonate like a battle cry:""The rich rise and die, and their children are no good and disappear. But we always continue; we are the ones who survive. They cannot finish us. They cannot crush us. We will always continue, because we are the people.""",9.0,Anonymous,History

I can see why this movie would be controvercial back in the day, however today I couldn't help but think how reserved it was.

Powerful,"""I been thinking about us, too, about our people living like pigs and good rich land laying fallow. Or maybe one guy with a million acres and a hundred thousand farmers starving.""Steinbeck's ode to the plight of dust bowl farmers during the Great Depression is put to film beautifully by John Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland. You could also call it an ode to socialism, which was far less controversial a concept after the nightmarish decade of the Depression, and there are some truly stirring moments. The scene when the Joads reach a camp out of town only to find it filled with poor, displaced farmers such as themselves is haunting. Hungry children from the camp crowd around their already meager dinner, and it made me feel the weight of the question, how can you eat when you know another person is starving? The workers are so dehumanized and treated as disposable that it goes right to the heart, particularly when in many ways it's recurred 80 years later.As labor tries to organize by demanding a fair wage with up-front agreements, we see some of the usual responses from management to try to crush them: enlisting the police to arrest ""agitators,"" luring far more men out to job sites than there are jobs so they can pay less, breaking strikes with violence and by hiring scabs, and over-charging at the company-run grocery, the only one available to workers. The film is softer about this than the novel, but the film also alludes to workers who try to stand up for themselves as being labeled ""red,"" simply because they want fairness. Sound familiar? This may seem like a dusty old story but it's highly relevant today.We see the positive side of humanity in many instances of ordinary people showing a heart and helping one another throughout the film. The work is filled with religious references, e.g. the trials of the family Joad (read Job), the ""lantern"" who sacrifices himself, J.C. (Jim Casy/Jesus Christ), and the migration to the land of ""milk and honey"" - but it's in the best of ways, speaking to the need to be kind to those humbled by circumstances, and the immorality of the rich not sharing their wealth. It also mixes in elements of eastern religion, signaling the oneness of all people in lines like ""a fellow ain't got a soul of his own, just little piece of a big soul, the one big soul that belongs to everybody,"" and to me this is a highly enlightened work.Henry Fonda was very well cast for this part and does very well, particularly with the speech at the end ('I'll be there.""). Jane Darwell also shines as his mother and has a rousing speech herself (""We're the people."") The stark visuals are beautiful, both in the sweeping vistas and the faces of the workers, and it's clear a lot of care went into them. The film never lags either, and I felt my heart rate was faster over its entire second half. The ending of the film is softened considerably relative to the novel, but this is a case where I love both versions. Powerful stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A master class of cinema,"The magnificent adaptation of the novel ""The Grapes of Wrath"", with John Ford on his best shape. The whole movie is a lesson on how to convey the feeling behind a time (the great depression in America) on the masterpiece images that resulted in the film. Cinematography, acting, edition, all are there with a purpose and combined they produce an outcome that only a great director is able to mind. Every detail is made important, like the clothes condition along the movie, the despair that increases in every face, the familiar ties that responds to every fact. Every detail tells the story in a way to make the spectator take place on the happenings. Special attentions to the constant use of shadows, which almost play as another group of characters.Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine are absolutely great but fit in the story in a way to lever the shinning of all the other actors/characters.Finally, it's a crazy idea, but it seems that the people in charge of ""The Walking Dead"" had in this movie a great playbook to guide them in a way to produce the story of a group of hopeless people trying to survive every new day in a society that has just been reduced to ashes.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Oranges,"OrangesThis historical drama tells the story about poor Midwest family forced off their land during the Great Depression. Homeless people then traveled to California in hope to get back on their feet as fruit pickers. But the reality of California was far from the promised land they hoped it would be. The movie has touching story, dark and heavy atmosphere, great cast and directing, and it must have left the strong impression because, a few years after watching, I remember it as if I watched it a few days ago. Although I'm aware of its objective qualities, for some reason I did not enjoy it.

Epic Story of Struggle,"The film The Grapes of Wrath from 1940, is based off a John Steinbeck novel. The plot takes place during the height of the great depression when families were struggling. Tom Joad is a recently released prisoner who was trying to find his way back home to his family. When he arrives at his home, it looks abandoned. This film was made in black and white, but the camera was amazing at showing more drama and emotion. He slowly walks up to the door wondering if its really empty or if they're just hiding. Upon entering his assumptions were correct, except for Muley. Joad finds out that everybody was traveling from Oklahoma to California to try to find some work and a better life. During the depression film had no other choice, but to reflect the realities of the world. People didn't want to see happiness on the screen when their lives were a constant battle. Joad and Muley take off on foot to hopefully meet up with their family. Eventually they do, and the world family seems to have meaning again. it doesn't matter what challenges they were facing, they knew the strength that they could get from each other. If someone was still hungry, but their was no food left to be eaten, someone would share what they had left. the Joad family continued across country on their journey finding random jobs and housing, but surviving. This was an epic story that wasn't based on any family in particular, but on the sad truths that our country once had to encounter. This family has a way of making their viewers appreciate what they have like no film can do today. This is a film that will stand strong as time continues to carry on.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A lonely four way country road.,"Directed by: John Ford Screen play by: Nunnally Johnson Produced by: Nunnally Johnson Cinematography by: Gregg Toland Starring: Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine, Charley Grapewin, Dorris Bowden The Grapes of WrathA lonely four way country road with sounds of birds chirping in the back ground, a man dressed in a suite walking north in the middle of the street which led to the parking lot of a restaurant. This was what opened up John Ford's black and white, seven award nominated film The Grapes of Wrath.The Grapes of Wrath (1940), John Ford's greatest film also in black and white was about the Joad's family from Oklahoma, Colorado who were evicted from their dirt bowl ancestry land. They migrated to California in search of jobs and to find a better way of life. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) played a major role as mother of the Joad's family in the film. Ma Joad is a strong willed mother who always encourages the others to be positive and strong=g. She was the backbone of the family. She kept the family together throughout the migration and through the roughest times.It was a pleasure watching Ma Joad take care of her family and providing them with the love and support needed to motivate and comfort each family member even when they were dying. During their migration Ma Joad lost two of her family members. Ma Joad fulfills every expectation playing her part in the film.Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) played his role exceptionally well as the black sheep in the family. Tom who just got out of jail for committing homicide was released early on parole. He was very excited to see his family only to be told that his family and his neighbors were evicted from their ancestral home. He soon found them and joined them on the trip to California. Although he was very short tempered, and on parole he tried not to get into trouble because his mother has begged him not to get into anymore trouble. Tom played his part amazingly well in this film.The film settings in black and white along with natural and low key lighting made this film exceptional. Everything looked so real, I felt as if I was character in the film. It felt like everything was happening while I was watching it. It all seemed so natural with the sunlight during the day and the low source of light in the night. This was the best black and white film I have ever seen. All the shots that made up the scene of the camp grounds were excellent. The high angle camera shot that was taken of Tom hiding when they were looking at license plates at the camp grounds was a great shot. This showed me how vulnerable and hopeless Tom was after killing a cop after they killed Casey.While migrating to California I noticed there were a lot of informational signs. Most of these signs would say welcome to Arizona or welcome to California. These signs gave only a part of the information, they would then say the speed limit is, but the speed limits were never shown in the film. This family knew there were no limits to what they could do.The Danger sign posted on a tree at the end of the film reveals that they were coming out of harm's way and that everything was going to be alright. This film far exceeded my expectations. All the characters played their part very well.",,Anonymous,History
Note Perfect,"There's probably nothing new I could say about this film - just the regular and much deserved praise: John Ford's direction is perfect, perhaps only surpassing it in The Searchers, as well as Greg Tolland's cinematography; the next year, he would photograph Citizen Kane, and his work there is just the slightest hair better than his work here (which, of course, means that this is one of the most impeccably photographed films ever made). And then there's the acting. Henry Fonda was, no doubt, one of the greatest actors of all times, and this might just be his best film (other great roles of his include The Lady Eve, made the following year, and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man). John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies. Even in Stagecoach, his role was kind of, well, cheesy (I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film). That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent; Carradine is brilliant (and so is Greg Tolland; man, look at the lighting job!). I do, however, wish he had kept his mustache. It's hard to picture him without it! But even with those two masterful actors, a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell, who plays the Joad matriarch. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history. There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which, as the Joad family is just about to flee their home, Mrs. Joad finds some old earrings. She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror. How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings? The past is past, and it will never come back.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It made me actually think and see how hard people had to try to keep their families stable and have enough resources to survive.

"Historically, socially and politically relevant, even today","Based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name, about the mid-west proletariat struggle during the great depression of the 1930's, John Ford's adaptation to film is a sweeping and emotional drama, displaying the problems entailed when a family are forced to move west in the search for work. Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), is travelling back to his homestead after five years in prison for manslaughter. On arriving back he discovers that his family have been evicted from the family farm due to a corporate take overs, and banks foreclosing on the land. So the only option is to travel to California, as they had been presented with a flier advertising picking work.We follow the family through series hardship across the breadth of the USA. Deaths occur, and the working part of the family are mistreated and abused by ruthless business's, who have seized the opportunity to take advantage of the mass exodus of farm workers, making the ""pilgrimage"" from east to west. The film is an indictment of the times. Many families would have had to make this journey, mainly due to the greed of financial institutions (sound familiar?).The film is majestically shot in beautiful black and white. The fact that it was filmed in studios does not seem to make the journey any less real. The film ends with Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) making a statement for the entire proletariat population: ""We'll go on forever, cause we are the people"". A bold statement, that could be used today. The working classes will always be here, and will always be needed. The people are the most important functioning body in the world. What the film shows historically, socially and politically, is that all moments of history (that is each moment there is failure or change) are in a perpetually cyclical motion - therefore, history perpetually repeats itself.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Great American Novel,"Often cited as a prime example of 'The Great American Novel', John Stienbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"" was hailed more for tackling unpalatable political truths at a time when the nation as a whole would rather have buried its head in the sand, than for its literary merits, though they are many. In filming the book in 1940 producer Darryl F Zanuck and director John Ford pulled no punches; even seventy years on this extraordinary film still has the power to shock as American moves ever closer to the possibility of recession: it is just as relevant today as it ever was.It's about the Great Depression, essentially about the Oakies forced off their land, initially by nature itself, thereafter by the banks which took over their share-holdings, and about their migration to California. It's a bleak, harrowing film with no real happy ending. Speeches by Tom Joad and his mother about 'how he'll be there when ever there is a fight so hungry people can eat' or about how 'they can't lick us 'cause we're the people' may have the whiff of optimism but 'not licking us' isn't quite the same as putting bread on the table. Consequently, the film's success has largely been critical and while Ford and Jane Darwell won Oscars the film itself was overlooked in favour of ""Rebecca"", (an oversight rectified the following year when Ford's far inferior ""How Green Was My Valley"" won Best Picture).In the hands of a lesser director it is unlikely the film would have been quite so grim. It's certainly not flawless; there is a penchant for Fordian sentimentality and the characters of Grandpa and Grandma never rise above caricature, but it's still remarkably faithful to Stienbeck's original and thanks, in the main, to Gregg Toland's superb black and white cinematography a good deal of it has the look of a documentary.It is also very well acted. John Qualen's Muley is a beautifully etched study in despair and John Carradine has one of his best roles as 'The Preacher' who finds himself in the unlikely role of a union leader. At the centre, of course, are two great performances. Henry Fonda brings his gangly, liberal integrity to the part of Tom Joad which fits him like a glove while Darwell's stoic, Mother Courge of a Ma Joad rises above the sentimentality and the penchant for caricature into the realms of the truly tragic.",10.0,Anonymous,History

We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody ...,"Watching John Ford's 1940 masterpiece ""The Grapes of Wrath"" spares dozens of historical readings about the Great Depression. Through the absorbing realistically-handled journey of the Joad Family, sharecroppers from Oklahoma, the movie is a tacit homage to all the farmers who were kicked out of their own land after half a century, and by an enemy even more redoubtable because he was invisible. Call it corporations, banks, politics, it's impossible to point a finger on a responsible person, let alone a gun, all the 'Okies' are left with is a bitter resignation mixed with the hopes for brighter futures in California, the promised land.Through its documentary value, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" works as the perfect contradiction to all the supporters of Capitalism as the core of American ideals. It's a film about the little people, those who had faith and lost it. The central character is Tom Joad, an ex-convict, released after four years. Joad was imprisoned for homicide but doesn't carry any regret, the 'victim' had it coming: he pulled a knife. Joad is the kind of more-or-less decent individual victim of unfortunate circumstances but learns to deal with them rather than whining. The second representative character is Casey, an ex-preacher played by John Carradine. The preacher lost the spirit, and it hardly surprises that it's Communism he embraces at the end.An ex-convict, an ex-preacher, ex-farmers, the gallery consists of a bunch of people who 'used to be', and seem incapable to conjugate the life in the future. In a world where farmers are forced to leave the land they walked on and died on, what positive can ever be presaged? The fear ends up killing Grandpa Joad, and the grandmother doesn't outlive him for long. But one person doesn't fear future; it's Ma Joad, and Jane Darnell embodies the pioneer spirit, temerity despite exhaustion, with her droopy but magnificently scintillating eyes. When they live the farm, she doesn't give a last look for they're going to California, and she has no time to mourn the past. She's not braver than the others: the night before, she meditated on her own sadness, alone, but as the heart of the Joadses, it's her duty to exude the happiness the Family is looking forward.The power of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is to vehicle its powerful and inspirational message through characters rather than facts. Ma Joad, through her eyes, smiles and spirit, incarnates the ferocious and so womanly attachment to practical stuff like eating, living, being clean, she's the unwounded soul of that crisis-stricken America. On the other hand, men are more inclined to think, to translate the facts into abstract notions, and ultimately to fight. Tom Joad is no more eager to become an agitator than anyone else, but the odyssey of the road 66, opened his eyes on the new face of America. Either facing the disdain or the support of fellow citizens, he understands that the salvation cannot come from the individual but from solidarity. His ""We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody"" almost sounds like a spiritual protest slogan.It's even ironic that a right-wing conservative directed ""The Grapes of Wrath"", but the whole socialist and communist undertones were less taboo at that time. The film was adapted from the Pullitzer-prize winning novel of John Steinbeck, released in 1939, at the dawn of a worldwide conflict that put the Red Scare into perspective. Naturally, the farmer's contribution to the war efforts leaded them to a more prosperous state, from which their descendants benefited. But as a slice of the American life during the 30's, the film encapsulates all the desperation, the fears and the hopes of a population that stopped to believe in its own ideals. And now that the world is stricken by another crisis, with the financial system, and the most pervert side of Capitalism as responsible, it's time to look at ""The Grapes of Wrath"" with a new eye for the film is still relevant today, maybe more than when it was praised as one of the greatest American films of all-time.And cinematically speaking, it's also a gripping adaptation that conveys the oppressive feeling of this era through a very powerful black-and-cinematography. There's indeed a magnificent contrast between the shadowy photography of the earlier scenes and the sunnier ones when they arrive in the campground in California. At one part, Casey makes a poignant preach implying that he found a new faith, his face hides in the shadow while his eyes are clearly seen, as to suggest a new lucidity, as if the use of lights allowed him to shine within his own words. The same goes for Henry Fonda during his memorable ""I'll be there"" speech, although the lines seem less spontaneous or more cinematic. And this is not to blame on the script but rather on Fonda who magnificently played a character full of anger and hopes, always distant but never unnoticeable, that's Fonda's charisma, subtle but irreplaceable, Fonda who should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.The film was nominated for several other Oscars, it lost the Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" but won a Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darnell and Best Director for John Ford. The two awards are much deserved for Darnell is the heart of the film, and fittingly concludes it with her immortal ""We're the people"", you sure are, Ma  and John Ford who works each shot with an admirable craftsmanship. Many of them show all the Joadses in one frame as to continually sustain the idea of their unshakable unity, which is the kind of values that the film stands for: unity and solidarity.Quite odd from an American film to celebrate these ideals, but this is what makes it such an endearing, timeless, and universal classic.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"All fiction, but oh so real and vivid and photographically striking.","The Grapes of Wrath (1940)A John Ford, Gregg Toland masterpiece. Even if you don't like the social politics, which people in 1940 often did not (the government was helping the poor too generously and so forth), you have to love the movie. Henry Fonda is only the beginning of a series of tough, beautiful performances. And the series of heartbreaks is balanced by glimmers of hope.Most of all, oddly, is that this is a cinematic masterpiece, tightly constructed, and seen (and photographed) with aesthetic intelligence. Maybe the most amazing performance is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who commands the role of an earthy, wise, smart woman fighting the disintegration of her family. She's quite astonishing.Toland's photography is worth noting not only for the usual framing of the shots or the occasional moving camera (when it moves through the squatter camp, slowly, showing the parade of poor people, it's quite striking), but for his use of minimal light. This isn't some film noir effect, but a way of capturing the candlelight, firelight, and just dim night skies that were very real, and very effective here. Great stuff.Dorothea Lange, the FSA photographer who set the framework for the visuals in this movie, is of a special order of photographer, visual but highly human and emotional. And empathetic. Ford and Toland manage to make this into a non stop moving experience, over two hours, and it's no small feat. The fact these are all actors, and yet they are so convincing, adds just another level of appreciation.Yes, great stuff.",9.0,Anonymous,History
graphic look into the feel and realness of the average struggling American family during the Great Depression,"Upon review of this classic, I found myself immersed into the feel of this film. The lighting in this movie casts a certain element of darkness,doom,and gloom which indirectly reflects the time period this is being portrayed in the film. The plot was interesting, I followed the story and it was an interesting look into what our grandparents and great grandparents had to endure during those times of hardship. I found it also liberating to a certain extent, it made current situations and problems in my current life seem not so hard up after all, at least i haven't been forced out of the home and shipped off to a farm to work for a measly 2 cents... Not yet of course ( considering the shape of our current economy / government ) I enjoyed the casting of shadows, and that most of the film was shot at night, this really gave me the sense of darkness, loneliness, and uncertainness. Not quite sure if the director had that intention in mind while in production, but anyway you look at it, it holds a unique element of darkness to it. I would strongly recommend this movie, its fun, serious, and educating, and tells a story during an important time in Americas history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
You Can't Keep an Okey Down,"This powerful film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford chronicles the Joads, a family from Oklahoma, driven from their home by greedy bankers and corporations after their livelihood was ruined by the dust storms of the mid 30s. These storms displaced around 500,000 people, many of whom went to California looking for work. This caused a serious overage of pickers and workers in that state and many of the displaced ended up and starving and suffering in squalor in miserable camps. Steinbeck chronicled this misery (his own version of Les Miserables) in Grapes of Wrath, which was adapted the following year for the screen. Henry Fonda took the role of Tom Joad, which turned his career into gold. All of the adults in the cast performed marvelously, from the crazy grandpa dreaming of squishing around in grapes, to Casey the former preacher who just wasn't sure anymore to Ma, (who won an Oscar along with John Ford for the film). The overwhelming message pounds home the misery of these people, the poor treatment they receive at the hands of the government, police and big business and how unions and worker rights are the solution to these ills.This movie is like bran muffins. Not just regular bran muffins, but bran muffins where part of the oil/butter has been replaced with apple sauce to make them more healthy than they already are.

Without the scene change the movie would not be able to change and move along the way it did.The lighting in this movie was fantastic.

Interesting way or directing,"""The Grapes of Wrath,"" is a very well known film based upon the conditions and hardships of the Great Depression. I found it to be very interesting that I could actually tell that some scenes were filmed on a sound stage. The sound gave it away. I noticed that in a scene where Tom and the former preacher were walking ""outside"" that when they talked, I could hear their voices echoing. I never have been able to really distinguish between on-scene location and on stage. But, in this movie, surprisingly I was able to because of the echoing. But, the lighting in that scene is awesome! It really captures that its later in the day, going on evening, and there is a storm coming. The camera work is pretty basic. The natural lighting of the candle as Tom, the preacher and Yulie are talking emphasizes the conversation they are all having. Good plot, basic filming, interesting light and the sound in some scenes is not synchronized or recorded right in relation to the location/set.",,Anonymous,History
A classic of the human condition,"I think it is most ironic that independent filmmakers claim to despise ""the Hollywood"" film in favor of making ""personal cinema"" when one looks at the films of perhaps the most Hollywood sytem ingrained and yet stunningly personal films of John Ford.His films hold up because they display his personal love of character, land, place (there is a difference), time, honor, tradition and ritual. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting and searing narrative.I agree with many of the other IMDB reviewers, there is much in this film that is pure leftist propaganda and that Reifenstahl and Eisenstien's influence can be seen.  This is certainly true in the masked stormtrooper bulldozer montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another. The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionism. There are so many frames that could stand as works of photographic art. The look of the film stands proudly next to the work of Benton, Hopper, O'Keefe, Capa, and Bourke-White as examples of American visual art.The cast is uniformly honest, sincere and utterly real in thier inhabitation of character. John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from a Actor's Studio graduate.Enough can not be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American pop culture icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.The script captures much of the best of Steinbeck's novel with fantastically illuminating and human quotes. It preaches to be sure, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many ""serious"" film makers have yet to learn.The film has not dated in terms of its impact on the heart. Grapes of Wrath is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense, it transcends nationalism and is fine work of World Literature. It is on equal with Citizen Kane as one of the finest films ever made. A 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The lighting of the film was very good, when it was dark in the house and the camera was just on his face in the beginning was very realistic.For me, as I was watching this film all I could think about was the fact that this actually was happening back then to many land owners. This film was very dramatic and I felt bad for their family. They left everything they had in Oklahoma and had a difficult ride to California where there was suppose to be work.

Starkly realistic...,"...Well, as starkly realistic as Hollywood could get in the 1940's.Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's amazing social novel is terrific. The atmosphere of the source material is brilliantly maintained. The thing that impressed me most was that the film wasn't glossed over in the Hollywood studio-style. Yes, there are some omissions in the plot to comply with the Hayes Code, but it's still very dark and realistic. The hungry children rummaging through the waste piles for a sliver of food is shockingly compelling, as are the machines sent out to destroy the farmer's houses, crushing them easily as the onlookers watch in disbelief. It feels authentic.Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom Joad, the hero of the tale. Fonda's underplaying and sense of the 'everyman' suit his character perfectly. The supporting cast are terrific, and they are not glossed-over, either. Jane Darwell appears to have just jumped off the pages of Steinbeck's epic as Ma Joad. So many families made the journey from the Mid-West to California, the land of supposed 'milk and honey' (which the Joad's find out is not true), but the Joad's struggle feels very personal to us.Very depressing in content- I had to watch this film in portions simply because it overwhelmed my emotions so completely. But the Great Depression was an awful event in America's history, and it's portrayed so accurately here. Students should watch this at school to realize how lucky they've got it now, and how dangerous it would be to fall into a recession once again (it would be different now, but still have the same effect on morale). This is draining to watch, but ultimately uplifting. Ford's direction is always convincing; Steinbeck's great work is in fine hands. The black-and-white photography emphasises the bleakness and realism.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Wonderful Classic,"This is my favorite John Ford movie. I've seen it many times and still love it. I feel so happy when the Joad family finally pulls into the government camp and are treated to kindness and decency. After traveling all that way with them, seeing them suffer, humiliated, spat on, you feel so much compassion for them. And the scene where Tom and his mother are dancing, and Tom is singing to her, that is pure joy. I don't know what Ford's politics were, but I remember reading somewhere where he is very conservative, and many of his film's deal with the frontier, rugged individualism and all, it's interesting that this movie deals so much with local corruption, exploitation and sides with the federal government and its programs protecting worker's rights. I think he also dealt with this issue abit in HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY with the miner's.",9.0,Anonymous,History
My brief review of the film,"A historically important and extremely accurate portrayal of the times and experiences of those disadvantaged by the Depression. It shows how some Californians were inviting and the cruelty of others, and the film manages to expose exactly what the book aimed to expose in terms of the dehumanising effect of the Depression. The degree of accuracy of the film makes it at times painstakingly uneasy, but nonetheless the subject matter is given appropriate treatment. In terms of lighting, acting and direction it nears perfection too. The title refers to how some Californian farmers would spray kerosene on their leftover, rotting produce to stop new migrants from eating it, and that idea in itself haunts the whole film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
ehh alright,"I found this movie to be quite dry in many parts and also very repetitive. The acting on the other hand was superb and it made me want to keep watching the movie instead of changing to something else. I have viewed two other John Ford films with this being my least favorite with ""The Man who Shot Liberty Valence"" taking the cake. The acting by Tommy was outstanding and really was intriguing the entire film. To me the character that stood out the most was the mama. She portrayed the lady of the house very well with all the cooking and the cleaning and caring for the family. It was only right that she got rewarded at the end. This film was an alright film but I don't think I would watch it again for fun. In my opinion not one of Ford's best films.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Just with the telephone poles and everything it was a great opening scene to draw in viewers.the story itself of a man, Tom Joad, is one to grab anyones attention.

"The Touching Saga of the No-Land and Homeless Joad Family, Searching for a Job to Survive in a Place and a Time Ruled by Violence and Prejudice","In Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) and his family are expelled from their lands by a huge company, owner of those lands. Having no other honest option other than finding a job to survive, the Joad family is attracted by a pamphlet, offering work in California. They join their savings, buy an old US$ 75,00 truck for transportation and moves to the promised place. There, the job does not exist, and they find indeed violence and prejudice, among other desperate very poor and starving persons.

"A valiant effort, ruined by socialist exaggerations.","I hesitate to write a bad review of The Grapes of Wrath because I know that to many people who view it apolitically, it is simply a very well made drama. To such people my criticism may seem merely like muckraking. If, however, you are observing the misinformation that the premise of this film is built upon, then I believe it legitimately fails. I understand the poetic license that artists take to make a good story, and I am willing to grant that license. However, I feel that, when tallied, this film's erroneous statements go far beyond the pale of poetry and cross into the realm of propaganda and silliness. It's the difference between ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" vs. Charlie Daniels ""In America"". The former inspires me, the latter is a joke.Another aspect of the movie that bothered me was its disconcerting take on morals. It begins, fittingly, with someone being mocked for obeying a rule. Henry Fonda, a murderer just out on parole, berates a truck driver for obeying a rule that prohibits him from giving rides. What if Fonda had hijacked him, would the truck driver be a prude or an idiot? In the next scene, God gets the ax. Fonda comes across a disillusioned vagabond, the family's ex-parson. He brags that his sermons were emotional hype and confesses that he liked to sleep with the women that got caught up in ""the spirit"" at his meetings. Now, he says, he has lost hope. He does not state this as a fault, so much as it is confusing to him why ""the spirit"" has left him. Strangely, this later state of the preacher is looked upon by Fonda as being clairvoyant. Everything that happens in The Grapes of Wrath happens within the context of morality being a relative thing, certainly one devoid of divine appointment. Everything from lying to murder is excusable if done by the right people or for the right reasons. A few examples:Upon seeing Fonda out of prison, most of his family is hoping he broke out. His parole comes as a disappointment.The murder he was sentenced to seems irrelevant.The sharecroppers are willing to kill the owners of the land to stop them from evicting them (they don't because it ""won't do no good"" not because it would be morally reprehensible).(slight spoiler) Fonda murders another man for murdering his friend, and Fonda's mother not only excuses the murder without knowing what her son's motive was, but offers to cover it up by hiding her son.I, personally, have a hard time rooting for such protagonists. I also found Fonda's character to be too abusive and insolent many times.Overall, I find the authors socialist overtones cliché and cockeyed:Its opinion of authority is comical. All cops are evil thugs, all employed towns people are absentee cowards, all successful businessmen are thoughtless criminals, and essentially everybody in the film that has employment are only out for themselves and their first impulse is always to be rude and uncaring.The film's opinion of how people treated each other in the '30's is askew. No doubt, some people where cold and heartless, that is a given at any time, but where are the good people? There is not a single group or individual (with any means, that is) helping any of these people, esp. children? Where are the soup kitchens, churches, etc..? The premise of the script is built upon this nonsense. Quick research into the Great Depression will reveal a contrary reality. People where mostly very kind and helpful to each other. It's how we survived as a country. Many other countries turned to anarchy.Its opinion of progress is very cockeyed. The tractors are pictured as giant evil job gobblers. In reality, modernization made it so poor people could get better paying jobs and live a much higher quality of life.Its opinion of what role religion plays in American life is cockeyed.Its opinion of land ownership is cockeyed. If I rent land, and the owner wants to take it back, that is part of my contractural agreement. Oddly, it appears the farm owners were actually doing them a favor by getting rid of them. If they were not successful, their grandparents should have thrown in the towel decades before. But I am expected to sympathize with this.Its opinion of how the government helps people is not only cockeyed, it's backwards. If anyone is guilty of screwing people and taking away their rights, it's government. Reality is so much different that this issue becomes a farce. In one scene, the only thing missing from the government run workers camp were angles playing harps. You may argue that Roosevelt's WPA helped people, but many scholars argue that it actually prolonged the depression.The entire premise of the ""Okie migration"" is not factual as presented here, Google the topic to find out. For example; the migration of the Midwest was transpiring since the teens. The bulk of it occurred in the 40's, not the thirties, as employment became abundant in California due to WWII. There are a plethora of other non-truths in this script. So much so that the movie was protested by many people in California. Steinbeck grossly misrepresents the facts.I could go on much longer, but I am limited to 1000 words. All of this is not to say The Grapes of Wrath does not have good and valid points about how we should help people and think of them before profits. I just think they are lost in an ocean of deception and lies. As a movie making effort: 9.5 out of 10. As a whole: 3 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History

Greatly depressing,"The Grapes of Wrath shows the story that many Americans had to go through during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. Returning from prison, Tom Joad finds that his former life is gone - the land has been appropriated, the preacher and his family reduced to penniless migrants. Along the way to California, they meet other migrants who are faring no better and are desperate for work no matter how low paying. Heartbreaking scenes include the sudden deaths, haggling for very small amounts of food and the children's surprise the first time they see a flushing toilet. Near the end, Tom takes breaks from bare survival mode to reflect on the unequal system perpetuating his poverty, taking up the cause of worker agitation but not getting far enough for the film to be truly subversive. It's a bleak portrayal of the time, but with perhaps too many characters coming in and out of the plot to keep track of.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wrath indeed,"IMDb Top 250: 156I can't think of too many films that show the hardships of the Depression off the top of my head, but surely The Grapes of Wrath (what an intriguing title) weighs equally to the entirety of all others. Based on a novel I haven't read, 'Grapes' follows the Joad family leaving to find work in California with their recently returned son and finding misery. This is a heavy film, a depression in a Depression.I was excited by the prospect of seeing a John Ford film, because I associate him with two major things: beautiful cinematography and 'full' films, filled with themes and symbolism. I got the first one: dark, black and white photography, with breathtaking long shots and silhouettes, and faces appearing in darkness. The second was still there, but not as plentifully as his later films. However this is an adaptation, and thus Ford's leeway was quite constricted, plot and theme wise.A film this bleak, with such a feeling of desperation (the wind sounds are chilling) needs desperate performances, and 'Grapes' delivers. Fantastic acting. Henry Fonda is just- wow. I recently saw The Philadelphia Story, and I can say Fonda's performance is far more deserving than Stewart's Oscar winning role. Tom Joad is hot-tempered yet caring: walking the fine line between cool and volatile. Fonda perfects the role and elevates the entire film with his honest performance. He is backed up by solid support, like Ma Joad and Casy. The Joad family is large, and we don't get to really meet most of them. I'm sure the book fleshes the characters out more, but I can only remember the names of Tom, Ma, Pa, and Roseasharon (?) Joad.Like All Quiet on the Western Front, 'Grapes' teaches a solid history lesson. We see the 'Okies' plight in the Dustbowl, their trip across the country with everything in one truck, and their subsequent hardships faced in California by people who don't want them stealing jobs they need too. This story is told with good flow and a strong pace- no scene feels rushed, and no scene feels overdone.Mood is another of The Grapes of Wrath's strength. There's a very post- apocalyptic feeling about it- the scramble to ensure their families survival against everyone else. We see a form of society breakdown, where people can only fend for themselves. The major conflict is hard to describe, as everything goes wrong for the Joads. Nature, other people (but no singular antagonist) and it would even seem God wants the Joads to fail. So when the dance scene comes, it's one of the biggest sighs of relief I've experienced watching films.The Grapes of Wrath is a really bleak film with a really strong lead. It's a remarkably important film, in league with Gone With the Wind, and should be seen for that reason alone- something numbers cannot tell you. It's a story about the injustices done by the rich fat cats at the expense of the poor, and more personally a story of human resilience: that we can overcome lots, but not everything. It's certainly humbling- things can get better but they can also get worse. 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good Film,"The Grapes of wrath is a good film that goes well beyond expressing the grimness of the great depression and dust bowl.

I also thought the film got too political. It wouldn't have been so bad the politics not been so uneducated or naive, but I can't really expect anything different.The cinematography and visuals in the film alone are enough reason to watch the film.

Torn from today's headlines?,"As I write this, there has been rioting in the streets in Argentina and Brazil, rioting by the African and middle eastern immigrants in France and here in the US, tens of thousands of the poor remain displaced from their homes following Hurricane Katrina. A line from one of the best films of the year, ""Secuestro Express,"" sums up perfectly all these people's common problem.""Half the world suffers from malnutrition, the other half from obesity.""Even though it was made 65 years ago, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is still relevant today, for the grinding poverty depicted in this film and the struggle to overcome it --in some cases just to survive it --remains today the all consuming battle for a large portion of the world's population.We should not forget just how controversial John Steinbeck's novel was when it was first published all those years ago. Called socialist propaganda by politicians and branded a pack of lies by the big California farmers, the book went on to achieve great acclaim. Yet it and stories like it will always be lightning rods for controversy because they dare to suggest that what separates the halves and have not's is not always just how hard people are willing to work. Some of those who work the hardest --and there may be no harder work than stoop labor --wind up with the least.Plenty of good hard work went into the motion picture version of this story of Dust Bowl immigrants of the 1930s trying to start a new life in California.The film, of course, was the work of some of the best in Hollywood. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the industry's greatest producers, adapted for the screen by Nunally Johnson (Jesse James), photographed by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane); staring one of the screen's greatest actors, Henry Fonda, backed by a remarkable cast of character actors including Jane Darwell and John Carradine, and helmed by a candidate for the honor of Hollywood's greatest director, John Ford, this film was assembled like a fine Swiss watch, which is probably why it continues to tick today, well over half a century later.Ford was at the top of his game when he undertook the project and its brimming with his unmatched visuals, thanks to the camera-work of Gregg Toland. From the opening shot of a solitary figure walking down a highway towards a diner, to shots of the Joad family, piled in their jalopy truck, passing through an Indian reservation in New Mexico, to the film's signature shot, as they wind their way through a transient camp outside Bakersfield, California, Ford and Toland use the camera to advance the idea that these are people on an odyssey, a search for a better life in a sometimes beautiful, but often hostile environment. Many directors are capable of making pretty pictures. Ford proves in ""Grapes of Wrath"" that you can tell a compelling story without a word being spoken.But like all great movies, from Murnau's ""Sunrise"" to Coppola's ""Godfather,"" this film is about a lot more than pretty pictures. The movie's words are powerful and haunting and resonate today. When John Qualen, playing the deranged sharecropper, Muley, describes how the Oakies have been pushed off their land by the banks; or when David Hughes playing a discouraged immigrant coming back from California empty handed, gives his dire warning about the perils the travelers face, you cannot help but be moved. And of course, there is Henry Fonda, who delivers his now legendary speech at the movie's end, as he sets out on his own to see what can be done about the plight of the poor. The screen may have never produced a better piece of dialog.""The Grapes of Wrath"" continues to stand today as a landmark of American movie making and a film well worth the time of anyone who wants to try to understand what for much of mankind remains the most important struggle --the struggle for survival..",,Anonymous,History
A really well made heavy handed drama.,"You know, some movies are just made as pure drama's. They are purely made to bring emotions to the screen and their heavy handed. You just know that from start till finish there will be nothing to enjoy about the movie and it is going to be as serious as it can get. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is such a drama, so if you don't like heavy, serious drama's, this just ain't the movie for you to watch.Because the movie is so incredibly heavy handed and self righteous, this perhaps isn't the masterpiece everybody telling you it is but there is no denying that the movie is really well made and also features some great acting performances. But because it's such an extreme drama it often feels forced as well and causes the movie to be a long watch, even though it really isn't a that long movie. It's just a movie with a real slow pace and yes I would definitely call it boring in parts, even though lots of (dramatic) things are happening within this movie. It really isn't the most exciting movie to watch and therefore also not really a very effective one. Even though I could appreciate the movie for what it was, it just didn't ever grabbed me with its emotions, story or characters, no matter how very well it all got done.But no, I obviously didn't hated this movie, on the contrary really. Seriously, how can you hate such a well crafted movie like this? Even though this movie got released in the early '40's it still has a real typical '30's look and feeling over it. The '30's really used to be the era of some of the best and most effective drama movies.It's a movie that obviously got well directed, by John Ford, who loved to make real 'American' movies. His movies always have something proud and patriotic about it but without the flag waving and such. To the main crowd he is perhaps best known for the work he did within the western genre, with movies such as ""Stagecoach"" and ""Rio Grande"" under his belt.It's also a beautiful looking movie with its cinematography and sets and costumes, which really suits the time period the movie got set in.It has a really great story and amazingly enough things like this really happened back then in America. I didn't knew anything about this piece of history, so I definitely learned something new from it. It's a pretty amazing story and you would have a hard time believing it if you didn't know that things like this really happened in the past. The first halve of the movie is basically a road trip with lots of drama to it obviously, while the rest of the movie also tends to be very dramatic, when the family constantly tries to settle down where ever there is work (and more trouble).Henry Fonda really plays a great role and he himself also considered it to be the role out of his career. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role. The movie also has an amazing supporting cast, with for instance fine acting performances from Jane Darwell and John Carradine. Darwell even won an Oscar for her part in this movie. It was one of the 2 Oscar's this movie received. The other was for director John Ford. Both deserved their win I would say. The movie got nominated in 5 more categories, including Henry Fonda's nomination.Perhaps not the masterpiece I was expecting, it was too overdone and heavy handed for that but nevertheless one great movie, that I surely appreciated watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Don't be turned off by Steinbeck, this is classic American cinema","Any John Steinbeck title-turned-film tends to scare away contemporary viewers with thoughts of two-plus hours of depressing country drama, but we often forget how radical Steinbeck was for his time, particularly with his Depression-era Dust Bowl novel ""The Grapes of Wrath."" With an adaptation by one of Hollywood's first great directors (and greatest frontier/Western director) in John Ford, this film is anything but a classic adapted for the screen just for the sake of it.Starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" centers on Joad, recently paroled after killing a man in self-defense, and his large family (including parents, grandparents, uncle, sister, brother, etc.) traveling out to California after being forced out of their Oklahoma home in search of work. This one flame of a new life out west, however, slowly begins to flicker away as they find out more and more that they're one of thousands competing for the same few hundred low-wage contractor jobs.The realization creeps up on the characters and even ourselves. A whopping 70 years later, if you come to the film without putting your history cap on, you'll almost be convinced the Joads have a shot. Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson hinges much of the film's movement on moments of realization, creating a growing shadow. Ford gives each scene a chance to sink in with his lingering closing shots that slowly fade to black. These are ancient foreshadow techniques, but Ford reminds us why they're timeless.The building tension keeps ""Wrath"" from festering too long in thoughts about good and evil and what actions make a man one or the other, which was sort of radical thinking for the Depression era. The former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who lives like a hobo and claims he no longer has the spirit because he cannot determine automatically what is right or wrong anymore was more progressive than we realize. Occasionally the script will go back on itself or insert somewhat needless moments of pause for Ma Joad (Oscar winner Jane Darwell) to sermonize about Steinbeck's themes, but audiences probably needed to be hit over the head with this stuff in 1940; it is a different philosophy, that's for sure.Tom Joad's famous speech to Ma as he leaves his family to go off and fight the cause (""wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there ... "") is one of the earliest American ""one person can make a difference fighting for what he/she believes in"" speeches on camera. Since 1940 we've had so many more examples of real life people who have stood up for a cause and fought injustice. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" might seem unoriginal in that thought, but in American history, it's hardly the case. And most certainly, that message will never become irrelevant in spite of hope that it one day might be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,History

Masterpiece of film-making,"If you're not familiar with the Production Code Administration during the time of this film, The Grapes of Wrath may lose a lot of its hidden meanings. John Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland wanted this film to have a documentary feel (hence the type of shots used), and for the most part, it accurately displays the realities of the depression. However certain additions to the movie that separate it from the book, including a totally different ending that neither Ford or Toland wanted to add give the movie a contradictory feeling to it (thanks to the PCA).The harsh struggles of the Joads throws the viewer into a world of desperation, mistreatment, and death. Anyone that saw this during it's original must have been moved, as for today's generation, it's hard to imagine the kind of destitution and difficulties the families of the depression endured. And as the viewer begins to sympathize with the Joad's situation, Ford throws a curve with how Tom Joad acts during a meeting with an lost friend.While it's clear this movie had a political message in mind, the restrictions of the PCA almost ruin the ending, giving almost an opposite message that Ford had.Technically, Toland is at his usual greatness, putting together shots that make the film appear so real that the viewer wants to step out of their seat and into the scene. While watching The Grapes of Wrath, it's easy for the viewer to forget the advantages of the life we live now and to step into the depression and feel the pain of the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The people who live.,"Maybe not the most thrilling movie ever made, but it's hard not to get caught up in it. You just can't help but to feel for the plight of the main characters, and follow them intently as they continuously journey onward searching for hope and prosperity. In a rather grim fashion, the characters are forced to confront disappointment, and ultimately persecution and hardship at every turn.This classic John Steinbeck story is perhaps as relevant now as it was back in the 30s; it serves to criticize the ideals of the American dream, and it proves quite effective as it documents the migration of displaced farmers and workers across the nation. The story is a journey that pushes the characters to extremes, and provides a fairly hellish view of the dustbowl in general. It's driven by a constant pattern, in which the characters come close to finding what they're looking for, and then having it snatched away from them. It's pretty bleak, but the characters remain endearing, especially with their endless conviction and motivation.On film, the story is immortalized with excellent photography and editing.

John Ford Created One of the Best American Treasures!,"John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath is one of the best American films ever produced. Based off the literary sensation written by John Steinbeck only a year before the film's release, it tells a story about depression and poverty. It is a very simple, but well-told story with memorable characters and performances. More than eighty years later, the film remains socially prevalent today as it was back in 1940. Ford does an incredible job making his audience care about the plight of these poor folks- something that many people had to endure during the Great Depression. For the duration of the two-hour running time, I was at the edge of my seat deep within my feelings. The film is not built on shocking dramatics, but rather a story that is still striking because of how deep it is based on reality. This reality is shocking enough. On top of the actual story, Gregg Toland's black-and-white cinematography is super effective. Of course, that is how film were seen back during this time-period, but the camerawork added a realistic touch to these character's predicaments.Steinbeck's novel was a revelation when it was published. To this day, it remains probably the most social document of the twentieth century. The head of 20th Century Fox, Darryl Zanuck immediately swept up the rights for the book. But he was worried about the left-leaning politicization of the novel (keep in mind, this was a different time back in the late 30's and 40's when communist hatred was rampant). He actually sent people to see if the conditions of these ""Okies"" truly exist as the novel described. Yes, they certainly did. Still, they honed down the political overtones. In terms of the tone, the book is a bit depressing. I am happy that they gave the film a more optimistic tone and changed the ending from the book. Despite the prevalent bleakness, you cannot help but think about the word ""hope."" Ma Joad symbolizes hope for her family as her ultimate goal is saving the family unit, which is also a slight difference when compared to the novel.This is the story about the Joad family. They are poor Oklahoma sharecroppers. Sharing the same fate as many other families during the Great Depression, this family is pushed off their lands by these wealthy landowners. Like many other Middle-America folks, they push towards California where they believe they can find plentiful opportunities to bring in the wealth. Once they arrive, they see that work is not as it seemed to be. In fact, labor unrest is very common throughout the state. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) is the glue that holds the family together as she believes they should stay together as one unit. But her eldest son, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the one who may be ultimately responsible for the well-being of this family.Excellent performances are everywhere here. Despite the film being more of a family unit when compared to the book, most of the family is relegated to background duty. When I say Ma Joad is the glue that holds her family together, I also mean Jane Darwell is the glue that holds all the actors together. She is magnificent. Her performance is raw, emotional. Henry Fonda likewise delivers a committed performance. His character is paroled from jail over a bar brawl, but Fonda plays his character as a man not committed to violence unless he has to in this unforgiving world. Also, John Carradine as Jim Casy delivers a sterling performance.The Grapes of Wrath is one of those movies that will make you think. You can compare the current labor movement to this film. This shows how the struggle stills exist even if they exist through different shapes and forms. Even the most hard-nosed person should feel some emotion when watching the plight of the family as they travel along Rt. 66 to California. John Ford is one of the best directors that tells riveting stories about America, in particular when it comes to westward expansion. Stagecoach is one of those stories that I love. This time around, Ford is telling a different type of westward expansion movie. A more raw, tender story. But unlike the novel, there is more hope here. This is one of the greatest American films of all time. A powerful story that is entirely relatable no matter the generation. It begs to be seen. So see it!My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,History
A moving story of the effects of Poverty and another warning from history,"This film although made almost seventy years ago is as relevant today as it was then. It depicts a family struggling to survive the effects of a depression and trying to do the right thing in spite of enormous suffering and degradation. You could make a similar film today and probably film it anywhere in the world. There were millions starving in the world both in 1940 and now almost 2010 and without sounding too pessimistic I cannot see an end to this situation. I am not interested in politics mainly because politicians worldwide generally are not interested in changing anything for the better. Thats not to say that I don't hope for a better future but I think it unlikely that my dream of no poverty will ever come true. The situation is the same as it always was and has been the same for centuries and millions have died as a result. That is not just my particular opinion that is a fact. If you are down you will rarely get any help and indeed you are more likely to be taken advantage of because there is always someone that has the power and the lack of empathy to do that. This film graphically sets out what can happen should you and your family find yourself in a similar position. I would recommend anyone watch this film as another timeless classic. To me 'The grapes of wrath' is another warning from history, it seems we collectively are not listening.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It changed my views about America,"Well yes sir...this is a movie worth noticing. A beautiful story and a immense drama. The story tell us about our society in metaphor.Everything was just great, it was a beautiful and significant screenplay. All characters and actors and director and set...just fitting at the right place. Jane Darwell was really seemingly person don't know why she didn't got Oscar or even nomination. Selfish and struggling people are there everywhere. So this movie is a comment on whats going on around due to negligence towards goodness.This movie changed my views about American people. Even though they seemed to be just all boasting rotten about themselves this film shows how to the ground, simple and loving Americans are. Its like nearly everyone every culture has got same problem but wherever there is innocence and simplicity, love and the lord will have its path. The knowledge found in Indian regions has got its glimpse in this film.It reminded me of all those beautiful Bollywood movies, and this marks that even Hollywood has its deep roots for society.

The seven deadly grapes,"If there's grapes of wrath, then logically, would grapes of the other seven deadly sins exist? Like Grapes of envy, gluttony, lust, greed, and sloth? Besides that, this was a boring movie. The main story was a good concept of a family going through tough times and coming together to overcome it, but I feel like they missed the mark. I think that Tom was a very selfish character as he still got into fights after getting out of jail even though he could have been caught and ruined the chances his family had to find a better way of living. I also hate how they brought up the mom as the glue of the family, but if i remember well she only really had like two moments when she acted like the ""glue"". I think I would have wanted to see more of her in that role rather than Tom being a reckless tool. I feel like I would enjoy The Grapes of Wrath if I read the book instead of watching the movie.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Worth a Closer Look,"Those shacks with their scrawny kids and threadbare mothers are right out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay of the Great Depression. Now, I'm no particular fan of director Ford, but he does nail this social protest film, which remains an affecting classic even 70-years later. Production notes indicate Ford had to battle TCF to get as much realism into the movie as he did. Yet, without those revealing touches, the dramatic impact would be sorely undercut.What impresses me is the similarity of conditions between then and now, that is, between the great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession (housing bubble) of the 2000's. Instead of a stock market collapse and a rural Dust Bowl, our era has seen a collapse of housing prices and a loss of jobs that has wiped out trillions in home-owner wealth. The collapse has created a new class of dispossessed as banks move in to repossess overdue mortgages. At the same time, the unemployed hope to find a job before government compensation runs out.In the movie, uprooted families pack up and move west to new horizons, living in tumble- down shacks along the way. Nowadays, uprooted families are either homeless or live in cars, there being scant new horizons to move to. Meanwhile, nameless bankers and Wall Streeters hover in the moneyed background, profiting off the general misery from behind gated communities. The movie goes easy on the contrast between the few rich and the many poor, but the implications remain embedded in the screenplay, especially when the sheriff evicts the sharecroppers from the land.This brief comparison is not meant to be political. Rather, it's meant to suggest that certain economic dynamics are still with us, even 70-years later, a parallel making the movie's social topic as relevant now as it was then. Of course, as yet there's no Steinbeck or Ford to dramatize the plight in the moving way of the novel or the film. But then, this new era of collapse is still pretty young.The film itself remains a triumph of casting, staging, and scripting. It's really Ma Joad's (Darwell) film, her strength and sensitivity a stand-in for migrant resilience as a whole. I'm so glad Ford refused to prettify her appearance in any fashion. Fonda too provides just the right humorless edge, that of a good man rendered an outlaw by onerous conditions of the time. Carradine's preacher may be the most interesting of the characters. Having lost ""The Call"", he's a lost soul amidst the general collapse of all that was familiar. Yet, he retains the capacities of a visionary leader, someone who can help guide the new Israelites into a land of milk and honey. It's part of the movie's tragic sense of dislocation that his new understanding is cut short.Among many memorable scenes, my favorite is the kids at the roadside diner. The hash- house waitress is a typical sassy type, used to fending off jibes from weary truckers. So, when the deal-making Pa Joad comes in with his two hungry kids, she's at first resistant. But then with the cook pushing, her resistance gives way to the humane person underneath. At the same time, the sentiment proves infectious. And instead of the diner losing money by befriending the needy Joads, the truckers leave a sizable tip. In short, a layer of everyday life is peeled back to show a seldom seen solidarity beneath.To me, not everything is roses. Ford shows his penchant for broad character humor with Grandpa Joad (Grapewin). I know Grandpa is supposed to be borderline senile; however, his overdone antics threaten to undercut the movie's concern with realistic effects. Also, the waitress's scene ending tribute to the generous truckers is unnecessary. Letting the audience grasp the humane gesture would have been more effective.Nonetheless, these are small blemishes within a beautifully wrought canvas. My lingering image is the final shot of Tom as he crosses the skyline, a silhouette of the reformist spirit now loose upon the land. My hope is there are many Tom Joads still among us.",,Anonymous,History
Not as connected story wise as the book,"The film is somewhat choppy as a story, the book isnt. The book has a much different ending. The supporting actors in the film are excellent and are seen again and again in Fords westerns. The main characters are fiery Tom Joad and his rock of the family mother ""Ma"". They dominate the film.The black and white scenery is typical Ford. the situations are too - good or bad. The dialogue is straight forward and the sound quality shows its age.I dont think the condemning of the capitalist system is as strong as in the book. The book has more nuance. The govt camp run by the people and govt by extension is the better way togo. Most of the existing society outside of this camp is fascist, police controlled, American Legion Nazi, exploitive and very greedy. Its a decent movie made to showcase the Depression Era effects on "" white Anglo Saxon ""American"" land owners."" No people of black, or brown hue are in the movie. Evidently their problems did not exist. Its a classic , kind of dated ,yet relevant for today. California, the golden land, is a metaphor for the United States. Evidently the streets are not paved with gold and the reality falls short of the rhetoric in the US....People are exploited, greed rules, the game is rigged against average people.

"Perfect: Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Ford","20th Century Fox and John Ford brought John Steinbeck's classic novel to the screen and created a perfect movie.Henry Fonda gives one of the truly great performances of any actor in the history of the movies and becomes Tom Joad. Fonda's performances conveyed Integrity and never more appropriate than in this film. I must also praise to high heaven the work of one of Hollywood's fabled character actresses Jane Darwell. Ms. Darwell conveys more emotion in some scenes than some actresses in a lifetime. Desperation, Loneliness, Futility, Darwell encompasses all the great values that make a Mother. Jane Darwell is Mother Courageous. Fonda and Darwell's parting scene is one of the most achingly memorable scenes in film History, if one cannot share their feelings one has to be made of stone.

"""That's what makes it ours  living on it and dying on it""","For the adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, the obvious choice for director was probably not John Ford, who was at that time best known for historical dramas. However, if the setting was not typical John Ford then its themes of family relationships, community spirit and social outcasts persevering in the face of all adversity certainly were. It was also a task which members of Ford's stock company of actors  Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and John Qualen  were more than suited to.Considering it is a contemporary drama shot in black-and-white, the images in Grapes of Wrath are startling, from the opening shot of a distant Henry Fonda approaching a crossroads to Jane Darwell's close-up monologue with which the films closes. The director of photography was Greg Toland, one of the best in the business at the time. Combined with Ford's effortless talent for shot composition the results are among the finest images in black-and-white cinema.Ford knows exactly when to edit and when to move the camera, usually for maximum emotional impact. In a scene where Ma Joad is burning some personal possessions in preparation to leave the farm, he cuts to a dirty mirror reflection of her. It's hard to explain how but it works perfectly. He also makes far more use of close-ups than is his norm, building up a greater level of intimacy and bringing the emotions to the fore. This occasionally makes the lengthy patches of dialogue seem a little corny, but this is often a problem with motion pictures adapted from novels which few directors have managed to get round successfully.John Carradine performs in what was probably the best role of his life as the preacher Casey. He's cast completely against type (he usually played sinister villains), but he makes the role his own, creating a character who appears simple on the surface, but is full of down-to-earth wisdom and humanity underneath. There's also a small yet memorable appearance from another Ford regular, John Qualen, who gives a spirited performance as the farmer Muley. In what are some of the best scenes in the film he vents his anger and frustration at being turfed off his land, eventually breaking down until he's nothing but a ghost of his former self.Despite Ford winning Best Director at the Academy Awards for Grapes of Wrath (one of only two Oscars it received), it's probably more a classic borne out of group effort than the vision of one man. For a start, the plot is sourced from a great novel, itself brilliantly adapted by Nunally Johnson. That is combined with a great cast of actors and of course Greg Toland's cinematography. Ford definitely felt more at home when making a western. Having said that, he was never someone to do a sloppy job, and I'm by no means suggesting his Oscar wasn't deserved, but that's not what makes this a memorable picture.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wrong actor won the Oscar,"I realize softheads and leftysts think FDR was some kind of god, a saviour to all the poorz of America. And that capitalists get their jollies kicking people off the land.Gratefully, for the moviegoers of 1940, The Grapes of Wrath was directed by John Ford, who was about as far from being a c0mmie sympathizer as one could hope to get in Hollywood. So he softened the sharp corners of the politics and made a more universal movie about poor Americans trying to survive in desperate times.There are many heartbreaking scenes. They'd be tough to watch even if the entire thing was fiction. Knowing this was reality for farmers displaced by the Dust Bowl (aka The Dirty Thirties) thanks in part to misguided government policies. It's even tougher when you realize America's poor in 2024 are losingtheir homes at record rates and ending up in homeless camps. Again thanks in part to ruinous goverment policies, including Resident Xiden's open-border.Gregg Toland's cinematography is remarkable and the performances suitably downbeat and gritty. I'm not a huge fan of Jane Darwell's performance as Ma Joad. It's a bit too hokey for me. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is more subtle. But let's be honest here, his character is not actually sympathetic. He's an edgy, nasty ingrate, to my eyes.The real hero is John Carradine's preacher. He's modest, honest and has the most dignity of any character. He even takes the assault wrap while Fonda escapes from the first camp. Carradine's performance is admirably without affectation, unlike Darwell, Pa and Sister Sharon (to say nothing of Grampa) who are all caricatures. As for moving performances, my money is on John Qualen as Muley. His flashback to being kicked off his land just crushed me.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The More Things Change...,"The amazing thing about this film, besides the acting, script, directing, lighting, etc., is how clear it is about class exploitation.  The sharecroppers are being kicked off their land, but no one seems to at fault. When the company man is questioned he says, ""It's not my fault, I'm only doing what the bank tells me to do.""  Farmer:  ""Well, I'll go to the bank."" Company Man: ""Well, it ain't his fault.  He's just doing his job."" Sharecropper:  ""Well, whose fault is it?""  ""Brother, I wish I knew.""  So, the first principle of exploitation, still present today, is to make the source of economic misery unlocateable.  How is this achieved?  Well, for one, politicians are in the service of the wealthy, but they also appear to be working for somthing called the ""American People.""  A President like George W. Bush is obviously working for only the richest 1% of the people who live in the U.S. but he constantly looks for ways to appears to be working for the entire population.  He said: ""My economic security policy can be summed up in one word: Jobs.""  And then he proposed a budget that cut job training across the nation.  The second principle of class exploitation clearly outlined in The Grapes of Wrath is that owners will always try and undercut wages by laying people off and throwing people out of work.  The Joads are told they'll be paid 5 cents a box of picked peaches, and then the next day this is cut down to 2 1/2 cents a box, and because there are starving people all around, they can get away with this.  This is still in effect today.  The wealthy class needs economic misery to keep wages down of ordinary people--this is why no state in the US pays a living wage of at least 11.00 an hour.  People actually have jobs for 6.50 an hour with out health care in this country!  There is no way that the great economy of Clinton could be sustained with a Bush in Whitehouse--which is exactly why it plummeted so fast after Bush stole the election.  I find The Grapes of Wrath to be the boldest Hollywood film ever made.  And in the end, when Henry Fonda starts putting 2+2 together, realizes that there is systematic exploitation of poor working people, there is a light in his eyes, a presence beyond the boundaries of his physical body: ""I'll be there..."" and by the end of film, we have made the journey from the scared individual all alone and helpless (Muley--who recounts the destruction of his farm) to Tom Joad's realization that the 97% of us without much of anything have to stick together to beat the remaining 3% of the wealthy who have politicians in their pockets and control the media.  It is Henry Fonda's portrayal of this growth of Tom Joad that makes him the best actor around who could have pulled off such a change.  Bravo!!!",,Anonymous,History

Who do we point the rifle at?,"I got my orders, it ain't up to me, I didn't set the price, take it or leave it. We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that ""nobody"" doesn't even exist.This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at ""the promised land"" they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter. Despite this fight and the competition for the jobs the workers shows solidarity with each other but cannot use this to get proper organized even though a few tries (the story could be seen as a predecessor to ""In Dubious battle"" where the struggle to get the workers organized continuous).The Joad family are very poor given the circumstances but nonetheless they are looked down upon and stigmatized; being poor equals being subhuman; An Okie. If they ask questions or making a statement in front of a policeman or guard they are threatened to loose their job or getting the label ""agitator"".Only in one place do they find themselves at home; in the government camp. It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are – and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the ""occupy wall street"" movement.Regards Simon",9.0,Anonymous,History

american classic,"Watching ""The Grapes of Wrath"" 60 years after its release, one still asks: How did Hollywood allow this film to be made? But as viewers, we are cheered that Darryl Zanuck permitted John Ford and his cast to tell an important story. Although inferior, I think, to John Steinbeck's source material, arguably the greatest American novel, the film is brutally frank about terrible conditions imposed upon Americans. Gregg Toland's unsparingly bleak cinematography dominates the film; the scene in which the Joads ride into the labor camp is so unsettling that I am relieved when the camera stops panning the other residents and returns to the Joads. The unspoken resentment of the new arrivals is palpable; they are not looked upon as fellow Americans but as enemies: more people looking for work, more hungry mouths to feed. The Joads don't have much but when Ma Joad cooks something for dinner, it's as if Pa Joad can hear the rumblings of every hungry belly in the camp when he tells Ma, ""I can still see them in the tent.""The acting is uniformly superb with Henry Fonda giving the necessary edge to Tom's character and Jane Darwell word perfect as the matriarch of the Joad family. The scene in which Ma models a pair of aged earrings in a faded mirror before leaving for California ranks with the greatest in American cinema. The first and last scenes of Ma and Tom together are guaranteed to touch one's soul. The story is too grim to support a happy ending, but what we have is about the best that can be hoped for, with Ma Joad reassuring her loved ones that ""they can't lick us because we're the family.""",,Anonymous,History
A harrowing film with a timeless impact,"It's amazing how hopeless and bleak a film from the golden age of Hollywood can be. Films from this era always seem to be overzealous and excessively joyous. They have that electrifying Hollywood feel to them. Not The Grapes of Wrath however. This is a film that gives the world a reality check and tells a story dealing with the darker and more troubling side of life. It tells the story of an impoverished family moving from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl to California in hopes of finding work. However, the difficult trip takes its toll on them and when they arrive to find significantly less work than they hoped for things become even more difficult. It is the harrowing story of struggle and survival, as well as overcoming adversity with love and family, two themes that drive this film. It's an epic production to watch unfold, and it will leave you feeling so lost, so empty, and yet so amazed.It might not seem like it, but this really was what pushing the enveloped in 1940's Hollywood. To tell a story this challenging and this difficult to absorb was something rarely seen in this glimmering time period of cinema. Yet, it really gave way to revealing the impact that dark cinema can have on an audience. The bleakness of the film is what makes it absolutely gripping and endlessly compelling. It is such a harrowing story and one that constantly makes us want to know what is coming next. It strikes all the right emotional chords and plays out to be a magnificent experience. Add in incredible performances, a compelling script, and John Ford's direction and darkly moving cinematography and you've got yourself a true work of genius.By today's standards The Grapes of Wrath doesn't seem all that depressing or difficult to watch, but if you look at in context you realize the impact of the film. This is why I give this film so much praise for being a true pioneer film in the ever changing world of cinema. The Grapes of Wrath isn't fantastic enough to compel me to call in one of my personal favorites, but I have undying respect for it's quality and the important mark it left on Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Sad...,"This is not a comedy. It is a sad tale written by John Steinbeck. But the thing about it is that it rings true with a lot of folks who migrated to California in search of a better life. It has been suggested that Steinbeck didn't show everything about the harsh realities people faced in this era. If that's true, I can understand why because we generally don't like depressiing stories.As a classic, this is a good movie because it shows that people can be resilient. During bad times, you can still find good people.I'm glad I did not live during this era because I don't think I have the mentality to overcome such extreme circumstances.",8.0,Anonymous,History
American classic,"The Grapes of Wrath gives us the hardships and prejudices that ""Okies"" had to face during their journey to California.  Forced off their land, and striking out west, the Joad family encounters just about every kind of hardship, yet the family lives on.  Mostly in part of Ma Joad, who keeps her family going through the worst of times.  Henry Fonda is wonderful as Tom. You can see his anger and frustration behind his eyes.  There's so much injustice going on around him, and he's powerless against it.  When he's about ready to do something foolish, it's his mother that pulls him back and makes him think about what his actions will do.  Unfortunately for Tom, fate has a way of dealing a bad hand and he must leave his family, not for his safety, but for theirs.  John Ford, a man usually associated with the western genre, brings Steinbeck's epic to the screen with skill and care. He invests so much time with the Joads that you feel like they're your own family.  And it pains you to see them go through such pain.  There is an uplifting end to it.  Ma Joad tells her husband that they will live on, they are the good people and nothing will ever wipe them out.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Hard times during the Great Depression,"I was not a fan of this movie. For this movie to be about the Great Depression, I didn't set my expectations high. The Great Depression is a hard topic to make good with. This movie was also made in black and white, so it is outdated for me. I will say, this movie gave an idea of how poor everyone was, and how hungry families were. And overall, how everyone was struggling. It is fascinating to me how Americans made it through the Great Depression. I think if they were to shorten the length of the movie, it would have helped pace the movie and help with the long boring scene. For me personally, I wouldn't recommend this movie.

The Grapes of Wrath Review,"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name represents an unflinching depiction of the realities of farming during the Great Depression. The film was directed by John Ford and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, with Nunnally Johnson writing the screenplay. The Grapes of Wrath stars Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, and John Carradine. The film was nominated for seven academy awards, with John Ford winning for best director and Jane Darwell winning for best actress in a supporting role.The Grapes of Wrath focuses on the Joads, a family of Oklahoman farmers in the 1930s. The film opens on Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), the eldest son of the Joad family who has recently been released from prison and is hitchhiking home to his family. He encounters Jim Casy (John Carradine) along the way, a preacher who baptized Tom years prior but has since lost his faith. The pair travel together to the Joad's farm, where we learn that the dire economic circumstances caused by the Great Depression and the devastation of the Dust Bowl has seen the Joad family forced from their land, along with thousands of other sharecropper families throughout the state. With scant options and desperate for work, the Joads decide to migrate west to California, which at the time was being touted as a haven of opportunity.The film follows the Joads as they make their way to California and depicts the heartache and hardship that migrants faced while traveling westward. Upon their arrival, the Joads quickly realize that California is not the welcoming and opportunity-laden promised-land that had been advertised. As the Joads travel through migrant camps experiencing deplorable conditions and brutal treatment, Ford takes the viewer on a journey that documents the stark realties faced by hundreds of thousands of displaced migrant workers.The events that transpire in the latter half of the film (which will not be described due to major spoilers) culminate in Tom recognizing the importance of social organizing in the face of injustice, and taking on an activist mantle to fight for change.In summary, The Grapes of Wrath is a cinematic achievement that stands the test of time. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad was marvelous, his acting style perfectly suited to the role. The musical score was a huge technological feat during the time it was produced, supplementing the film's striking visuals and cinematography. While faithful to the novel, the film ends on an uplifting note, an excellent choice (in my opinion) that offers the audience a sense of hope and purpose.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Early vision of neoliberalism,"This movie is John Fords best work, cinematographically and in every other sense. First of all it shows where capitalism is ending: in the complete misery of most of the people. Besides, and this is new since this film has been made, capitalism will ruin our planet, too.But, to use a quote of Ma Joad:""Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good an' they die out. But we keep a'comin'. We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out; they can't lick us.

John Ford doesn't let us forget what it's like to be destitute as the film details the belittling attitudes they endure at every stop along the way, eating away at whatever pride they have left. And when the torturous journey claims the life of Noah Joad (Frank Sully), the eldest of the family, his haunting and memorable burial along the side of the road provides one of the film's most riveting scenes.

Don't watch if you love the book.,"I know there is always a difference between books and films, but my goodness this one is rough. The Grapes of Wrath is one of my favorite books and, now, my least favorite films. The sense of deepening dread that carries the Joads from bad to worse in the book is missing, there is no sense of urgency to find work, the casting choices were poor (other than Fonda as Tom Joad), and the music makes it feel like a family just in limbo rather than running for their lives. Key parts of the book that made it into the film are rearranged and this lose their potency. Important characters like Grampa, Granma, Casy, and Rosasharn all fade into the background. Lastly, the most striking images (the book's final two chapters) are left out entirely. Even though I reminded myself before I started the film that movies never live up to the book they are based on, I've never been more disappointed in a film in my whole life.",4.0,Anonymous,History

A bit too easy going down,"John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath."" is generally considered one of the Great Ones. Ford's direction is assured, the Gregg Toland cinematography is stunning, and Henry Fonda is mesmerizing in what is probably his best performance. But the film just isn't all it's cracked up to be.For one thing, characters disappear with no explanation or exhibit completely unmotivated changes of heart -- as if the director's cut had been hacked to pieces by the studio after the first preview in Pasadena. Worse, in spite of the unmitigated suffering, everything has a squeaky-clean gloss, and the Joads are suffused with an unrelenting nobility that makes you want to strangle them all. Certainly Steinbeck's ""little people"" were heavily romanticized, but you could still taste the Demon Dust that engulfed them. Here it too often feels like a little wayward talcum powder.Fonda's Tom Joad is especially troubling, because he seems to exist as the mediating force between ""our"" prejudices about these people and their essential ""goodness"". He's clearly capable of violence -- and of realizing our worst fears about the poor and aimless -- but his faults are the result of an involuntary fall from grace. He's at the core an angel who's been cast from heaven by evil forces outside himself. This is rather simplistic.Still, if the film ended on Fonda's famed visionary, fevered soliloquy, it would be easy to forgive much of the gloss. Instead the last big (and seemingly tacked-on) monologue is given to Ma Joad, and its perversely buoyant optimism is utterly true to the soporific populism of Old Hollywood.",,Anonymous,History

Grapes of wraith,I enjoyed this movie a lot. It does a great job of portraying history and what it was like after the economic crash of United States. The main character is a very righteous man who has been through a lot and after serving a jail sentence comes home to find out his family is leaving his Oklahoma farm. They are off to California due to he dust storms and infertile farmland. On their journey they face many trials and tribulations in which the protagonist must help his family overcome in order to help them have a safe trip to California.throughout the film there is very epic scenes that are quite inspiring as well as very poetic and epic dialogue.

They took a good book, found a good director, took the time to find good locations and make realistic sets, hired a stellar cast, and tried to find the essence of scenes form the books, and present a shorter yet faithful version of the story. It's hard to blame the producers, writer and director for cutting away parts of the book, just as it is hard to not miss the parts that are not adapted.There are some tweaks to the story that changes the tone a little, especially regarding the ending. I find myself forgiving it, due to the time it was made in. Had a modern day adaptation taken similar shortcuts (in order to achieve a happy ending), I would most likely not have accepted it. The same goes with how certain characters at times are a bit exaggerated.

A classic you needn't be afraid to try if you're not a film school graduate,"Plenty of people write reviews for film reviewers. So if you're a film reviewer, just check out what Roger Ebert wrote and you're set.What about us regular guys? I like intellectual dramas, but not if they're melodramatic, and a film about an event they name after ""Depression"" I was sure was going to be too weepy. This is why I still haven't seen Schindler's List. I just haven't had a free week where I can afford to cry all the time.Also, a lot of ""classics"" are pretty boring, not from an film school perspective, but from a regular guy perspective. So I'm glad to say that The Grapes of Wrath is a winner. It starts with a lot of whining about land, which as I've moved several times in my life I didn't quite get, but when it ratchets up into labor camps and competitive gangs fighting for jobs, holey smokes.It's true that the film is preachy. But it's also a true story, and good one. The point of the film isn't so much the plot as the settings that the family is thrust into. And it's wonderfully moving. Similar to Across the Universe, you get a glimpse into all aspects of life in that period.I recommend it as a classic that's not too erudite or aging. I'll give The Grapes of Wrath an 8 out of 10, sort of a bonus 7 out of 10 for being a true story.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Biblical journey across Route 66,"""The grapes of wrath"" plays during the great depression. The ""dust bowl"" causes farmers to lose their farm and sending them on a journey West to California, hoping to find work as a day laborer.John Ford has made many films about men moving West, but most of the time these were adventurous frontier men moving out of their own free will. In ""The grapes of wrath"" men are driven out of necessity.""The grapes of wrath"" is the adaptation of a novel of a liberal writer (John Steinbeck) by a conservative director (John Ford). The result is a film that is fairly critical about capitalism and capitalists.Look at the way the capitalist bosses are portrayed. They pay low wages, oblige their workers to shop in the expensive camp shop and call everybody who stands up for their rights a troublemaker and communist. If necessary they remain order with the help of their own private gangs. It is if you look at a Russian movie in which Sergeij Eisenstein portrays the boyars.In contrast, the government is portrayed as just and decent. A very curious combination in an American movie! Maybe John Ford is not so conservative after all. A year after ""The grapes of wrath"" he would make ""How green was my valley"" about workers in a Welsh mining village.The journey to California is portrayed in a Biblical way, including the crossing of a desert. On the other hand the journey is typical American, the family Joad getting their kicks on route 66.The value of ""The grapes of wrath"" is enhanced in no small part by the cinematography of Gregg Toland. For his work in ""The Godfather"" (1972, Francis Ford Coppola) cinematographer Gordon Willis earned the honorary name of ""Prince of darkness"". In my opinion Gregg Toland earned this title more than 30 years earlier for ""The grapes of wrath"" in which many scenes are very dark and sparsely lit. Gregg Toland went on to become very famous for his use of deep focus photography in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941, Orson Welles).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Review for ART1145- A Highlight of Human Spirit,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" is an all-time classic of American Cinema. It is a movie that still stands the test of time, and in many people's eyes is a masterpiece. The things that really stood out to my untrained eye were the attention to detail in the sets, the great use of lighting, and the passion of the actors.""The Grapes of Wrath"" was directed by John Ford in 1940 and based on the novel of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film was produced by Darryl Zanuck. The story was based on a family from Oklahoma being displaced from their farmland during the great depression. The film depicts the trials and tribulations the family goes through during their relocation to California.Tom Joad, newly released from prison, is the main character and ultimate leader of the Joad family. His character is played by Henry Fonda. While initially coming off as selfish, Tom develops into a caring, compassionate, and strong leader. Ma Joad is the matriarch of the family. She was played by Jane Darwell and she did her best to hold the family together. Jim Casey is another important character. He was a former preacher who Tom Joad brought along for the journey with the family. In turn, Jim did his best helping to turn Tom into a better person. In the end, Tom ended up putting his life on the line for avenging Jim's demise.While the movie was great in many aspects, there are certainly some aspects that perhaps leave something to be desired. It is quite crude with many aspects of the film that are not appropriate for young people. Also, some of language and actions would not be accepted in society these days.In conclusion, all the acclaim of the movie is absolutely warranted. It is a story with compelling characters, a great story line, unexpected outcomes, and does a great job highlighting the challenges of this era and human spirit. It is a must see for anyone interested in American history, and enjoys a film that brings to life the struggles, hopes, and dreams of people.",9.0,Anonymous,History

A Must-See Film For So Many Reasons - And One of The Very Best,"If this isn't the finest and most moving depiction of the human tragedies that occurred during the Dust Bowl era, I don't know what is. Yet it is much more than that - it is simply one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will never see - and while it's arguably (a very young) Henry Fonda's very best film, Jane Darwell puts in a performance you will never forget (and you won't soon forget her final line - one of the most historic, moving and memorable final lines in all of movie history). You can't get a better story than one written by John Steinbeck, of course, and the stark cinematography blazes new territory and remains fresh to this day. Even the ""lesser"" character actors shine brightly here. Who will forget John Qualen's performance as Muley or John Carradine's performance as Casey? ...And that's just scratching the surface. Who doesn't fall in love with and care about the main characters, as they desperately try to survive the rigors of the Depression (and whom among us could withstand the horrors they went through)? This is a real story - one that every American needs to know; there is no exaggeration here. The inhumanity heaped upon the most defenseless during the Depression - as brought out in this film - is something few movies have brought out. This is the quintessential Dust Bowl and Depression film. The realism is incredible. The music helps move you to tears, too.

If you actually make it to the point in the movie where Henry Fonda rattles off his big speech, congratulations. The movie is so dismal, and his voice is so irritating, it's hard to make it through the entire movie all at once.The only redeeming parts of this classic John Ford drama are the supporting characters. Jane Darwell (rewarded with an Oscar statuette and a Hot Toasty Rag nomination) plays the long-suffering mom. She's tough and hardened, and has sacrificed her whole life for her family and the farm. I can never make it past her famous packing scene without crying.Charley Grapewin also gives an impressive, but brief, performance. He plays the grandfather, without his teeth and with a constant palsy. It's very sad to hear his wobbly voice, but it's shades of things to come. To see more of a great thing, rent Tobacco Road to see his Rag-winning performance. John Carradine and John Qualen are familiar faces, even though the box office draw is Henry Fonda. Had he spent the entire movie in his little cap just enjoying some close-ups, it would have been much better. But, we all know his voice is annoying, and to hear him speak line after line of John Steinbeck drama... Well, it takes a very alert audience member.If you haven't seen this classic yet, you'll probably feel compelled to watch it. But don't worry if you don't like it. You're in good company.

The Grapes Of Wrath,The Grapes of Wrath I believed that the picture was flat because of how the content was choreographed by John Ford. The negative element was that most of the sequences didn't have a strong substance. The black and white footage aggravated the situation; the reason was that the storyline was crumbling like breadcrumbs. As a consequence I lost fascination in the plot. Because of the terrible director the landscapes were matt with the colour. If it was Hitchcock motion picture the Black and White and the directing wouldn't of been an issue. In my opinion the soundtrack was rushing to the drains because of the instruments that were playing worthless chords. But on the other hand some of the camera angles captured quality moments for an example; far distance and sky view. The phycological element in the content was underneath the surface as John Ford's purpose. A few scenes of cinematography were impressive.

It just looses me. This was simple in that were wasn't too much babble about things like that. The characters carried on with life and had real experiences that I could emotionally follow.I did seem to miss out on characters leaving the original party, besides the one that was pointed out by the characters. I did sit here wondering why certain faces weren't around anymore. I was paying attention, but I think it's because black and white movies are hard for me to follow, since I grew up with color. If a character isn't distinct enough, I'll forget who they are and mix them up with others. That would happen in such a story as this, with so many people in it and moving around such a large group.Those are the only two discrepancies I had with it. Other than that I did enjoy it!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Steinbeck at his best,"Born into wealth, it is hard to imagine how Steinbeck could portray poverty in such a personal way. If it is true that great writers write from what they know, it is astounding. Somewhere he possessed an old soul and a feel for real people and real times. East of Eden is another wonderful example of his understanding of pain and , most of all, of love. Henry Fonda was born to play this role. Why he did not win an Oscar for it is amazing. Attempts in later years to remake this epic movie, a waste. Leave perfection alone. Ma Joad, also, cannot, among today's actresses be redone. Perhaps Meryl Streep in another hundred pounds and 30 years. When choosing entertainment for young readers, this movie is one they should be required to see. Sadly, many English classes no longer have required reading. Watching this adaption of Steinbeck is the next best thing.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Even though the movie is highly rated and people seem to like it I do not think it was the one for me. First off it was black and white and I tried to see past it but it just seemed to throw off the whole movie and just board me.

Excruciating and beautiful.,"Grapes of Wrath is a really difficult movie to watch. For nearly two hours, you watch a family lose their home, get bullied by the police, starve, and lose half their family members to death. And the despair and helplessness is all captured and presented beautifully. GOW is an extraordinarily directed movie, with a fantastic use of camera and lighting. The cloudy country shots are beautiful. As are the dark, enclosed shots(in a different way), with their contrasting sense of lost confinement. It's a simple thing to mention, but the way Muley lit up when Tom was searching through is home was really awesome. The movie is bitchin.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Love the immiegrantion story,"America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review.Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Stark Reminder,"The Grapes of Wrath (1940), directed by John Ford is a dramatic film about the depression; and is based off of John Steinbeck's novel. The Joad family are in search for a better life, and head towards California. This film is very dramatic, and showcases the Great Depression and its many struggles. It shows people living in deplorable conditions and the set pieces are great. The film does a good job at showing the environment, which was the Midwestern United States. The camera shots by John Ford are amazing and capture the scope and the feel of the scenes. This story is such a good one, that when presented with the opportunity, you should watch it if you haven't already. Overall, I give The Grapes of Wrath(1940) an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I think it might just be me because this isn't my type of movie but I have to be considerate because it did come out in 1940. I like the story a lot though because of the time period, it is very interesting seeing how the family was affected by the Depression.

"A stupendous, powerful, essential classic","While there are certainly exceptions, one doesn't typically look to the 40s for high quality cinema, especially not as censors' production codes neutered much storytelling and film-making. Not all pictures were so heavily subject to the whims of reactionaries, however - some distinctly scraped by in some manner - and it doesn't take long after this one begins that we recognize the enduring strength of its narrative, the infuriating, despairing relevance that it continues to have eighty years later, and the fact that it surely falls into the latter category. 'The grapes of wrath' is a story of the wealthy, powerful, and amoral exploiting hardship and desperation to set people against one another, and to selfishly reap gain wherever possible, and moreover of forsaking humanity to destroy lives instead of coming together to lift up the unfortunate and disadvantaged to mutual benefit. Of course it is also, more specifically, the story of one family persevering despite these conditions and trying to abide and survive, but it is through the lens of that particular set of characters, and their friends and acquaintances, that we see laid bare the lasting iniquity, dismissive indifference, oppressive abuse, and murderous callousness of the powers that be. Here, perhaps, is where the cinematic sensibilities of the 40s have a proverbial leg up on modern fare, for despite the dour subject matter, the feature endeavors mightily to carry itself with a warmth and hopeful optimism that maybe, just maybe, the Joad clan might make it through these dark years and come out stronger on the other side. Even as that endeavor struggles through brutality and grief, there is shrewd wisdom and and tact in the construction that helps the flick to continue to shine brightly, and to duck the ax of regressive cultural forces.By virtue of that tale alone, Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel, this title is immediately grabbing, captivating, and absorbing, with both a soulful richness and an urgent message that we don't always find in the medium. Among other frames of reference, in the case of the latter I am obliquely reminded of King Vidor's 'Our daily bread,' and in the brightest instances of the former, Kurosawa Akira's 'Red Beard'; in the most grim moments, well, those comparisons are harder to come by except in daily real-life headlines. The sum total speaks resolutely to a conflict between the needy and the cruel; unthinking complicit state agents, migrants, labor movements, and individuals on all sides who leap to action for good and for ill; and those who try to help as they can: all operating within a titanic, unjust, inhumane sociopolitical and economic system that would require truly unprecedented unity and pressure to change. Vibrant scene writing, alongside the narrative at large, offers a portrait of humanity both heartfelt and dire - and as tragically, devastatingly, maddeningly relevant to the world of 2024 as to that of 1940 - and even the characters and dialogue are incredibly smart and flavorful. As 'The grapes of wrath' speaks directly to the malice of wealth and power, the value of community and collective action, and the unswerving determination of all, there can be no disputing that as much as this is a fictional drama for our consumption, it is also a call to action with a strident, welcome aim to radicalize.This is to say nothing of the otherwise craftsmanship of the movie. It's not that any facet is singularly revelatory, but from top to bottom this is shaped with fantastic skill, intelligence, and vision that does just as much as the writing to breathe life both terrific and terrible into the saga. The production design, art direction, costume design, hair, and makeup realize The Great Depression with stark, unfailing clarity and severity, not to mention utmost detail; those stunts and effects that are employed arguably hit harder for the measure of restraint present in contemporary film-making compared to subsequent decades. Gregg Toland's cinematography isn't outwardly striking, but at all times is stupendously keen and focused, centering the drama in a steadfast manner that makes it ring out all the clearer; the very use of light and shadow in this black and white presentation lends magnificently to the gravity of the story, proving that sometimes even with all its advantages modern cinema can't match the unyielding purity and ardor of the classics. The cast is simply a treasure, from one to the next all bearing wholehearted vitality in their performances that lets their characters pop out. In Johnson's adaptation the family is given different treatment than in Steinbeck's novel, but that in no way diminishes Jane Darwell's portrayal of Ma Joad, a proto-feminist anchor of familial and community bonds; Henry Fonda and John Carradine's acting as Tom Joad and Jim Casy, both driven and resolute in their dawning recognition of social conditions; nor the efforts of their co-stars, all just as crucial to the tableau.And all this is definitely a fine credit to filmmaker John Ford, sagely guiding each element into the exact right direction to tell a compelling story, and to make a picture that would stand as a testament to the times, while bearing great purpose. Ford is not a filmmaker I'm especially familiar with, but of any of his works I've seen to date, this is unquestionably the best. I assumed I would like 'The grapes of wrath,' but it is absolutely far more impactful and rewarding than I ever could have guessed. In all the past 130 or so years there are a relative scant few titles that might be heralded as some of the best ever made; I don't know that this would specifically make my personal shortlist, but for the level on which the film operates in every capacity, the distinction is a matter of semantics more than substance. It's dreary, yes, and not always easy to watch; words like ""enjoyable"" or even ""satisfying"" carry too positive a connotation for the ways in which the story plainly mirrors real life, past and present. Yet even at that, and for the contributions of all involved, and for the thought-provoking, inspirational messaging that ultimately sits at the core, the end result is so outstanding that it altogether demands viewership, an essential classic that feels genuinely important and educational. Some features exist beyond questions of personal preference, and in my opinion this is one of them: 'The grapes of wrath' is superb, and I must give it only my very highest and heartiest recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Basically a Primary Source,"The 1930's are a struggle to truly understand the poorness and pain people went through, especially the farmers in the west. Grapes of Wrath explains and shows it perfectly. The abuse and mistreatment of these poor people- though everyone was poor- really pulls at the heartstrings. This movie is very close to being a primary source for the Great Depression, which adds to the realness of the movie. The scenes of these communities of other western farmers, especially the first one, was very heartbreaking. I appreciate the cinematography.

And the people continue to go on.....,"John Ford directed some classics, and this might be his best. The Grapes of Wrath is of course based on John Steinbeck's seminal novel about the hardships of the Great Depression on Oklahoma sharecroppers forced to migrate to Californian for menial work. The film paints a stark picture of perhaps our country's most bleak period. A time when unemployment was around 25%, dust was choking off normally reliable farmland, and simply finding enough food to eat could be nearly impossible.This film was actually made when these kinds of conditions were still ravaging the United States. It would not be until the end of WWII that happiness on a large scale would be found once again within our borders.The film itself is skillfully made and acted. Some of the edgier elements of Steinbeck's novel could not be included in a film in 1940, but the audience will still have no trouble understanding the dire circumstances these characters face. This film basically made Henry Fonda a star, and he may have never been better. Fonda stars as Tom Joad. Joad is portrayed in the film's earlier moments as kind of a shiftless and violent type who has just been let out of jail where he had been sent for killing a man. He seems to want to brag about this to a truck driver who gives him a ride out to his family's farm. Once he gets there, he encounters a washed-up preacher named Casey who is played by John Carradine. It seems that since Tom has been away, things have gotten so bad in rural Oklahoma that even preachers are losing faith. Tom Joad then learns that his family, among several others, have been ordered off their farms by either banks or faceless corporations that own them. Tom Joad has to grow up pretty quick after meeting up with his family members, and soon enough they load themselves and their belongings into an old truck and are headed out to California to find work.The Joads encounter all sorts of hardships and prejudice on their journey, and things are even worse once they arrive in California. It seems that work is harder to find than they were led to believe, and the work there is doesn't pay worth a damn. Anyone who speaks out is likely to get beat over the head with an ax handle and killed. People are starving everywhere, and nobody in authority seems like they care. For a moment, the Joads seem to find a sanctuary in a government-run campground, but by this time, Tom Joad's fate is already pretty much determined. For reasons you will have to see for yourself, Tom Joad knows that he will have to spend the rest of his life on the run. And hopefully, he or his spirit will be able to help the ""little guy"" whenever he can. His goodbye scene with his mother is poignant, and it will touch even the most stone-hearted members of any audience.The picture looks great. B/W has never looked this good. Even though some of the sets were obviously sound stages, you won't really mind. Except maybe the scene where Fonda and Carradine are walking up the land to the Joad farm. You can actually hear their voices echo off the walls and ceiling! The film is preachy, but these were desperate times back then. To a guy who is starving and cannot feed his family, socialist dogma must have sounded pretty good. All of the performances ring true, including Jane Darwell as Tom's mother. She won an Oscar, as did director Ford. The film is bleak, but in its final frames there is a definite twinge of optimism. This is key because when the film was made, nobody yet knew of the prosperity yet to come. Pearl Harbor had not even happened. The film definitely scores points for ending with an upbeat theme and showing its faith in the people. Because after all, we the people keep on keepin' on! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Analysis of The Grapes of Wrath; 1940 film,"The following comment surmises the Classic book: The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, but also pertains to scenes and events from the award winning 1940 picture.John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath is a stunningly realistic account of the daunting lifestyles of mid-western and southern farmers, who after having endured the vicissitudes of several consecutive years of drought and the lack of crop growth are compelled to relinquish ownership of their properties and move west for the prospect of a frivolous life, where fruits and vegetables are abundant and where labor is easy and prevalent. The historical significance of this movement is portrayed through the eyes of Steinbeck's memorable fictional characters: Casey, Tom Joad and his family. Having been recently released on parole from prison for the execution of a man, Tom Joad is keen on returning to his family once more. The identity of the man Tom has killed remains undisclosed throughout the book due to the fact that the significance of Tom's atrocity is not of the man he killed, but the reason he killed him. John Steinbeck built his book on characters with dormant animosity. The poor yield of the crops, the famine and pessimism of the future has all amounted to irrational wrath and unconventional violence. On his journey homebound Tom confronts a listless figure with his back against a tree bark and is surprised to discover that the person is none other than Casey, the preacher. Casey enlightens Joad that he is no longer a preacher and has given up a life of piety for the life of a ""normal man"". Here again, the ingenuity of Steinbeck's plot is witnessed, because the preacher's neglect of God shows that he unequivocally faces the predilections and dilemmas of the common people. He being a pastor does not make him exempt of the impending crisis soon to befall. By the time Tom Joad and Casey have reached Tom's former abode, they perceive that it has been abandoned and has been left to decay and disintegrate in putridity. When Tom asks a fellow farmer as to what has become of his family, he is aware that they have relocated elsewhere and are planning to embark on a tedious exodus west in a few days time. The grapes of wrath are beginning to plant their roots.Tom and Casey reach Tom's family by nightfall and Tom asks his mother when they were to leave. She replies that they were to leave tomorrow morning. He then inquires whether or not they would have left, had he still been in prison. Tom's mother (alluded to as Ma) assures him that they would have dispatched an epistle. Now Steinbeck addresses the dire earnestness of the situation, by showing that Tom's family would have went west, whether he was in prison or not. When Tom's capricious grandpa adamantly rejects to moving west with the rest of the family he is knocked unconscious and sprawled upon the tarpaulin, which furthermore shows the vital importance of the move west. Soon after their departure, Grandpa falls ill and later succumbs to his sickness. He is given a banal burial, and the family along with Casey moves on, showing that even death would not intervene with the necessity of a better life out west. Later in the story when Tom's grandmother falls ill, the truck stops in front a checkpoint and an officer peruses about the items and occupants on board. Tom's mother ardently refuses for the mandatory checking, claiming that there are no liquids on board and that they have an ailing woman who is in need of critical medical attention. The officer permits them through out of maudlinness and when the rest of the family realizes that the grandmother is deceased they ask why she never informed them. She replies that she was scared the guards wouldn't let them through if they had known it was so, and once again we are blatantly witnessed to the importance of the migration west.From thence forth the family is labeled as ""Okies"", not pertaining to the place of their birth, but a bias slur, generalizing them as simpletons who have neither food nor work, and ramp about the country pleading for undeserved privileges and necessities.Goaded on by the lack of food and substantial work, the Joads reach California. Pa says something along the lines of ""It will all be better once we get to California."" and Tom replies that ""We are already in California"", signifying that life for them in the Midwest would be no different from life in California. Acres upon acres of plentiful fruits and vegetables which were not of their possession, but of the possession of the affluent, avaricious landowners were a mere ploy in the eyes of the Okies. They were there, redolent, serene and glistening, mocking the ""Okies"" for having come all that way merely to perceive something they would never have the ability to obtain. The grapes sagged on the branches of the Californian bushes. Troubles sagged on the hearts of the Okies and the wrath intensified into pure rage. The grapes of wrath had sewn their stalks in the hearts of the Okies.Envy and spite instills within the former preacher Casey, to audaciously strike a cop who arrives to intentionally conjure trouble out of his own initial contempt. Casey is sent to prison and the family resumes in search of work and solace. Solace is found when the family reaches a stable government camp, where not only are hot baths and commodious tents bourgeois accessories but the affable people accentuate the atmosphere. The realization that life in the government camp is ephemeral goads the Joads onwards once more and Steinbeck idyllically portrays his use of deception by making his readers believe that a glorious life is prevalent when in all actuality it is not (he uses this style in Of Mice and Men as well).",9.0,Anonymous,History

I don't know much about the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl, or the struggles of the Oklahoma natives in the 1930s. But from what I do understand, Steinbeck told it well and John Ford probably toned it down a little to make it palatable for audiences.Henry Fonda shines here. Although he had already broken out as the title character in ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" (1939), also directed by John Ford, he is said to have really launched his career on ""Grapes of Wrath"" following his Oscar nomination.

A Still Relevant Masterpiece.,"Based on John Steinbeck's novel, this adaptation, brilliantly directed by John Ford, stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, who returns to his home after being released from prison on a ""homicide"" charge, discovering that his family is being evicted by the bank, along with everyone else in the area, because this is in the middle of the infamous Oklahoma dust bowl, where a long drought proved devastating.

Direction by John Ford is highly atmospheric and haunting, and he well-deserved his Academy Award, though the film should have itself won that honor in 1940.

one of the two or three best films that Ford and/or Fonda ever made in their illustrious careers,"I once had the opportunity to read John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ""The Grapes of Wrath"" but regrettably turned it down in favor of another novel that I was not so enthralled by. But now looking back a few hours ago on experiencing the famous film adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"", I'm finding myself very eager to look upon the original text that inspired such an enthralling, potent, and strong movie.""The Grapes of Wrath"" was directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda and this one of the two or three best films either of them ever made in their careers. Fonda stars as Tom Joad, an Oklahoma farmer recently released from prison during the dawn of the Great Depression. Fonda returns to his family, only to discover that they've been forced off their homes and now their only glimmer of hope for survival seems to be to head to California. But when they arrive, they arrive only to discover that things in California are just as back as they were in Oklahoma, if not worse.It has been eight decades since the crash of the stock market in 1929 and being locked in a global recession at this point in time, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a surprisingly potent little movie to look upon. Not to say that it wasn't always moving and powerful, but it's just that now, the strength of the movie is excelled and pulsed into the nerves of the American people.Henry Fonda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this movie (and ironically enough lost to his best friend, Jimmy Stewart for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), an event that made Jimmy feel a little guilty afterward) and it would be forty-one years before Fonda was ever nominated for Best Actor again, when he finally won for ""On Golden Pond"" in 1981. And while any performance by an actor as multifaceted and terrific as Henry Fonda is a classic in its own right, his portrayal of Tom Joad is hands-down the cemented image of the struggling American, a performance that is rivaled in this allegorical category really only by Orson Welles in ""Citizen Kane."" And these two performances really are the balance of what every human being wants. Welles's Charles Foster Kane has all the money and fame a man could want, but he would sacrifice it all to have a family as strong and close as Tom Joad's. And Joad watches his family crumble around him, envying men who can prosper and live happily.Now, that's just the allegory, but that's not all that makes ""The Grapes of Wrath"" a great movie. Nunnally Johnson's screenplay is arguably one of the best ever written, as it encompasses these characters and realistically recreates the Great Depression era so well to make it seem as though it were real captures images of that terrible chapter in the world's history. The movie also features a strong supporting cast including Jane Darwell, who won the Oscar for Best Actress. The cinematography is dusty, yet gorgeous at the same time and this too adheres to the psychological effect on the audience. And of course, as with any film, the director is due enormous credit. I'm not sure which film I would consider John Ford's definitive best, but this or ""The Searchers"" would be the two primary contenders.And yet, even though the movie does portray a Depression as terrible and family-wrecking, it does end on an optimistic, if not entirely victorious note for the Joad family and this is best, not finishing the story. Just giving the audience the right tone to assume and then using their imaginations and curiosity to wonder how to fill up the rest. This is a powerful, significant element of this powerful, significant film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Grapes of Wrath review,"The grapes of wrath is so realistic and breath taking, it will leave you in a world of emotions. it is the story of the Joad family, who are kicked off their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. Since there wasn't a lot of variation on the black and white cinematography in 1940's, the lack of color increases the emotions of wholeness,poverty and emptiness due to the family's foreclosure and forcing them to move. The Grapes of Wrath is merely not a cutting edge sit at the end of your seat film, but it is a realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performance by the actors and the work of the production company couldn't be more on its mark. the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational.",,Anonymous,History
A Cinematic Journey Through The Grapes of Wrath,"From a production perspective, the film is notable for its exquisite use of black-and-white photography by Gregg Toland, whose work effectively conveys the protagonists' personal, unfiltered feelings as well as the enormous emptiness of the American countryside. In addition to highlighting instances of human resiliency, the contrast between the lights and shadows evokes a sense of hopelessness. John Ford's direction is outstanding because he strikes a balance between the Joad family's personal experience and more general social observation. Because of its deliberate pacing, the viewer is able to thoroughly immerse themselves in the family's predicament without feeling hurried through each scene's intense emotional content.Though the movie adheres to the novel's spirit, several aspects of Steinbeck's original work-especially its more extreme political overtones-are subdued, emphasizing the individual drama above the larger social and economic critique. For readers who are accustomed to the novel's harsher criticism of capitalism, this might be a disadvantage, but it might also make the movie more acceptable to a larger audience.All things considered, The Grapes of Wrath is a strong, provocative movie that documents a pivotal period in American history. The film's portrayal of human persistence in the face of tremendous circumstances is profoundly compelling, and the performances-particularly those of Jane Darwell and Henry Fonda-are outstanding. This picture is still a must-see because of its historical relevance, emotional depth, and technical mastery. To anybody interested in American history, social justice, or vintage film.In conclusion, while The Grapes of Wrath does take some liberties with the source material, it is a masterpiece in its own right. John Ford's adaptation conveys the emotional weight of the Joad family's journey while offering a powerful commentary on the American Dream and the struggles faced by the working class.",8.0,Anonymous,History
What would Steinbeck think of America today?,"Growing up in a comfortable suburban community, I had the option of reading John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" in an English class. I wish I had. But I'm not sure I would have fully grasped its significance. Now that America is in a modern equivalent of the Great Depression, some 80 years later, I can fully appreciate Steinbeck's work.I have nothing against capitalism, but what is portrayed here is not capitalism, it is naked, ruthless greed destroying the lives of countless people. While the details have changed, the greed we see today is the same, and even more faceless and insatiable.This movie is not just a story, it is a lesson about the need for compassion for our fellow Americans and human beings, a lesson that desperately needs retelling today.In 1960, John Steinbeck traveled around America in a pickup camper to research the book that became ""Travels with Charlie."" The Steinbeck who saw the horrors of migrant labor camps portrayed in ""Grapes of Wrath"" did not like what he saw Americans had become in 1960, especially the racist ""cheerleaders"" of New Orleans. He was so demoralized he eventually cut his trip short and headed for home.I wonder what Steinbeck would have thought about Americans today, especially the politics? I think John Steinbeck would weep.This is a movie that every American should watch, especially if you are living in a comfortable suburb insulated from the pain many of your fellow Americans are experiencing today. This is not a comfortable story, but it is one you need to see, and probably will be glad you did see, unless you are one of the 21st century robber barons.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Heartbreaking,It is sad because it is true. Modern companies led by rich people don't care about poor and ordinary people who just try to survive.

A story of survival and humanity,"The film was released before the United States actually entered World War II, its production and release took place during a time of political tension and social unrest. The film not only criticized the social injustices in the country, but also asked questions about the American dream and the country's values. At a time when the world was reeling from war and economic instability, the film touched upon themes that resonated with many viewers and made them think.Director John Ford managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and portray the emotional and physical hardships of the main characters, the Joad family. The story is a family journey through the dusty streets of the Midwest in search of a better life in California.An unforgettable story of survival and humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,History

wrotten grapes,"Ok so it's not bad but not good. Ok, it's bad. It doesn't really make sense. The beginning of the movie I am still confused about and I am not sure how the guy got back to his family but whatever. Anyways the movie is about Okies (fams from Oklahoma) moving to California and trying to find work and housing. The main character I guess killed someone and got out and was on parole but broke the parole to go with his family. The family went on the road trip and it took a long time. Someone dies but can't say. The grandpa didn't want to go so they got him drunk and put him in the back of the truck. Kinda rude but ok. The first camp they went to the cops came and tried to arrest a guy for ""a fight"" that probably didn't happen. The guy ran and the cop shot at him but somehow missed very badly and shot a random lady randomly standing in the road. Yeah also it is in black and white so it is kinda hard to see them at night but watch if you want.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Rusalka's sixth film review: An epic of the 1930's,"As a film of the 1940's, The Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and monumental classic work of American Literature as this is.Even seen as a bit dated by today's standards, this film harkens back to a time in American History when the Government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for argriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees westward to California.  They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.This has to be the defintive Henry Fonda performance.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath recieved two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's suspense masterpiece Rebecca.All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with 1941's Best Picture winner How Green Was My Valley (another Best Director statuette) and his 1952 homage to his homeland of Ireland, The Quiet Man (yet another Best Director statuette).  But his film career would be crowned later still with what many consider his greatest achievement, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne, Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.My rating: 2 and a half stars",,Anonymous,History
Good classic,"Good classic I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Amidst Death, Despair and Desolation, Hope","Released within a year of the novel, this potent Steinbeck adaptation sees a hard-working Oklahoma family through a bitter eviction, an arduous cross-country relocation and a desperate fight for survival near the crowded California coast. Along the lonesome desert highway, they encounter cruelty and kindness, hope and hardship, life and loss. Depression-era America was still a fresh reality at the time of filming, which makes its portrayal less a dramatized dash of hindsight and more of a living testament.The book's broad themes, while tempered, remain intact. To be honest, Steinbeck's version can be downright ruthless in its many depictions of human greed and life beneath the bottom rung. That's partly what I loved about it - the brutal, unflinching honesty of it all - but I can forgive an eighty-year-old film for averting its gaze from time to time, so long as the message rings true. In this case, the big-screen rework slices away most of the political messaging and concludes its story in a more optimistic place than the novel, but the plot, trimmed and compressed as necessary, still shines. It's impossible to replicate the rich, deep characterization of a good Steinbeck novel in a two-hour movie, but this one does a fine job of distilling the important players to more digestible versions of themselves without losing their essence.As adaptations of classic novels go, The Grapes of Wrath is pretty darn good. Especially so considering its age, and the various competing influences that could've derailed its narrative. Compared to East of Eden, it's night-and-day.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Steinbeck classic,"Starting with John Steinbeck's classic novel of the Depression and migration of families from Texas and Oklahoma due to the dust bowl and subsequent drought, the grapes of wrath brings the pain and suffering of the farmers to the big screen. Huge numbers of migrants had the misfortune of living through both the stock market crash and its aftermath and the lack of rain which left thousands of empty farms.Narrated by Tom Joad, a man who has just been released from prison and returns to the family farm only to find it abandoned. He meets up with a former preacher, Jim Casey, and they venture out on the road. What they find is not pretty as the banks have foreclosed on countless properties and the rumor spreads that California is a perfect destination for good, high paying jobs. Unfortunately, the employers have sent out many more fliers than people needed for the work and use the oversupply to keep wages low. In order to force a living wage, attempts are made to form unions , which results in violence between starving transients living in camps and the owners who call them reds or communists.The book is one of the finest works of American literature and director John Ford retains the spirit of the novel using Henry Fonda as every man in the defining character, Tom Joad. John Carradine is also well cast as the doubting former preacher, Jim Casey. The mood is ominous but at the same time hopeful of a better time yet to come. We need to be reminded of our past mistakes in order to avoid repeating them, and this film is a good history lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Grapes of Wrath,"The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge-of-your-seat type film, but it is exceptionally realistic and does a fantastic job portraying the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. This film was a perfect example of great American film making because of its genuinity.

The characters performances were powerful and inspiring. The Grapes of Wrath is an unquestionably beautiful and spiring - yet educational - film at the same time.

"""The Grapes of Wrath"": A Timeless Masterpiece of Struggle and Survival","The Grapes of Wrath, directed by John Ford and based on John Steinbeck's acclaimed novel, is a powerful depiction of hardship, resilience, and the fight for justice. Released in 1940, the film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the protagonist, alongside Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Carradine as Jim Casy. The screenplay, written by Nunnally Johnson, brings Steinbeck's intense social commentary to life, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the film's producer.The story follows the Joad family as they face the harsh realities of the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. After being forced off their farm in Oklahoma due to foreclosure, they embark on a difficult journey to California in search of a better life. The family, hoping to find work and stability, is met with discrimination, extreme poverty, and exploitation. Along their journey, they confront the broader injustices plaguing the working class. Tom Joad, recently released from prison, becomes a voice of social awareness and change as he slowly realizes the systematic oppression faced by poor laborers.John Ford's direction brilliantly captures both the personal struggles of the Joad family and the broader societal issues of the time. The cinematography by Gregg Toland is a standout feature of the film, with its use of deep-focus shots that emphasize the vastness of the American landscape while highlighting the family's isolation and desperation. These visuals, combined with Ford's narrative style, give the film a somber yet hopeful tone.The performances in the film are stellar, particularly Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad. Fonda brings an emotional depth to the character, transforming him into a symbol of resilience and justice. Jane Darwell's performance as Ma Joad is equally compelling, as she represents the strength and hope that holds the family together. The cast's relationship makes the movie better and gives it an authentic, heartfelt feel.Overall, The Grapes of Wrath is an enduring classic that resonates across generations. Its exploration of social inequality, family, and human dignity still holds relevance today. The film's compelling narrative, coupled with exceptional performances and striking cinematography, makes it a must-watch for anyone interested in film history and social justice. I would give this film 8 out of 10 for its profound impact and timeless message.",8.0,Anonymous,History

movie review,"Great Movie. ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" was known to be an outstanding novel. John Ford brings us his adaptation of it. This movie was so well done. One technical aspect was how great the photography looked, by cinematographer Gregg Toland, one of the best in the industry at that time period. John Ford gave this movie excellent direction, he conveyed good character development and the movie had movement and progression, both in the storyline, the core meaning and the character relationships. It's a sad movie made in 1940, but taking place in the 30's during the dust bowl, families are forced to migrate west to California in hopes of finding work. With thousands of families migrating, few can be accommodated. For the family of Tom Joad luck was rare. The emotions, mood and feeling that come from the very roundness and progressiveness is what makes this movie so desirable. Also the shot composition and lighting really helped me feel the mood of the story. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a very realistic and sad story of man vs. law and man vs. society. It shows us how the best thing to do is to stick together with your loved ones and you'll get by. This was such and inspiring influential movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Analysis for The Grapes of Wrath (1940),"This movie is a good one, but it's not as good as some of the other films that I have watched recently. When I saw the Route 66 sign, I knew that the family was going to another place. However, I didn't know that the Joad family's travels down the highway was hard. I was sad when Grandpa Joad passed away during the trip down the highway. Other than that, it's still good. The acting by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell happens to be really good as the story moves on. Also, the writing of this movie is so good that it makes me want to see it at least once more. When it comes to how it did overall, I would say that it's not as good as some of the others, but hey, it's still a good movie.

A Well Deserved Place In The Library Of Congress,"Based on the landmark novel by John Steinbeck, John Ford's film adaptation of The Grapes Of Wrath has become almost as large a cultural force as its inspiration. It was selected as one of the first twenty- five films to be archived in the Library Of Congress as a significant cultural artifact and, in my opinion, this was done with very good reasons.The story of the Joad family making the trek from Oklahoma through to California in search of work during the American depression will be familiar to many people, and as such I will not talk at length about the film's plot. What I will discuss, however, is the deftness with which this material is handled by Ford.Gritty and realistic the photography and direction of the movie is one of the high points of cinema history. Nothing appears by accident, but nothing is drawn too obviously to the audiences attention. Tom Joad (wonderfully played by Henry Fonda) lighting hand-rolled cigarette in a moment of quiet contemplation, ex-preacher Casy's (John Carradine) nervous twitching as he tries to find his role in the world, and the Joad kids' (Darryl Hickman and Shirley Mills) resigned playing as their stomachs softly growl: all of this is shown with such a lack of overt stylisation that they become some of the most touching and heart- wrenching images to be displayed outside of a documentary.The attention to detail too is great to witness. The actors wear no make-up as they play their parts in an effort for realism and the car that takes them on their trying journey is the same Hudson ""Super Six"" Sedan described by Steinbeck. Nothing feels staged or overly Hollywood, but rather it all comes across so naturally that one can almost smell the miasma of dirt and sweat that surrounds this unhappy lot.I think, however, that some of the biting realism of this film have been lost over the years, or at least relegated to being somewhat of a quaint charm. I mean, Steinbeck's novel is taught in many schools and people have become very familiar with the story over the many years since it was written, and this is be no means a bad thing (in fact it makes me happy to think that Steinbeck is still so well respected and widely read), but it does mean that someone sitting down to watch The Grapes Of Wrath for the first time is unlikely to have anything similar to the reaction that audiences had at the time.The socialist undertones and dissection of the pain caused by a capitalist system left to its own devices now come as part of the package when one hears the title The Grapes Of Wrath, no longer will one be surprised, shocked, and reduced to tears of righteous indignation when these images are presented to them. The discussion of 'pinks' and 'reds' are not so immediate to a modern audience as to make them bristle with deep-rooted political allegiances, but rather they pass the modern viewer by completely or serve only as some historical curiosity of a bygone time.I suppose that it is better that the conditions of Steinbeck's book and Ford's film do not persist to the current day, but it is still somewhat of a shame that these reactions have been lost, and that a full visceral understanding of the film is almost unattainable today. But still the film must be viewed as a triumph and a masterpiece which does and will remain relevant now and for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Powerful humanitarian film in a challenging time,"Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) comes from a sharecropper's family in Oklahoma. He's done time for being in a fight where his opponent dies. He returns to the farm in the Dust Bowl era only to find everyone packed up and gone, part of a mass migration to California where supposedly plenty of farm jobs exist for them. Tom catches up with his family before the authorities come to demolish the home where they're staying[1] and about ten of them head west in a big ol' beat up truck that reminds you of the Beverly Hillbillies.The story is how human beings, when faced with natural disaster and social structures that systematically destroy their ability to earn a living, press on with dignity and hope. (Hmmm, seems applicable to the world of our Wall-Street takeover, eh?) Indeed, I see the movie (and book) as one long song to the indomitability of the human spirit. No, these aren't Randian nonfamilial, hyperindividualistic characters seeking to achieve prodigious engineering feats against all odds.

Amazingly compelling movie,"This film is a shining example of John Ford's directing prowess. ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a ripped for the history books example of life in the 1930's Midwest. Henry Fonda has an amazingly compelling performance as Tom Joad, an ex-con returning home to his family of sharecroppers. When the company repossesses the land, the family must move where they can hope they can find work. The film takes a very naturalistic lighting approach which magnifies the performances given by the cast. I have never read the original novel by John Steinbeck, but this work put together by John Ford sets itself apart to stand on it's own merit. The film takes on a subject matter that was still very fresh in the minds of the American public.

A Masterful Film That Lives Up to Its Reputation,"Grapes of Wrath, The (1940)**** (out of 4)I'm sure many could take a political angle when discussing John Steinbeck's novel, which was the bases for this film, which today is considered one of the greatest pictures ever made but I think trying to label it left-wing or right-wing would really kill the deeper meanings in the film. The story is quite simple as a poor family from Oklahoma are kicked off their land and they decide to travel West where they think plenty of work will await them. The family heads off for a better life but soon they're hit with one heartbreak after another. Having watched this for the first time in over twenty-years, what really struck me was the simple message of the story and the rather simple tones that director Ford used to get those messages across. This certainly isn't a film that preaches to you but at the same time it's impossible not to deeply feel what it's saying as the film perfectly shows everything that's great about America and what's bad about it. There are so many classic. landmark moments in this film that many others simply get overlooked or are never really discussed at all. One such scene happens early on when the family, slowly breaking apart, enter a diner wanting ten-cents worth of bread but the rather snotty waitress tells them all that's available is fifteen-cents. What follows is certainly very touching and shows what good can come out of people. Of course, there's also the ugly side mainly dealing with, as Tom Joad puts it, millions of acres of land and thousands of farmers going hungry. Ford clearly wanted to make people feel as close to these characters as possible and I think one major reason he succeeds is because of the documentary feel he creates. The natural lighting was the perfect choice because it really makes you feel the dirt that is on all these characters, it makes you feel the baking sun and it makes you feel as if you're along for this sad journey. This journey from Oklahoma to California is filmed in such a way that you can't help but feel for the people going through it but it also gives you this strange feeling that you can follow your dreams no matter how unlikely they are to come true. Many stated that this film is about dreams that go unfulfilled while others see the ending as an incredibly positive thing to give one hope for going forward. I think my feelings are somewhere in between but there's no question the final speech by Tom Joad deserves its place in history.Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and that ""simple man"" quality of the actor was certainly very much needed here and there's no question that it was born here. While Fonda turned in many good to very good performances before this film, it's clear that this here is where he really took off and this simple man part is something he would go onto play countless times in his career. Just that laid back approach to the way he walked and talked really took this character off the book pages and made him a film icon. Fonda certainly gets much of the spotlight but the supporting players are all just as impressive. Jane Darwell is perfect as the strong mother, Charley Grapewin as Grandpa, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad and John Qualen as Muley. Eddie Quillan, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, Darryl Hickman, Ward Bond and Joe Sawyer also appear. Then there's John Carradine who turns in one of the finest performances that any actor gave in any film from this era. It's always rather shocking to see how many terrific performances he gave early in his career before turning to ""C"" and ""Z"" pictures towards the end of his life. It's also rather sad that he wasn't given better film parts because his role as Casy.THE GRAPES OF WRATH was considered for many decades to be the greatest American movie but then the praise for CITIZEN KANE came around and while the Ford film has fallen over the past few decades it's certainly a film that still touches many. I don't think there's anyway to deny the true power as it's almost what one would call the perfect film. Everything on a technical level is top-notch and you're certainly not going to find many more movies with such terrific performances by an entire cast. Some might try to tear it apart for some political reasons but that would really be a shame and it would only show the flaws of said viewer and not the film itself.",,Anonymous,History

Human spirit,"Good movies are the ones that goes beyond a specific historic moment and impacts our present ""moment/life"". You can feel and understand The Grapes of Wrath's message now in 2014. I had to look back into dates to realize that ""La Terra Trema"" and ""Rocco e i suoi fratelli"" both from Luchino Visconti or ""Les quatre cents coups"" from François Truffaut or even ""Los Olvidados"" from Luis Buñuel were made after John Ford's movie, I felt that in those days only European cinema had these deep drama human elements, but this movie was a good surprise for me. Human spirit struggling; people moving from one place to other leaving everything they have for a new better life, dealing with moral dilemmas, taking care of older parents, hunger, misery, all these elements are always present in one way or another in those days but what I loved about this movie is the ""hope"", the way this American movie believes in the human spirit and doesn't lead everything to a dramatic tragedy.

This movie is strong,"This movie is strong, because it accuses simple wrath, and this strength comes from people. At the ending, Ma says ""Women are strong, because we accept the situation.

He says that he got direction from his company; his company got direction from the bank in Tulsa; the banker in Tulsa got direction from the bank headquarters of the East, who makes all decisions to earn money most efficiently. This is the same with what is happening in today's world. Today, the greedy economic animals in the East of America are doing the same, and by their greedy acts the world is going to big depression. Therefore I felt this movie still has a strength that works today.Though I have not read the book yet, there were some scenes I could not understand well. Kasy was an ex-preacher. He did not know about the economic social problems of the poor and the rich. He is arrested at the camp site to let Tom run away.

We later find out this man has just been released from jail and is on probation. He comes home to an empty house and the news his family has lost his land and thus their source of income and survival and from here the family makes their journey across the county suffering many hardships along the way.Being released just a year after the Great Depression officially ended in 1939 many movie goers related to this film like nothing they had ever seen. It stands today as a reminder of the struggles that we as a nation have overcome and the strength of the average American family.Besides its historical significance the film was also a major success for the style of the early 1940's. It combined studio setting with location setting which was typical of the time. It was also directed by Ford which resulted in much of his style which included many long and medium range shots. The use of light was typical for the time, which met it was used to determine between good and bad characters and to set the mood of the over all scenes in the film. One example of this includes a scene where the corrupt cops beat and kill a friend of the family. in this scene it is the lack of light that makes it typical for the time period. Overall it is a very well made film and a good movie with historical significance and a good plot that was only enhanced by John Fords unique directing style.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The quintessential Depression era drama - from director John Ford,"John Ford won the second of his record four Best Director Academy Awards for this Depression era drama from John Steinbeck's novel about the Joads, and other families of Oklahoma sharecroppers whose decades old farms were destroyed by the Dust Bowl, their migration west (in an overloaded jalopy-truck) to California, a place purported to be ""the land of milk and honey"", and their disillusionment about the American dream.Jane Darwell won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar (on her only nomination) for her role as Ma Joad, the family matriarch whose last words are perhaps the film's most optimistic. Henry Fonda received his first nomination (Best Actor) as Tom Joad (voted AFI's #12 hero, even though his character is an ex-con that struggles to stay out of trouble during much of the story).Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, the film was nominated for Best Picture, so was its Editing (Robert L. Simpson's only Academy recognition), Sound, and associate producer Nunnally Johnson's screenplay. It appears at #21 on AFI's Greatest Movies list, #7 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list, and was added to the National Film Registry in 1989.The cast is chock full of recognizable character actors whose performances – along with Gregg Toland's dark cinematography – help to convey the squalid conditions of the situation and bleak outlook of the time. John Carradine plays the former preacher Casy, who makes the journey with the Joads. Charley Grapewin plays Grandpa, whose depression about his reality contributes to his failing health, while Russell Simpson plays his son and Fonda's Pa Joad.John Qualen gives the best of his prolific career as Muley, whose driven crazy by losing the land he and his family had tended for 70 years. Others in the credited cast are Dorris Bowdon, O.Z. Whitehead, Eddie Quillan, Zeffie Tilbury, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, child actor Darryl Hickman, Grant Mitchell as the caretaker of a most unusual (almost commune-like) Department of Agriculture facility, Ford company regular Ward Bond as a policeman, Selmer Jackson, Charles Middleton, Paul Guilfoyle as an agitator, Cliff Clark, Joe Sawyer, Frank Faylen, and Irving Bacon.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great film that does justice to the novel,"When I say this I don't mean in the sense of how accurately the film follows Steinbeck's novel; the film starts to stray from the books story around halfway through the movie. What I mean is the film is great on it's own and ,unlike most film adaptations of books, this movie kept most of the others message intact. The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff. I just think keeping to Steinbeck's original ending would have instilled to much ill feelings in Americans in a time where we needed some optimism. So great film, don't watch it though if you can't handle a little despair though.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Family on  Wheels.,"The amazing director John Ford won Oscar for this movie. All his films are beautifully and carefully made masterpieces.This movie is about a man called Tom Joad. He is back from the prison expecting to rejoin his family. But, as he reaches the village, it was totally washed out. He finds out where his family is. But, they were getting ready to migrate from there too. He joins them. The whole family including pregnant woman, old people and kids are on the movie. Wherever they go, they had to keep moving due to one reason or the other.A heart touching movie. Very well made.A must watch. Highly recommended.#KiduMovie",9.0,Anonymous,History
Steinbeck's masterpiece,"This is a great movie with an epic story that is ultra realistic to issues people faced during the time period depicted. The cinematography is astonishing especially for a 1940 film and really helps set the mood of each scene. Tom Joad's journey is a captivating adventure, the struggles him and his family face throughout the film and the hardships overcome made me appreciative all the things I'm blessed with. When originally released I can imagine this film had a strong impact on American society because during the great depression many families had gone through similar situation and could relate. Strong acting done by Henry Fonda really helps to create a strong emotional bond to the characters. John Ford definitely did not disappoint in his adaptation of Steinbeck's most powerful story, truly a thought provoking perception on American life around the time of the great depression. A must see for anyone who enjoys classic masterpieces",8.0,Anonymous,History
great,"Having read and loved the book, I was a little apprehensive about watching this. I didn't want it to not meet my expectations. However, it went above and beyond them. The movie really painted a clear picture of everything the book was trying to say. The adaptation from book to film was a work of art in itself. It has such a powerful social message that is really hit home through the way it is directed and the way the actors worked together. Also, I felt that the cinematographer of the film did a wonderful job at capturing the fields and open skies of Oklahoma. The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most realistic and captivating films that I have seen and definitely left me in awe, and thinking about the issues it presented.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wraith of grapes,"This was an interesting movie. One thing from this movie that I didn't like was the old cinematography. The only thing I liked was how the family, no matter what they went through, stayed together through they're troubles, and the way it depicted the way life was like during the great depression, and showcased some of the things that people went through just to live and survive when unemployment was at a rate of 25%, like people losing their land, farms, and houses and having to find somewhere else to live or move to a different state and start their lives over, and some couldn't finds another home or ob and was left homeless.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Overrated with flawed performances, but an overall effective adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel","John Steinbeck's novel, ""The Grapes of Wrath"", was originally published in 1939 and turned out to be both highly acclaimed and highly controversial. This film adaptation was released the year after the book and was also a success. Today, both the book and the movie are still hailed as classics. I recently finished reading the lengthy novel with the intention of watching this 1940 adaptation soon afterwards. Aware of its general reception, I was expecting a great film, better than both of the adaptations of Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" I had seen (the 1939 and 1992 versions). My expectations were definitely not exactly met. As much as I'm sure many would disagree, I don't think it lives up to the source material. I was still impressed, however.In Depression-era Oklahoma, Tom Joad has just been released from prison. He was sentenced to seven years for killing a man in a drunken brawl, but has been let out on parole after four years. On his way back to his family's farm, he meets Casy, a former preacher he used to know, who has since lost his faith. Together, they go to the Joad farm to find that it has been abandoned. Muley, a former neighbour, comes along and tells the two of them about the dust storms and how they have led to the eviction of farming families from their land! The Joads are now at Uncle John's place, and will soon be leaving for California, just like so many other farming families in the Dust Bowl are doing, including Muley's, but he refuses to leave Oklahoma. The next day, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's farm, so Tom is reunited with his family (his parents, grandparents, siblings, and uncle). The Joads then begin their journey to California to search for employment, and take the former preacher with them on their truck. However, their destination may not be what they are expecting.Since I was expecting this to be a great film, I was expecting great acting, but unfortunately, I didn't see much of that. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is a memorable but flawed one, and this is clear from the scene where he first talks. Most of the other cast performances can probably be described the same way. Most of them aren't exactly bad, but Dorris Bowdon's performance as Rose of Sharon can be fairly poor, and the way Shirley Mills (Ruthie) says her lines can also be bad. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for the role of Ma Joad in this film, and her performance is probably better than most of the others here. There were times when I wasn't quite as moved as I felt I should have been, especially around the beginning, such as the part where Muley talks about losing his land. It just didn't seem convincing enough to me. However, I did find some parts more moving, especially later on, and found that maybe it got more intriguing after the Joads' arrival in California. For the most part, the film did hold my interest, with the story and the cinematography, though I also found that it ended too soon, leaving out too much of the novel, even though the movie is just over two hours long.After reading John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, it seemed to me that an excellent movie certainly could have been made out of it, and was convinced that this widely watched adaptation was it, but while many definitely think it is, I think it's overrated. However, overall, it is a good drama. Obviously, there are some differences between the novel and this adaptation. For much of the film, it closely follows the book (though obviously not everything is included), but takes more liberties later on. Also, some parts of the book obviously couldn't have been done in Hollywood in 1940, including the ending. This was long before the fall of Hays Code. Still, despite the differences, I would say this adaptation of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is worth watching if you like the book (or maybe if you haven't read the book but like movies from this era), though you obviously COULD find yourself somewhat disappointed, maybe even severely disappointed, even if most people who have seen it haven't been disappointed at all.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A man can never be completely defeated.,"THE GRAPES OF WRATH is a moving social drama and excellent adaptation of the famous novel by American writer John Steinbeck. At the heart of the story are a young farmer and his family who lost their property during the Great Depression. Like other people with whom they share the same fate they went to the West in search of work and a new life.Paradoxically, the film has a strong working ""left-wing"" message directed by the controversial ""right-wing"". Apart from the obvious failures at the end of the film Ford did a great job. People usually find happiness in the small things, and when these little things they lose with them is lost the meaning of life.Ideology is the journey and searching. Job, existence and life.Henry Fonda as Tom Joad is young and rebellious farmer's son who becomes so to speak organizer social unrest. His knowledge of the link between the two classes. He committed two murders, but finally knows that his enemy is not the people but an ideology.Jane Darwell as Ma Joad It is a pillar of the family and probably the most powerful character in the film. In the most difficult situations, trying to keep the family together, although this is impossible. Women and mothers are adjusted when living and when survives.John Carradine as Jim Casy He a key character. A good man and a former priest who does not know, but he's trying to learn. Sometimes you need to lie down on an empty stomach, but keep what little dignity.The film is an impressive atmosphere that perfectly describes the hard life, and loyal, almost documentary account of the relationships between people, with a discreet, but clearly proclaiming the idea of love and solidarity among the little people.

Little Pieces of One Big Soul,"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the two films I can thank for my love of classic movies. When I was a kid I had enjoyed a few older films. Mostly stuff like The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life that I had been weaned on from an early age. But, like most kids, I was far more into the movies of my time. I viewed most older movies, especially black & white ones, with a degree of contempt. However, that changed when I was fourteen. That summer I checked out two older movies on VHS from my local library. I had heard a lot about one of these movies being called ""the greatest movie of all time"" and the other I knew was based on a book that fourteen year-old me just wasn't about to voluntarily read (although I did read it years later). So I took them both home and watched them back to back, glued to the screen the whole time. The two films were Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath and I was in love with classic movies from that point on. Interestingly enough, both films had legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland working on them.The Grapes of Wrath is a beautiful, haunting masterpiece from director John Ford, who deservedly won an Oscar. Nunnally Johnson's script brings John Steinbeck's novel to life but gives it a more optimistic finish. The cast is extraordinary, with Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell giving exemplary performances. It's a classic film in every sense of the word. To say I recommend it wouldn't be strong enough. This is just one of those films you HAVE to see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""OOOOOOOKlahoma, where the wind comes sweeping down the plain!""","The Grapes Of Wrath (1940) -It was difficult to watch and review a film like this over 80 years after it was made, because there was no way that my feelings towards it were going to be anywhere near what those watching in 1940 would have experienced.So much time has passed since the Great Depression, that the era almost seemed unreal to me. It's hard to imagine these historic events, having not gone through them and while 'Stranger Things' (2016-) and 'The Breakfast Club' (1985) were accessible to me, because I lived through the 80's, the older time periods feel like something that happened to someone else, in that awful and selfish way like ""Why should I care?"".And that's not what I mean, of course and I would obviously have cared then, but it was a struggle to recognise the family and the issues depicted here in a time 100 years ago and a place and situation that I've never been in.Even living in the current dystopian environment that I am, with a new Prime Minister every morning and energy bills higher than my pay cheque, those harsher times were really tough to associate with and the reaction seemingly so extreme.If this film was remade today and utilised all of the tricks that have been learned over those passing years and the best actors that are available, I believe that it could really emote something, but sadly, while the production values, Etc, were very good for the time and I would say that the director and editor both did their jobs well, it was ""Of it's time"".I felt detached from it in the same way I was when watching 'Ben-Hur' (1959) and 'Braveheart' (1995). It just seemed too far passed.That doesn't mean that the story wasn't interesting to watch and perversely enjoyable, because of course I didn't enjoy the pain and suffering that they all endured, but the tale was a good one and worth telling.I've never really enjoyed performances by Henry Fonda, except perhaps in 'On Golden Pond' (1981) and 'The Ox-Bow Incident' (1942) and he wasn't really that outstanding as Tom Joad. The role was very typical of many others I've seen from him, but he lead the story well along with Jane Darwell, who played his mother, Ma Joad. The others were all variously capable in their performances, some that should never have got work again and others that could have been showcased more. There were some characters that I would have liked to have seen more of, his sister, Rosasharn for instance, who I believe needed more coverage, especially as the film developed and Jim Casy, whose story might have been just as intriguing.At times I found the soundtrack was a bit jolly for the content, but I felt that the other filmic content such as the sets, locations and props, were all very apt, although the truck that they drove in scared the Bejesus out of me when there was a camber to the road.I think that this film probably features on a couple of the Top Film lists, because the story was and still is so good and maybe back in 1940 it was made the best way it could be. It really wasn't a bad film and it was well paced, but other than the story, nothing else stood out for me if I was looking to hand out awards.It was definitely a story with a lesson to be learned however, but too far in the past for me to connect with. The present is upsetting enough as it is and who knew that ""The Depression"" was so, ya know, depressing?I need more romantic comedies to watch, because this type of film is killing me with their anxieties and tensions.I would recommend it though.517.49/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Depressing,"This movie was good, but my attention span is really low so it was hard for me to really enjoy it due to the pace.

And it's very interesting how the actors actually live through this time so I think that allowed them to play their characters so well.

"Impressive, but Longggggg","""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a very powerful movie indeed. This film shows the truth of the Great Depression and what people really went through. The living conditions at all of the camps were for the most part unbearable. Rarely would there be running water or edible food. The effects of this movie were pretty realistic. Such as when Tom gets hit in the face, the makeup looks as though he was actually hit in the face.This movie was just too long for my taste. I feel as though a good portion of it could have been taken out, and we still would have received the message of the film. To me it did not make sense why Tom would be a former prisoner, and then in trouble with the cops.

Grapes?,"Grapes of Wrath is a movie based on and filmed in the great depression. It focuses on the ""dust bowl"" where okies had to move to California in search of jobs and work. The movie shows how they were treated and they do this very well. They show how they get kicked out of their land and they move through the levels of severity of the camps. While they do show the history part very well the entertainment aspect is lacking. They do the bare minimum to keep the audience focused and into the movie. If you took all the camps and historical facts out of the movie it would be a confusing and uninteresting mess. This movie has potential but if killing off someone every time it gets boring is the producers idea of keeping the audience entertained it is doomed. There just needs to be for life to the movie, more story, more laughs and enjoyment.

And it replaces the dark, apocalyptic ending with a tacked-on, feel-good bit of piffle.  This is no replacement for one of the most beautiful and important American novels of all time.

Squinting into a sun blotted out by dust,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940): Author John Steinbeck approved this film version of his book, despite changes that needed to be made for censors, etc.. Set AND made in the Depression of the late 1930's, starting in Oklahoma, we follow a destitute and harassed family as they attempt to reach ""the land of milk and honey"" (California) for jobs. Their journey is the stuff of well, humans and their stories. The photography and lighting is some of the finest of all time. The story, unabashedly pro-Common Man - self-governing, self-policing, self-motivating  Unionizing  Socializing, if you will - is pure Great Depression. The hero isn't a god  God is within each of us  we are simply in a position to choose heroism. This is a large, sweeping, gritty, shadowy, rough film with tight lips and squinted eyes, bearing the pain and continuing on, stopping to mourn but not to abandon. It has its speeches, and they are glorious. The horizons are wide, though the moment is short. It is full of symbolism and yet remains personal. Only the most hardened or inexperienced or uneducated would see this film as somehow less than what comes from Hollywood now. And, for the first time, I am suggesting you see the DVD version with the running commentary by two experts, one on John Ford, one on John Steinbeck. THIS is worthwhile.",,Anonymous,History
Historically touching,"I found this film to be touching, not only because of the Joad family's unfortunate situation but because this really happened during the Great Depression and in some cases on a far worse level. It's a shame that the whole family started off with twelve members and at the end of the movie only ended up with seven or eight. I commemorate the overall spirit of the family for not giving up and working together to make ends meet and establish a life for themselves. During this time it was very bad for farmers because they were forced off their land with no other direction to go in. Many people died and starved and fought tooth and nail for even the smallest, short lasting job out there. What really makes this film touching and unique is the fact that this actually took place in history and it gave people some insight on how others were suffering and how to be kind and compassionate towards others. When the family stumbled upon the camp that was run by the Department of Agriculture it demonstrated the kindness and compassion that was needed in order for people to survive and make it through the next day. Having that ultimately unified the people into preventing a so called ""riot"" to take place at a local dance just as a excuse for the sheriffs to show up and ransack the place. Tom and mama's little speeches towards the end touched the heart of the audience and affirmed the idea that no matter how hard things get in life you should always keep going and do your best and never give up to live a happy and healthy life. Another thing to add regarding the form is that the camera angles were very pleasing for being an older movie because during exciting scenes, like when there was a fight or a chase taking place, the camera man did very well in following every movement and the different angles made it more exciting to watch and made the audience feel as if they were really there watching it. Overall this was a great film in my opinion because a.) I'm a sucker for historical films and b.) the plot is one that could never get old and ultimately would touch the heart of anyone watching it.",,Anonymous,History
"""I smell spare ribs. Somebody's been eatin' spare ribs. How come I ain't got none?""","""The Grapes of Wrath"" probably could of been advertised as a documentary, had it not been for its narrative-style story-telling. The historical context of the movie's setting, characters, and conflict makes it seem like a genuine account of a farming family surviving after the Great Depression. At first, you're not sure if this will be a good movie, mostly because of the behaviors of Charley Grapewin and Zeffie Tilbury's characters, who come off as some sort of senile comic relief pair. Later on, however, you realize that the movie is shaped around the struggle this family encounters as they go West. Henry Fonda makes for an incredible lead role, mostly because of the fact that he's a criminal and the last thing you'd expect for him to act like a generic ""momma's boy."" It's his rebelliousness that also makes this character likable, seeing how we could of acted the same way if we were in his shoes. The dialogue is memorable, the shadows and sound effects really draw in the atmosphere of West, and the final speech(es) of the film tie everything together spectacularly. After watching this film, there's a cleansing feeling you get from seeing this film, as if all the worries of the world momentarily drained out in the past two hours.",,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"I thought the Grapes of Wrath was a genuinely good movie, It was my first time seeing it, and now I know why it is such a highly held classic. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous I noticed. Great use of the camera, especially with shadows, and different textures and degrees of light. The movie was not hard to follow at all, but held my attention easily. I think that is partly because this really happened to people. You could feel the Joad's pain.

There is so much doubt in the film and on top of that doubt they are poor. Moving to California for a new life wasn't exactly working, but the film does show that family was the one thing they still had.I myself just saw this as a very sad story as others are but this is a first for me that a film with this kind of story doesn't give me an exact ending or make me think everything will be happy in the end.",,Anonymous,History

I don't think I would survive such an event in my life. I just couldn't get past the film. In some of the scenes the sounds were echo like and this bothered me. I did find some of the scenes interesting in retrospect. I like the scene where the children thought they broke the toilet and ran from the owner.

Tragically real,"The Grapes of Wrath is the film adaptation of the book which covers the story of an Oklahoma family living in the dust bowl during the Great Depression. This film plays no games when it comes to realism and does its best to render the heart wrenching plight of the Oakies as they suffered while traveling to California for work. The film is gritty and keeps to the reality of the tale as much as possible. The saddest thing though was the way that for all Tom's attempts at good, to reform, to help those in need, he is the one who causes the family to struggle the most as his very presence is a source of constant problem. This movie serves as a reminder of the struggles faced by farmed during the Great Depression and the challenge of how anyone let alone this family could possibly survive through it.",,Anonymous,History

awesome film,"The film Grape of Wrath was shot in 1940. It is a film based off the novel by writer John Steinbeck. Right away just from knowing what the film was based off of. I'm a fan of John Stinebeck other works. So naturally I was excited to see this film. The film takes place during the great depression which was a time of hardship with little employment. This is a story of a family and friend's journey from Oklahoma to California in search of work and a new way of life. Watching the film I felt sad, seeing the condition due to the depression. The film gave views great insight to life during the depression, and the hardship faced by the people who had to live and make through it. How the conditions were so bad at this time that this group of people had to leave their homes, for one evening violating parole, to find a place when they could work and survive. I also was sad because of the misfortunes of the group traveling. The grape of wrath is a film that has great actors who play their parts well. They are believable. This is a film of realism. It's done so well that it's not only believable the viewers could see this film as an actual even that occur during that time in history. As far as the quality of the film's production go. It's fantastic. The scenes are admiral. Lighting is perfect. And the cast is exceptional.",,Anonymous,History
The Grapes of Wrath,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" is a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel of the same name. It tells the story of the Joad family trying to make their to California while trying to survive the harsh conditions of the Great Depression. The movie was very political in the sense that it made many references to left sided politics, especially when the preacher, Jim Casey, mentions that he is turning to Communism. Because of this, the movie received a little negative criticism. The movie won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Directer, as well as nominated for Best Actor, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, Best Sound Recording, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",,Anonymous,History
A warming story of family struggles...,"Grapes of Wrath was a warming film of family overcoming struggles together, and making ends meet. Henry Fonda plays a compassionate ex-con, on parole, who goes west hoping for a better life with his family. The Joad family faces its good share of struggles. First being kicked out of their house because of the government, then moving out of a camp because it's going to be burned, and going form location to location looking for work and money, to simply put food on the table. Yet through all the struggles, the family sticks together, and somehow makes it through. Despite Henry Fonda, Tom, leaving in the end, their is hope for the family.The film carries a strong message of family love and is wonderfully directed and acted. Fonda's expressions, eyes, and acting are perfect along with Jane Darwell as Mama Joad, who holds the family together and keeps the family's hope alive. It is filmed well with good use of lighting and shadows to create a masterpiece.",,Anonymous,History
Are we seeing the future?,"I strongly encourage everyone out there to view this brilliant film. Though episodic and with the usual Steinbeck plotting weakness, the courage it took Zanuck, Ford, and Johnson to make this statement is astounding considering it came from Hollywood 1940. It goes from grim to grimmer with an honesty that is almost unbearable. In an age when our shallowest vanities are catered to, from designer coffee to nail salons, the film is a seminal reminder of what was and looks like will be again. One note of humor I appreciated: the head of the immaculate ""social engineering camp"" was made to resemble FDR. I can't but wonder -- is this the future as well as the past?",,Anonymous,History
The Great Grapes of Wrath,What an amazing film. Not much more can be said about the movie. I am an addict to when it comes to The Great Depression. I am in love with the history about it. To know that this movie was based on the family problems during that time mad it so much more interesting to watch. This was a great film and I'd watch it over and over again. The storyline to this film was beautiful. The focus on the main characters made the vision of the director and writers' thoughts so much more vivid. The way the camera-work was highly intriguing. The black and white aspect of it made no difference for the simple fact that history was being told instead of watching a movie/being entertained by a film. Masterpiece.,,Anonymous,History
Appreciated the Cinematography!,"The Grapes of Wrath (1940) is definitely a well put together film that reflects a wide range of emotions including sadness and anger, which were commonly expressed during the Great Drepression, as well as hope. The camera seemed able to capture all of these emotions in the empty surroundings that showed the barren land, and in the haunted looks of the characters as they faced a hardship that too many real people faced in the Great Depression. I liked how the cinematography showed the empty spaces in several shots while also focusing on the individual silhouettes outlined in between the empty space. I thought this technique showed people as dark ""shadows"" on the screen, pointing out the fact that they were shadows of who they used to be.",,Anonymous,History
Very Slow Film,"""The Grapes of Wrath"" as a film was very similar to the novel in one unfortunate way, it was very slow to develop. It is the story of the Joad family in the dust bowl of the western United States, during the Great Depression of the 1930's. The Joad's are destitute and heading west in hopes of finding a better life. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad was the lone bright spot in this film. The plot was very slow and deliberate, by design. The film is meant to portray a struggle, and the fight against hopelessness, which it does well, unfortunately it does it at the expense of keeping the interest of the viewer. The sad, drawn out tale is, plainly put, not very interesting or fun to watch. As a documentary it would have worked by telling such a fine story, but as a film that is meant to entertain an audience it fell flat on its face. Watching this film felt like work more than entertainment, and although it may be understandable because of the subject matter, the end result is a film that is not enjoyable.",,Anonymous,History
Grapes of wrath,This movie was a movie that was just made when more lighting technology came to the scenes. I think the movie did a great with the lighting. The lighting of the movies had a lot to do with what you can see and bring the movie to life. I thought they did a pretty good job with this because I saw with the lighting it brought out more of the actors. It lighting also made it easy to tell time was passing because they lights would get lighter and darker. I felt that this movies actors also played there roles pretty well because if I had my house being taken from me I believe I would have acted just like sum of the people and fight for my land. While others just would go and move just like I can see people in real life doing. All these things brought the movie to life and did a great job making the movie realistic.,,Anonymous,History
