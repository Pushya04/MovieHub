Director's Cut review - an originally disappointing film reborn into something worthwhile,"The studio executives who ruined the first release version of this film in 1998 have a lot to answer for, but the director has had the last word and proved he was right all along, with the new Director's Cut (which I saw at the Sydney Film Festival tonight), which is an ENTIRELY different and improved experience. From now on, I don't think there should be any reason for anyone to watch the original release version again, the improvement is that dramatic. The one aspect that may irritate some viewers is that a few of the 'new' scenes have slightly lower image & sound quality than the rest of the film, as they obviously weren't able to find perfect quality footage for every restored scene, and the editing between some scenes doesn't always feel entirely smooth. And some weaknesses in the film still remain - such as Ryan Philippe, who is a bit limp despite being more than pretty enough for the role. But in so many other ways this is a far far better film, taking a film I'd only have rated maybe a 4 in the past, to at least a 7 now. About 40% of the film feels entirely changed, all for the better. There's a lot more life to the nights at the club, now that they've been able to put back the sex & drugs the studio removed (no movie about 1980-era disco makes any sense once you remove them). The parties are wild and bisexual and very disco. And the whole direction of the drama has been altered, now that the dull studio-imposed romance with Neve Campbell has been removed. Neve is still there in a small role, but the film now focuses on Ryan's love triangle with Salma Hayek & Breckin Meyer instead, which is far more interesting. Everyone who worked on the film should be happy with the Director's Cut, which proves they were making something pretty decent (until the studio stuffed it up).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a good movie!  What was the problem?,"Why the poor box office performance?  Why the bad reviews?  Why the bad word of mouth?  I really didn't see anything horrible about this movie!  First of all, it's a character-driven story.  There's little subplots involving jealousy and philandering, but it's not handled in a soapy fashion.  I didn't feel any of the characters were one-dimensional.Of course, Mike Myers steals the show as the homosexual club owner Steve Rubell.  I don't know the real Steve Rubell, so you be the judge whether or not his performance was accurate, but I have to say that Myers did an incredible job!  And I'm not overstating the least bit!  You watch him in this movie and you totally forget that this is the same guy who played Austin Powers.  Not to say I didn't realize Myers had talent prior to watching this film.  He has definitely proven that he has talent as a comic actor, but I didn't know he had the chops to pull off a straight, dramatic role.  Even his accent sounds real, not the least bit phony.  I'm surprised Myers didn't even get an Oscar nod.  He should've at least gotten the nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  Trust me--you will be blown away by his performance in this movie!The music is great.  It's always great to reminisce to the great songs from the seventies.  Mark  Christopher nicely captured the whole rebellious atmosphere of 54.  We're given a taste of the drug addiction and even the sexual promiscuity that made the place famous--there's a scene where a couple shamelessly pounds away on the balcony.  I read one person's review, saying that this movie should've been an hour longer.  I find it ironic that people watch movies that are two and a half to three hours long and complain, ""Oh, this movie dragged!  Oh, this movie needed more editing!"" Yet they watch a succintly timed film like this and complain it's too short. This may not have been the most thorough examination of the famous nightclub, but I think it got to the point.  No reason why we have to go into every tiny detail.This is a serious, dramatic film but it's also very entertaining.  I actually had a smile on my face when the movie ended.  It ended on a happy note without having that forced, schmaltzy Hollywood feel.  Plus, I really like that song ""Knock on Wood"" that they played over the credits.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
For the Director's cut only...,"The director's cut is much more interesting, definitely.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly well done.,"One does not usually expect a popular movie to be much good, namely because it caters to the tastes of a crowd, which are notoriously un-demanding. Rarely, however, one finds a film which delivers on its promises.  This, fortunately, was one of these films. The acting was the high point of the film.  Mike Myers wore his role like a skin, naturally and easily.  Ryan Phillippe proved that despite occasional bursts of negative popular opinion he is more than a simple dime-a-dozen pretty boy, and possesses both skill and talent, both of which are put to good use.  (And he is good looking, which despite all else, never hurts. But, let's not belabor the obvious).  The filming was excellently done, with a good eye towards shock and an occasional shot of strangely unexpected beauty. The only real objection one could put to this film is that it was far too short.  Several sub-plots came up which were either abandoned or underdeveloped, and the ending, while highly effective, had a slight air of ""deus ex machina"" about it.  On the whole, though, a talented, unusually intelligent film with excellent actors and direction.  Well worth watching.",,Anonymous,Music
Playground of the elite,"Once upon a time in the not too distant past a man named Steve Rubell who to look at in this film and in real life was not all that much decided to create a playground where only the elite could participate. Two criteria decided who was among the elite, power and beauty. Rubell courted the powerful and selected only the beautiful. He created Studio 54 on West 54 Street in Manhattan and people would beg to be admitted. I was actually in the place once, not on charm, beauty, or personality mind you, but for a political fundraiser when it was rented out.One who got in on sheer beauty in this film was New Jersey kid Ryan Phillippe and it is through his eyes that the story of 54 unfolds. And we see Mike Myers as Steve Rubell who reveled in the company of the powerful and beautiful, indulged in all the vices, and stole from his own business like the wise guys in Goodfellas used to rob the cargo shipments at JFK Airport like it was an ATM. Missing from the story is his partner Ian Schrager, still very much with us, still very much a power player. It's for that reason he is missing, but it renders 54 inaccurate from the start.Phillippe has no problem using his looks and body to get all the sex he wants and to advance himself and establish. It's the main lesson he learns from Myers. What he sees as an ultimate goal in life, is something in the end he rejects.Myers is fascinating and repellent at the same time. You've got to wonder why people would curry favors from this man, but in point of fact it happened. You know where he's headed and 54 makes you want to see him fall, at the same time you wish you could be part of the 54 scene.Selma Hayek and Breckin Mayer play a couple who work at 54, a married couple who take Phillippe in. The hedonist atmosphere puts a strain on their marriage like few others are tested. Also Neve Campbell, a soap actress who is from New Jersey like Phillippe is also an ambitious woman who teaches Phillippe a thing or two. They all register well.In the end though 54 is in the joint custody of both Ryan Phillippe and Mike Myers. This was Phillippe's breakthrough part and Myers is not in this role a part of Wayne's World or Austin Powers. No this is the story of a self indulgent man who had a heady ride and a tremendous fall.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
So underappreciated,"This movie is a gem.
If you can get your hands on the Directors Cut, do it! It's brilliant, and you can see what the film was meant to be.
I made my own edit with the Directors cut, and I added all the additional Neve Campbell scenes they filmed for the theatrical version.All in all, I think it's a great look at what the 54 nightclub must have been like. But seriously, get the Directors cut.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Superficial and awkward, but with a pleasurable, hedonistic nostalgia...","Writer-director Mark Christopher worked hard at recreating the sinfully decadent magic of Manhattan's Studio 54, the number-one celebrity hangout from the late-1970s into the 1980s, but he skimped on the most intriguing part of the nightclub's history: the relationship between business partners Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager. Mike Myers was a terrific choice for the flamboyant, eccentric Rubell, but Schrager has gone missing. Instead, the story is told from the point-of-view of a busboy-turned-bartender (!), a muscular rube whose innocence is soiled by boss Rubell's dirty business dealings and hedonistic trappings. The film has a low-budget feel which doesn't make itself present in the production so much as in the character-driven scenes, which are underpopulated, padded with real and faked black-and-photos, and further undermined by stilted dialogue. Ryan Phillipe is well-cast as the young stud from New Jersey whom Rubell takes under his wing, yet his voice-over narration is uncomfortably omnipresent, telling us things we can see or perceive for ourselves, and the interrelationships between the club staff are uninteresting. Some of the music is good, bringing back those long-ago nights of carefree sex and dancing-the-night-away, but Christopher doesn't grasp the big picture. As a result, the film (at best) is a series of precious little moments struggling to surface. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Cmon down to 54,"I liked this movie, it's not a 10 but certainly not a bad picture. I do agree that the focus should have been more on the happenings of the club itself but this happens a lot in true life stories turned into movies. Actually the movie could have been a lot worse.I think they did a reasonably good job, though not an exceptional one, of capturing the Glitz, glamor and mystery of the greatest nightclub in the world. You feel the appropriate sense of loss at the end of the movie and wish you had been there. I know I did. The NYC club scene is still alive and kicking but no other club will probably ever be as notorious as 54. I was really shocked this movie didn't do better at the box office but though I liked it, I agree it had flaws. The movie while capturing the atmosphere and time period strongly, and making one curious about Studio 54 and maybe wishing they'd gone at least once, didn't succeed in making the club's allure irresistible and the movie compellingly unforgettable and an instant classic as it should have, because all the tools were there for an unforgettable film.The movie should also have been MUCH LONGER. It still turned out much better then it could have though and is most definitely entertaining. I thought it was MUCH better then The last days of disco which I thought was horrible. I'd give it a 7 or 7.5 of 10 for the movie making, 8 of 10 for personal enjoyment though I'd really like to have seen this be a 10 all around, in the way of a ""Boogie Nights."" Still worth seeing though.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"This Ain't No Party, This Ain't No Disco, This Ain't No Fooling Around","Beautiful teenager Ryan Phillippe (as Shane O'Shea) is tired of cruising New Jersey with his plain boyfriends, and aches to go to Manhattan's famous ""Studio 54"" disco. There, he hopes to meet his idol, soap opera star Neve Campbell (as Julie Black). Taking off his shirt for ""54"" manager Mike Myers (as Steve Rubell) helps Mr. Phillippe gain admittance to the club.

Poor Film,"54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era. It features the classic good-looking bartender. The sexy females. The high powered owner. The partying. When all entwined together chaos ensues, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be at the brunt of it all.I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible, whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments (like, it's an 'ok' film). I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast. Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek, I am always awaiting to see her beauty, radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance, but, reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is. I mean, really, what has she ever bequeathed the masses with, other than her immense table dance in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting'. Mike Myers, isn't quite as bad as these 2, he does at least give the Film something worthy. Playing the seedy, extroverted co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that the majority watching would hate (i.e. job well done), he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick. But alas, it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness. Most 'bad' bad films I find something to take from the film, but this has nothing to it, really. Neve Campbell isn't too bad, but she is just 'there'. The storyline is dull, it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else. Any meaning. Any class. Anything at all. Because like most ornaments, they are just hollow pointless objects, that are merely pretty to look at, much akin to the basis of this disastrous film.Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting, like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great movie,"It's unknown to me why this movie got such a bad review from critics. There are alot of factual errors about the club, yes. But this seemed to be a great movie. Mike Myers was an excellent pick for Steve Rubell, he had the same personality as Rubell in the movie.Another thing is the story is so interesting about Studio 54, it was a fad, hip, and unusual place for it's time. Not only that, the story of the controversial club is one that really is unknown to some.The story might not be dead on accurate, and some of the characters might be factual, and there could be alot of mistakes in the movie, but it's still a great one to watch when you get past it.I would suggest watching VH-1's Behind The Music on Studio 54 first before seeing the movie, for a clear understanding on the club. That way you don't get freaked out.",,Anonymous,Music
Infernal Disco,"The irony that my 54th review should be on this film....As a big fan of Salma Hayek I had a long wait for '54', one of a slew of late 1990's projects that examined the decadent and excessive 1970s club scene. If Boogie Nights (a personal favourite of mine) set the pace, what could I expect from a high powered cast of (mostly) then favourites and a young director who was considered to be in the rise?Truth be told, I found 54 something of a frustrating experience. This ought to have been a powerhouse drama, with a dream back story, and an equally able cast. Yet it never really ignites the way it ought to have done. Firstly, there was not enough focus on Mike Meyers's ruthless, materialistic club svengali. It was a pity that Meyers never sought to build on this dramatic success, instead opting to spend the remainder of the decade in misfiring comedies (Austin Powers excepted); had 54 concentrated on the relationship with an effective Ryan Philippe - tailor made for a pretty boy reliant on looks and shallow charm- then this might have been a different film. Phillippe manages to a fair job here, but cannot quite make the effort required to stamp himself on proceedings.Instead, there's too much emphasis on a tepid 'love triangle' between the underwritten Salma Hayek (who later disowned the role - nothing particularly wrong with her effort but see above), and a hopeless Breckin Meyer. Meyer's hapless everyman routine is fine in the likes of Road Trip or Rat Race, but he totally lacks either looks, charisma or credibility that his role demands. Neve Campbell puts in little more than a glofied cameo; sorry to say, but almost anyone could have played her part.I'm not being overly harsh or unfair. This is not a disaster by any stretch of the imagination, but I honestly felt that it could have been better. It makes a fair stab in terms of atmosphere and pathos, but I just felt it was lacking in certain areas where the likes of Boogie Nights, Go or even Party Monster succeeded. I understand that there's cut footage/deleted scenes out that there that may have made a major impact on the storyline - perhaps the kind of impact that Mark Christopher, Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillipe intended (perhaps). Until this material is properly assessed, I'm only reluctantly willing to endorse 54. A bit like that party you were looking forward to going to. You know, the one that never quite got started?",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty good movie,"When I went to this movie, I went with the feeling ""it probably is a movie kind a like Saturday Night Fever"". Well, I was pretty right. Most of the actors did a good job, but I thought Philippe (Shane) wasn't that great. Mike Myers, au contraire, played one of his best roles. The film gives a more than average view about studio 54. The film isn't as far as great as Boogie Nights, but that's because this is a slightly different movie. The best scenes of this movie were to me Steve Rubell rolling in his own money totally stoned and of the world (a very vulgar scene). The last scene where you see Steve Rubell on the stage looking over the dancing people and you can see in his eyes that the party was over, that was a great scene. My final remark, a pretty enjoyable movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not freedom,"Elite nightclubs are all about hedonism and the power of the young, rich, and beautiful; places where a rigid hierarchy holds sway, albeit an alternative one. One may understand why those in the in-crowd may enjoy such places; but to suggest that they symbolise ""freedom"" is a rather strange interpretation. But every Hollywood film has to pay homage to this virtue, however still defined, and so '54', Mark Christopher's film about a once-fashionable New York venue, tries to suggest there was something idealistic about the place, in spite of the fact there seem few ideals on view. To strengthen this rather weak idea, his script casts lead actor Ryan Phillipe as a young Adonis, who is far too sweet to serve as a useful vehicle into the dark side of this underworld; but he tells us there was something mystical about the place, and as the audience, we're expected to believe him, although all we see are a lot of dancing, drug-taking, and sex. Which might not be unbelievable, but is hardly unique. Meanwhile, the film's plot goes nowhere and even seems to bottle out of it's own natural climax. The real Studio 54 might indeed have been where it was all happening; but this gentle homage is really very bland.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining enough but better to stick with the cd.,"A look down the cast list of Mark Christopher's ""54"" might provide a few surprises. Yes, before he decided he wanted to be the King of the World Donald Trump turned up as a patron as did Michael York, Sheryl Crow, Cindy Crawford, Heidi Klum, Art Garfunkel and Peter Bogdanovitch but I wouldn't waste my time trying to pick them out of the darkness. The film is a 'biography' of New York's famous Studio 54 as seen through the eyes of hot young busboy Ryan Phillippe, (he spends most of the film with his shirt off). Michael Myers is Steve Rubell, the club's manager and the cast also includes Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse's"" Dawn Wiener herself, Heather Matarazzo. It's not much of a movie; it's mostly like a sex obsessed music video but the music's great which makes up for a lot and it does capture the hedonistic, drug-fuelled atmosphere of the place while Myers is surprisingly good, Still, maybe you would be better off buying the double cd instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
So disappointed..,"This is the second worst, and most disappointing film I've seen this year. With such a great potential given the history of the club, it's well know patrons, and the endless possibility of storylines, the film is wasted on ficticious characters and their moronic, boring storylines. I knew the that the film was bad, when the only references to real people were those who were deceased (Steve Rubel, Andy Warhol, Truman Capote).  My guess that every person associated with the movie still living threatened to sue if the were portrayed. Forget this movie, and catch the ""Behind the Music"" documentary of Studio 54 on VH1.  It is much, much better.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
54 A look back,54 is the story of the famed New York night club by the same name. The movie was OK at best. The main problem is that the characters do not live up to the excitement of the famed club.The story revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillipee) WHO is a Jersey boy and lands a job at the club. He is soon promoted by Steve (Mike Meyers). I have a problem with this for what boss promotes someone to bar tender with no previous experience. Well Steve is skimming money from the till to hide it from it from the IRS. In the mean time Anita who works in the coat check (Selma Hyak) is aspiring to be a singer.While Meyers gives a very good understated performance as Steve the rest of the characters are only marginally interesting. So the movie just kind of winds down to the eventual conclusion. Making this a rather forgetful movie experience.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Could have been much better,"""54"" is a film based on the infamous ""Studio 54"" of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982.The film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance. It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like ""Boogie Nights"" but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe. Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell. It's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time, it's a total failure.""54"" could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging.

One Big Party Until You Come Down From The High,"Studio 54 was a swift, colourful flick that showed us the true ins and outs of the seventies.  The only difference is that the writers remembered the seventies .. thus, they obviously didn't really live the seventies atmosphere to its fullest. Mr Ryan Phillippe, in my opinion, took on an enormous task in performing this role ... I mean who else could you get to wear tight clothing, push pills, make drinks, take sexual harassment from a male employer, and still look pretty?  Ms Campbell' purpose in this movie showed young girls that you can get somewhere with talent and not just looks.  Basically, the script was compelling, the acting was sought as half way and ended up getting three quarters ... so overall I say that this isn't that bad of a flick if you are looking for something out of the everyday norm.  I gave this movie a rating of a ""9"" because it is a personal favourite of mine, and the casting was one of the best combos, for my taste in movies.  - David Wills christian 11/01/99",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Club Movie,"54 is above the avearge with its recreation of the late 70s club scene in New York. The story of a New Jersey guy dreaming of the big city, and making it to the center of the sparkling night life is quite well done, with a good recreation of the athmosphere and some truth in the psychology of the characters.

"Burn, Baby, Burn, Disco Infernal","As you can see from my summary, I think this movie is pure hell.Perhaps author/director Mark Christopher might have made a decent movie had he been allowed to stick to his original ideas.  However, considering how contrived and threadbare the whole script as we see in the movie, I doubt this could have been anything close to a great movie.The director seems to have assembled the worst cast possible, or at least made sure that most of them gave their worst performance possible.  Ryan Phillipe proved in this movie that he is nothing more than something nice to look at.  If your idea of a great actor is one who looks great in tight jeans or short shorts and a tight tank top (not that using acting ability would ever matter), he's perfect in the role.His character is not a loveable one, but Phillipe doesn't even make us regard him in any matter.  He does not develop his character's thoughts or emotions.  He could have been a villian or some cocky bas**rd whom the audience loves to hate.  Yes, Phillipe was limited by a poor script, but I can't say he has ever excelled as an actor in any movie.Neve Campbell was also extremely dissappointing in her performance, in her battle with Phillipe for who could be the worst actor in the film.  Her performance is also uninvolved and bland.  She was better in the ""Scream"" movies and even ""Wild Things.""  She failed to show us why Phillipe's character would even possibly be infatuated with her.For the most part, the rest of the cast was also terrible.  Salma Hayek proved why I don't like her acting once again, and the stoner from ""Clueless"" was also rather bland.The ""dirty old lady"" bit is becoming too much of a bad Hollywood cliche these days.  I liked Ellen Dow's character the first time I saw it--in ""The Wedding Singer.""One great thing about ""54"" was Mike Myers' brilliant performance.  He really threw himself into the role, and proved that he, as a true actor, might be more gifted than we have previously given him credit.  He used the terrible script to his advantage, using the contrived, false dialogue to show the pathetic nature of his character.  I only hope that Peter Weir will cast him in a movie and do for him what he did for Robin Williams (Dead Poets Society) or Jim Carrey (The Truman Show).Perhaps if Mr. Christopher had the type of controll that Orson Welles had over ""Citizen Kane,"" he might have had a decent movie.

Not too shabby,"This is, by no means, going on my 1998 Top Ten list, but I'm willing to cut it some slack.

In this film he proved himself to be an actor, and a damn good one. Although I anxiously await the new Austin Powers flick, I hope that Myers keeps taking roles that force him to stretch his limits.",,Anonymous,Music
Ryan and the film overall is good.,"First off I would like to mention that I wasn't born until many years after 54 closed its doors. So, I don't really have anything to compare the film to. But despite of not knowing about the real club, I enjoyed the movie very much.Many people criticize '54' saying that it did a terrible job of depicting the actual club scene while others commend it for bringing the New York happening spot to life. All I know is that I love anything 60s and 70s so I obviously liked this film. The clothes are good, the music is better than today's and Studio 54 looked like THE place to be.The story line following a New Jersey nobody seems pretty simple. He hits New York, visits the club and in no time is the bartender. I thought that it was an excellent choice in casting Ryan Phillippe in the role of Shane O'Shea.Phillippe's role doesn't look like it needed a whole lot of work put into because once again, it is a simple picture of a young man set out to make something of himself. But he does his best nonetheless. O'Shea was created well. Another young actor I particularly like is Breckin Meyer. He did a very good acting job but there was something wrong with his character. Greg seemed as if he had a purpose there in the beginning but after a while he slowly moved into the darkness and just became someone who hooked Shane up with a place to stay. Salma Hayek seems to be a popular name now days. I must say that I'm not too interested in seeing her anything. I've seen her in one or two movies before seeing her in '54' and I still don't get why everybody likes her. Not good acting on her part. Neve Campbell who is definitely not one of my favorite actresses plays a minor role in this film but they make it seem like she's in the lead. I won't comment too much on her since she once again chose a bad character to act out. And Mike Myers who plays the club owner, Steve Rubell, probably does the best next to Ryan Phillippe. It's not that Myers is such a terrific actor, it's just that he didn't have any competition (sorry Breckin). But still he played out the role his best. The cast was pretty good overall.I thought that the re-creation of Studio 54 was very good. Again, I didn't know the real one but it looked so fantastic in there. Lights, dancing, music, it seemed as if the people had it made. The score for the movie wasn't anything too too great. The music was good, don't get me wrong, but I've heard better.So, the story line following O'Shea was good. The acting was mixed with some good some bad. The writing was decent and the script as a whole was one of the better ones. See this even if you aren't familiar with the club itself. '54' gives a pretty good idea of what went on and how it finally came to an end.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Tedious Drama has a few nice touches.,"I really wanted to like this film, mainly because Neve Campbell was in it, but I couldn't. This was long, episodic and boring. The script was unimaginative and the direction was uninspiring. The only impressive factors was the acting (especially by Mike Myers!) and the set design was spectacular. Though these can't make up for a shoddy script. Like most films, it was flawed from preproduction.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Director's cut,"I suppose this cut leaves the promise of a better film. But to be honest I still prefer the guilty pleasure cut that was released in theaters. Centering around a sexy young man played by Ryan Phillippe who discovers the famous club in its hey day and is sucked into the glamorous nightlife becoming a drawing attraction. This version goes a bit more into the dirty details and isn't shy about showing the gay goods. But although there are some solid bits here and there. The movie feels disconnected and confusing.

The beautiful people...the beautiful...,"Admittedly, I rented this movie to get a glimpse of Neve Campbell and Selma Hayek doing their stuff, and of course, I was disappointed.  While interesting from a sociological standpoint, this movie never really seemed to get going.  The narration that helped so much at the beginning mysteriously disappeared, and the only sense of closure was the death at the end.  This movie was pure eye candy, and not much of that.  I would have to agree also, with the other critics, that Neve Campbell is lucky if she didn't do her career a major disservice with this part.  She was stiff, which is partly due to the writing, but I saw nothing more than ""Party of Five"" with a somewhat better cast (although I'm not sure).  Enjoy the music  and the dance, because there ain't much more to this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
the last days of disco,"If you have a great home sound system and a big plasma TV then 54 can be a spectacular home experience. Unlike the real thing. STUDIO 54 as a disco scene is legendary but lemme tell ya, in Sydney in 1988-1994 we had the gigantic real thing: massive and spectacular dance parties (no NOT raves) but massive disco nights in a place that held 5000 people and staged Busby Berkeley sized massive dance entertainment. See any Kylie Minogue concert today to get a sense of we had for free at the time! They were called RAT parties and BACCHANALIA events. Often our own big disco clubs competed and it was massive and musical and a throb of wild night fun unlike anything I have seen in any movie anywhere. STUDIO 54 as a small movie version of what we know as gigantic and real in our own Australian lives and makes us look like Hollywood epic disco. What is in this film is quite puny and tacky compared to the real thing here. I thought the film was a good but could have been great disco drama. There has always been a call for a great BIG disco film or a dance party spectacular and Saturday NIGHT FEVER and 54 and even parts of WEST SIDE STORY about as close as we will get I guess. Ryan Phillippe is cute and Adonis and well cast as the pretty chipmunk bar boy, Brecken Myer believable in their NY suburban angst.... as is all the cast esp the girls Selma Hyack and gorgeous Neve Campbell...however the dialog at the end of the film where they reconcile is truly lame and lets the film down. I real life these characters would both end up as prostitutes. But it is Mike Myer pulling off another creepy performance (see CAT IN THE HAT for the other) that is the core of the film. Studio 54 as depicted in this almost-there setting looks like a stinky old cinema with nut-case clients and ghastly B grade celebrities. (Do The Time Warp, anyone?)I am glad I wasn't there for real as what happened here was real and astonishing. I hear there is a very sleazy and sexually explicit directors cut of 54 and that would be more to the mark as this is an almost-Disney version of what we can see had greater depths of nude depravity... all to a pulsating disco beat!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
dreaming with tears in my eyes,"From what I understand, Studio 54 was a place of excitement, sex, music, drugs, money, crime, celebrity, and high energy.  Amazingly, this movie misses EVERY ONE of those things.  Sure, there's some sex and drugs, but it's extremely tame.  The energy of this film is completely nonexistent - as is the humor and the sleaze.  Imagine if a good director told this tale (like Martin Scorsese or someone)!  There's a killer movie here.  Also let me say that Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek are NOT a believable couple, in no way imaginable.  I gave it a 3, but only because Neve Campbell is beautiful, Salma Hayek is sexy, and Sela Ward is hot.  I added a point because Mike Meyers rules.  It's kind of nice not seeing him be so happily goofy as in Austin Powers or Waynes World.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
And did what corporations always do...,"When ""54"" got released, many critics claimed that it was just another attempt to get into the '70s nostalgia that had swept the country. It's more than that. The movie shows New York's Studio 54, an unusual club where young people danced to disco and could meet celebrities, as seen through the eyes of employee Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe). At the end, he talks about, how after the government closed the place down, a corporation took it over and did what corporations always do: make the place safe and sterile. Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) built it up into a most unique hangout, and the corporation drained the life out of it.So don't trust the critics. This was a really good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining story about the famed 1970s New York nightclub,"54 (1998) D: Mark Christopher. Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Mike Myers, Sela Ward, Breckin Myer, Sherry Stringfield, Jay Goede. Uneven if entertaining story about the famed 1970s New York nightclub, as told through the eyes of a young bartender (Phillipe). The cinematography and set pieces are spectacular and the film really catches the look and feel of the late 1970s.

Never lives up to its potential...,"What could have been an intoxicating, unforgettable film is instead reduced so pretty people like Ryan Phillippe and Neve Campbell whining and posing. The REAL story of the REAL ""54"" is Steve Rubell and the shenanigans and illegal activities that took place in AND out of the club....as well as the entire disco era. Actually, aside from some great music from the period, the viewer doesn't get much of a feel for the late 70's. And frankly, it's a bit hard to because of the VERY 90's faces in the film. It would be okay if some of them could actually act...The only thing this film has going for it, besides the music, is a stellar, surprising performance from Mike Myers as Steve Rubell. The filmmakers blew their chance with this movie...the REAL story of Studio 54 with Mike Myers in the lead role would have made a phenomenal movie. Instead, we get a soap opera with bad acting and Myers reduced to a thankless supporting role. Overall, ""54"" isn't terrible and it does have it's moments. It is just very disappointing, because the REAL story would have been so much more fulfilling.",,Anonymous,Music
Empty...,"54 was one of the films of 1998 I-was-waiting-for.I'm still waiting...Give us the directors cut!!!Based on a couple of gay-theme shorts Mark Christopher did, Miramax hired him to write and direct what was supposed to be a realistic portrayal of the infamous NYC night club, Studio 54.According to people involved, Christopher did just that.  His film showed an unflinching view of the late '70s.  Sex, both gay and straight occupied much of the club, and the drugs ran rampant.  I don't know what his version contained, but it HAS to be better than what was released into theatres. The story, as it is now, revolves around Shane (Ryan Phillippe), a Jersey kid who ends up bussing at 54.  The movie focuses on is rise to the top, and then dramatic fall.  Mike Myers turns in one of his best performances of his career as club owner, Steve Rubel.  Ryan Phillippe, who usually has a limited acting ability, shows a glimmer of a great performance trying to break free.  And, as far as Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer and Salma Hayek, why were they in the movie again?  I can't quite figure it out.  Lord knows, the only reason Neve Campbell was there was to add another name to the marquee.54 as it is, is a mess.  Not much makes sense, and I didn't care whatsoever about any of the characters.  I didn't care because I never got a chance to. The editing is choppy, dialogue reeks of quick re-writes, and the movie is tamer than most stuff put out under the Disney label.  Hey, Miramax, remember The Crying Game?  Priest?  Kids?  You used to take chances with your films, and stood behind the filmmaker. Now it seems your interested solely in the 'ole mighty buck!54 had to have been the biggest letdown of the summer of '98 - and there were some pretty big let downs that summer.  I urge Miramax to let Christopher release the version he shot (at least on DVD), because as it is now, it's an embarrassment to all those involved, and to all of us who were first in line to witness this hatchet job.My Grade: C-",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Weak and Disjointed,"The story of Steve Rubel and of Studio 54 (the famous night spot of the elite on New York's 54th Street in an old ABC TV studio) is a facinating one which encapsulates much of the atmosphere of excess which characterized that era; this movie, ""54"" which purports to tell that story through the eyes of Shane, one of Rubel's employees, fails miserably in its attempt.  What we get instead is Reese Witherspoon's husband presented as a shiftless but handsome youth from Jersey City (a working class town directly across the Hudson River) yearning for the excitment of the ""Big City"" in a banal ""Cinderella"" tale.Mike Myers is brilliant as Steve Rubel, the club's creator, a drug swilling homosexual who likes to surround himself with pretty boys. Enter Mr. Witherspoon's ""Shane"" who catches Rubel's eye while trying to gain admittance one night into the fabled lair of the famous. Through some oblique family connection Shane is introduced to Rubel, and is offered a job as a busboy. So far, so good.At this point the film loses direction (perhaps literally) as instead of learning the secrets of what went on in the club- facinating bits about basement VIP rooms and drug pipelines only alluded to in passing, we are instead served up a lame story of Shane's attraction for a famous TV star and (Neve Campbell) who frequents the club, and an entngled relationship with Shane's fellow busboy's pretty wife (Miss Hayuk).Out of nowhere Shane is suddenly driving a Camero with custom plates and living the high life, but inexplicably is still living in a small apartment with his two fellow employees- and by the way, how a busboy and hatcheck girl could afford a two bedroom apartment in the City is just another careless detail in this sloppy mess.As many other have said, ""Boogie Nights"" does a much better job of conveying the mood and music of the period, and also tells a more interesting story of the characters involved, in frankly a very similar story.There was a good story to be told here, but we never can get past the door.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty pathetic,"Dull, boring story about the legendary Studio 54 and one of its owners, Steve Rubell (played by Mike Meyers).  It also deals with three other people played by Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek and Breckin Meyer.  What their names were, I don't remember...mostly because there's absolutely nothing going on here.Purportedly, the original version was much stronger--so strong with sex and drug use that it was threatened with an NC-17.  Then test audiences reacted VERY negatively to the extreme stuff (a gay kiss was completely cut out). What came out was a seriously watered down version of what might have been a good movie.  I HATE those stupid test audiences!!  I was actually in Studio 54 back in 1980--what I saw there was in NO way portrayed in the movie.  The drug use was out in the open and there were people (literally) having sex--gay and straight!  That's not shown here in any way.Phillippe (as the lead) was terrible.  He is handsome and muscular but has a blank face on all the time.  Hayek is good but given nothing to do.  Ditto with Meyer (who's VERY good).  Neve Campbell barely even registered.  Myers is (surprisingly) very good in a dramatic role.  The movie is ALMOST worth seeing for him.  Also there are a few good songs (especially ""If You Could Read My Mind"").But, basically, this movie is so light and inconseqential that I forgot about it the next day!  A waste.  See the E True Hollywood Story on this--that gives a much more accurate portrayal of the club itself.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The rise and fall of Studio 54,"Unfortunately, ""54"" could've been more effective. It's a good movie, but it didn't have any depth. I've always been interested in history, and lately I've been studying the 60's and 70's decades. They are actually very interesting. I have a bit of an interest in Studio 54. I knew there was a movie about it, so I rented, and it didn't really effect me like it should have. I think that's why the rating isn't that good. If you watch ""Casino"", you have the full effect of the rise and fall of the mob in Las Vegas. Scorcesse understood that, and Mark Christopher didn't seem to have a good grip on it. It was a well made film and the acting was fine. But, it could have been more effective. That's all I'm saying.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
My best friend loved this movie; so I rented it,"and agree with most of the negative reviews. In fairness, I tried to give the film a chance, and watched it more than once.It isn't really the cast that ruins the non-existent script (was this ad-lib?; seems to be). Although one embarrassingly amateurish scene with Neve Campbell trying to sound like a New Yorker; ""waitress a cup of cawfeeee...."" like a teenager would even get waited on with that attitude; more likely she would have the coffee thrown in her face! Directed by Mark Christopher, I will have to read his bio, I doubt he has spent much time living or working in NYC.The cast tries their best; Salma Hayek; Ryan Phillipe (although he is a bit too naive at first) Mike Myers does look like Rubell(horribly so) and Sela Ward is attractive and vacuous. We also see the usual inferences to Andy Warhol, Princess Grace, etc.The real problem is, why do we care?. The first thing any writer or director must do is capture the INTEREST of the audience. We cannot care about these empty, coke-snorting characters, because they are one-dimensional. Overall, that is not the fault of the actor. The writer and director should oversee what they are projecting; and whether it does or doesn't work. This doesn't.Even ""Boogie Nghts"" at least had Philip Seymour Hoffman, an excellent actor. Rent that film, don't bother to watch this.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
can this have really been the way?,"If this is a reasonably accurate representation of the actual goings-on in Studio 54 during that time, there are just a few things I'd like to say:(1) It should have been shut down LONG before the time it actually was, based on the outright illegal activites happening.

Studio Fifty Bore,"You would think that a movie about Studio 54 would focus on the life of Steve Rubel. But why make sense? This film is Boogie Nights meets disco. The stars are small time employees of Studio 54 who want to be famous but whose careers go nowhere. The film could have been about any famous disco club and it would not have changed the story very much.Boogie Nights did this story ten times better. In 54 the lives of our young struggling characters are not explored in any depth and the gaps in the story are huge. When a bus boy steals 10 thousand why isn't he fired? Instead Rubel's top financial assistant is fired for stealing the money but Rubel says later he knew she didn't do it. 54 seems to have half a script.As for the acting, the stars, Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer just don't carry the film. Hayek is often terrible with her Elvis sneer. Phillipe and Meyer can go back to TV and won't be missed. My advice to Neve Campbell; stay away from bombs like this. The decent performances by Mike Meyers and Sela Ward give a hint that with a good script, competent actors and the same interesting sets, there could have been a good film here.As Studio 54 plodded on, the dialogue became more ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh at the Rubel welcome back party with Hayek in a terrible wig and Mike Meyers waving at our nobody main characters who he couldn't see 100 feet away and whom the real Rubel wouldn't have remembered. But then the best part of Studio 54 happened. This stinker ended.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Brilliant, tragic, and most of all, fabulous.","Studio 54 was the center of a universe that revolved around sex, drugs, and a pantheon of ephemeral pop culture gods who presided over a world of decadence and music.  Long before the neanderthal ""disco sucks"" mob convinced the world to stop dancing, every possible indulgence was explored, and then surpassed, in clubs like this one across the country. Well, if there had been clubs like this, but there was only one 54.The story mirrors the lunatic time warp within great dance clubs.  There was a cast of characters, you kind of knew them, and you knew some of the details of their lives outside the club, but make no mistake, the real world took place under the seductive lights, and everything else was just backstage preparation.You might say that the myriad subplots that ran through 54 were not adequately explored by the movie, but that would be naive.  Nobody at the club really knew Warhol, Jagger, Grace Kelly, Capote, or any of the luminaries, famous or not, who inhabited the club like ghosts.  We drank from their lives from dusk till dawn and hibernated in the so-called real world until the stars came out at night.Mike Meyers is beyond fabulous as the complex and tragic Steve Rubell.  If Ryan Phillippe is no Oscar winner, you might recall that the real busboys weren't usually National Merit Scholars either.  They were beautiful, and that was all that mattered.The giddy yet tragic abandon of the Disco Days has never been captured so perfectly.  Everyone knew it couldn't last, but we all stuck it out to see who could make it till last call.  An era as beautiful and optimistic as the hippies and flower children of the 1960's drowned under the weight of the resentment of those who couldn't make it past the velvet rope.This movie is the absolute best of its genre, and unflinchingly reveals the darkness that lay under the glittering veneer of 54.

Are you ready for disappointment?,"54 is one of those films that has potential to be engaging and intoxicating, but that potential is never fulfilled.  The impression I got was that each storyline was intended to go somewhere, but was hacked up and edited out somewhere in the process.  There is no overall arc to the story, which gave it the feel of a 2-hr pilot for a prime time TV drama, in which case we would eventually find out more about the characters.The only character I was interested in was Mike Myers's.  Surprisingly, the owner of Studio 54 was relegated to a minor role in the story -- merely window dressing.  Instead of the film being about the club, its owner, and its patrons, it seems to be preoccupied with how gorgeous Ryan Phillippe is.With such a talented cast, it is a shame that they were wasted on a story and characters that go nowhere.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Ryan Phillippe seemed to be lost in his role, while Neve Campbell seemed real dis-interested. Salma Hayek done the best with the role she was given.

...the soundtrack's better,"""54""- a 1998 release of a fictionalized account of the late seventies' notorious nightclub that's peppered with drugs, decadence, and debauchery in the POV of a dimbulb from across the river that separates New Jersey from New York. Ryan Phillipe is the leading, narrating it-guy (I think this film actually helped destroy his career). Salma Hayek was the it-girl and played a philandering wife to Breckin Meyer (who, by the way, was HORRIBLY miscast to play her husband- no way Salma would ever touch him). Neve Campbell (all 10 minutes of her) played the soap star on the down, which incidentally mirrored her real-life career as well. Mike Myers as Steve Rubell stole the whole show. He played it with so much charisma, you couldn't help but to root for this freak. And even though Myers didn't look a whole lot like Rubell, he was not his usual over-the-top self and the subtle Linda Richman (SNL) voice he used, made the whole delivery work. Sela Ward had a small role in this as a hot-stuff, wired, record producer, but then again, EVERYONE had minuscule parts. Sherry Stringfield played his strung-out confidant Viv (and looked like she lost weight to the point of being unrecognized), along with Heather Matzarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", ""The Princess Diaries"") as Ryan Phillipe's younger sister.The film had potential. It seemed decent most of the time, and you wanted to know a little more with what was going on in each scene. Yet it seemed more like watching an extended British theatrical trailer. An example was when Shane (Phillipe) is bummed that the magazine he posed for didn't have any text. Well, we never knew he even posed in the first place, but it must've been a piece that was snipped in order not to fully enjoy this subplot. The only problem is that there were multiple scenes that suffered from this same lack of coherence. The movie must have originally been three hours long, but the execs had to snip about half the footage for whatever reason. The result is a contorted, contrived, unremarkable film that doesn't even carry half the songs on film that are embedded in its soundtrack.I did feel (as I did with ""Boogie Nights"") that I was in fact watching a documentary of the late 70s, and old memories of where I was at that time go-go danced in the back of my head. The Director of Photography deserves props (like the DPs to ""American Psycho"" & ""Boogie Nights"" do). I was only eight when this movie took place, but I remember where I was on New Year's Eve of 1979. But this film unfortunately tried to cram as much '70-isms and references as possible. When Breckin Meyer reaches for his wife, she says, ""Sit on it!"" Or when Shane and Meyer are the wild & crazy Czechoslovakian Brothers (Dan Aykroyd & Steve Martin in the '70s heyday of SNL). See my review of ""Boogie Nights"", you'll know what I mean. And I didn't buy that Shane (who wasn't a real sharp tool to begin with) magically goes to NYU and is a manager of a restaurant at the movie's end.All in all, the movie was dramatic in parts where it shouldn't have been; had no humor where it should have; was shorter than it should have been; and had scenes that shouldn't have been. The end credits were cool to watch because of all the celebrities and icons of the time were there: Liza Minelli, Martin Scorcese, Farah Fawcett, John Travolta, Sylvester Stallone, and even the Governator of California.Not a bad film, but by no means a good one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Movie titled under false pretenses,"I remember when this movie came out and the reviews for it were terrible back then. I'm sitting here over 20 years later watching it again for some reason and I remember why they were so terrible.The movie is unfortunately not about the salaciously real story involving the infamous night club's owner, Steve Rubell, and the dirty way he ran it into the ground with his greed. This is nothing more than a club movie slapped with the 54 title to rope people into watching it, glossing over the true backstory of how Rubell created one of the biggest nightclubs in the world but then just a few years later after it's creation, brought it crashing to the ground through years of stealing and tax evasion.The real story is interesting, however this one isn't. Mike Myers looks confused as how to play the infamous Rubell, stuck between Austin Powers and Wayne Campbell while lead actor Ryan Phillipe gives his usual performance wear seems like he's grimacing most of the time to hold in having to take a crap. Which was like all of his performances, painful to watch and nothing but crap. No wonder the dude isn't acting anymore, he was awful back then.The only performance I can't understand why she got a bad review by some people was Neve Campbell. I found her character fairly interesting, even though it was slightly misplaced. Like most of this movie, it was jumbled up and the real story was glossed over which would have been a lot more interesting to see.

Mike Myers' bang-on Steve Rubell is probably the only reason to rent this film.,"I watch about 10 to 30 films a month, from mainstream to independent features, and what qualifies as a great film, to me, is its ability to capture my attention every time I watch it. In the film's defense, I didn't dislike it. Ryan Philippe was tolerable, as was most of the cast, including Neve Campbell. The best way to describe this film is unspectacular, as good an effort as it was. Myers, though, is the obvious jewel of this picture. Despite the mediocrity of this film, his performance was Oscar-caliber, and if anything, the Academy, not to mention The Hollywood Foreign Press, seriously underestimated his performance. His words could've been written a little better (Mark Christopher is to blame for that; don't blame Myers), but Myers delivered them with perfection.

Blame Miramax for this one.,"OK, here's the deal: Mark Christopher wrote & filmed a much more interesting story, namely an all-3-sides love triangle between the Philippe, Hayek, and Breckin Meyer characters, where the three all behaved rather badly and rashly. But Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who run Miramax, which is owned by Disney, quite simply, freaked. They showed the movie to a bunch of shallow preview audiences who shy away from characters who are good AND bad, instead of one or the other, and made Christopher do extensive reshoots. Which is is how we got this dull, mangled mess of a film. The Neve Campbell character is so damned boring it's hard to understand how she'd be charismatic enough to get her soap opera role, much less get into the movies. Philippe is a cipher, and we don't see enough of Hayek and Breckin together to understand their relationship. Next time, Harvey and Bob, let the two boys kiss.",,Anonymous,Music
Trashy Drama,"54 is an Ok film cause it mixes Melrose Place with Mike Myers' character style.  The film showcases a twisted around version of the true story of the corruption of the studio 54 during the late 70's.  The performances are good, the script is OK, the style is great, but there is something missing here.

Perhaps it's because he is so good as Austin Powers that the character seems to pervade everything else he plays also - such as Steve Rubell in this case.  There were moments that he sounded and acted like Powers far too frequent in 54.Rubell, the founder and owner of trendy NY nightclub 54, finally fell foul of the authorities as we all know; but the story of what happened and how is interesting all the same.It should have been a lot longer film, it was only starting to really go somewhere when it finished.Salma Hayek and Ryan Phillippe gave good performances, and Neve Campbell was absolutely gorgeous as usual, and is a really under rated actress at the same time, doing a good role as the soap star looking to get big.

Has nothing to sell,"Despite all the music, dancing, flashy lights, and glitter, 54 wanders around blind deaf and dumb, making no progress and ends up amounting to nothing.What could be more frustrating than being asked to watch two hundred people party like it's 1999, and not getting a chance to be a part of it. The film is dull. It is set up a little like Boogie Nights (which itself was set up like Goodfellas) meaning of course that the story has a first person perspective, narration included with a blow by blow description of names places and faces, and ""what a good time it was"" or something like that. Too bad the narrator is a piece of cardboard, as is everyone else in the movie. Neve Campbell is the only one who feels human in her performance, yet she is given practically no screen time.

Myers is probably the best here, hamming his role perfectly, Neve is good but her character is not very appealing, Hayek unfortunately is given little to do, but does it well, and Phillipe's character is annoying, but he proves he isn't just a pretty boy by giving an okay performance. He has done better in other roles, just like the rest of the cast, but that isn't the fault of the actors. The story isn't involving enough, but there are some funny, and touching moments.

All I can say is Mike Myers!,"Disco.  Many people hated it, many loved it.  54 told the story of the infamous New York nightclub, Studio 54.  The stars hobnobbed, danced, drank, and even snorted there.I liked 54.  Very simple.  The atmosphere of the film, the decade of the Seventies, always provides for some interesting plotlines.  Ryan Phillippe played a young kid trying to make something of his otherwise dull life in Jersey.  His style was convincing, yet he had this annoying habit of 'mugging' for the camera as if to say 'see how attractive I am'.  Neve Campbell unfortunately didn't shine in her role as the soapstar boosting her career.  She also overused her facial expressions, the ones she helped to sell 'Scream' with.Mike Myers, I say with a huge breathtaking sigh.  His performance as club owner and continuously high schmoozer Steve Rubell was incredible.  He showed depth and brought light to an otherwise pathetic character.

Last days of disco movies?,"It seems that making the definitive New York disco movie is a lost cause. Both Whit Stillman's `Last Days of Disco' and Christopher's `54' make valiant but doomed attempts.The problem with `54' is, like `Last Days' the characters lack depth. But perhaps this is no accident given the artificiality of the scene both movies set out to portray. Compared to ballroom dancing, or to be more accurate, `Strictly Ballroom' where the environment is populated with people dedicated in their own individual ways to succeed, the disco scene is a hard seam to mine.Whereas `Last Days' focuses on regulars who frequent the disco, here we focus on an employee. `54' takes as its central character Shane O'Shea (Phillippe), a New Jersey kid who is bored with life on the wrong side of the tracks, or, more accurately, the wrong side of the Hudson River. So he crosses into New York City, joins the queue of hopefuls hoping to be allowed into `54', and manages to get in by the rather unlikely process of removing his shirt (a scene recalled towards the end of the movie when he is thrown out of the same disco, again shirtless). From here on we follow his rise as an employee to the dizzy heights of bartender, a position that in the world of disco appears to be equivalent to a leading Wall Street bond trader. Phillippe is too lightweight in the role for us to really care too much about his fate.Mike Myers makes a reasonable stab at playing the role of Steve Rubell, `54's charismatically odd owner. Unfortunately he has a tendency, in several scenes, to look a bit like the toothy British comedian Ken Dodd and I was half expecting him to come out with Dodd's old saying `How tickled I am, missus'. Given some of Myers's lines it might actually have been worked.In the end Rubell is hit by the IRS  given the amount of drugs being wheeled and dealed in the place he probably got the lesser of two evils. And as Ken Dodd also got into a little bit of difficulty with the UK's revenue service the parallels were just too much.All in all, like `Last Days of Disco', this is a sorry effort. Perhaps the whole Manhattan disco scene can now be quietly condemned to the trashcan of movie history.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Nothing but wanna-be party monsters,"Studio 54 was one of the defining clubs of the seventies. Known for its lavish parties, limitless energy, and the known hangout for A-list celebrities, its inviting, yet elusive atmosphere completely challenged the party-life at that point in time. It was a cultural staple that has now faded into a curious piece of history.It's only logical that a film make an attempt to capture the energy and the enigma of the popular nightclub, and Mark Christopher's 54 does just that at a basic level. Enthusiasts of the nightclub will find the atmosphere of the film adoring and majestic, while detractors or outsides will find little to note here. This is more a Cliff Notes representation of an enormous cultural staple. Think the social change the Vietnam War provided being summed up in a pamphlet of information.The film stars Ryan Phillippe as Shane O'Shea, a young Jersey boy who lives a pretty unremarkable life until he ups the courage to cross the New York/Jersey border and becomes a bartender at Studio 54. Not long after, he meets the aspiring singer Anita (Salma Hayek) and her overprotective husband, Greg (Breckin Meyer) and gradually becomes closer and closer with Anita and alienating Greg in the meantime. Shane also finds himself slightly at odds with the egomaniac club-owner Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), who consistently reminds him he is an easily-replaceable pretty face. Overtime, Shane becomes sucked into the twisted drug culture that Studio 54 bears, along with the heavily dramatic lifestyle, which will ultimately cause his demise and the club's.One would anticipate a film like 54 be able to capture the strange, uncouth wackiness of the club along with being able to bring the raw focus had by a film like Boogie Nights and the sophistication of a film like Casino. Unfortunately, we don't get much of either. 54 is a fine examination of a club, but it's too unwilling to go beneath the surface and really expose anything. It plays safe, hitting the right notes at the right time. Never does it become inoffensive or shifts its tone into a rawer, more unadulterated look.Both of the aforementioned films had the luxury of surprising their audiences whether it was in the way of style or in the way of content. 54 remains something of an effigy in terms of style; it features rather muted colors and not a lot of dance floor excitement as the club was known for. We get a more behind the scenes look, which is nice, but rarely do we dive much into the characters to a get a sense of what they're truly about. We know a bit more about the characters than the average caricatures that pass in a raunchy teen flick but not by a whole lot.Returning to the point of the style of the particular film, it's all pretty bland and inert. The excitement and energy that existed in the club isn't translated well enough to film. If 54 wanted to take on a persona equivalent to that of, say, European art-house, what could've unfolded would've been sure beauty in the way of color and vibe. It settles for a mediocre palette of redundant colors - that is when the film chooses to show them off.At least we have a slew of solid performances here; Ryan Phillippe is strong as the lead character, portraying his rise believably and his downfall professionally, Salma Hayek is interesting to watch as always, Breckin Meyer gets a few laughs, and Mike Myers gives the best or his worst performance of his career depending on how you look at it. While no performance is necessarily bad, they all occupy an uncertain state in the sense that nobody knows if they're supposed to be serious or satirical. Myers' character seems to be from a different film, playing Rubell with a looser persona rather than Phillippe, who seems to be playing Shane with complete seriousness.54 is benefited by a strong cast and favorable writing from director Christopher, but it's relatively too safe and too restricted to truly call itself the encompassing film on an entire culture.Starring: Ryan Phillippe, Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, Breckin Meyer, Mike Myers, and Sela Ward.

Liked it mostly because it is an accurate depiction.,"I agree, the story was a little weak, and some of the acting, although Mike Myers did a very nice job. But the movie does capture the era to a large extent, as well as the hallowed halls of the famous danceteria itself. How can I say this? Because, unlike most of those trashing this movie, I was actually there during its heyday (1978), and I can tell you that Mark Christopher DID in fact capture a lot of the details about the club.Yes, they really did prevent ""ordinary"" people from entering, in just as condescending a fashion as depicted in this film, if not worse. Yes, your chances of gaining entry wearing a polyester shirt were near zero, no matter how empty the place might have been at the moment. Yes, the velvet ropes were controlled by 'Peter Perfect' doormen, who thwarted all sorts of tricks used to gain admission, such as calling out their names like they knew them, saying they were there before (somehow, the doormen remembered everyone, and that tactic rarely worked), riding up in rented limos and having the driver go up and announce ""Mr. So-and-So is here"" (that didn't work, either), or stripping off their clothes in the middle of the street (females). Yes, many did stay outside the club until 5 or 6 a.m., just to glimpse the beautiful people leaving. Yes, there really was a bag lady who was regularly admitted. Yes, there really was a crescent moon sniffing a coke spoon that descended upon the dance floor. Yes, there really was a balcony converted into a not-so-private area for more ""intimate"" encounters, of all varieties. The film didn't make up very much. It reported history, and pretty accurately, so far as I'm concerned. Don't like the decadence? Sorry, but that was the reality about this place.Admittedly, I'm a bit partial to this film because the main character (Shane) looked something like me in those days - early twenties, blonde wavy hair, blue-eyed - and like me, was a Jersey kid who decided to take a trip across the river to the better places in Manhattan. Even that aspect was accurate, as there were probably many like Shane.But unlike Shane, I never worked at Studio, and I never got too caught up its ""lifestyle"". And I'm quite grateful for the latter, for as I watched this film, I began to wonder about how many of the dancing hedonists I was acquainted with in those days were ultimately defeated by their own lifestyles, and like Steve Rubell, are now bopping in that great disco in the sky, if you get my meaning. For example, the friend who got me entry into Studio 54 - a person who was among the club's most loyal patrons - met an untimely end some years ago at the age of 37, due to hepatitis and AIDS. Back in the 70s, he once told me that he wanted his ashes scattered on Studio 54's dance floor after he died. In a way, he got his wish, albeit metaphorically; a sad story, as is the story in this film.If you want to see a great drama, I don't think you'll find it here. But if you want to know what it was really like at Studio 54, then see this.",,Anonymous,Music

"This was an important era in the ""me"" generation and I don't think we saw enough.","I was disappointed by 54, the movie just retold the legend of the club as advertised. I was hoping the story would go deeper, especially in terms of the celebrities that enjoyed the limelight. Unfortunately part of the mystique of 54 can be found in the years after Steve Rubell went to prison, I would have recommended that the early 80's which lacked the glamour of the 70's be represented as well (if only for a footnote). This was an important era in the ""me"" generation and I don't think we saw enough. This is the first movie on the excess of the 70's that didn't really have a good soundtrack. I enjoyed Boogie Nights but found that a lot of the same material was re-hashed in 54. Mike Myers was amazing, Neve Campbell did the best that could be done as a throw-in role and I would have enjoyed more of Salma Hayek.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"Fun times, lewd times, fun all the way!","Loved this film, I was just a little late coming into the ""disco"" scene as it was called in 78, I was more into ABBA, but by the 80's ABBA was over and HI NRG music was my thing.This film is brilliant! Although I never attended Studio 54, there were equivalents in London, Heaven, The Roof Garden on a Sunday night, and The Hippodrome on a Monday night. This reminds me of those times.Decadence, drinking, excess, I never partook in drugs but I certainly drank champagne like it was water. I spent hundreds of pounds on a Sat, Sun and Mon night, I danced, and I had sex, sex, sex, anywhere and everywhere! Then AIDS rearer its head and it pretty much was over.AIDS is mentioned in ""54"", as are drugs and booze, it was all an excess in every extreme, a wonderful era, that had its casualties, me included, who went on to be an alcoholic.Now cured of alcohol, self restraint and will power got me through, I returned to London's club scene and the equivalents are here now today too, HardOn, an overt and open minded sex club in London, a monthly affair, where there is free love, gay sex in every corner, live sex shows, scary live acts where I saw one man ""branded"" with a scalpel, another man had his genitalia burned with a Bunsen burner while the crowd looked on unimpressed! Decandence returned to London, whether this level of debauchery will ever return to the newly cleaned up New York is another matter.Studio 54 brings back fond memories, great music tracks and a joie de vivre that now can still be found if you know where to look.Enjoyed immensely, I recommend this film to all open minded people out there! I so wish I was 20 again! Still, at 43 I am back out and doing much the same, just with the brakes on a little, so I can make it to 65! :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A very pathetic attempt of a good movie,"Unfortunately this film, 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of 'Studio 54.'  The only thing that was good about the picture was 'Mike Myers' who was a joy to watch.  'Neve Cambpell,'  although her role was little was unfortunately bad.  The bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors, except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Average movie could have been better,"This could have been a really good movie, but it's filmed in such a lackluster way it will be quickly forgotten.  Mike Meyers is the only really interesting character in this film, and there should have been more of him. Ryan Phillippe is very pretty, with an appropriately pouty mouth, curly blond locks and great pecs, but unfortunately he lacks the screen presence to carry an entire movie as the leading character. His acting is not bad (he cries well), he's just not that interesting. The music is good, the story is predictable but engaging, but 54 tries so hard to be a cross between ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Last Days of Disco"" that it's hard not to notice its inferiority to both. A shame, really. My grade: C+",,Anonymous,Music
"while interesting, it wears thin","A very average movie that has the appearance to be stupendous, but never gains any momentum.  Some characters are un-needed (Neve Campbell's) because the writing never finishes the story.  Also the story-line dulls in some areas.  To save this, the film Makers used a documentary/narration approach. While this is interesting its continued use wears thin and it doesn't provide the needed pick-me-up",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Boogie Nots,"It's said there's a longer cut of 54 that can miraculously turn this mediocre dud into a great motion picture... but if you've prepared a plain meal and add more food, you'll probably wind up with... more plain food on the table...And it's a stilted, cautious one at that, since... despite the R-rated T&A raging inside the infamous New York City 1970's Studio 54 nightclub, where only mostly-ugly rich celebrities or beautiful nobodies could enter... there's a standard-dialogue/TV-movie vibe from the very beginning, even making Mike Myers' otherwise decent attempt at playing gay nightclub mogul Steve Rubell seem watered-down, cliche and predictable...And back when flavor-of-the-month Ryan Phillippe (here allowed into the club while buddy Mark Ruffalo's too ugly to enter) may have been a more legitimate actor than former rapper Marky Mark Walhberg, there's simply no touching PT Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS, which 54 attempts (with pallid traces of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER melodrama) but without the inspired muse of Scorsese-meets-Tarantino's contagious celebration of gritty exploitation cinema (and Phillipe's stale narration proves how comparably brilliant GOODFELLAS' Ray Liotta was)...Instead, 54's a bland one-night-stand that lacks the necessary nerve to go all the way... while random side-characters lethargically add to a mainstream feel-good movie, clumsily attempting yet another anything-goes/based-on-a-true-story expose...Like naive bartender Brecken Meyer's Afterschool Special-style drug addiction; Salma Hayek's attempt to be a music star straight from an episode of FAME; or Neve Campbell's famous TV starlet, half as pretty as the pretty boy supposedly obsessed with her...So, overall, there's no saving a picture that has recently laid practically all blame on producer Harvey Weinstein, supposedly having edited-out the story's inner-core, and yet, if that's the case, how do you explain PULP FICTION?Well... the difference is the director, folks, who in this case didn't jump in with both feet... to end up wading in extremely shallow waters.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Looking Better A Decade Later,"Ryan Phillippe shirtless shouldn't be illegal, as suggested by Mike Myers in his excellent portrayal of Steve Rubell - it should be REQUIRED - for any young man that looks as excellent as Phillippe did in this film.

While Phillippe has gone on to demonstrate his acting ability in other films, we will never forget his perfect physique in this trendy film.The movie was never intended to be any better than the era and music it represents, but Ryan would be a treat at any time - at that age - if he removed his shirt.

Everything Mike Myers Touches Turns To Gold,"Virtual unknown Mark Christopher's ""54"" came out at essentially the same time as Stillman's ""The Last Days of Disco,"" and most of us who are still Stillman hopefuls were expecting a TKO.Sadly though, even with Kate Beckinsale in the cast, ""Days"" finishes a poor second.Mike Myers, in his first truly dramatic role, is absolutely superb as the ubiquitous and egocentric Steve Rubell ~ the man who literally invented trendy~but~exclusive NYC hot~spots with his Studio 54.But Myers is merely the thread which holds several subplots together.Most of these involve lowlife Jersey kid, ""Shane"" [Ryan Phillippe], who happens upon the club nearly by accident.  Shane, via several personally~compromising situations, is fairly~quickly elevated to ""waiter"" status which, at 54, meant overnight stardom.Neve Campbell, as an ex~Jersey girl who has made it semi~big on a soap opera, excels as the object of Shane's desires.Salma Hayek, in what is likely her best performance thus far, is terrific as the disco star wannabe.I continue to be amazed with Mike Myers ~ even when he's not doing his comedy schtick, he makes it work.  This is a true oddity for ex~SNL personnel: Bill Murray, John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd's attempts at drama have been at best adequate [depite Aykroyd's nomination for the awful ""Driving Miss Daisy""] and at worst, deplorable [all of Aykroyd's other work].The guy is gold.

"Unique, Interesting, and Excellent","My oh my!  I loved ""54"" very much!  The film was very unique, very interesting, and different than most films!  I loved the set of the night club itself and I loved the attitude and nature of the characters in this film.  What I was a little disappointed about was the fact that they didn't really have a lot of the celebrities that went to Studio 54 back then such as Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Halston, Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, Cher, just to name a few.  And where is the other owner of Studio 54, Ian Schweggar (or however you spell his name)?  The movie I guess you could say highlighted the lives of the more common people rather than the big stars and icons who were at 54 every night during the late 1970's.  My cousin, Jimmy, went to Studio 54 back in the late 1970's when he was a teenager.  I think he was the same age as Shane during that period.Yet I give this film a lot of credit.  It was very glamorous, very exciting to watch, and above all, it was so much fun to watch!  Ryan Phillepe is a great actor, very talented, and he is soooo cute!  Reese Witherspoon is a lucky girl!

"54: The Director's Cut, a new Masterpiece is born","Because they are completely different movies. Amputated in 1998 due to the adventurous leap towards the ""immoral"", the editing of that film was altered, eliminating almost 40min of footage, shooting 30min of new ones, adding the voice-over of its protagonist, and promoting a post-Scream Neve Campbell from cameo as Phillippe's love interest and headliner, and finally altering the order and meaning of most of his scenes. What in 54 of 1998 wanted to be a moral fable about success, excess, rise, fall and redemption (although in the end it was more of an aesthetic and forcedly melancholic anecdote); It is now the unprejudiced love story of a menage à trois, as well as an uncompromising portrait of a place, a moment, and its people. Comparing both tapes, only the character of Steve Rubell retains his essence; all the others change absolutely and fortunately, becoming now careerists, solitary beings, obsessed with success to limits as terrible as they are recognizable. Their actions follow nihilistic paths, disguised as wild hedonism, turning their backs on the tempus fugit, turning the body into a map of the night before dawn, nocturnal creatures, as Hopper would say.And this transformation of the characters of characters gives rise to some interpretations, now yes, superb in their courage, in their sincerity, in their absolute lack of modesty and false status as a youthful star. That is why it is fascinating to observe how Ryan Phillippe, now with the best performance of his career, faces a young man as simple as he is dark, so bent on his own desires that he is capable of betraying even true love.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Not bad at all,"I saw this movie after having heard nearly every critic trashing it. My opinion......not so bad. I found this movie technically stunning, with great locations and a cool recreation of the era. It's the plot that doesn't work on very well. It gets stuck in some points where Christopher could have done something else to develop. The movie is also some kind of waste -of -talent -that -should -have -looked -better -on -paper. Mike Myers does a great performance here, one of his best. Neve Campbell is also ok. But the one who should have stolen the movie is Salma Hayek. She is so beautiful that the only fact of seeing her on screen is a pleasure. Anyway, her character wasn't treated as it deserved. Doesn't matter........she's still appealing as always and very talented. My comment in just a few words: It could have been better, but is still a good one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Love this movie!!,"I've just finished watching the new extended version and love the new scenes. I was slightly disappointed not seeing the scenes from the director's cut I've heard so much about. I hope I get to see the director's cut sometime soon. Many thought the original was a flop and missing something. Having experienced the Disco era both as a DJ and a patron, I feel it's a true representation of the Disco era, the last era of true freedom. I also was fortunate enough to go Studio 54 myself.I've studied this movie for screen writing purposes. I've written a similar time period piece. Understanding the nuances of writing, I don't understand why important footage was left out just for time consideration. It wasn't too long to begin with. Personally I'd rather spend a few extra minutes seeing an entire uncut movie and getting the full experience. The love triangle scenes between Ryan Phillippe, Selma Hayek & Breckin Meyer may have been considered to risqué at the time the original movie was released, though is an accurate portrayal of the period. These scenes were left out this version as well.I gave the movie 10 stars and suggest everyone see it!! I also love the soundtrack and hats off to the cast!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
54 (DIDIER BECU),"Is it my fault or what? Why if I wanna praise a movie, I have to see that it's being turned down by most of the IMDB-voters? Anyway, ""54"" tells the story of the legendary Studio 54-discotheque in New York that was huge in the days of disco and that was known for its orgies, extravaganzas and endless days of disco. It tells the story of a Shane who lives at the other side of NY and who is picked up by the boss, who makes him a bartender. He soon sees what has to be done to make it (gaysex included) but he forgets his poor origin and climbs up to the ladder of stardom. ""54"" is a perfect movie for anyone who seek decadence with a discosoundtrack and for those who are at the end of their 30's, they all know the party's definitely over and fun never sounded so good. A real masterpiece that tells a real important part of popular music's history.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Reasonable story with strong sense of period covering the weak characters,"In the 1970's Shane and his friends go out in New York to see if they can get into the exclusive club 54.  Shane gets in but his friends don't, and he immediately falls for the glamorous life.  He gets a job in the club and gradually works his way up from busboy to barman, getting more money, drugs and sex than he can handle.  However as relationships crumble and the excesses become the norm, things are bound to break eventually.With the success of Boogie Nights, period films from the Seventies were suddenly good business if you could pull them off.  54 is set in the `legendary' nightclub of the same name - although I must confess that the news of this `legendary' place never reached me in rural Northern Ireland, although I was aware of the place before I saw this film.  The lack of introduction to the place put me off a little bit - it expected the audience to already be in awe of this great club without it doing anything to win us over.  From this point in the film takes the narrative on a basic downward spiral of drugs, sex and general excess to act as a sort of cautionary tale against the period.  It does this a little heavily where I would have preferred it to trust me to get the message fro ma straight telling.The character of Shane is the main focus, with him acting as our eyes on the other characters, particularly club owner Steve Rubell.  While it tries to paint a big picture of all the excesses and broken dreams, mainly it only manages to do Shane well and the rest are sort of in the background and not as well drawn and involved as in Boogie Nights.  It still works but it lacks the tapestry effect that would have improved it.The cast are still pretty good.  Generally I hate the bland and expressionless Phillippe, he is not a good actor and he generally leaves me feeling cold by his performances.  Here, partly because he is our entry to the film, I thought he was better than he has been before.  Myers is good although his presence may have been part of people turning up to the film expecting a crude comedy.  He delivers his lines well and seems to enjoy having a straight role to play.  Hayek is OK but Campbell has very little to do.  The supporting cast are OK but the material doesn't fill them out beyond people who we know we will see the `curse' of 54 played onto, much like the `characters' at the start of Casualty who we know something will happen to.Overall this is an enjoyable film that trades off it's good sense of time and place to cover the fact that the material is not as well written as it should have been.  The action is too simple and the characters are not real enough. I hate to compare, but Boogie nights deals with a similar tale but does it much better.",,Anonymous,Music

The Party Doesnt End Til Sunrise,"I love this movie. Mike Myers was excellent in the role as club owner Steve Rubell. Although he was not the only club owner at that time , but noone ever even sees that guy in this film. Mark Christopher does an excellent , almost flawless job in depicting the party that was Studio 54. Like with all bio/movies , some pieces are not true - but Mark seemed to put as much truth as he could fit into this one - as was the same for his other 1998 film , bio/movie of supermodel Gia.One thing that was a little sketchy about this film is that when the viewer sees all the ""guests"" that were granted entrance or had been on the ""guestlists"" to enter the club , one may have a hard time knowing who is depicting who. In other words , as far as the real Studio 54 club goes , ""guests"" were people in power , of money , in the art world , in the business (actors , actresses , supermodels , music artists) - and this makes it hard to tell which star in the movie is depicting which star....Get my drift?

I hated the stuff--brainless, artless nonsense. With no discernible talent required to compose disco, there was no reason to take any of it seriously. An incoherent narrative, dreadful dialogue, and a whole undercurrent of stupefying stupidity (the heart and soul of disco), don't combine for anything other than a garbage movie about pathetic people living in the unreal world of the late 1970s disco scene.Have at it.",,Anonymous,Music

Knock on Wood,"54 is a great movie for nostalgia pundits such as myself. It is an affectionately made journey through the looking glass to back to the late 70's and early 80's. It has a great soundtrack and enjoyable performances by Ryan Philippe, Selma Hyack and the like. Of course the man who steals the show is Mike Myers who is hillarious as Steve Rubell. The Script centres alot of the attention on Myers and Rubell, because he is quite simply the most interesting of the ensemble characters in the movie. I dont know too much about Rubell but Myers manages to make him a likeable character despite being nothing short of a bastard. Where the movie lets it's self down is that there is practically no style to the direction or even the script, so we dont see anything we havent seen before. Philippe's opening narration goes for a Goodfella's style feel, while the movie tries mercifully to drag it's self out of the shadow of Boogie Nights. Director Mark Christopher seems to be trying to hold back the feeling of excess instead of succumbing to what is natural. This is a pity because the movie could have benefited alot more from doing just that. Overall though, as it stands 54 is an enjoyable, watchable -Grade Mike Myers showcase with some great tracks {Knock on Wood for one} and some solid performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Studio 54 misrepresented in bad film...,"FIFTY-FOUR does not know whether it wants to capture the late 70's, the impact the club had on it, Steve Rubell, or the lives of the fictional characters, who are about as memorable as most people's memory of 54 parties.  They rarely have any.  It does not focus on any of the latter, but instead, tries to wrap it it all into a cohesive whole.  No go.  This is a very ambitious undertaking by the filmmakers, but it seems like they could not or would not let loose.  How can you really recreate Studio 54 unless you shoot inside the actual club ? (it still stands in New York)  I also feel that Miramax was afraid of backlash and box-office so they set strict productional values.  No real big stars, and, most importantly, no representatives of the world famous celebrities who attended 54 on a steady basis.We do see some of the obvious in and outs of the club, like the drug-swapping at the bars, and the guidelines for getting in at the infamous velvet ropes that kept so many people out.  We never get a real sense that we are back in that period.  I would recommend seeing the current documentaries on the club being shown on cable TV.  The film is so short, the documentaries are longer and much more entertaining.Mike Myers gives a half-decent performance, but never-mind the fact that Steve Rubell's partner in the club is nowhere to be found.  And the director makes a half-hearted stab at taking us into the highly private ""basement"" where all the stars hung out.  Myers' lines seem forced and I'm sure people who were close to the real Rubell were gnawing their teeth.  What could've been an important statement about the me-decade and its excesses is wasted. Instead, we get a Tony Manero-type story the viewer could really care less about.",,Anonymous,Music
"While getting slammed by critics, 54 offers fun, summer entertainment.","I enjoyed this film.  Yes, it got slammed by critics.  Yes, it's a little slack on details and some might consider it dull.  While even I hoped for a little more of life inside the club than it actually projected I still amazingly liked it.  Maybe, because it was incredibly short and light -weight summer entertainment or because it had a constant beat to it; either way I still enjoyed it.  I'm not recommending this, even though i liked it myself; because most people won't have interest in seeing a movie on 54 and especially after reading the terrible reviews about it.  The truth is Mike Myers was good as Steve Rubell and the rest give reasonably good performances;enough to believe at least.  This film was incredibly low on sex and drugs considering it was the late 70's in the notorious Studio 54. I was a little surprised that the film didn't ever show rubell's co-partner Ian Shroeger.  If you're expecting a strict copy of the real 54, this will probably disappoint you.  The main story line is featured on a young adult who rises as a bartender in the club and how his life changes in all aspects; his connection with his family deteriorates, his drug use rises along with his sexual activity.  But there is really hardly much sex in it too make it possibly offending.  I love how the beginning and the ending is portrayed.  The film was cut short 30 minutes after it was shown to a test audience-which disliked various parts and the ending i believe.  Whether it was cut for the good or the bad I give this film an 8 out of ten or a B+ or better yet, 3 stars out of 4.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I am fascinated with the decade of the 70's and this movie portrayed it beautifully, much to my surprise.  Drugs, some pretty raunchy sex, and kickin' music really create the vintage feeling.  Salma Hayek absolutely stole the show as the fame-seeking coat-girl Anita, and Mike Myers was also very believable as 54 owner Steve Rubell.  Even though Ryan Phillippe could've been better, his wrong-turns are forgotten as Neve Campbell stinks up the screen.  Her performance as the soap-opera actress made me feel severely violated.  Even though I am a big fan of hers, I seriously think that she should stick to what she's good at:  portraying disturbingly neurotic people who scream a lot.  Even though Campbell's acting was nastier than Paula Cole's armpit hair, this is an overall great movie.  B+",8.0,Anonymous,Music
This is true underrate (and it's the first time I say so),"No doubt it is VERY underrated. I'm not saying that it should have a 9.x but it should make it over 7 for sure. To begin with, the script which is in part (if not all) documentary, is extremely captivating. Second, there is an overlooked wonderful acting from Mike Myers doing Steve Rubell. Perfect representation of that kind of person. Dustin Hoffman (one of my favorites) couldn't have done it better if chosen for the cast. Third... it's amusing all the way long. This movie keeps your attention high amongst other reasons because you quickly understand the fact that some things are going to happen necessarily because the statu quo shown there cannot resist too long in time. Strongly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A strange family,"It was a time of drugs, sex and Disco. I felt some strange feeling of family in this movie. It was interesting to see the inner workings of Studio 54.

Pretty accurate time capsule.,I'm basing my rating on the directors cut version since it doesn't have it's own entry. I would say it's a two star difference. A young bartender's journey into the New York City club scene and nightlife via legendary club Studio 54 in the late 1970s. See the unrated director's cut for the full scope of Shane54's journey. It gives an even more accurate depiction of the time period and scene. I do prefer the ending of this version though.,9.0,Anonymous,Music
I don't even know how to describe how I'm feeling right now.,"This movie was absolutely wonderful and beautiful. Very well done. I was obsessed with Shane of course. He made some bad choices but in the end he made the right ones and kept his found family and I think that's beautiful. He literally had it all I'm so surprised I've only now seen it because it's right up my alley. I can't believe it's all based on a true story. He is beautiful and I wonder how he is today...hope he's great. That chest.... WOAH lol anyways I was pleasantly surprised and if you get the chance give this movie a watch. I wish I could've been at one of these legendary parties! Beautiful gay men everywhere. Fabulous women. Drugs and debauchery...my kind of place.

"Why didn´t they film instead ""The Andy Warhol Diaries""? Or will there be a ""Director´s Cut""?","This film is in one point disappointing because Disney didn´t allow to shoot ""hotter"" scenes and on the other hand, who cares about a fictive character like the Ryan Phillippe guy, Shane? I mean, he looks good and does his best but it would have been much more thrilling if they would have done something like ""The Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager Story"" ( because after jail they also opened the legendary ""Palladium"" club in N.Y.)and show their point of view or ""The Andy Warhol Diaries"" which describe the decadence of the 70´s and 80´s explicitly. They document the rise and fall of the legendary ""54"" clique Warhol/ Bianca Jagger/ Halston/ Truman Capote/ Steve Rubell very nice.

Time wasted,"If it were not for the talented performance of Mike Myers, this movie would have been a total waste of money.

Not a Bad Story but awful acting apart from Mike Myers,"Mike Myers was far to good to be apart of the dire idea of a film.   It just seemed to much like boogie nights.  The story of 54 is all about a young man who dreams of being a somebody and becomes very famous and begins to strain underneath the pressure.  Isn't that what happens to Dirk Diggler in the days of disco fever in Boogie nights.  How much people don't want to believe this it's true.   Ryan Philippe is a very good actor but he is also a bad one.   Antitrust, White Squall and the excellent The Way of the Gun are his only great performances but the others he just tries to hard to give a great performance and it shows in 54.   Salma Hayek is not need at all as did Neve Campbell whose career was dying with the Scream sequels as this just helped her on the way.   Mike Myers proves that he can act just as much as he can make people laugh and was the only thing good about this film and was the only reason it probably got made.Disappointing film that tried to jump the bandwagon but couldn't even hold on.",,Anonymous,Music
"Great potential, some very good performance's, needed to be about an hour longer.","54 was a good movie that did not live up to its potential.  The story is excellent, and a number of the performances were outstanding (especially that of Mike Meyers), but in the end I walked out of the theater wishing that any of the dozen or so sub-plots were expanded upon.  This movie tried to be about drug use, promiscuous and careless sex, an eccentric club owner , trying to make ones dreams come true at all costs, the dingier side (and price) of stardom, the strong desire of the  ""system"" to get rid of the club and the free spirited attitude that caused it to be so successful, romance, the degradation of family values and relationships, and the consequences of all of the above.  In the end however, with what seems must have been about five or six hours worth of film on the cutting room floor, this was a decent movie about a club employee and his scattered memories of his time spent there.  54 was entertaining, but it could have been great. I believe that most audiences will leave the theatre feeling that they were missing something.",,Anonymous,Music
"A great idea, but that's about it.","54 is a movie depicting the life of workers and patrons of the legendary studio 54 in New York.  It revolves around a young man named Shane, a suburbanite from New Jersey who dreams of the big city.  Upon finding out a local-girl-hit-big soap starlet hangs at Studio 54, an upscale club in New York, Shane and his friends decide to give 54 a visit.  Anyhow, to make a long story short, Shane becomes an employee, 54 closes, Shane comes back for a visit.. thats about it.  The movie repeatedly shows scenes of drugs being exchanged at the cafe table between Shane & friends.  Women having sex with Shane.  .  The movie was too rushed...  like the director just wanted to get the whole thing over with.  Hell, the end was a music video for the theme song.  For a better modern look into the 70's I'd suggest ""Boogie Nights"".  Studio 54 seemed like a whole bunch of 90's folks in 70's clothing.",,Anonymous,Music
A good performance by Myers in an otherwise lacking film.,"To be honest, I don't know a lot about Steve Rubell or Studio 54. But it doesn't seem to matter because I was entertained by Mike Myers' performance in this movie. He could be funny, dramatic, powerful, or just plain pathetic (when he was on drugs). Other than him, this movie is kind of uninteresting. There are funny moments with Disco Dottie but Ryan Phillippe's story, and his friends', simply did not keep me glued to my screen. And I didn't really get the feel of a '70s disco club (maybe if the music had been a little louder). And on top of that, both Phillippe and Neve Campbell aren't very good actors. If not for Myers this movie would have been a dud.",,Anonymous,Music
not real bad,"a young man in a crazy universe. fun, dramas, Mike Meyers in a seductive performance, Ryan Philippe in a nice role. and a legendary club who represents only the pretext for recreate the spirit of a period. far to be a great film, it is a decent one. and that is the only important thing- to explore the forms of a form of hedonism, free circle with its great problems, the need to escape and the surrogate of happiness. 54 has not the ambition to be a documentary. only a show about myths and bitter taste of success, hypocrisy and ambition. and it does a good job, giving few crumbs from an illusory universe. a film about forms of seduction who seduce itself. that could be all.",,Anonymous,Music

Better the second time,"I had seen ""54"" in the theaters and thought it was very bad. I had mostly seen it just to see Andy Warhol (played by the wonderful Jared Haris), but he was only in the film for like two seconds. I had expected way more of the film. Disney messed it up so badly. If they had just let the director make it like he wanted to, it would have been way better. Now all 14 year old teens like it, and adults and university students (like me) won't. Now, every time a production company messes up a film, they said it got ""54'd."" Too bad. I have to admit that the glitter and colors in the film was really good, but not as good as the ones in ""Velvet Goldmine"". The costumes in the were suitable. Out of the three disco/70's movies this year; ""The Last Days of Disco,"" ""Velvet Goldmine,"" and ""54,"" ""Velvet Goldmine was the best, then ""The Last Days of Disco,"" then ""54.""  Mike Myers was the best part of the film. I found Salma Hayek very cute. Neve Campbell was very disappointing. I have a feeling that Ryan Phillippe is going  to be the next Leonardo DiCaprio. So if you're bored one night, and want to party, rent ""54.""",,Anonymous,Music
I enjoyed this film for many reasons.,"I think that 54 is actually a lot better than I expected it to be. I had read reviews of it, saying it wasn't very good but I decided to watch it last night anyway. I really enjoyed it.Ryan Phillipe was great, mainly because he spent a lot of time with his shirt off, but also because he can act well. Mike Myers was scarily realistic as Steve Rubell and really made you believe that he was ever so slightly unhinged, but in a good way. Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer were good too. The soundtrack was awesome. If the real Studio 54 was anything like the one in the film I wish I had been around in 70s New York to go there!",,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as Boogie Nights,"Flashy fictional disco piece about Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe) who heads to New York and finds himself with a bartending job at the (non-fictional) infamous Studio 54 club. Phillippe's take as Shane is passable, as are supporting roles from Salma Hayeck, Breckin Meyer, Heather Matarazzo and Neve Campbell (how many seconds *was* she on for?), but by far the most memorable performance is from Mike Myers. A far cry from his Austin Powers persona, Myers plays the (real-life) gay owner of the club.The movie does a good job of capturing the club's no-holds-barred feel and the set is very impressive, but it just seems like the producers could have come up with something more - after all, Studio 54 is the most famous and mysterious club of all time!",,Anonymous,Music
Watch Boogie Nights instead,"54 is an example of what happens when a studio messes around too much with a movie.  54 could've been good.  There was a good cast involved, but the film was re-edited against the director's wishes and what we got was, well I just don't know.  Ryan Phillipe's character was one of the many ""I just want to get out of here"" characters that populate many of today's films.  Salma Hayek seemed woefully wasted, and her character's story line seemed to go nowhere.  Neve Campbell's character was totally useless and added nothing to the dramatic narrative.  Mike Myers was the only good thing about 54.  It's a shame that there was too much messing around on the studio's part.  This could've shown what the nightlife in 54 was like, instead we get just a tiny glimpse.",,Anonymous,Music
Way too short,"54 is a lackluster movie which tries to tell a big story in less than 90 minutes. As a result, the film is shallow and contains no depth or detail. It feels like icing without cake, toppings without yogurt. It has one or two interesting characters, but never does much with them. 54 feels like Saturday Night Fever at times, but never lives up to it. It certainly never comes close to the character depth of Last Days of Disco and the excellent Boogie Nights. Perhaps a Director's Cut with about 60 more minutes of footage would make this a much better film.",,Anonymous,Music
Pointless and unnecessary Boogie Nights wannabe.,"In a pathetic try to resemble excellent Boogie Nights - director Mark Christopher delivers a curiously unatmospheric tale about Studio 54.The real problem with 54 isn't the uncommitted direction or the boring script, it lies simply with Ryan Phillippe's performance. He doesn't express a thing! Not even the presence of one of the most beautiful women, Salma Hayek, makes this film worth seeing. Neve Campbell may wonder what the hell she's doing here.Go rent Boogie Nights!",,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Movie,"This movie was so good that I didn't want it to end.  I knew the club owner was Mike Myers only because of promos.  Thus, I would have to say that makeup did an excellent job on the movie set.

Although I thought the movie was basically a sleaze fest, I could believe this only if the directors, writers and producers had done an excellent job.I left the movie feeling uneasy about its content, but I also wanted to know more.  I recommend this movie to those not so faint at heart.",,Anonymous,Music
Stupidest cast of characters since Boogie Nights,"This movie could be called Boogie Nights ""lite"" but that would be a great disservice to that movie. This movie's characters are the dumbest bunch assembled since Boogie Nights. The main difference is that you cared about the characters in Boogie Nights and in 54 you couldn't care less about.Almost every aspect of this film is sub-standard, from the story (is there one?), the acting and the direction. The most compelling performance comes from Mike Myers who seems to be doing a failed ""SNL"" character whose most affecting trait is his bad hair and huge nose. Neve Campbell is on hand as Ryan Philippes inspiration and inexplicably falls in love with him. This seems highly unlikely since she's a famous actress and he's a bartender that is dumber than a rock. Their love story is easily the weakest element of the film.Don't be fooled by the Miramax name on this film. It stinks. They should have done better. This film doesn't deserve to make a quarter of the gross of The Last Days of Disco which at least had a story and characters which you could care about.",,Anonymous,Music

"Rise and fall of the New York club, Studio 54","54 ( rating, * out of 5 )From Miramax comes a picture written and directed by Mark Christopher about a horde of obnoxious and disagreeable people that during the late 70's and early 80's, frequented the coolest nightspot on the planet, (or so they want us to believe) the one and only, Studio 54.This alleged hot-spot was the focal point for a tribe of wannabes that any average punter couldn't give a rat's rear-end about - vile excuses for humanity that are as vulgar as they are irrelevant.Shane (Ryan Phillippe) turns his back on his tedious New Jersey existence for the glamour of being a bus-boy at Studio 54. Evidently, New Jersey is a low-brow sort of place where Cro-Magnon men take their cave-girl dates out for beef jerky and slurpees.After several sub-plots that painfully go nowhere, Shane ends up as a bartender - a job that keeps his pocket piccolo happy and many crotch crickets in his pants. Everyone with ambition and no acting ability wants to be a Studio 54 barman because this is where the women and drugs flow as freely as Mark Christopher's idiotic dialogue and contrived situations.Shane, (who bears a striking similarity to Christopher Atkins) meets Anita, (Salma Hayek) who wants to be Patti Labelle but without the talent - the kind of aspiring star-to-be that appears fascinated by popping champagne corks, rockets blasting off, cucumbers and trains rushing through tunnels.Anita is married to this half-pint wingnut who doesn't really have any relevance to the overall story but successfully provides a series of unplanned annoyances. Then there's the club owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) who is having trouble with a collection of bad suits from the Internal Revenue Service. (we don't really care about him either)Shane falls for Julie Black, (Neve Campbell) a soap actress who is also trying to further her career by bedding stupefied film-producers. The end mercifully comes when Shane and Julie realize how shallow and pretentious their contemporaries really are...like der.I never thought there would ever be anything as idiotic as disco, but I never figured on a movie about disco. Studio 54 comes across as nothing more than a New York bag shanty where the mezzanine floor is reserved for a bit of blanket drill while the showbiz elite have a place to demonstrate their comatose wit.This movie has all the steamy sex of 'Better Homes and Gardens' and by the time Neve Campbell is required to deliver lines, I was ready to cough up a phlegm ball.Ryan Phillippe displays no redeeming qualities required for a leading man and Mike Myers is completely squandered as the strange and enigmatic Rubell. However, he does have a moment or two and is the only reason this movie rates its one star. The collective cast come across as anti-social butterflies who bump and grind to that oxymoron of modern times, disco music.This movie really started to reek after about five minutes and after ten minutes of this pretentious guff, I had to resist the urge to run screaming into the hills. Basically, this flick is a cheap retread of 'Saturday Night Fever', without the dance routines and with a lot more boring bits. Studio 54 manages to achieve one thing in spectacular fashion though, and that is to remind us all how uncool we really were.",,Anonymous,Music

"There was bound to be a movie about New York's legendary Studio 54 sooner or later, but who knew it would be such a letdown?","Fans of Mike Myers will not be disappointed by his funny and smart performance here. However, anybody else who sees 54 will be wondering why director Mark Christopher totally wasted talented, beautiful actresses like Salma Hayek and Neve Cambell. There is a genuinely interesting story behind the real-life Studio 54. Unfortunately, the audience will probably never know it because this movie squanders its short running time (90 minutes) detailing the boring, uneventful adventures of a fictional lead character played by Ryan Phillipe. This movie probably would have been a little more fun and would have given new director Mark Christopher slightly better reviews if Paul Thomas Anderson hadn't made the same movie, ten times better, last year, with Boogie Nights.",,Anonymous,Music
slice from a world,"beautiful. the first word for a film who presents, in nuanced manner, the essence of a lost universe. inspired performances. because each of actors is more than interpreter of a character but part of a fascinating puzzle about a small circle, its lights and shadows, its illusions and triumphs. in same measure, it is a correct film because seams represent only a sketch but the atmosphere, the admirable acting of Ryan Phillips who becomes more than the nice blonde guy is an important ingredient for story and for the feeling of viewer to be part of show. the relations, the dialogs, the dance and dramas and the fall are reflected in inspired manner , with the right tone. so, a slice from a world. fascinating and fragile. and a film who could be a form of homage to a special place and its people.",,Anonymous,Music

I saw a ""Biography"" on A&E that had wilder club scenes, more celebrities and a more poignant plot. Are we supposed to be impressed with the back of Andy Warhol's head. Give me a break! To be fair the movie did have a few good scenes. And I love Heather Matazzarro, even though she is wasted here. In fact there were quite a few things a found to like but every time something else would rear its ugly head. For example Mike Myers, who I read in reviews had totally transformed himself into the Steve character, has a tendency to open his mouth and grin like he's doing a Saturday Night live skit. You want to smack him. This is one of those movies that just meanders toward an anticlimactic close. For example the movie goes out of its way to show characters abusing drugs, but never shows any ill effects from them, except for the old lady who drops dead of course. Shane 54 seems to effortlesly kick all of the habits that the movie shows him developing by the end. And the raid on the club at the end, it's almost an afterthought, even though it contains Myers best line. As they stick him in the police car, ""This is so tacky."" My advice, stay away.

Dancing on life's dance floor,"I found this film really good despite its rather ""wafer-thin"" plot. It's almost a documentary about the legendary disco Studio 54 (and the end of the 70's). The characters seem to have something in common: they all wanna win in life, they want to become something important, and that's what I most liked about ""54"". The will to grow, to become big, the necessity to be a big shot; it hasn't changed. Everybody wants to be (a big) part of the party, and we know life is the greatest party. Shane, Julie, Anita, Gregg, they all wanted to create their respective ""real"" lives as they created inside the glamourous 54, where everybody could be a star. I see it as a metaphor about the race of life, our desire to be important or at least to do something important. If I'm saying too much bullshit, just think the film is still enjoying. It describes just perfectly how was the aura that surrounded Studio 54 and its guests plus that ""late 70's feeling"". The cast and the soundtrack are also great.

Welcome to the Party - shame this movie doesn't make us give a fig about it.,"'54' is about 'Studio 54' a night club and, in particular, one young man who works there - Shane O'Shea (played by the stunning Ryan Phillippe). Shane is dissatisfied with his homelife, as young male movie protagonists are wont to be, so he decides to work in the New York club everyone is raving about - 'Studio 54'. Getting in on the salacious looks of 54's boss, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), Shane gets to meet a variety of people and experience a life of new excesses, which will shape his whole life - because it would be a boring movie if they did not.Right the problem with '54' is that. well we never get much of a feel for the titular place. '54' was, apparently, a place of hedonism, of pushing the boundaries of pleasure and so forth - the movie instead presents us with a slightly risqué club, but nothing shocking or, more pointedly, memorable about it. Yes there're drugs - ohhh! Scary! Yes sex occurs - but in a low-key tame manner. Yes there's some glitz in the club - but hardly anything spectacular. So the quintessential heart of the movie isn't really beating - it's up to the characters to try and keep the body pumping. Unfortunately, with one exception, they're all rather dull. Shsne doesn't really do much except Fall For Girl Who He Should Not Fall For - a stock plot device that's tired. He forms a few friendships but they're never all that convincing. Is this a fault of Phillipe? Probably not because he can rise above being a very very pretty face (which is what he's in this movie for). His friend, Greg (Breckin Meyer), is dull and Greg's girlfriend Anita (Selma Hayek in an unworthy performance), is - in her thin sketchedness - a perfect companion. It's only Myers performance as Rubell that we see an actual character forming - this being clearly Myers' best performance, with a great touch of eternal sadness invested into the character that allows him to command the movie any time he is on screen.Written and directed by Mark Christopher, this movie was apparently not what the director originally intended. Certainly there doesn't seem to be much of a vision here, as the movie ambles along to a somewhat obvious and certainly bland conclusion (admittedly, being based on fact it had no choice - that doesn't mean we have to be bored on the journey). There's nothing stand out about any of Christopher's work here. it doesn't really show any spirit but it's certainly no `Battlefield Earth'. Perhaps if his original picture was intact - which purported to really give us a flavour of '54'  and the people - then this movie would be decent. As it is it's fairly bland, saved only by the eye candy of the male and female leads. 3/10.",,Anonymous,Music
a pleasant surprise,"Despite negative reviews, I liked this movie. I think the reason I had a problem with movies like ""Titanic"" and ""Forrest Gump"" was because of all the hype--when I finally got to see them they just didn't live up to all the praise they received. I was let down. I think the opposite happened here--I wasn't expecting much, a mediocre movie at best--and as a result enjoyed the movie. Not a great movie, by no means--not even as good as ""Boogie Nights,"" which it parallels, and yet entertaining in its own right. Ryan Phillippe has taken more criticism for his ""poor"" acting than he deserves--I thought he was quite effective as the naive, sensitive and not-too-bright Shane O'Shea who thinks he's made it big until the sh** hits the fan; if you've spent any time around adolescents from northern New Jersey, they do sound just like this. He was very likeable and sympathetic (not to mention very nice to look at). Neve Campbell also did a fine job as Shane's love interest, but I think the romance could have been better developed (the fault of the movie being too short to really develop *any* characters enough). And I definitely agree that the very funny and talented Mike Myers did not have nearly enough to do--his Steve Rubell was humorous and tragic at the same time--and you wanted to see more of him. The soundtrack was good, but the dance-floor scenes were somehow lack-luster, and had the feel of a daytime soap. I think if the movie had been longer, a lot of these problems would have been solved. I think Ryan Phillippe has a lot of potential as a dramatic actor--once you look past the ""dumb blond"" persona he presents here. Not a great movie by any means, but much better than you've probably heard. Give this movie a chance!",,Anonymous,Music
"A poor version of ""Saturday Night Fever""","I watched this movie because this summer I was in New York and I went to see the show ""Cabaret"" at Studio 54, so I wanted to see what the club was like in its 70s heyday when, according to what I'd read, it was an illicit sex and drugs den, as well as being New York's hottest nightspot. But the movie seemed very tame and watered down - it was hinted that a lot of sex went on, and that drugs were rife, but it didn't depict this very realistically. The plot centered around Shane (Ryan Phillipe), a kid from New Jersey who ends up working at 54, and gets sucked into the whole lifestyle surrounding it. Phillipe's performance was satisfactory, but by no means outstanding. In fact the only good performance was by Mike Myers as 54's owner, Steve Rubell, who comes across as a kid who never really grew up, and never wanted the party of youth to end. Myers' performance is stunning, and you totally forget he ever played Austin Powers, which is how it should be! The rest of the supporting cast was disappointingly mediocre, as was most of the movie. It seemed to lack a certain something, and the plot was very choppy - it was obvious that some storylines were developed, but then never properly concluded. Overall, I'd say if you want to see a good movie about the 70s club scene, see ""Saturday Night Fever"" - it's more realistic, has a better storyline, better developed characters, better acting, and last of all, better music!",,Anonymous,Music

"""Found a cure""","Few days ago I saw this movie and it was great, FANTASTIC! I really don't know why everyone talks bad about 54, I think it's a very good ecranisation of the real studio 54, with good acting. I don't know why everyone insists on excellent acting, in 54 it's quite good but it's not acting that makes the film GREAT but THE BEST disco music and the breath taking atmosphere. Ryan looks stunning (and more than that. sorry can't find the right words), Mike acts excellently. This film really changed me and I suggest it to everyone, especially because of the music. I keep listening to the soundtrack and can't get enough of it. It's great to know that a place like 54 really existed, and it was heaven on earth. I gave it 10, and would give 100 if posible, 'cause it can really Relight your fire! ""Wanna thank you for the joy you brought me"" Voya54",,Anonymous,Music
not just another boogie night,i saw studio 54 on a really boring night. i really enjoyed..i rented boogie nights twice & turned it off both times..the fact that shane grew up the same way as most of us do in a boring town looking for something new really hit home to me..then he had a chance to have it all but he realized there's still bulls** to put up with..mike myers did a great job as steve..he definitely was very convincing and the ending was great..selma hayek although did steal the whole movie as anita...i'm not a fan of neve campbell so she really didn't shock me as a great performance in this one..overall i thought it was a great movie..it showed the great times of studio 54 but also the rough times of being left out & the sadness of the drugs..altogether a great film that didn't take much thought but was far more enjoyable than boogie nights..***,,Anonymous,Music
Falls short in almost every aspect.,"I really had a big expectation about this movie.  I was a kid in the disco era, but still enjoyed its decisively vigorous, if vacuous and musically sterile, tunes.  And of course, it was (still is) the culminating point of dance music.  However, when I listen to disco music, specially now that I am able to understand the joyful and morally permissive atmosphere of the 70's and early 80's, I get a feeling of awe that is somewhat lost in the film.And the film itself seems lost as to whether it is about the mostly underdeveloped characters, or the irresponsible fun-culture of the time.Anyway, the biggest surprise it that this is a criticism of the hedonistic spirit that reached its highest point in the club's parties; in fact this flick was more like a fable -a gross one- complete with a moral.So, as I heard so many people say... Boy:  did the studio mess up with this one!",,Anonymous,Music
Expected wild performance from Mike Myers....,"I was really underwelmed by the whole movie, but espiecially by Mike Myers. Having purchased a copy of Austin Powers, I am obviously a big fan of his. I have decided to see all of his work. This performance was too subdued.  Was Rubel this pathetic? Salma Heyek was good, but not overwhelmed here either.  Nobody else is worth mentioning.  Maybe the whole disco thing (from Studio 54 on down) was pathetic, and this movie captured it perfectly.  Hard to say.",,Anonymous,Music
"Who knew sex, drugs and disco could be so dull?","A disappointing movie somewhat redeemed by a good soundtrack and Mike Myers' inspired turn as cynical, self-aggrandizing Rubell. But the rest of the characters were cardboard cutouts and the plot was nonexistent. I've seen the talented Ryan Phillippe spin straw into gold before, rescuing a flawed script with a strong performance, but he doesn't do it here, and since his is the main role, of course the movie's in trouble. Mind you, his character of Shane is virtually unplayable. I call it the Forrest Gump Principle of Movies: the main character must be intelligent and/or likable, preferably both, but one will do.Shane isn't a very nice guy, and he's not too bright either, so we have nothing to root for. The other characters are equally vacuous and selfish and most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through the movie, relying on sex appeal to get them through. If the writer had put even a smidge of the thought that went into the characterization of Rubell into the other parts, this movie might have been much better. On the bright side, although I was in diapers at Studio 54's heyday, I'm told by informed sources that it's an accurate portrayal of the hedonistic, anything-goes disco culture. But it's not interesting enough to make me wish it was 1979 again. Intriguing idea scuttled by a script light on plot and sympathetic characters. Rent it for the eye candy factor.",,Anonymous,Music
What happened to the magic?,"Watching this movie brought back a lot of fond memories of the 70's.  I still wish I was old enough to get into Studio 54.  On with the review:  The movie was enjoyable with a lot of beefy guys and hot music. Acting was believable and I was astonished to find that the accents actually went with that era.  Almost flawless with a few mistakes that was easy to pick up. (i.e. The Met Life building was not around in the 70's, it was Pan Am) - Out of 5 stars, I give 54 3/12 stars.  I would have given it 4 stars although it lacked some of the magic of the 70's.  Hey, what happened to the rest of the great disco songs? :o)",,Anonymous,Music
I truly enjoyed it,"This film tells the story of a young man from Jersey City, who goes to Manhattan to work for the fanciest club that people can almost touch heaven.I watched the director's cut in the Taipei Queer Film Festival, and I was truly engrossed by the story. The young Ryan Philippe is magnetic in his role, as he gets transfixed by money, glitter and fame. He pays a high price for his lifestyle, ultimately causing rather sad events. Acting is great by the now big stars, but at that time unknowns. The story makes people ponder upon the priorities in life, and the need to choose between glitter and fame versus friendship and wholesomeness. The music is uplifting and fits the film well. I truly enjoyed it!",,Anonymous,Music
Mike Myers should stick with Austin Powers.,"This was one of the worst professionally made movies I have seen in a long time. It has the shoddy look of a low budget production but I'm sure it wasn't. There is probably a good film to be made about the idiots that stand in line to be insulted by snotty doorman at these trendy clubs, but this one misses by a mile. The acting is uniformally bad. Mike Myers is ludicrous as the club's owner. Judging from it's brief running time it has obviously been heavily cut. Hard to imagine that there was footage even worse than what is on screen. To see a movie that more or less covers the same ground, rent ""The Last Days of Disco"". At least that had wit and style.",,Anonymous,Music
A good movie for people who like movies about crack-sniffing geriatrics,"Ryan Phillippe plays Shane O'Shea (a name that could only be used in porno movies and bad movies like this) a young dreamer from New Jersey who dreams of making it to New York and going to Studio 54, the biggest club of the 70's and meeting the girl of his dreams, soap opera star, Julie Black (Neve Campbell) Well, he does make it to New York and his good looks allows him to go inside and to meet the club's homosexual owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers) and get a job as a bus boy. He meets fellow bus-boy, Greg (Ryan's long time friend, Breckin Meyer) and his coat check girl/aspiring singer wife, Anita (Salma Hayek) and lives with them. Of course Shane makes it big as a bartender and makes connections and poses for gay magazines and sleeps with every woman he sees, and then comes the down hill. Everyone weeps their sob stories and rise above them, but are still stuck in this terrible movie that centers around drugs, alcohol, sex, and bad film making. The end is one of the worst ending in film history when an 80 year old woman overdoses on crack on the floor of the dance floor on New Year's Eve. This movie is bad, that's about all I can say. The original cut was supposed to have been great, giving Ryan the ability to show of his acting talents like in Little Boy Blue, White Squall, etc. but due to extreme editing, all he does is stand around and act pretty. Neve Campbell is given little to do, including a terrible Jewish-New York accent and Salma Hayek is very pathetic as she tries to make the best of this train wreck of a movie. The less said about Ellen Dow the better. Breckin Meyer is able to show off his ability as Greg and ends up being the saving grace of the film.",,Anonymous,Music
Myers saves the flick,"Yet another banal lure-of-the-big-city-eventually-disappoints-the-ambitious-small-town- boy tale. This film is saved from complete and utter mediocrity only by Mike Myers' spot-on performance as Steve Rubell. Myers, for once, does not overact or mug for the camera. Instead, he nails Rubell's essence perfectly, down to the nervous nuances of his cocaine-fueled laugh. The soundtrack pales in comparison to that of the equally dull and lower-budget ""The Last Days of Disco.""",,Anonymous,Music
Utterly and completely painful,"My older sister was part of the 54 crowd and after seeing the movie, she looked at me and shook her head silently, her mouth turned down into a look of disgust. She asked me if the director had ever even been there. I had seen an interview on MTV with him where he said he hadn't ever been and I think that's where the problem lies with this movie. I rented this one on VHS and afterwards, I couldn't help feeling like this was given to the wrong guy to direct. No offense to anyone but the movie was obviously directed by a gay guy who was more interested in filming how hot the men looked than in the actual club itself. I don't mind seeing that kind of stuff in movies but in this one it just seemed like the focus was mainly set on that aspect of the era and I felt that not enough attention was being paid to the myth of the club. As you may or may not know, Studio 54 was a legend in it's own time. There was a lot more that could have been done with this movie, other than release this hack product. This could have been an epic masterpiece, not an undernourished crock. Come on, how could this movie clock in at just above an hour and a half? This could have easily been an entertaining three hour movie that would have covered the rise and fall of this famous nightspot in rich detail. It seems that no one else involved with the movie thought so because the movie seems preoccupied with meaningless accuracies and weak characters. This movie just could have been something special. Hell, Boogie Nights got it right. They should have let Paul Thomas Anderson do this one, he probably would've turned something out that would've been watchable. Maybe it wasn't the director's fault, maybe it was the work of meddling producers that caused this film to explode but I can honestly say that just from the endless stories my sis had told me of 54, they got this one all wrong. Maybe we'll see another 54 film in the future but after this crockery, I doubt anyone will get excited about it with the taste of this one still lingering. The acting by nearly all of the principals is horrendous. I like Ryan Philiipe actually but not here. Way of the Gun was more like it. Neve Campbell seems to have exhausted her bag of tricks because I thought she was still playing Sydney from Scream. The only positive thing I can possibly say is that the movie has a great soundtrack, even though it could've used a couple more tracks that 54 was known to play regularly. It's a little run-of-the-mill but contains a couple of the essentials. And lastly, Mike Myers delivers a knockout performance that hints at what this movie could have been if it had been done properly. He's the only one that walks out of this one unscathed. Everyone else, head to the showers and take a bath cause you stink! I didn't even rewind the tape when I brought it back to the video store that's how disgusted I was! I will never watch this horse pucky again. Unless, I wish to inflict further trauma on my already damaged brain. And I'll say it again, with the exception of Mike Myers, if you were involved in any way with the making of this film, take a bath cause you stink! Rating: * out of ***** (and that's ONLY because of Mike Myers)",,Anonymous,Music
