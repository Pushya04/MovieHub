One of the most memorable plot twists of this decade,"I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island is at the top of its genre,"Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
No one likes to be messed with.,"Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself?Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained.Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir.The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise.Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully.This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it.This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing.Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.10 out of 10-CLS",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie of the decade.,"It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good.
""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many ""illusions"" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from ""Memento"" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.
On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.

All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...,"There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you've read the novel multiple times, you'll feel like you're reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing ""the most dangerous patients,"" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall's The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn't go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That's not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility's faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.However, that mood isn't sacrificed and ""spooky"" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a ""best of"" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my ""Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows"" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he's quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn't mean anything though if you don't have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn't among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there's always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn't rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.Shutter Island isn't just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I've been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I've been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those ""in the know."" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I'll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in ""Spoiler"" tags.

Mind Games,"Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction.Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Of all the movies in theatres to see, this is worth your time","I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't miss this one - review from a skeptic.,"From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony.All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't you get it? You're a rat in a maze.,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be.From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play.Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another Excellent Film by Scorsese...,"Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!).

Counting down the days until I can add this to my DVD collection...,"Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it's not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.9/10.

Atmospheric and clever- really makes you think deep,"I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.I do agree it is too long and that it drags in places, that Shutter Island is still very impressive and gripping. The cinematography is great, dark, expressionistic and Gothic. Same with the scenery which is both picturesque and bleak, while the direction is superb, almost operatic and imaginative. The screenplay is intelligent and the plot gripping and clever, however Shutter Island is one of those films that if you miss a line of dialogue or a plot point you are in danger of missing something important. I also liked the music- admittedly the repeated bass motif which has a knock-on-the-door effect makes us think immediately that something out of the ordinary is going to happen but I have to admit it was haunting, while the Mahler chamber music piece along with the more gut-wrenching images at Dacchau was put to effective use, though coming from a classical music enthusiast I never knew Mahler wrote chamber music.The acting is very good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both excellent, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good too. Max Von Sydow is also good, and although I wasn't sure about Michelle Williams at first she was suitably eerie and haunting. Finally the ending, some have said it was clever, others were underwhelmed by it. For me, I found it very clever and it was actually the part of the film that made me think about most. Of course it leaves questions rather than answers, but I think that was the point, it is ambiguous and open to interpretation and I certainly would have never thought of that. There could also be the possibility that there is no right or wrong answer, we are left to wonder for ourselves whether he was sane or not, and I think that was a reason for why the film ended inconclusively- I for one asked myself what did happen to Ted?Overall, very gripping and clever, with an ending that really makes you think. It is not what I consider a perfect film, but the direction and acting makes up for any misgivings. Plus it is probably a film you need to see more than once to completely understand or appreciate it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

""Shutter Island"" is extraordinary to look at. It has some bravura shots that will take your breath away.

Martin Scorsese's direction is excellent and it's beautifully filmed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
THE BEST PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER,"'Shutter Island' is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, movies ever directed by Martin Scorsese. One cannot comprehend the experience in one-go. You will have to watch it twice or thrice to understand it enough, which is why Scorsese himself said back in 2010 that the movie would earn double profits because of people going to watch the movie twice.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. They have, without doubt, given an excellent performance. And since it is directed by Martin Scorsese, you will of course be appealed by the cinematography and direction. But what's the most striking feature of this movie, the thing that makes this movie a real success is it's plot. The movie is an adaptation of the 2003 novel 'Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane. The first half of the movie is calm and steady, but it is only a setting up for the terrific, unexpected ending which is absolutely shocking and jaw-dropping. There are several clues and intentional continuing errors that foreshadow the twist ending. The film is also filled with anagrams reminding me of which, did you know that the title 'Shutter Island' is actually an anagram for 'Truth and Lies'.The background score is also amazing, especially the one by Gustav Mahler. The background score maintains the rythm of the movie.There is only one inclusion by Martin Scorsese in the film which was not originally in the novel, the dialogue ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", which happens to be one of the most famous quotes in cinema.Overall, 'Shutter Island' is completely watchable and enjoyable. There is a lot to learn in this film while it intensifies you. Personally for me, it is the best psychological thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Shocking and Brilliant,","Shutter Island is an absolute breathtaking movie with a tremendous storyline that will keep you interested all the way through and a brilliant cast that all follow through with their performances in an overall terrific film once again from the great Martin Scorsese.The movie sounded pretty plain to me,I thought it would be an average thriller that I would enjoy but it would be pretty forgettable,but it totally wasn't,the movie had me curious and also confused,and the twist was one of the greatest,most surprising and most shocking twists i've ever seen in a movie,I literally never suspected it,not even once,and when it did happen I still didn't believe it.Shutter Island is a must see for all fans of Leonardo DiCaprio,Martin Scorsese,thriller and mystery.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio),a US Marshall,sets out with his partner to a mental institution in a quiet island to investigate where a missing patient could have gone.But there's something suspicious about the island that they didn't bargain for.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
one of Scorsese's best,"I read the novel so I knew the story going in, and I still got chills in several places and really was moved at how incredibly good this movie is. I won't get into the plot, because that could spoil things, but Leonardo DiCaprio investigates a missing patient/inmate in a top-secret island fortress for the criminally insane. He keeps getting frustrated as his interviews with doctors and patients raise more questions than answers. Ben Kingsley, who plays the primary doctor on the island, deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, and we will see how far the rest of the cast and movie will go into next year's awards.The best comparisons for me were the Shining, for the psychological horror aspects of both movies. And a little bit of Silence of the Lambs, when the hero goes into a row of cells to talk with one of the inmates/patients. DiCaprio is good, but not up to the level of a younger Jack Nicholson, who would have been absolutely brilliant in this part when he was in his mid-thirties.I am not sure if someone who hasn't read the book will be confused by some of the story... or simply be blown away at how it unfolds.I have seen all of Martin Scorsese's movies and this is one of his top 5 or 6, better than Cape Fear, Aviator and the Departed but a hair below Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver.This is a very scary movie, the truest horror film Scorsese has ever done. I can't recommend it to my wife or otherwise squeamish viewers, there are too many terrifying moments for them to enjoy it.What a great movie, I will surely see it again in the theaters. Haven't seen one twice since the Hurt Locker, and before that one it's been 10 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It had potential to be so much better *sigh...,"Like any fan of Scorsese, I was very excited to see this film, but left disappointed. The build up of the story was fantastic: Hurricane season. Deary and moody. Epic shots of this huge, foreboding island. Haunting score that puts your senses on alert. Ominous mental asylum. Everything hinted at an instant classic thriller; another Scorsese masterpiece. With the 1950s setting, the U.S. Marshals/detectives, missing person case and the bleak tone the film was establishing, there was even a noir feel to it.As the story progresses, the protagonist (DiCaprio) starts having these off-kilter flashbacks, and among one of them, a story that tells of his time in the Second World War. This is where I think the film hits its highest note. How all these different flashbacks fit into this puzzle that is this mental asylum, Shutter Island, is the mystery you're anxiously waiting to be unraveled. If your history is up to par then you'll know how fitting the WWII plot element is to the overall story of the film, which is also ultimately where I think the movie left me underwhelmed. I understand this film is based off of a novel, a set script, but I wish Scorsese would've explored more of the aforementioned plot element and done away with the tired, cliché story that eventually unfolds.To the film's credit, the cinematography, score, set design, wardrobe and the often forgotten, lighting (very creepy and effective at times), were all marvelously done. DiCaprio, who I'm not a big fan of, was actually quite enjoyable and solid. Often times he doesn't seem to really fit the bill of the role, but in Shutter Island I was a believer. DiCaprio's character was very ""alive"" to me. The acting by the rest of the supporting cast were top notch as well. Mark Ruffalo, who I think is a very underrated actor, was a nice surprise as I didn't know he was going to be in this film.Overall, 6 stars or a B-. Worth the watch but not something I would eventually buy on DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Go See The Doctor,"A 1950s ward for the criminally insane isn't a pleasantry for anyone. The terror behind the walls has a mystique to the public. It's as though unspeakable acts of torture can exist within the confines of padded rooms so long as the public never witnesses first hand. The isolation, or in the case of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island the possibility of it, could be enough to drive you insane.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Having met up with new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), he's on assignment to investigate the disappearance of Rachel (Emily Mortimer) from the secluded mental hospital on Shutter Island. During his visit, Teddy is plagued by vivid recollections of his days as a soldier liberating a Nazi death camp and visions of Delores, his deceased wife (Michelle Williams). These tie in with Teddy's ulterior motives: investigating rumored inhuman experiments and locating his wife's murderer.I didn't read the book; get used to it. I watch movies and I review them on their own merit. I'm not one to bicker about the source material being wronged when I know full well that a book typically contains an unfilmable heap of situations that need to be whittled down into entertainment in a convenient sub-three hour block. I care about the movie, and in the case of Shutter Island I speculate that fans of the book will have a far different experience since they should have a very solid notion of what happens. For me, someone new to the material, Shutter Island is captivating.When it comes to the plot there is a ton that I'd like to discuss, but can't simply because this is a puzzle film and I don't want to ruin it's intricately woven pattern of suspense. I'll say that some elements are very familiar, but that doesn't stop it from being a shocker. Elsewhere I can say that it's a well-crafted film on technical levels. The visions of the dead wife are often complemented with CGI that's used with discretion. Cinematography is strong, showing the colors reminiscent of a similar era prison film, The Shawshank Redemption. Originally I felt that the theatrical score was beating me over the head, but it didn't take long to assist in providing atmosphere. Editing also plays a role as cuts are made in unorthodox fashion, purposely creating misaligned audio, but this pertains mostly to the dream sequences. The cast even excels as each role becomes deeper than speculated. Leo gives another powerful performance now that he's cleared the hurdle of being typecast as ""the kid"".When it comes to the twisted thrillers, I prefer endings to be less blatant. With Shutter Island the longwinded conclusion spells out every last possibility. I'm not looking for something open to interpretation, but requiring more participation. There's still plenty of evidence to spot that you'd want to view it again for the details or chat with friends. As I think more about it, that's what separates the thrillers from the horrors. The thrillers make you think about outcomes, motives, and twists. Shutter Island doesn't tie itself into a knot, but it gets close. That frustration can polarize an audience, but if you've trusted in me this far then you're ahead of the game.NOTE: If you are playing the Shutter Island drinking game, be sure to take a shot each and every time Mark Ruffalo says ""boss"". That's the only rule you'll need.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Twisted, somber, but hugely entertaining Scorcese thriller","Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together.Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio).Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Shutter Island - Intrigue and Assumption,"Shutter Island. The story starts you off with a strong suspense of something really wrong in the so called island. It then develops a very subtle intrigue to the story, which keeps us assuming and guessing repeatedly on what the actual truth is.

The Mind as Prison,"Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision.The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story.In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as György Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time.

"Predictable, yet Scorsese","I am an extreme movie goer. So obviously I follow the works of the great Martin Scorsese. I heard this movie was also a thinker and much like an old style Hitchcock film. Considering Hitchcock is my favourite director and is a master at his work and a genius at the art of psychological horror...I was overwhelmed with excitement for this movie.In all I say the plot of this movie was...okay. Don't get me wrong, it's very smart and completely original and as far as I know not done before. However, if you are as much a movie buff as myself this twist ending is a give away obvious one right off the bat. this is why it lost 3 stars for me. However, it touches on many emotions and other aspects besides the main plot of the film and runs deeper then its first visible roots. A truly complex film.Now on too why I gave it the seven stars. Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese. If for no other reason, see this film for its amazing directing. Shutter Island truly brings back the psychological thriller and is both beautifully and horrifyingly directed. This right here is why Scorsese is known for being a true dominator of his medium.And so for Performance of the movie by both the actors and director I give this movie a probable 9.5 but for plot and story I give it a probable 6. I recommend it, but for those real film buffs out there who know the layout of how movies work and are good at guessing the twist endings...don't get your hopes up.

Wonderful movie,"I guess when looking at the names of director and the cast one knows that it can't go wrong. And it didn't. I loved this movie through it's 138 minutes and it didn't even seem that long.Now I can't say if the big twist towards the end was very well hidden. Unfortunately I heard it before I watched it. Which is not surprising considering that I waited almost 10 years to do so. So when watching there were moments where I would think ""Now here people should have guessed it"". Especially in the second half of the movie. But this could just be me knowing it and seeing the clues more clearly, just as people who rewatched it did. But regardless, even though I knew the ending I really enjoyed the movie so somebody who guessed it at the very beginning but still was questioning it would as well.The cinematography is great. So much film noir in it. It is a movie that gives one this suspense that keeps one watching. The cast is all great. Including the small parts of guards and mental patients. And the main characters gave so much character to the movie. I won't list all their names because I literally would list all of them. If anyone of them would played by a different actor it wouldn't be the same.And I loved the ending. I am not talking about the twist that I already discussed but the very ending.

Scorsese and DiCaprio Do It Again,"US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are dispatched to Shutter Island, a facility that combines mental health treatment and criminal detention. One patient, Rachel Solando, is missing and has slipped through the walls as if through evaporation. Where on the island could she have gone?DiCaprio and Scorsese are a great team, let's just say that right away. If you've seen ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed"" or -- my favorite -- ""Gangs of New York"", you are aware of the greatness these two can achieve. While I do not feel ""Shutter Island"" is on par with ""Departed"" or ""Gangs"", it can still be counted as a fine film in its own right.The scenery captures the feel of the 1950s and the dank lonesome feeling that accompanies insane asylums of this period. Much like Arkham Asylum, the very building itself comes off as creepy and disturbing as those it houses. Poorly lit, plenty of stairs and mezzanine, and a feeling of oozing insanity. The inmates here are nasty, not least of which is George Noyce (played by the same man who brought us Rorschach and the upcoming Freddy Krueger).Michelle Williams, while only seen in dreams and flashbacks, really captures the viewer with her role of Dolores. This is quite possibly her best role yet, overshadowing her work in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Could we see a Best Supporting Actress nod? I freely admit that tears were brought to my eyes by her performance.I appreciated how closely the film followed the book by Dennis Lehane (author of ""Mystic River""). Unfortunately for those who read it, the twists won't be as shocking, though you might pick up on the clues before your friends do. The film downplays much of the detective aspect, and almost completely removes the code-breaking parts. You could fairly say it has been dumbed-down.Scorsese, or his screenwriter, have also added in plenty of extra violence to turn this into a bit of an action flick. An extra gun shot here, a needle there, a firing squad sequence... this works well to keep viewers engaged. At the same time, the inclusion of the Dachau flashbacks dragged the pace down, and I think this will not work with some audiences. The biggest complaint I've heard yet was about the film's length.After seeing what I felt were disappointing previews for ""Shutter Island"", the film comes out well and on par with the book, a rare event. They use every tool at their disposal to amp up the visuals, and while the final twist may have you recalling other films (it's not the most original), all in all it's a fine piece of cinema. Along with ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" and ""Youth in Revolt"", it is one of the best films of 2010 (so far).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

HK Neo Reviews: Shutter Island,"Dark and intense mental therapy...Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and together with director Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio moves up a notch. It is not an understatement to claim that Shutter Island only works because DiCaprio makes it convincing. It may seem to be one of Scorsese lesser work in first glance. However, the film does not disappoints, with enough suspense and interesting moments to get us through to the finish line. The ending itself is what made this film a cut above genre conventions. The film ends by raising more questions than it answers and in turn allowing the audience to decide for themselves as to what really happened. For me, it works, but for those looking for answers, it will probably just leave you wondering. Shutter Island is like a classic noir flick, its dark, its murky, it's even depressing, but it is also quite a satisfying experience to sit through.The movie goes like this: DiCaprio plays a cop who is assigned to an isolated island with a mental hospital. The year is the 1950s and a mental patient have escaped the maximum security of the Shutter Island. Together with his counterpart (played by Mark Ruffalo), they explore the island and like a haunted house or a horror story, nothing is what it seems to be.Ben Kinsley is what you call a method character actor. He has the unique ability to make even the griminess of smile into something hidden or evil about it. He has the grin and looks of a cunning interior. Kingsley plays a mental health professor, but somehow he is more to it than that. A clever actor in his own right, Kingsley made his character quite an interesting one to watch. DiCaprio as mentioned before carries the film with both of his shoulders. Maturity has certainly passed him by and not for the first time, he continues to impress me with the emotional range that he possesses. His moment of mental breakdown is a joy to watch and if that moment near the end is given to a lesser light, the film may have already been blown off the rails. This is a steady-fast performance that works.All in all, Shutter Island is a departure from the director usual aim of winning awards, but that does not mean that Shutter Island is any lesser of a movie. With strong acting turns from the increasingly reliable DiCaprio and the ever intriguing presence of Ben Kingsley, Shutter Island is convincing enough to be believable. The thought provoking ending may actually be a blessing in disguise. There is a quote that leaves us pondering: ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" For me, what it means is that DiCaprio chose to erase his memory and die a good man. The reason to it is simple. One of the saddest and toughest aspects of life is to have a good memory. Memories are what shape us, but also is what makes us more cynical and bitter about the world. At the end of the day, Martin Scorsese has created a movie that allows the audience to come up with their own viewpoint of what happens. Whether that is a good or bad thing, it is really the way you approach and think...(Neo 2010)I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Intriguing, creepy, and engaging little puzzler - one of Scorsese's best","1954; US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is investigating the disappearance of a patient who has escaped from a psychiatric hospital on Shutter Island. Once Teddy begins his investigations, he notices strange anomalies such as; Rachel managing to escape from a room that has been locked from the outside, the fact that she manages to bypass all the other patients and security staff without anyone noticing etc. Daniels is puzzled by Rachel's seemingly 'unexplainable' disappearance and is determined to get to the bottom of it.I'll be the first to say that mystery films are probably my favourite genre (when they're done right) and films like Shutter Island help to cement that feeling. Shutter Island hooked me in straight away due to how creepy it looked - this was down to some superb cinematography. Then as the film progressed, I found that I was more and more hooked in. Shutter Island takes you in one direction, but then pulls you in another direction and it's all these twists and turns that help to keep things fresh. I felt a constant sense of paranoia throughout this film. I found that I never knew who I could trust when I was watching this film and this merely helped to increase the suspense. Daniels' dream sequences gave his character an added depth, but also added another layer to the plot. I found that Shutter Island not only kept me in suspense, but also kept me thinking and the two elements combined are cinematic heaven as far as I'm concerned.Acting wise, Scorsese has got lots of big players on board such as DiCaprio, Kingsley and Von Sydow to name a few and all the players on board put in stellar performances. As mentioned, the cinematography was superb and this really helped to give Shutter Island a creepy and mysterious feel.Where Shutter Island falters slightly is in the heavy handed way it dealt with one particular plot twist (which I won't reveal). Suffice it to say, this did lessen the impact when it was revealed. However, just when I was prepared to be majorly disappointed, Shutter Island throws in more twists and turns after the obvious twist was revealed and these added twists did surprise me somewhat.This is an excellent film that will most likely appeal to fans of psychological thrillers or mystery films.

A dark original work of mystery and intrigue with DiCaprio,"Without a doubt, another of Martin Scorsese's best films, Shutter Island is a clever and quite original psychological thriller. It is a story that has not been seen in other films and with an intriguing twist. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been a talented actor and here he does a wonderful job as Detective Teddy who will discover that his reality is not what it seems. It focuses a lot on the psychology of the character with a series of flashbacks and nightmares that are key to discovering the truth about this character. It has a very good atmosphere that knows how to combine suspense with dramatic moments. You can really appreciate the production, the photography and the dark atmosphere that can be felt in some scenes. The script is quite intelligent, giving many key pieces that come together little by little. The editing is somewhat questionable and some continuity errors are noted. The rest of the film is great and the way he handles trauma in a mind disturbed enough to create a different reality in order to bury said trauma is striking. Shutter Island is one of the best psychological suspense thrillers ever made and another great work by Scorsese. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Neither logical nor believable,"Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted for the screen by Laeta Kalogridis, Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller Shutter Island is set in 1954 on a remote island off the Massachusetts coast that houses Ashecliffe, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. This is where Teddy Daniels, a United States Marshal played by Leonardo DiCaprio, arrives with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient who was incarcerated after murdering her three children. The missing woman appears to have vanished barefoot without a trace from her locked cell during the night after leaving a strange note.Backed by production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, Scorsese builds a dark, foreboding atmosphere that soon escalates into full-blown uncertainty and dread as the story unfolds. Incorporating aspects of different genres, Shutter Island keeps the viewer off-balance and unable to ascertain with certainty what is real and what is fantasy until the very end. As the investigation begins, we soon discover that the marshal has some back stories of his own that are making things more difficult for him. These include nightmare visions of liberating Dachau at the end of World War II and of lining up and shooting Nazi guards as payback. He is also beset with migraine headaches and flashback visions of his wife Delores (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire.Teddy and Chuck question patients and orderlies who last saw the missing woman but things become more interesting when they interrogate the psychiatrist in charge, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley talks a great deal about his disdain for pre-frontal lobotomies and use of Thorazine and his preference for talk-based therapy but puzzlingly refuses to provide the investigators with important documents they need for their investigation. Also interviewed is Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow) whose Germanic persona causes Teddy to have flashbacks of Dachau and raises doubts in his mind that he is being told the truth. People talk in whispers and everyone seems to be keeping a secret and the attitude of Warden (Ted Levine) and Deputy Warden (John Carroll) only adds to the mystery.As a Category 5 hurricane rolls in, it becomes apparent that no one is going to get off the island anytime soon and doubts begin to arise in Teddy's mind as to whether or not there really was a patient that disappeared or whether he may have been lured to the island under false pretenses. Before long we are immersed in whispers of government experiments being conducted on prisoners in the island's lighthouse, an item straight out of today's headlines where a fully clothed, mutated human body was recently reported washed ashore on Plum Island in Long Island Sound where the U.S. allegedly studies dangerous animal diseases.Fear is ratcheted up even higher when Daniels reveals a personal agenda of his own that sends the investigation off on a tangent. Unfortunately, the flashbacks, visions, and other visual pyrotechnics pile up, and what began as an intriguing mystery becomes an ordeal of repetitive psychological horror with the screen often filled with tasteless images such as those of dead children and holocaust victims. Though the last fifteen minutes brings a degree of resolution, Shutter Island ultimately wastes the considerable talents of its outstanding cast with an overwrought and overblown production whose premise is neither logical nor believable.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"when you're looking for a plot twist story, this is one of the top of the list","I thought I was ready for the ending when my friends recommended 'Shutter Island' to me. I had been connecting the puzzle throughout every scene, without realizing what a mega puzzle it actually was. To sculpt such a giant plot twist was remarkable, and I would put it on my list with similar masterpieces that contain elements of surprises like 'Now You See Me', 'Fractured'.Leonardo wowed me, on how he could portray a character full of questions, only to find even a bigger question! Obviously, his acting in this very movie was the key that opened the doors to his next amazing roles such as the 'Inception', and 'Great Gatsby', because his characters have always left such an impression in his audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Situation Theory,"Scorcese is an accomplished cinematic mind. There is no question of this. When he dies, we will celebrate the loss of a talent.But his life has been compromised by limits in the depth of his religion of cinema. This has haunted him, and he will not be happy to die until he conquers this.The problem is simple. I'll call it the curse of the character, and link it to Dante, or even Homer. That it dominates much written narrative is purely an accident of war. This is the idea that humans exist as complete, each one of us carrying a universe within us that some of us are able to project and carry around us.If we build stories, then, the stories are about the nature of the worlds attached to characters. The characters can actually be tragic, manipulated by their own world forces, or even uninteresting. But no matter how you slice it, the narrative follows people and the containing world is an annotation, an effect. I believe this is ""Italian"" in film-making and Scorcese was captured by it. Unfortunately for him, the cult of the actor in Hollywood (and associated market forces that support critics) feeds this. So he adopted deNiro and made films that were at least competent. But the camera could only follow bodies.But all the real juice in cinema is in this idea of noir. It has penetrated everywhere to some extent because it matters. The religious cosmology of noir has a world that exists apart from any humans. It pre-exists, has its own laws and dynamics. Being external to the souls of humans who appear, it blows them around and tinkers with those souls.It has the advantage that the film's narrative can entangle the existence of the world with the viewers and their needs. It brings the film to the viewers in a sort of contract, a dialog that cannot be refused. It also allows the camera to exist in a world apart from the characters. Thus, the filmmaker can inform us of the situation. Space matters. Texture, color, light all have their own lives.Scorcese has been bothered by the fact that his films did not do this; could not. Here he was with the craft, the skills, but not the vision. So in one of the most intriguing inner stories in Hollywood, he attempts to escape his own limits.He shifts from deNiro-like actors to deCaprio style. He tries, really hard to discover. His ""Gangs"" was a noble attempt, but a failure because of problems with funders. ""Aviator"" was his first noir success, helped by the influence of Cate (playing Kate). Check out the story, which mirrors Marty's plight. Marvel in that cool scene where the room is filled with strings.The rat movie was a retreat. And now this. It is a pure victory, an personal achievement. Some of us have been rooting for the man in his encounter with himself and are doubly rewarded with this film.There are elements in the story that reflect this quest of the filmmaker. I wouldn't want to focus on them too much here, because the reader may think that the story itself matters more than it should. But see the references to Spielberg's similar quest with ""Close"" and ""List?"" See the imposition of the noir narrator and the notion of slippery trust? See the folds in the anagrams? Look how at the end, we have shifted truths but the ambiguity remains. He could indeed still be the investigating cop, now compromised. In fact, this could be a flashback to the episode we learn happened nine months previously. (Note in particular how the tie changes toward the end.)Those story elements would have made a good comment. I'll do that elsewhere. Here the point is to look at how Marty has a new eye. Look at how the camera is almost never anchored to a person. Look at how it always — always — starts with some focus on an element of the world then slips to catch a person (always Teddy, then his focus). Look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation.Look at how for the first time ever, Marty shows space: flying paper, ash, dust, hail, leaves, trees. Look at how he even explores the architecture of water a bit. Watch with admiration as he announces his love for Thelma (his editor), and allows her some rubato in how the thing is paced because she owns the clock of the world, now hers.My immediate context: I saw this in a theater with a pride of chattering young Marines. They could not follow the story and left laughing at themselves.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A rewarding and well acted 120 minutes,"I often enjoy it when what some may call 'prestige' directors forte into what some may call 'mainstream' move-making for a film or two. You get the best of both worlds; a film palatable for a Friday night, and as well as weight behind the camera. Few would argue that Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Ron Howards Angels & Demons are their respective best work but I'm not one to throw on Citizen Kane over Bad Boys II when I simply want to relax after a day in the grind.The same can be said for Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. While I don't want to make unfair assumptions about how other filmmakers would have handled the material, his prowess behind the camera certainly adds some pizazz and gravitas to the material. Shutter Island is the third successful instance of a Dennis Lehane novel, after Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, being brought to the big screen and here's to hoping this streak of winning adaptations continue. This time around we follow U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) as they investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from a stormy island penitentiary off the coast from Boston in 1954. The shifty resident doctor (played deliciously by Ben Kingsley) does not make things easy for the two as Teddy is haunted not only by the facility itself, but by past demons of his wartime traumas and the death of his wife years earlier.Revealing much more than that regarding the plot would an injustice to the viewer so I shall say no more. What I will reveal is that DiCaprio turns in another star performance and while I feel it may be lost in the shuffle of the year to come, it is an award worthy exploit. His character complexly navigates between instances of professional integrity and unhinged paranoia. Ruffalo is by all means good in his role but it is, to be blunt, unmemorable. Not for his acting but for how the character is written. The real star is the set design and art direction which never release its grim grip for the length of the film.There is nothing overtly terrible about Shutter Island only that there is nothing outwardly remarkable about it either. The middle portion sags before its fantastic conclusion and there are a few too many flashbacks and dream sequences all of which add up to a solid, but not great genre exercise. Contrary to the ominous aura of the film, the score utilized is far too brash for its own good; clanging and banging its way through the Gothic atmosphere. While I would not go as far as to create a direct comparison, it recalls the disastrous score from 2008's Blindness. It could have gone a long way to use more Drag Me to Hell style acoustics, which utilize everyday objects and sounds to eerie effect.As is the unfortunate case with many thrillers and horror flicks, I cannot see Shutter Island standing up to repeat viewings with much potency. I will not deny however its sinister mood and great performances kept me more than entertained for 120 minutes and with its complex and rewarding twists it is still the best movie of this young year.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Psychological and Emotional,"This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still find some new subtle clues, messages, and twists. I watch it every few years, since it came out, and I still find things that make me sit on the edge of my seat and excitedly point at the TV. It is so incredibly thorough down to the smallest detail and it keeps you glued to the screen. The depth of feeling and emotion Leonardo DiCaprio played in this is so beautiful and intense. It's infuriating to think of all of the outstanding work he has performed over the years and only just recently won his first Oscar. I believe he was absolutely deserving of one from Shutter Island, let alone his other performances.If you can, pick up the Blu Ray and watch the extra features after the movie. One of the coolest things to me was that they actually brought in the Medical Director from the now defunct, extremely notorious Bridgewater Hospital which was one of the most ill-reputed mental institutions in the United States. The fact that he leant his experience into creating the atmosphere and emotion from his own work into this movie was amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter is an excellent  film!,"Shutter Island is one of the most intriguing film , which I have ever seen. When I started to watch it, I thought that is not interesting film at all because I don't like detective stories about policeman. But it amazed me at all .This film is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane . It is take place in the mid-1950s where a main character, Teddy Deniels and his partner Chuck Aule, are sent to an island where there is a security prison for patients with some methods health disorders and many of them are so dangerous for other people. The plot is very unusual and unpredictable . You want to watch it and to see what happens at the end of this story.This horror film with tons of atmosphere to music ,directions and set to a wonderfully story.I believe that the main idea of the plot is to find your demons inside your own island in your head. Not only Teddy doing it.As for actors, in this film you can see Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy Deniels (main character). He gave one of the best performances hero and showed a man who has their own «demons» and many strange things inside him. He tried to solve the mystery of the island and this situation was really important for him. I'd recommend this film for people who like detective and mysterious stories with unpredictable ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"**A Gripping Psychological Thriller That Keeps You Guessing""**","Martin Scorsese's *Shutter Island*, is a masterful psychological thriller that intricately weaves suspense and mystery, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, the film features a haunting atmosphere, compelling performances, and a labyrinthine plot that delves deep into the human psyche.Set in 1954, the story follows U. S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), who, alongside his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), arrives at the remote Shutter Island, home to a psychiatric facility for the criminally insane. They are there to investigate the disappearance of a patient named Rachel Solando, who seemingly vanished from a locked cell. As the investigation unfolds, Daniels grapples with eerie surroundings and the facility's mysterious staff, raising questions about the island's dark secrets and the true nature of sanity.Scorsese's direction seamlessly blends the palpable tension and Gothic elements, creating a gripping atmosphere that feels both claustrophobic and disorienting. The cinematography is striking, with sweeping shots of the storm-lashed island and dimly lit hallways that enhance the film's overall sense of dread.Leonard DiCaprio's performance is a standout, effectively capturing the character's turmoil and haunted past. The relationship between Teddy and Chuck adds depth to the narrative, as their partnership evolves amidst the growing sense of paranoia surrounding them. The supporting cast, including Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, deliver powerful performances that further enrich the film's unsettling intrigue.What truly sets *Shutter Island* apart is its ability to provoke thought and maintain suspense. The story invites viewers to ponder the themes of guilt, grief, and the elusive nature of reality. As secrets are uncovered and lines between reality and illusion blur, audiences will find themselves questioning what is true and what is merely a construct of the mind.Ultimately, *Shutter Island* is a cinematic tour de force that captivates and challenges its viewers.

For those who appreciate psychological thrillers that are rich in atmosphere and complexity, *Shutter Island* is an unforgettable journey into the human mind that should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not one of his greats.,"Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island reminds me of Hitchcock's successful Vertigo, Psycho, and most of all, Spellbound, without the success. The mentally unstable characters who provided Hitchcock hints of utter depravity in those classics in Shutter Island mainly serve facile plot twists.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal who, with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) goes to Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in 1954 to investigate the escape of a notorious murderess of her own three children. Almost everyone at that Boston harbor institution besides the patients seems a bit off center, even Teddy, who brings some psychological baggage to the job.While the cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic and the 19th century industrial brick insane asylum and its accompanying Civil War fort reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs with a touch of Alcatraz, the plot twists are indiscriminately telegraphed while Teddy's recurring visions of his deceased wife are too many and annoying. As the resident shrink, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is much smoother than Lambs' Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) but not half as fun. Nor is there a villain who can come close to Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Although Teddy is the center of the film, Scorsese spends too many frames on tortured close-ups, as if he were making sure that DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar next year.The film should have expanded the role of Dr. Naehring, head of the hospital, because the estimable Max von Sydow could have saved the film from boredom as the twists are telegraphed obviously and way too bluntly. In its favor, Scorsese plays deftly, if not a bit too obviously, with different camera angles such as bird's eye and visual images such as bright red blood, reminiscent of the stunning work in Sam Mendes' American Beauty.When you've directed Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull, you have a tough time topping yourself. Shutter Island is not a film to be ashamed of; it's just not as good as his greats.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Insane(ly good),"This is a thriller that builds up very slowly. Really slow, so slow, that some people got bored. And got their fangs out for the ending. That's just a matter of taste then. Even the ending is low key and will not be there to satisfy anyone (though it is one clever way to end a movie, which left me with my mouth open).Martin Scorsese might have gone thriller at least once before, with ""Cape Fear"", but this time we really dig into another world. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out a great performance once again. Even small roles are cast with great actors to really give the whole thing some weight. It's a great psychological thriller ride then.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
who is 67?,"A fresh attempt to make a story with an unexpected twist to keep the audience guessing until the end is just what this films attempts to do. Attempts but doesn't quite succeed as well as others have before. The film does leave the audience wondering what really is going on. We have two detectives that arrive at shutter island and must figure out the mysterious disappearance of a patient.The set design and production values are well accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are accompanied by Ben Kingsley and perform outstandingly through the film. The acting isn't over done and is spot on for each character. The acting really brings to life the story. Although in parts the plot is quite disturbing and can make one look away and cringe for the most part it isn't full of holes and does all tie together.This film falls short however in the fact that it's so much of a tale about trying to figure out exactly what the real story is that you already guess what the real story is and then have to sit and wait for the picture to tell you what you already know. It's like watching the DaVinci code and knowing what the solution to the puzzle is, the intrigue loses something when you already have the answer to the riddle.All in all the film is something fresh and tries to be new, It's acting is superb and story line flows fairly well. It simply falls a little boring once you know the punchline. The ending line of the movie however does bump up the score one point just simply because you don't really know how it ends even after you know how it ends.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good but Predictable Psychological Thriller,"In 1954, the Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) from Seattle travel by ferry to the Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of the patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who drowned her three kids, from the mental institution for dangerous criminals Ashcliffe Hospital. Teddy is veteran WWII soldier traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm, Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees, discovers that one is missing and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the sixty-seventh patient of the Shutter Island.""Shutter Island"" is a good but predictable psychological thriller. The production has a high budget and consequently a great cast, costumes, locations and special effects. However, the major twist when Teddy Daniels finds the truth about the Shutter Island and himself is not a surprise. In this regard, ""Identity"" and ""Haute Tension"" for example, work better and better and really surprise the viewer after the plot point. Further, the IMDb Rating Top 250: #246 is absolutely overrated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ilha do Medo"" (""Island of the Fear"")Note: On 05 September 2023, I saw this film again.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island: A great movie on either side of the walls,"The trailer had me wondering if the movie would miss its mark. I was expecting the haunting atmosphere with a mystery to boot. I kinda wondered if there were going to be ghosts or evil creatures. But I left that in the back of my mind. I opted more for the mystery and atmosphere.Unfortunately, I expect DiCaprio to disappoint me because he just doesn't have that ""quality actor"" appeal for me. I am also aware I am probably not in the majority. But as it goes, I am slowly coming out of my cloud of negativity. This was one of DiCaprio's better roles. I liked him best in The Departed but Shutter Island is going to stick in my mind for a long time.Ben Kingsley was at the top of his game here as the mysterious Dr. Cawley. He was an easy man to be suspicious of thanks to his squinty eyes and devious smirks. Thanks also to the implications and direction of the movie. While DiCaprio and Kingsley easily filled the bill for leads, all the actors did a great job of keeping this viewer's attention.The atmosphere and scenery provided satisfactory background while the action and actors merged well to make this such a great, void-less movie. Yes, the sea was angry that day my friend, but actions, icons, trinkets and memories kept the restless mind rolling. Push came to shove when doubt tried to overrule belief. ""Up"" and ""down"" had no meaning or relevance when it came time to analyze. What did have meaning was the love for the mystery and love itself.Once again, Scorsese puts it altogether in such a beautiful way. You sir, are the boss! And I mean that in a good way.

""" Reality is a matter of circumstance, whomever you trust determines that  ""","The Second World War was one great big mess and those who survived a visit to the Concentration Camps were doubly affected. Famed film director Martin Scorsese and novelist Dennis Lehane teamed to bring his book to the big screen. The movie, like the novel is called "" Shutter Island. "" The year is 1954 and two U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent from the mainland to an offshore island for the criminally insane. The reason is simple, a violent and dangerous inmate Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams) has somehow escaped the maximum prison and remains at large. The two Marshalles are introduced to Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem very reluctant to divulge any pertinent information on any aspect of the place, patients or their protocol. With the warden (Ted Levine) watching their every move, it's difficult to proceed. However, with dogged skill, Daniels finally discovers much more than he's suppose too and finds himself the target of what he believes is a monstrous conspiracy involving Nazis, illegal experimental drugs and murder. The movie begins suspensively driven, shifts quickly into a dark mode and then flings the audience into the realm of the diabolical. All in all, the fast paced drama is another triumph for the team of De Caprio and Scoresese. Easilly recommended. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Highly predictable and just plain boring,"Either I am very clever or this was rubbish. I had the so called twist sussed within 5 mins of the film starting. It was just so painfully obvious that it had me doubting whether I had it right or not. But sadly there was no clever story writing...it really was that obvious. Don't watch this and expect a Sixth Sense ending.The editing was awful and the scenes were choppy. This movie was a blooper fest...full of scenes that just didn't join together.This is probably the hardest review I have written on IMDb because the film bored me. I just didn't care about the ending. From the very start til the end I pretty much knew I had it figured out so I didn't really care about all the pointless scenes in-between.When the end finally came I was glad I didn't care because my intelligence had been assaulted by another ""Bobby waking up in the shower"" ending mastered by the cult TV series ""Dallas"". All my watching was pointless because you were hit with a dumbed down ending that was partly explained by some poor dialogue.Some scenes were done OK (concentration camp) but some were just so green screen (rock climbing). If you are a fan of Cluedo then have a look at this but if you want a great film with a original ending then stay clear.As for the IMDb rating...another example of this website being managed by the film PR hype team. Never in a million years does this film deserve such a high rating. Probably the worst over inflated rating yet.Cant recommend...there are better things to spend your money on.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A thinking man's psychological thriller gets the royal treatment from Scorsese and company...,"Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A B-movie plot with ambitious themes,"The less you know about Martin Scorsese's latest, the better. The film opens in bright white light, which is gradually faded to reveal Leonardo DiCaprio's character, a senior investigator from a US Government agency, suffering seasickness on a ferry crossing. He is en route to the eponymous Shutter Island, to assist with efforts to find an escapee from the island's prison-cum-hospital; a facility that is home to some of the most notorious mentally deranged criminals of 1950s America.Immediately, we are hooked. The car journey from the ferry to the facility is filled with foreboding and intrigue, melding eerie sound textures with dark, bleak images of the unwelcoming island. Once we arrive, the curious behaviour of the accompanying police officers and the local staff, in addition to the more understandable actions of the patients/prisoners, further builds suspense, paying homage to classic Hitchcock techniques.The most impressive achievement is that the storyline is consistently riveting for a running time in excess of two hours, seemingly without a single wasted scene, shot or line of dialogue as the plot unfolds in lavish, cinematic scale. DiCaprio's mature and compelling performance, in a character not too dissimilar to his undercover police officer in The Departed, is complemented perfectly by Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and the wealth of heavyweight acting talents playing minor characters. A couple of minor plot contrivances aside, this is a robust and stimulating addition to Scorsese's canon; albeit one that it is unlikely to reach the same high plateau of critical acclaim as much of the director's preceding efforts.The film is based on a novel by the increasingly impressive Dennis Lehane, whose Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone were also translated for the cinema, and who was also a writer for The Wire. The themes and settings of Shutter Island represent a diversion of sorts, but it transcends the B-movie genre in the same way as the TV/movie adaptations of his other writings were much more than just crime stories.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Leo DiCaprio was brilliant & plenty of twists,I had been wanting to watch this film for a while and when I finally got round to doing so it did not disappoint. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in the role of the marshal Teddy Daniels and he really brought the whole film to life with his performance. Mark Ruffalo was also memorable for his portrayal of the supporting character and their relationship was a crucial part of the story so it was important that they both played their parts convincingly.What I loved about this film was the whole psychological aspect of it which makes it extremely gripping. It's the type of film which constantly makes you wonder who is telling the truth and it pushes the viewers to try and figure out what is really going on. As the film progresses and reaches the final stage there are more and more twists revealed. Even after having seen the big revelation at the end of the film I still know I could watch this film again in the future as it would be interesting to view taking into account the truth at the end.Even though this film is over 2 hours long it certainly didn't feel like it and the thrilling scenes and build up of suspension throughout made it go so quickly. This film is definitely worth a watch and some people may have mistaken it for a horror from some parts of the trailer but it was simply a good psychological thriller.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent film.,"I think this is just about as good as it gets within the psychological thriller genre. The whole cast are first rate and this has to be one of DiCaprio's best performances. Max Von Sydow is superb as always.The atmosphere is wonderful, Gothic and distinctly unsettling and the setting just perfect. The photography is beautiful and never over fanciful and the plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole two and a quarter hours, which is the sign of a great film. It is a return to the old fashioned thriller style, with relatively little in the way of special effects, which is one of its great strengths in my view.

way overrated (spoilers),"Was looking forward to seeing this yesterday and thought the set and music at the beginning meant I was in for a good ride. Boy were we disappointed. How this movie is getting all these accolades and rated so highly is a mystery. I guess if Scorsese is directing and Caprio and Kingsley are in it its automatically a winner, not this time. The movie isn't really boring, its the type of movie where you keep expecting something to happen and it never does.Just one scene after another leaving you with that unfinished feeling. Nothing really strange ever happens, which you would expect in a forensic mental hospital, its not particularly violent and the twist is really obvious. Too bad because Ben Kingsley is one of my favourite actors and his role as head Psychiatrist could've been a real scene stealer in a more interesting movie but his role was very pedestrian.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Scorsese + My Favourite Genre = Win,"After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening.Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice.Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience.That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It dispels any illusion of terror or foreboding when you know exactly what is happening the whole time. This is a sad sad movie for the legendary scorcese. It wasn't a horror movie in the slightest and while it tried to be a phsycological thriller it never once pulled it off.

Overlong but engaging b-movie psychological  thriller,"When a dangerous patient/prisoner manages to escape a secure and remote mental institution, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner are sent to investigate. Arriving on the island they begin their investigation but find oddity and suspicion everywhere. As their investigation stalls and is hampered by those in charge, Daniels starts to realise that not everyone is who they claim to be, and that not even he has been honest about his motivations for leading the investigation.Shutter Island came and went and it got mixed reviews. My girlfriend watched it on a plane and disliked it, so it took me longer than normal to get around to watching it. What I found was a solidly enjoyable b-movie thriller which treads a familiar path but mostly keeps the viewer guessing right to the end. Those who have seen more than one film involving an investigation in a mental institution will not be surprised to learn that things are not what they seem, and the film does well to buy into this tone and embrace the rather OTT sense of reality or unreality. The soundtrack is full of heavy horns that compliment this atmosphere further. So in terms of what it is doing it all works really quite well but the problem is that it is overly long and needed to be tighter with a shorter running time. By being in excess of two hours, I was still held by it but at the same time it felt that it was a bit excessive and the longer it took to get to its destination, the more likely the audience were to be pulling at it to move faster.The performances are good. DiCaprio marked quite a 2010 with this and Inception, both roles that are genre films but with which he was able to do a lot more in terms of his character's psyche. Here he keeps the mystery alive and he takes the viewer with him really well. Support is strong from Ruffalo, Sir Kingsley, Levine, Mortimer, Clarkson, Koteas and others – all playing things close to ensure that there is this air of menace and mystery maintained. Scorsese directs with excess in a good way – striking images are used and I liked the way that there are no obvious visual triggers between reality and hallucinations/memories, this works well and I enjoyed the blurring for the viewer.Shutter Island is not a perfect film by any means; for what it is it is excessively long and takes too much time at the risk of the viewer getting impatient with its pace. However it does engage and it does work well with the material thanks to strong direction and performances. Well worth a look as a b-movie thriller despite the big names involved.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty tedious (SPOILER),"Of course this is impeccably produced and acted (though DiCaprio here might be a matter of taste), but it's a pretty long slog in which not enough happens and the resolution isn't worth the wait. The supernatural elements hinted at by advance materials turn out to be nonexistent.Worse, this is a throwback to 1940s/50s Hollywood feature in that (HERE COMES THE SPOILER) various action and intrigue happens for the majority of the film...then the final reel is spent with some psychiatrist or other figure of authority explaining at length ""Well, what REALLY happened previously was just an elaborate and implausible charade designed by us to induce a healing repressed-memory catharsis in our patient! Now all is well! Blah blah blah blah...."" That ending NEVER worked (even in ""Psycho""), usually coming off as a con job and turning everything before it into one big red herring. Which is just what happens here.There are good performances by Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley (the latter two just getting one big scene each). Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams and Max Von Sydow are in a fair number of scenes yet get pretty much wasted in generic narrative-device roles. The movie is of course well produced, designed, shot, et al. But you know something is wrong when you're watching a supposedly terrifying thriller and midway you think ""Gee that 'creepy' island setting is attractive! I'll bet that would make a nice vacation spot!""I realize even Martin Scorcese has to do one for the box office every so often, but this uninspired genre piece (with a story more contrived and less resonant than the prior Dennis Lahane ones adapted for ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") feels like a marking-time exercise for everyone involved.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Island of high expectations but slightly lobotomized results,"Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level.The greatest news to announce is that ""Shutter Island"" lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an ""asylum for the criminally insane"" and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters – Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule – to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. ""Shutter Island"" first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for ""normal"" male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out.""Shutter Island"" is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that ""Shutter Island"" is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that ""Shutter Island"" ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found ""Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Good But Not Great,"A hurricane is approaching and patient Rachel Solando escapes from an insane asylum that's located in an island. She didn't try to swim away because the current would have killed her and washed her ashore. So, where is she? That's what U.S. Marshalls Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are trying to find out.Throughout their investigation they begin to wonder if Solando really did escape. Does a Rachel Solando even exist? Perhaps it's a trap. Someone wants them on that island and isn't going to let them escape. And with the hurricane nearby they couldn't even if they wanted to.That's the mystery in director Martin Scorsese's first film since 2006's The Departed, the movie for which he finally won an Academy Award. Like The Departed and even his 1991 film, Cape Fear, it's a thriller that'll have audiences on the edge of their seat. However, it is the weakest of the three. If this movie has one flaw (and it's only ONE flaw) it's that it relies too much on the mystery. Once you know the ending there's no reason to re-watch the film. It's two hours and twenty minutes of DiCaprio running around a mental institute. Aside from two or three humorous scenes nothing distracts the plot. It's on autopilot.

A plot of sensational details, an atmosphere out of the ordinary, incredible soundtracks, a crazy direction by Scorsese, more than perfect interpretations of Di Caprio and the rest of the cast, incredible costumes, a beautiful setting, an incredible plot, continuous twists, a huge writing. Everything in this film is perfect, nothing excluded, indeed, in my opinion there are things that surpass perfection. It is impossible to talk about and discuss this film without spoiling everything that happens during the film. This film is about Teddy Daniels, a federal agent who goes to the asylum on Shutter Island with his new colleague Chuck. Everything that happens then.... I let you find out! The characters are incredible and the evolution of the story and suspense are incredible. The soundtracks make all the scenes tense and full of suspense, even if they would be normal scenes. The special effects present are perfect, they seemed real. This film is a continuous interweaving, you have to be always careful to every little detail, especially in the end, otherwise...you are out of everything: this is just the beauty!

Save your money -- a bomb -- Scorsese is not Hitchcock,"Summary: This is bad movie. Don't waste your time or your money on it. There was not a single convincing, or memorable, scene in the whole two-plus hours. There was not a single character to care much about. Most egregious is that this is a suspense film with almost no suspense. The movie was full of clichés -- but virtually every one of them was handled without the grace that made them clichés in the first place. The ending was predictable. The plot was stupid. The music was not the least bit memorable. On the good side? Hmmm, I suppose the cinematography was very nice, and there was a lot of technique (mostly ineffective) with the cameras. Oh, and I liked the double-basses playing the fog-horn motif.In the elevator in the garage on the way back to my car, a couple was complaining about a movie they had just seen. ""What the h..l was THAT?"" ""I don't know dear. What a stupid movie."" ""I can't believe what a mess it was!"" and so on. I asked them what movie they had just seen: Shutter Island. We agreed with each other as they left the elevator: ""Hitchcock, except without anything good in it."" I will now do my best to pan this movie without producing any spoilers. However if you want to be *absolutely* certain to enjoy the ""suspense"" in all possible aspects then don't read any farther.Suspense? This movie certainly falls in the category of Suspense. Except, er, the movie has almost no suspense to it. There was no rhythm to the sequencing of shots, no building of tension, no small releases. The whole movie was flat, like watching a collection of skits pasted together. Alas, despite his success with Cape Fear (which was much more literal), Scorsese just seems to have no feel at all for Hitchcock-style suspense.Plot? The plot for this movie is both trite, and baroque. As narrative fiction goes it is about on the level of movies made from video games, except they don't bother to pretend. (Hey, for that matter, Silent Hill had a better plot than this movie did.) No part of this movie, not even a single one of the scenes, was believable. Most of it was just absurd. In the interest of no spoilers I have to tread lightly here. Scorsese might argue that he was trying to represent a particular plot device, but boy did THAT ever fall flat. Don't expect to make much sense, either, of the bits and pieces snatched from the real story in the original book. Plenty of scenes could have been dropped without the slightest ding to THIS mess of a plot.How trite? Nazi doctors, concentration camp memories, ""mysterious"" psychiatrists, ghostly presences, all of the most hackneyed and ineffective type. Let's see: the spiral staircase from The Haunting of Hill House, the Boogey-man from Silence of the Lambs, the shower from Psycho... need I go on? And, too bad, the list of trite / iconic references here is more interesting to ponder than the actual boring manifestations of them in the movie.Horror? I am not sure how, but Scorsese managed to make eerie, dripping, insane-asylum corridors not the least bit eerie or menacing, violent, criminally-insane killers on the loose not the least bit scary, or interesting, menacing psychiatrists with drugs in syringes not the least bit terrifying.Character? Sorry. Not a single character was convincing or interesting. There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Ruffalo, no sparks flying between DiCaprio and Kingsly. The great love of DiCaprio for his wife was entirely cardboard. The ooky prison-guards looked great for about five seconds and then went absolutely nowhere. What a disappointment from the guy who brought us all these rich characters in, say, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver (""Stop a car at a hundred yards -- put a bullet right through the engine block!""). The actors had nothing to work with in this movie.Engagement? Hmmm. If you can't manage to involve your audience with Nazi death-camp images, and children being murdered, you've got to admit that is pretty lame. But, this bomb manages to make both of these devices and many others sterile and void of any emotion. You also don't care about the wronged do-gooders locked away in an insane asylum, the hero of the story, or his side-kick...O.K., so maybe it gets two or three stars out of ten, but the hype is just too annoying for this weak effort from an excellent director.This movie was just dumb.

Gripping and extraordinary psychological-thriller with an unforgettable Leonardo DiCaprio.,"'Shutter Island' is a tough and gritty movie with thrills, tense, suspenseful and a lot of twists and turns. 1954. Bailiffs Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffallo) are sent to a remote island in Boston Harbor to investigate the disappearance of an unsettling murderer (Emily Mortimer) held at the Ashecliffe Psychiatric Hospital, a penitentiary facility specializing in dangerously insane people and disturbed criminals run by the sinister doctor John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) . Teddy has lost his family in an apartment fire years before. There are frequent flashbacks to Teddy's time in WWII as a soldier, and Teddy has internal talks where his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), gives him advice. McPherson (Ted Levine) is the deputy warden. Males & females are in different buildings with the most dangerous patients in building C and the marshals are told not to go without McPherson & Dr. Cawley accompanying them. They will soon discover that the penitentiary center keeps many secrets and that the island hides something more dangerous than the patients. Someone is missing !. Some places never let you go !.This exciting film with interesting screenplay contains psychological characterization, intrigue, grisly triller, tense situations and is pretty entertaining, though overlong . It's brilliant , atmospheric and slickly developed , almost a masterpiece . Major asset are the continuous suspense and marvelous acting though at the ending becomes into an predictable thriller film. Casting is frankly awesome with exceptional interpretations along with a glamorous cinematography by Robert Richardson. Martin Scorsese directs this complex and somber psychological thriller with a twisted script by Laeta Kalogridis, based on the novel of the same title by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone baby Gone"" both of them brought to the screen by Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck respectively.Shutter Island (2010) includes tension, emotion, violence, guilt, and the ghosts of the past as a backdrop, this story of madness and paranopia features excellent performances by a cast of the best Hollywood actors led by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is followed by Marc Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and others more secondary as Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Carroll Lynch, Robin Bartlett, Christopher Denham, Elias Koteas, among others.This gripping motion picture filmed in budget enough was professionally directed by Martin Scorsese, displaying some of his trademarks and characteristics .This prestigious filmmaker has made a lot of notorious and successful movies with the greatest actors delivering terrific acting, such as : ¨Boxcar Bertha¨, ¨Alicia Doesn't Live Here¨ , ¨Color of money¨, ¨Last Waltz¨ , ¨King of Comedy¨, ¨After Hours¨ , ¨Taxi Driver¨ , ¨New York New York¨ , ¨Gangs of New York¨ , ¨Raging Bull¨ , ¨Shutther Island¨ and many others .

The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell.

Another quality team-up from Scorsese & DiCaprio,"Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", among others. The story revolves around a missing persons case at an isolated hospital for the criminally insane circa 1954.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall sent to investigate the disappearance. However, he has already formulated his own hypothesis about the incident, one that involves secret government testing. The clues steadily accumulate, often creating more questions than answers, all the while ratcheting up the tension until we reach the final, climactic revelation.DiCaprio does a good job of carrying the film in what develops into a challenging, multi-faceted role. He is given strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Williams among several other notables in smaller roles. All in all, a talented ensemble cast.Scorsese's direction is as sharp as ever and he creates a number of memorable scenes. Frequent collaborator Robbie Robertson (of The Band fame) supervised the music, selecting existing pieces, some of which are quite striking. Multiple Oscar winners Dante Ferretti (production design) & Robert Richardson (cinematography) were also key contributors to the movie's atmosphere & authenticity.Having watched ""Shutter Island"" a couple of times now I feel that I have a better appreciation of the film's intricacies. Subtle touches that went unnoticed the first time around now take on new meanings with foreknowledge of the mystery's resolution. I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by the story's conclusion on my initial viewing but the fact that the movie stands up to repeated viewings is a testament to the quality of its construction. Ultimately, ""Shutter Island"" certainly deserves to be seen once but I feel that a second viewing is key to experiencing everything that the movie has to offer.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Eventually we reach the end and the twist is revealed to us as it is simultaneously revealed to DiCaprio. While watching the movie the second time everything its very obvious what's going on.

A story that grips and fills the viewer with doubt,"Martin Scorsese has delivered a controversial piece of dark filmmaking with the movie Shutter Island, set in Boston Harbour during the 1950's. The film holds the viewers in its grip with Leonardio DiCaprio playing a federal marshall with his subordinate Mark Ruffalo, who are investigating the disappearance of a patient (prisoner) on the island, a horrible place of infamy contrasting with its beautiful green landscape. It becomes clear that the condescending and smooth doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow are conducting experiments in eugenics, something he has despised ever since his wartime experience with the Nazis. Or so it seems. Then a series of traumas and flashbacks into his personal life cast doubt on the whole plot. We witness a series of exploits, family related tragedies, a cliffhanging on Shutter Island and a visit with a mysterious woman in a cave. The trauma of a troubled man on a mission casts a heavy doubt on the entire plot and his own personal sanity. A movie well worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Movie That Has To Be Watched Multiple Times,It's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in their careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much it's something completely different from Scorsese. The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time. This was one of the best movies of 2010 and Scorsese' most underrated movie. 96% from me would absolutely recommend this movie.,9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island,"For probably the first time, I was very excited about a Scorsese film. I have been left cold by nearly every film I've seen of his, either due to subject matters that I just cannot bring myself to care about or I'm generally unimpressed by the film. There are exceptions of course as Gangs of New York was flawed but very powerful and The Last Temptation of Christ is a masterpiece, but despite a blip here and there over the years, Scorsese generally makes films that don't speak to me.Well, with Shutter Island he had me. I have a weak spot for psychological thrillers set in historical asylums. I gravitate towards these films, and when they work, they quickly find their places among my favorites. I found myself comparing the trailers for Shutter Island with Brad Anderson's Session 9 and the detective films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (i.e. Cure, Retribution). i assumed that Martin Scorsese was influenced by the amazing atmosphere of the Japanese detective thrillers and was making his own. If Shutter Island hails from those influences, it doesn't succeed in duplicating the tone or attention to setting. Sadly, Shutter Island instead tries to be a M. Night Shyamalan film without the tension and unlike, Shyamalan, Scorsese gives away the twist immediately. Calling Shutter Island a disappointment is an understatement.Stop reading now if you want to avoid spoilers, because I'm about to give away everything.My biggest issue with Shutter Island is that nothing holds together and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. I hate movies that depend upon a big reveal at the end that finally explains everything. The biggest problem is that they almost never hold up to repeat viewings. Well, if Shutter Island had worked up until the lame and blatantly obvious reveal that Teddy Daniels is criminally insane, then I'd just be annoyed with it in the way that I am at the filmography of Shymalan, i.e. I was entertained the first time, but it completely falls apart with any scrutiny . If one could say the same for Shutter Island, it was be a complement.The problem is that the whole premise of Shutter Island is completely retarded. I realized to my disappointment very early on that Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) was not on the island to reveal a conspiracy, but as a patient. But are we really supposed to buy this plot? Would a mental hospital allow a delusional patient to wander about their facility for a few days playing detective in order to determine if he can be cured? Shutter Island's biggest failure is that it didn't make a lick of narrative sense. I enjoyed some of the dream sequences, but again, they allowed the truth of Teddy Daniels' crime to be so obvious as to made the last 30 minutes of the movie unnecessary for anyone who was awake during the first half-hour. In fact, the second half of the movie bludgeons you with Teddy's actual story, which was evident from the not so subtle clues throughout.However, there was one completely unforgettable part of the reveal. The moment that Dr. Cawley (Sir. Ben Kingsley) brings out the visual aids to show Teddy that all of the names in his conspiracy plot are anagrams, was the best bit of unintentional comedy that I've seen all year. But then, what could have been a downright cool detective thriller investigating the very horrific practices that happened in asylums during the first half of the 20th century, we get another movie with a non-nonsensical plot that is simply explained by the protagonist being insane. Yawn. My advice is to watch Quills, Session 9, or The American Experience: The Lobotomist for some intense, horrifying stories of mental institutions.",,Anonymous,Mystery
drowning in imaginations,"Every body has it's own imagination, dreams, fears and etc. But what makes us to get lost in our imaginations? What makes us to cross the line? What makes us to look crazy as much as we seem normal?I think this movie has answered some of those questions. I realized that when you have nothing to believe in, no one to trust in and you suddenly loose every thing you have, you have no way but going through your imaginations.By a survey at Scorsese's movies we see that most of them have a kind of apocalyptic atmosphere. ""taxi driver"", ""The departed"", ""The gangs of new york"" and the last one ""Shutter island"".

Gets under your skin.,"In the space of a week we have been given two very distinct examples of how to (and how not to) generate genuine scares. Joe Johnston's The Wolfman exhibited cheap, shallow attempts of frightening the audience, mostly consisting of lazy ""don't look around the corner"" moments that relied on loud noises and sudden movements to make you jump. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Scorsese - as you would expect from such a virtuoso director - demonstrates an innate knack for producing goose bumps, combining atmospheric sound design and terrifyingly vivid images – most notably during Teddy's dream sequences – that get under your skin to brilliant effect. Shutter Island is not a horror flick mind you. It is more akin to Hitchcock's The Birds; eerie, chilling and deeply disturbing. You'll probably not jump out of your seat once but, like Scorsese understands and Johnston needs to learn, it is what stays in your head after the credits roll that is of greater significance.Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island's narrative doesn't hold its punches back. Dealing with murder, corruption, alcohol abuse, mental sickness, genocide and torture; no dramatic stone is left unturned. Occasionally it feels a little heavy-handed, but what else can you expect from the guy who penned the source material for Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone? Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis commendably keeps Lehane's story moving, never allowing it to be bogged down with one particular issue ensuring the thriller aspect of the film – arguably what the majority of audience members will be seeing the movie for - gets plenty of room to develop. With a handful of twists here and there and information drip-fed methodically, you'll never be wholly confident in what you think is happening or, more importantly, what is going to happen.Regular Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio (he's starred in the director's last four films) is in top form yet again, adding clout to the ever-increasing opinion of this reviewer that he may well be one of the best actors of our generation. Willing to give himself over to the material completely, the onetime Romeo embodies his character with such verve and preciseness that he's never less the entirely convincing. Meanwhile Michelle Williams is quietly carving out a niche for herself as the tormented soul, her eyes able to convey so much emotion that words almost seem unnecessary; old-timers Kingsley and von Sydow provide their psychiatrists with the perfect amount of ambiguity; Haley is gruesome and sympathetic in a cameo role whilst Ruffalo plays the unfussy part of Teddy's partner with more subtle cleverness than initially noticed.Due to the class of Scorsese throughout his illustrious career this may not even make his top five, however 99% of directors around the world would gladly call this their masterpiece.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But as 'Shutter Island' progressed, I was soon immersed into the mystery of the missing suspect.Leonardo Dicaprio played an engrossing detective with an unbridled drive and determination that often clouded his judgement, but with the reluctance of Mark Ruffalo was kept sensible.The first half never dragged as it introduced new and interesting characters that added to the curiosity of the island which was also helped with typically Gothic set design.Unfortunately the second half became slow and confusing with an unambitious push towards the disappointing and predictable ending.I would have preferred to watch the first half of the film, stopped it and left the ending as a mystery for my imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

His constant photographer Robert Richardson does a great job of getting that rainforest island to look magnificent and Teddys dreams and flashbacks are nothing but adorable beautiful.Yes, there are ghostly shadows, rain that goes down from gray-tailed clouds and weathery men in trenchcoats with troubled ankle dragons.

"""Shutter Island""","This film was a traditional Scorsese picture. The cinematography was fantastic, acting excellent, music emotional and direction superb. That being said, I have trouble saying that this film is an instant classic. The technical elements were sound. If I were to go through with a score sheet, ""Shutter Island"" would receive a perfect 10 in each category, yet something about the film left me wanting more. I don't blame the ambiguous ending. On the contrary, I enjoy an ambiguous ending. (""Gone with the Wind"" anyone?) I can't put my finger on what it lacked for me, but I can safely say it was missing that something that I was hoping for. Perhaps, it was the hype that surrounded the movie. Well, say that's what it is...for now.Onto the positive aspects of the film, the first thing to strike me was the fantastic score Scorsese compiled. Classical music was used sparingly and effectively. Also, the use of silence in this film was remarkable. As Teddy (DiCaprio) is walking through the terrifying halls of the mental hospital, the silence scares the audience more so than the darkness and prison-like cells patients are thrown into.The cinematography was also fantastic in this film. I loved the switch in color palette between life on Shutter Island and the recesses of Teddy's mind. This plays a huge part in the story line, helping the audience decipher what is real and what is clearly a hallucination though even that can trip you up.The acting was wonderful. DiCaprio is at his finest. He is believably and charming. You can't help but empathize with his character, no matter what. Ben Kingsley is intellectually terrifying. Though not the same, his performance hearkens to Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Mark Ruffalo is overshadowed in this film but does a nice job. Emily Mortimer is quite convincing as a mental patient and Michelle Williams' depth was a pleasant surprise. I didn't think she'd play quite as large a role as she did.Scorsese directed.

Gripping throughout,"I knew I had to watch this the moment I saw the trailer, I went in with high expectations, and this still blew me away. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York... OK, not Cape Fear, but that was a mistake from day one(it didn't need a remake), the talent involved notwithstanding... I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting. There is plenty of bloody, at times gory, violence and disturbing content, relatively infrequent strong language, brief nudity and a sexual description. I recommend this to any fan of the director and thrillers that mess with your head. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A thriller produced for an intelligent audience, imagine that. Absolutely a superb film.","Visually, Martin Scorsese is unparalleled. But, if you know anything about cinema, you already knew that. This film isn't a masterpiece, or a storyline we haven't seen before (think along the lines of Identity [2003]), what this film is, is a beautifully crafted thriller. If you enjoy thrillers, you will enjoy this movie, period. I'm not just referring to the twists and turns in the plot either. When you deal with Scorsese, you get quality, and this film is no different. The acting was phenomenal; DiCaprio, Rufallo, and Kinsley delivered, big time. This flick reads like a great novel, and yet, it refuses to take on that distinctive and predictable Hollywood style (that we have all too often been gratuitously subjected to.) In addition, this film has such a realistic quality to it, that never once did I feel as though I had been cheated out of my money. If anything, the previews for the film don't do it justice, they have promoted it as a ""scary movie"", and that couldn't be further from the truth. I can assure you that Mr. Scorsese isn't looking for the cheap ""Boo! I got you!"" moment. It's just simply not one of those kinds of movies. He realizes he is dealing with an intelligent audience, and thus, he provide us (the audience) with a clever intellectually stimulating film..I commend Mr. Scorsese for not electing to go with a conventional ending, and although some people in the theater went ""aaww"" (in a bad way), I went ""aahh!"" (in a good way), because I understood the reasoning behind it. With so much humdrum useless junk in the theaters these days, and in particular so much junk in the thriller genre, it is truly a delight to witness a talented director like Martin Scorsese take on a project like this. As you can see, this was definitely my kind of movie, but I have a hunch that I'm not alone, and I have a hunch this thing is going to catch on very very fast.One last thing, I urge you to see it in theaters, your really missing out if you decide to wait until DVD for this one, trust me on that.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shut up! Shutter Island rules!,"Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant ""Shutter Island"" as I do to all of my reviews. ""Shutter Island"" is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called ""Shut-her Island"". OK, I will focus on ""Shutter Island"" before you guys think I belong on ""Shut-him Island"". Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of ""Shutter Island"" because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was ""dead in the water"" also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's ""critical psyche condition"" ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me ""twist & shout"" with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of ""Shutter Island"" does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile ""Shutter Island"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island An Excellent Suspenseful Thriller,"Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; ""We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls."" Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A real twist,"I got myself to watch this movie since a lot of people kept saying how much better this was than Inception. It's hard to compare the two movies, since they both do amazing at their own kind. I'm a true fan of Inception, but the great psychological content made this film absolutely unforgettable to me.Just to start with, we're in 1954, on an isolated island where an asylum for the criminally insane takes place (in other words, they have put some of my very favorite subjects together, nice). Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) visits the island on the purpose of investigating the disappearance of one of their patients (or as he calls them ""prisoners""), but from the very beginning he knows that something is wrong with the place. As the events go on, there are more and more weird things happening, and all together with Teddy's tragic memories as a war hero and from his personal life, he's starting to see hallucinations and feeling worse about the whole situation. Time passing by, he seems to be losing his sense of reality, and becomes more and more aware of that there's something the staff of the mental hospital won't tell him. He continues on with his investigation, but there are dark things awaiting him to find out. One question which is up during the whole movie: is there really conspiracy, or is the reason of the unreasonable oddity something more obvious, which he can't see through the veil of his past blinding him? The atmosphere of the movie is magnificent, and the acting was great as well. I'm not one big fan of DiCaprio, but I must admit that he did an amazing job in this movie, probably the most amazing act of his I have seen so far. The movie had its scary moments, and it was really exciting so it's nearly impossible to get bored of.I recommend Shutter Island to everyone who likes films that makes the audience think after watching them, or even read a couple of film analysis to fully understand what they have seen. In short, a beautiful masterpiece of modern cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Modern masterpiece,"Shutter Island is a breath of fresh air. An Intelligent and thought provoking film, that had my attention from beginning to end. Leonardo Dicaprio is on top form here, turning in a very credible performance as the troubled lead character.Wonderful musical score and atmospheric sets make this film extremely entertaining. The movie has a surprising ending that will make you ponder exactly what did happen.Some nice subtexts flowing through the film which will leave the viewer with questions to ponder and reflect on, long after the movie has finished.In summary, this movie can be recommended as a thinking mans horror film. Entertaining for sure, but with a depth and gravitas so often lacking in the horror genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was all about World War II?,"A few random observations that don't really add up to a theory of the movie:Some odd clues in the movie: 1. Dachau was liberated in the Spring of 1945, not the Winter. 2. Dachau is a town near Munich, so the weather was warm in Spring. 3. The sign ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" was over the entrance to Auschwitz in Poland, not Dachau. 4. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January, 1945, so it would have been cold, as shown in the movie. 5. The guards at Dachau were not executed by U.S. troops. Who knows what happened at Auschwitz? 6. Why does Teddy speak German so well? 7. Dr. Naehrung's name means ""nourishment"" in German.According to Ebert, much of the flavor of Film Noir was a depiction of the PTSD suffered by G.I.s in WWII.It is well known that the U.S. military conducted very dubious research during the 50s into the use of drugs to affect behavior.Is this the Dark Side of ""Men Who Stare at Goats""?",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent Neo-Noir flick,"I am very confused on why exactly this has an 8.2/10 but whatever. Don't get me wrong this is a decent film. DiCaprio phones it in a little which sucks especially compared to Mark Ruffalo's overacting. Ben Kingsley does a great job though. Same with Max Von Syndrow who played the German doctor. He was clearly inspired by Casper Gutman in the 1941 noir ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston. Just listen to the way he talks. ""My sir, you have excellent defensive mechanisms"" compared to Gutman's ""My sir, you are a most headstrong individual."" As far as neo-noirs go, their are many better ones. However, I would probably recommend Shutter Island.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who said Noirs were dead?,"Scorsese's genial work needs no introduction. Every full-feature film he has made in the last twelve odd years has been brilliant in some way or other. Shutter Island, his latest installment, is an instant classic. Having read a few reviews that chastised the film this reviewer feels the need to give the work the praise it deserves.Set in the 1950's, an age when, regarding attire, people dressed in much more stylish fashion than we do nowadays, Shutter Island pits the viewer with the usual trench-coats, police uniforms with flappy raincoats, tweed suits, hats, flowery female dresses and the rest that have now gone out of wear. Another aspect that brings the 50's back to life is the automobiles – we also get a shot of such a vehicle in Shutter Island.But the visual experience we are treated to with this movie does not end with the car and wardrobe, or the beautiful asphalt buildings of the penitentiary. The Island itself is worthy of mention. It possesses an air of insanity that is prescient from the very beginning, when the viewer's ear is invaded with overtly melodramatic insertions as the camera approaches the Island and DiCaprio and Ruffalo are arriving. Soon enough, however, we will begin to comprehend the significance of these details.Shutter Island is in much reminiscent of Hitchcock's work. While the movie is not set in black-and-white, it is more Noir than many Noirs were in their heyday. Not only does the music fit in with this assertion; as well as the shots of the cliffs and island, and of the surrounding water; but the progression of the story, that goes from mysterious to incomprehensible soon enough, transcending the real and reaching hallucinatory plains, aids in creating a masterpiece of an ethereal, ephemeral thriller.To be sure, such an ambitious project would not have been feasible had the director not only been intimately involved with Hitchcock's and other master thriller-makers' work but also without the aid of a stellar set of actors. DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, the incomparable Sydow, as well as the female cast all stand tall and play their parts to full effect. This could be one of the trickiest parts DiCaprio has approached in his whole career, and he has succeeded. It is a pleasure to appreciate the development he has undertaken since his frail days in 1999's Titanic.In summary: screaming Hitchcock, Shutter Island is an assault on the senses, an epic psychological journey into the most elusive, extreme confines of the mind. It deserves a place among the best such films being made in recent years. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A  savor-less salad of cinematic tricks ...,"Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply  lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic cliché, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clichés: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware  danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did itno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""?The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that  to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
King of masterpieces does it again!!,"I went today to see 'Shutter Island' with so many reasons and worries that would make me hate it, cause first of all I've read the novel (one of the best novels I've ever read) and I've never seen a movie before that was better than the novel it's based on and also due to some of the bad reviews this movie has got..but I have to thank God that I was wrong!! Every element of Shutter Island was top notch...Leo does it again and shows to everyone who questions his talent how brilliant he is by his performance as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams all gave superb supporting performances too. Cinematography and Lights had a major role in keeping the atmosphere of the movie as mysterious and uncomfortable as possible, it made you feel what Teddy Daniels is going through..and finally, the direction. Mr. Martin Scorsese, the king of masterpieces, gives us again another masterpiece of his. It's not only that he knows how to control all of the cinematic equipment he's got the way he wants, but he also puts the viewer's mind exactly where he wants..Through his image, this plot had more depth, more passion, more subtlety and much much more tension that made this movie literally surpass it's novel by all means..I read some reviews that complained about the predictability of the movie, which I didn't feel while watching it, but even if it is a predictable movie, this won't lessen anything from it's value..you can watch it for it's great performances, character development, the mysterious and tension filled atmosphere, the well thought and written dialog and an original score that helped keeping the tension for two and a half hours.

A good movie is more than an unexpected plot twist,"If you read why some people don't like this movie, it's often because of the twist - the predictable, foreseeable twist.To those critics I can only say that this movie doesn't even need to have a twist.Shutter Island builds up a surrealistic, dream-woven, poetic atmosphere. Since the whole story is imaginary and spins around and around in a single mind, having a twist means nothing else but coming back to our point of departure.So, to some, this movie has a twist. To others, it hasn't. It's relative. But that's not the point.Why are you looking for a twist anyway - what actually are you looking for? I don't get it. You never watch movies twice?

Scorsese has once again brought a great film to the playing field!,"First off, if you are a fan of Scorsese' previous films (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Departed), you need to know that Shutter Island is a whole new style for this director.Shutter Island is a psychological thriller, starring Leonardo De Caprio as Teddy Daniels, that attacks our fears on an entire new level. The overall dark tone and bleak state of mind we are in builds and builds, never letting go through out the movies entirety. The film is thrilling, captivating, and most importantly, extremely entertaining. I was not once asking myself when the film was going to be over and found myself so engaged in the story that, at times, was unaware I was even watching a film, but that I was living it.Some have complained that they are dissatisfied with the ending and saw it coming from miles away. Yes, you may think you know where it is going, that you anticipated the right turn when in arrived, but no one will be expecting the sudden left turn it makes in the films conclusion.While Shutter Island was made by a true master of the film trade, one thing you will find unpleasantly delightful, is the director's ability to genuinely creep you out in several terrifying scenes. The film doesn't rely on loud bags in the silence (although a few do occur, and will make you jump) but more on dark imagery and even darker dialogue that never lets up and brings the tension to a painfully disturbing level. This one will not escape your thoughts so easily.The only major flaw I found in the film was within the ending. Not to say it wasn't terrifying or original, but the mystery revealed, in my opinion, is one that has become quite overplayed and generic in recent years. That being said, Scorsese adds his usual twist and craft to it, dressing it up in an entirely new way.I found Shutter Island to be a fantastic film and encourage everyone to go see it. Ol' Marty hasn't lost his touch as a truly talented film maker and seeing this film puts you in store for a great ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An excellent thriller,"Martin Scorsese has proved time and again that he is one of the greatest film makers ever to have lived, with even his not so good film are still better then most of the films that come out. After winning his long awaited Oscar for The Departed Scorsese took his time before delivering us Shutter Island.Set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned a case to go to a mental institute on Shutter Island, off the coast of Boston. A patient, Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) had escaped from her cell and it's clear that there was no way she could have done it alone. Teddy starts to suffer dreams and flashbacks involving when he helped liberate a concentration camp in Germany, and messages from his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams), offering him guidance. Whilst investigating Teddy becomes paranoid, believing there is a wider conspiracy, with patients being coached, and that the leading psychiatrists Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) were conducting experiments on the patients and that Teddy's arrival on the island was a trap. Teddy also plans to find the man who torched his apartment building where his wife died. He too was an inmate on the island.Scorsese shows once again his skill behind the camera, giving the audience a stylist, neo-noir story with a very eerie atmosphere throughout. He keeps the mystery going in this fast paced film. He tells a very compelling thriller with good horror moments in what must have been a complex novel. It is stylist, but also has a lot of substance. He give justice to Laeta Kalogridis' screenplay.Once again Scorsese turns to Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role and DiCaprio gives one on his best performances, and a very mature performance as the guilt ridden officer. He has proved like Brad Pitt that he is more then just a pretty boy but also a very talented actor in a long career. Ben Kingsley has finally performed in film where he can give a more understated performance which he is better at. He offers a sly performance as the main antagonist of the film. Mark Ruffalo is an actor who has made his career in supporting roles, and again he does a good performance as Ted's main ally.Despite all the positives to the film, everything did not add up and by about the two thirds of the way through I guessed the big twist. However, that does not diminish the quality of the film.Shutter Island will easily make my Top 10 for 2010.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

In a Nutshell: Shutter Island,"Shutter Island..A journey from darkness to revelation.Highly anticipated through the vibe of Here's-another-Scorsese-DiCaprio- collaboration, Shutter Island delivers what's expected and more. It is an acting-directing masterpiece that won't fail most of its viewers. Set in 1954, this is a story of Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), US marshal, who's called for a special investigation of the disappearance of a psychiatric patient from an island based asylum for the criminally insane. As Teddy steps foot into grim Ashecliffe, he's disturbed by the looks of the patients on the outer grounds of the hospital, but he has no idea that what he's about to encounter is out of his wildest expectations.Based on a novel with the same name by Dennis Lehane, writer of ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"", this story needed a great ensemble of actors lead by none other than legendary director Martin Scorsese to live up to its viewers expectations, and luckily it did. Scorsese had also chosen his all time buddy Film Editor and 3 time Academy Award winner Thelma Schoonmaker, the lady behind editing movies like ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Departed"" and ""The Aviator"", to become his editing mastermind. I say, since Marty chose to employ flashbacks, visions and short intervening scenes to help reach the dramatic climax of the story, he needed the helping hand of such a remarkable editor.In this picture, not only is your mind captivated by the thrill of the story, but also your senses by its absorbing setup and its powerful score. Throughout the movie, you can tell that a great effort has been exerted in the art direction especially in scenes of Teddy's dreams, visions and flashbacks. And it's all only backed up by a brilliant choice of music that serves achieving no less than the desired emotional state of the audience.And just as if you aren't satisfied with brilliant acting of DiCaprio, Ruffalo and Kingsley, Martin Scorsese presents a triple serving of spectacular short appearances by Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley. Each with a story of their own, they not only deliver dazzling performances that may very well earn them supporting role nominations, but they also push the story forward toward its ultimate revelation.In Short, apart from a rather limited hype of negative criticism towards the similarities of the story and an old silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Shutter Island has had a great reception worldwide and had been very well appreciated by the book readers and those who just saw the movie. I say if a movie is the highest grossing and the most financially successful in Martin Scorsese's career, you should see it if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rat in a Maze,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh yes, the psychological thriller is my favorite movie genre. Not sure what that says about me. There are so few good ones, at least since Alfred Hitchcock passed on. Director Martin Scorsese often includes some psychological warfare in his films, but with ""Shutter Island"", he leaps feet first into the world of the criminally insane.This is a very difficult film to comment on because it is crucial that the viewer watch with a clean slate ... in other words, don't let someone toss out some spoilers if you plan to see the film. All I will say regarding the story is that it's fun to watch and my brain was working non-stop the whole time (that's a good thing!). Scorcese uses many different camera angles, close-ups and bright red to go with the island storm. The film has some of the style of his Cape Fear, but even more darkness to the story, as here, EVERY character is a bit off center.Scorsese has, as usual, assembled an excellent cast. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead as Teddy. His partner is played by Mark Ruffalo and they ""investigate"" the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island - a treatment center for the criminally insane. This is no vacation island and at the center is a civil war fort that houses the worst of the worst. The creepy place is run by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who could both make afternoon English Tea seem downright ominous.The cast is so strong that Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are basically limited to one scene each and Jackie Earle Haley continues his resurgence with a wicked one on one scene with Leo. Michelle Williams makes her appearances via flashbacks, visions and sweaty, late night dreams. By the end of the film, her ugly yellow dress was itself a frightening prop.To cap off the mental and emotional turmoil, Scorsese adds an unusual score that at first seems overbearing at odd times, but later reveals itself to have been ""right"" all along. My favorite shot of the film is at the very beginning when the ferry first breaks through the fog. Funny enough, it was ME in a fog for the next 2 hours!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Effective Psychological Horror Film. Worth a Watch.,"Shutter Island is an example of a horror film that doesn't require any distracting action sequences, pointless side-storys, token characters, or useless nudity to draw its audiences in.Shutter Island is Scorsese's psychological horror film. Obviously the star is Leonardo DiCaprio, but the supporting cast stood out as well. There wasn't really a misplaced actor in the entire film. Every character stood out as necessary, as did every particular scene with those characters. The movie moves at a solid pace and doesn't let up from the start.The movies atmosphere starts as the opening scene begins, and doesn't let up until the credits. Shutter Island is a movie that starts out good and doesn't let go. An intriguing storyline and genius film making make Shutter Island a highly recommended film for fans of the genre. It isn't your typical popcorn horror film, as it starts out slow and builds itself without any flashy special effects. This doesn't stop the effectiveness of the movie, as scenes are disturbing and the twists work well",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This will get you thinking!,"Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River), Shutter Island tells the story of 1950's US Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) as he and his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) as they head to Shutter Island, a mental institute for the criminally insane, to find an escaped in-mate.All is not what it seems on the foreboding Shutter Island: the staff, led by a particularly creepy (SIR!) Ben Kingsley, seem almost reluctant to help the case progress and are seem almost conspiratorial with the inmates to cloud the investigation. On top of this, Daniels himself has another agenda for being involved involving his murdered wife.All of which weaves a tangled web that really get the grey matter working, especially if, like me, you are inclined to enjoy the challenge of keeping pace with the detective in a detective story. The movie is very much in a similar vein to Scorsese's Cape Fear remake, complete with a seriously imposing score, sweeping camera moves and scene compositions that comfortably straddle Film Noir and thrillers from the 50's stylistics.Whilst the cast are adequate in what they do, the movie really belongs to Scorsese. The look and sound of the movie is entrenched in Cape Fear territory, but the atmosphere of the movie is much more akin to Polanski's paranoia classics Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. It is credit to Scorsese that this side to the movie is the most apparent and helps entwine the viewer in the tangled web that is Shutter Island. There seems to me to be a real focus on Scorsese's vision for the movie and the result is indelibly stamped as a Scorsese movie much more than it will ever be a DiCaprio movie.DiCaprio does cope well with his role and one thing that DiCaprio does so well that many of his contemporaries cannot is show genuine vulnerability. Although, I personally find him to still look a little too young-looking and not grizzled enough to play characters such as Daniels, this reservation was lost once Shutter Island came into view.The movie will have you revisiting themes and scenes long after the titles roll and it is certainly a movie to discuss afterwards rather than file away as 2 hours of escapism. The movie also invites a second viewing, although I think a DVD/blu-ray with a director's commentary would be my own viewing choice.www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Both good and bad.,"At the end of this movie, there are going to be only two kinds of audience: one, which will feel cheated because it watched in incredulity as one of the characters in the film shamelessly reveals the mystery flat out within the first 10 minutes, as if the director, sick with fear that the audience would feel betrayed, couldn't help himself; the second kind which would not notice the above and go on to watch the entire flick trying to assemble and reassemble the puzzle pieces, only to let out a groan in self-disgust for not having paid enough attention in the beginning.Whether you like this movie or not will depend on which of the above two categories you fall in. I watched this movie with my nephew. As the suspense was revealed, we both looked at each other and uttered almost together, ""What the hell...!?"" Movie itself is not so bad and has some decent performances and atmosphere, but it will all be meaningless if you are the first kind of audience.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Stays true to the book.,"While the film was in theatres, I took my chance to read the book that made this film come alive. The book was fantastic and puzzles and twists were very surprising. When the film reached my local video store, I took my chance to grab it off the shelf and view it. The film does a good job of having the same atmosphere and dialog as the book while also staying true to it, as well. The cast did an excellent job of portraying the characters in the book and their performances were over the top. If I hadn't read the book, I would've given this film a perfect ten but that could, sadly, not happen since I already knew what was going to happen and it made the film a bit more boring. The dialog in Shutter Island is mostly what you read in the book but the people who say those lines do a really good job. Two particular lines that were used in both the film and books were, ""Thorns as big as my d*ck."" and ""Pull yourself together, Teddy."" and I remember them a bit more than the others because one was funny and the other one was cool. So cool in fact is that I wake up every morning and splash water onto my face and stare at the mirror and exactly say that line. The acting was top notch in this motion picture with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Jackie Earle Haley taking the top four spots. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a superb job of portraying Teddy Daniels and my vision of Teddy was what Leonardo gave us. He plays a U.S. marshal who is investigating the disappearance of one of the patients from the Ashcliff Hospital for the criminally insane. Along the way he discovers puzzles and finds out that everybody is keeping a secret from him. He really gave a convincing act. Ben Kingsley does a well done job of Dr. John Cawley, who is the somewhat mysterious, and his accent is really cool. Mark Ruffalo plays the partner of Teddy, Chuck Aule, as they are sent to the hospital where a mystery plagues the entire hospital. Ruffalo impressed me a lot in this film and he does a good job of knowing nothing when he really does. The best and by the far most impressive actor has to be Jackie Earle Haley for his wonderful role as George Noyce, a mental nutcase who speaks in riddles. Haley knows how to act in a good, realistic way and that is what separated him from everyone else and made him the king of Shutter Island. A lot of people are saying that this isn't one of the Scorsese's best works but I have to disagree and say that this his second best film after, of course, ""The Departed"". I suggest that you stop listening to these remarks and just be immersed into this complex yet fascinating mystery/thriller/horror. The wardrobe for this film matches the year it was set in and it does give the film a 1954 feeling. The makeup is quite good as well from the hairstyles to the facial makeup.In 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, from Seattle travel to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital, because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm; Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the Shutter Island.Roger Ebert wrote in his review, ""the movie is about: atmosphere, ominous portents, the erosion of Teddy's confidence and even his identity. It's all done with flawless directorial command. Scorsese has fear to evoke, and he does it with many notes."" and I have to agree with that. He awarded the film 3 and a half stars. People on IMDb who wrote negatively about the film mostly complained about the ending and how they would have liked it to go in another direction. Well, I have a message for them: LIVE WITH IT! The ending was as perfect as it gets but in the film you don't get as much shock form it like the shock you get by reading the book. If anyone is reading this review make sure that you don't read any reviews that contain spoilers because most of them ruin the surprise ending and with a delicate film like this it is easy to say, ""Sh*t! I wish I could go back in time!!AHH!"". The flashbacks that haunt Teddy are portrayed in a mean, nasty way from the war, his life, and his wife. This film should be recommended to people who love Scorsese's works because this is one of his masterpieces that you have to feast upon. I also strongly suggest is that, if you can, read the book before you watch the film because it will make you want to view the film more. I watched it so I could compare this with the book and I was very happy as a result. 8/10 - Shutter Island is a film that you can't miss out on and that is a rule!""Over and Out."" 13 July, 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite Its Pedigree, ""Shutter Island"" Feels Awfully Ordinary","Martin Scorsese's Gothic thriller works overtime to wring chills from its creepy setting (an institution for the criminally insane) and mysterious plot twists. But despite, or maybe because of, all of the obvious and heavy-handed directorial flourishes (moody film noir lighting, constant rain and thunder, a screechy score that announces every emotion you should be feeling before you're allowed to feel it), the film is surprisingly unengaging and, even more surprisingly given its stylish director, fairly pedestrian.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to the eponymous island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. They butt up against uncooperative administrators (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and uncover a possible conspiracy that involves inmates being used in mind-control experiments similar to the ones inflicted by the Nazis on concentration-camp Jews. Throughout, we're treated to dream-like flashbacks in which we learn things about DiCaprio's past and help us understand the personal vendettas driving his behavior. Everything builds to a surprise plot twist that's meant no doubt to make us question everything we've watched up to that point in the film but which frankly didn't come as that much of a surprise.The film is chock-full of recognizable faces in brief cameos: Michelle Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and most notably Patricia Clarkson. But despite the film's high production values and A-list cast, it's hard to believe that someone as talented and capable as Martin Scorsese made this. It's not a bad movie, but it's an awfully mediocre one. There's a reason a film by such a high-profile director was dumped in theatres in the dead of winter.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A captivating thriller with Scorsese and DiCaprio at the top of their game,"In a career littered with cinematic masterpieces and beloved gems, Shutter Island sometimes appears to be one of the more forgotten about Martin Scorsese films, living in the shadows of granddaddy's like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed but there's no doubt this pulpy, over the top and entirely great thriller is one of the living legends most accessible and enjoyable rides.Adapted from Dennis Lehane's book of the same name, Shutter Island is a rained drenched and atmospheric mystery with more intrigue, suspense and twists and turns than you can count, as Scorsese and his favourite leading man Leonardo DiCaprio get caught up in a missing persons case on the haunting lunatic asylum island that houses the Ashecliffe Hospital, run by its potentially devious boss Dr. Crawley, played with gleeful intensity by Sir Ben Kingsley.Filled with stunning shots by DOP Robert Richardson, a moody and nerve rattling score and fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley, Shutter Island is a complete of a picture as one would expect from a filmmaker of the caliber of Scorsese with the bonus being Shutter Island feels almost like three films in one.At first a more straight up mystery that morphs slowly into a horror like battle against the mind and potential nefarious forces that then becomes a haunting examination of trauma and grief, Scorsese ensures that Shutter Island is jam-packed with memorable imagery, unexpected detours and contemplative questions too become so much more than the film the synopsis or narrative might at first suggest.It's a wild ride and one that the first viewing will take many by complete surprise that's enhanced by a terrific DiCaprio performance that must surely rank amongst some of the best work the leading man has ever done.Great in other Scorsese efforts Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed, for my mind DiCaprio's turn as the traumatized widower and war veteran turned U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels is one of the actors most assured performances.Tasked with inhabiting a range of different emotions and character traits, DiCaprio's transformative turn as a man battling his own demons as well as the demons of the island is awards worthy and a main reason why Shutter Island is still so regarded by casual viewers to this day.A unique film in both a genre sense and in Scorsese's career sense, Shutter Island may not get the plaudits that its other Scorsese relatives get but there's no reason to suggest this isn't as good or even better than many of its other highly regarded bloodline.Final Say -A seriously enjoyable and deeply haunting experience, Shutter Island sees Scorsese and DiCaprio on the top of their game, having fun, exploring important themes and making movies like only the best of them can dare dream to do.5 magic glasses of water out of 5",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But there are some brilliant surrealist scenes and shots in SHUTTER ISLAND. The use of colour was very effective and involving.I'd read the book, so the suspense wasn't as great; the friend I saw it with, who had not read the book, liked the movie better than I did, and thought it was deeper than I did.

An exciting ride but ultimately lacking in originality and ingenuity,"Undoubtedly stylish and unabashedly Hitchcockian, Shutter Island is brewing with promise in its early stages.

Both of those things kept me from seeing it until I could catch it on PPV.I have to say that not only was this film not a disappointment in any way, but the fact that I 'knew' what the ending was didn't detract from the experience at all.Scorcese was really masterful at weaving a story that is absolutely engrossing and thrilling without resorting to creepy effects or obvious scare tactics (which would have been the cheap and easy way to tell this story). It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least, to watch a genuinely interesting thriller that takes place at a secluded mental institution and not have to endure shock scenes of ghoulish creatures or other overused devices like that.I've read some of the bad reviews and critiques, and I honestly have to say that I don't understand what they're on about at all.

The chilling journey to Shutter Island is one worth taking.,"Martin Scorsese is one of the last living legends of film-making. His latest offering Shutter Island once again stars his current muse Leonardo DiCaprio and continues their tradition of creating quality cinema together. Though the film doesn't reach high tier Scorsese, this effective mystery story proves that the director is still very much a master of his craft.The story weaves a web of intrigue surrounding an escaped prisoner on the mysterious Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. DiCaprio stars as US Marshall Teddy Daniels, who, along with his partner played by Mark Ruffalo, is sent to assist in the investigation and re-apprehension of the patient. They are met with underscored hostility and reserved answers from the staff, which leads Daniels to believe that there is more to the island and its facility than the staff are letting on.Scorsese presents his audience with images that instill a sense of uneasiness that never lets up. His use of a hurricane, decaying buildings, and disturbing nightmares prove incredibly effective in drenching the film's atmosphere with uncertainty and confusion. With a haunting score and lovely, dreary cinematography by veteran Robert Richardson rounding out the sense of impending doom nicely.The movie's themes are hard to discuss without spoiling the shocking finale, but know that they deal with the power of our mind and how easily we can use that power to deceive ourselves, preventing us from having to accept the truth, especially when it is ugly and unbearable. Such dark themes make the overall affair rather depressing to witness, but this is also its greatest strength.The film's biggest weakness is that it is billed as a thriller, and though Scorsese is obviously trying to draw viewers to the edge of their seat, he often fails, obtaining a strong level of uncertainty rather than fearful anxiety. This makes the film work more as an intriguing mystery.If you are in search of a thoughtful, adult film that is loaded with subtle chills and superb performances, Shutter Island is a place you want to visit. Just beware that what you see there is not always reality.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A cartoonlike dystopian by a director of much better films.,"'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for the criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island. This setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation and dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I think that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the strongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the hollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind doesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to 'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter Island' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something you'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and makes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There are one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think that they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half. DiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and, combined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter Island' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film isn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times, and Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be commended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Chilling Thriller, distinct with Scorcese-DiCaprio combination","As the U.S. Marshals depart from Boston Harbor towards the isolated island that houses the Ashecliffe hospital for the criminally insane, the background music of the vessel's horns, the eerie mist and the uneasy countenance on them confirms that Martin Scorcese is going to squirm our thrill seeking minds....Author Dennis Lehane, whose notable works include Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, provides the source for Scorcese's 4th and latest venture with Hollywood's finest – Leonardo Dicaprio. Shutter Island is a mind-bending, complex and multisided thriller that toys with your inquisitive side before revealing its dark form. U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) along with his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) are heading for the island to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient named Rachel Solando from Ashecliffe, aided by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). They are in a time when lobotomy surgery, inhuman drug experiments, mind-control conspiracies, the threat from the Hydrogen bomb and the after- effects of world war II have become the cause for insanity among several. Their investigation through interviews of other patients is a tiring psychological exercise that divulges little truth while the autocratic approach of Dr. Naehring(Max Von Sydow) restricts access to vital information. Frustrated and torn in disbelief, Daniels confronts the doctors in a futile stand against the authority on the island asylum. Teddy's apprehensions about the island's horrifying mysteries lead him to surprises that arise after the devastating hurricane shatters the island's structured order. The ensuing chaos is where he finds strands of truth for his convictions but in this quest, do things appear as they are or is he beguiled by the Hospital's secrets?Leonardo Dicaprio's renews his status of being the best in the business with Shutter Island. Playing Teddy Daniels required him to portray multiple characteristics that changed with the circumstances in the story. His keen understanding of the role and submersion into the director's vision enabled him to deliver such a stellar performance. Mark Ruffalo is commendable as Chuck while Ben Kingsley delivers the right amount of composure that looks convincing as a Doctor of the criminally insane patients. Watch them all together in the lighthouse where the truth is revealed through some very powerful performances. The rest of the cast that played Dolores, Rachel(s), George Noyce and Naehring leave quite an impact that blends with the film's turbulent theme of misdirection and evil.Shutter Island is a chilling thriller. The surprises keep coming and even if one has read the book or knows its suspense, Scorcese's direction can easily hold you to your seats with a great screenplay by Kalogridis. The cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of 1954 while portraying nature's wrath on the island during the hurricane. This is one of the rare adaptations of a novel that is executed page-by-page with the same depiction of every character, building, structure, plant, color, storm, cave and cliff that was visualized by the reader. To that, Scorcese adds his distinct style in Teddy's recurring flashbacks during the war and his last moments with his wife. Scorcese's display of blood looks artistic compared to the screen splattering in Tarantino's movies. Certainly there is a reason why the 40 film old director has a Golden eye behind his black frames.8.508 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's all about perspective, putting you in the head-space of the protagonist and making you feel how he feels, and it works wonders.","'Shutter Island (2010)' is a film entirely about perspective, and the first time I watched the picture I was so immersed into the perspective of the protagonist - whose point of view is intrinsically inseparable from the narrative and integral to the success of its various reveals - that I was totally swept up and taken along for the ride, made to dance like a marionette to the thriller's tightly-timed and twisty tune. I was completely in sync with DiCaprio's increasingly disheveled detective and experienced all the same emotional beats that he did, ranging from fear and confusion to sadness and even denial. As such, I was captivated and totally on board no matter how outlandish or somewhat confusing certain aspects may have seemed. I've now seen it twice, however, and the second viewing was a very different experience as, while our perspective isn't entirely out of sync with that of the protagonist, the knowledge of what's to come provides a slightly different point of view which transforms even something as simple as a sideways glance into something altogether more monumental. While the second viewing inevitably isn't as impactful as the first (in fact, it exposes a number of issues such as some second act pacing problems), it holds up remarkably well under the scrutiny of examination afforded by the separation of audience and character that occurs once you know the flick's final hand. It's still surprisingly emotionally resonant, too. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Scorsese successfully made us questioned our own sanity, like it could happen to any of us is many ways.","Bite me for watching it only to fill my Loe-hunger! haha. And...for the fact that Leo paired with Martin Scorsese always made a good movie. Since Gangs of New York to finally set an Oscar in The Departed. Now another psychological thriller, breath-taking journey in an asylum scenes. Leo plays U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels who was in 1954 went to Ashecliff Hospital with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Rufallo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient who vanished from a locked room. The hospital itself located in a cluster island called Shutter Island. There they meet the head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who's suspicious enough to make our Marshall suspect him of doing something unusual to patients inside the hospital. Later soon they claimed they've found Rachel, but Teddy insisted they must have hid something else inside the place. So he continue his investigation, along with his strong will to find his wife's killer who was said already sent there, but nothing related to him was ever found in the hospital. Emerges to uncover the conspiracy, along with fear and the urge of finding his wife's killer, bring Teddy to the edge of his sanity itself.At the end, Scorsese rewarded you with a beautiful twist which I already guessed ^^'. But as an adaptation from a famous novel of same title by David Lehane, this movie sure worth to watch. Leo's act, as usual, never failed me. He plays this fragile Marshall even more than just 'very well'. And Mark Rufallo as a sidekick isn't bad at all. In fact, almost all casts played beautifully here. One thing, I admire how Scorsese put the first person point-of-view into a great visual adventure for us. He even successfully made us questioned our own sanity, like it could happen to any of us is many ways. But I think it will be just perfect if he also develop its mysterious surrounding area a lil'bit more, or bringing even greater thrill to our throat by taking a little attention to the doctors and workers around them. But I guess since it is indeed Teddy's own journey to follow, I can take it nicely.In the end, I suggest you to bring extra food as the movie is a bit slow and action-less.

Maybe my friend is right about learning to pick up things real quick and to foresee the trajectory before making any moves.

The lame twist at the end does little to detract from an otherwise great ride,"For those who complain that Scorsese, in the 2000s, spent a decade trying to win a Best Picture Oscar, Shutter Island might be for them. It's essentially a B movie, an insane asylum-based thriller adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane. You'll probably guess the film's final twist within a matter of minutes, but it doesn't matter too much. It's a heck of a ride. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a Federal Marshall from Boston visiting an island asylum for the criminally insane after one of their patients mysteriously vanishes. He has an idea that there might be something more sinister going on on the island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner, Ben Kingsley the head psychiatrist of the institution and Michelle Williams is DiCaprio's deceased wife (in frequent flashbacks, dreams and fantasy sequences). They round out the main cast. The supporting cast includes Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley. Everyone in the film turns in an excellent, heated performance (Ruffalo is a tad more laid back than the rest). Some of the movie plays out like a first-rate horror story, especially DiCaprio's entrance into the dreaded Cell Block C, which contains the most violent criminals in the institution. As I stated above, it's pretty easy to guess at what this is all leading to, and, when it gets there, Scorsese spends far too long explicating everything. But the very last moment of the film is quite good. All in all, it's a worthy film in the Scorsese canon.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Blah,"I was ambivalent before going into this movie. I read some great reviews on IMDb and I love Leo Dicaprio as an actor so that made me excited to see it. However, I am not a big Scorce fan--I thought ""Departed"" was overrated--so that made me kind-of leery. Unfortunately, just like ""Departed,"" this movie was overly morbid and the r.o.i (return on investment) was insufficient.Like others have stated, you keep waiting on the big twist in this movie, but it never comes. I read that this movie is for ""smart"" people, but not really. It didn't require a lot of thinking at all. If you've ever seen one of the many movies about the criminally insane, then you've pretty much seen this movie already--only chances are this movie is not as good as the ones you saw.So I fell asleep...and when I woke up only to see that I really didn't miss much--this movie is sooo slow--I tried to make myself go back to sleep again. But to no avail. This movie is a sleeper in the literal sense. It, like ""Up in the Air,"" is over-hyped maybe based on its cast or something. But you will leave with a ""what did I just see?"" feeling and you'll wonder what more constructive activity you could have been doing for that couple of hours. A real blah of a movie experience. Lift me up (with all the hype) then leave me hanging...just hanging there in thin air waiting...waiting...roll credits. *sigh* My six rating is generous and given mostly because the acting is good.

I find I enjoy DiCaprio's acting the older he becomes--and he did not disappoint with this one. It is a thriller in the true sense of the word. Perhaps there are those movie goers who are more intuitive about endings or even in figuring out where a movie is headed early on in the picture, but for me, the movie unfolded at a very nice pace. I had enough time to think 'ok, where is this headed now?' but the 'maybe this or maybe that' still kept me wondering, never quite sure where it was headed--it could go this way or that or that, up unto its conclusion. Too many movies build-up, build-up only to disappoint the viewer at the end, this simply did not.My husband and I recommend Shutter Island, and at a minimum, rent it when it comes out on DVD.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A flawed masterpiece.,"Most people go into ""Shutter Island"" expecting that director Martin Scorsese will pull off another ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Raging Bull"". Though this is not the case, Scorsese succeeds in constructing one of the best psychological thrillers in years due to his prodigious directing, brilliant cinematography and excellent performances from each member of the cast.Shutter Island takes place off the coast of Boston in 1954. The film follows U.S marshal Teddy Danial's(DiCapro) as he investigates the disappearance of mental patient Rachel Solondro, who has escaped from her room in the mental institution located on the island. As a violent storm hits the island, Teddy discovers that there is more to this case then he first believed. As the plot unfolds, and Teddy begins to hallucinate about his dead wife, and images of past experiences of concentration camps while he was a soldier in WW2, he begins to question why he is on the island. Is he there to kill the man who murdered his wife? Is this all a set-up for some sort of dark conspiracy? Or is it something of much greater importance?Though many aspects of this film are similar to ""The Shining"" (haunting music while we reach the mental institution, quick cuts to dead children, etc) this is NOT a horror film. Like ""Taxi Driver"", each scene (with the exception of the beginning of one), has the protagonist in it as if we are viewing the world through his point of view. Scorsese makes us feel what Teddy feels and due to Scorsese's brilliant direction, we as an audience are unsure what is real and what is fake by the middle of the film.When you have made more then three masterpieces and have perfected your craft so efficiently , you are able to break some of the rules to make the audience feel a specific way. Scorsese tends to break multiple rule such as noticeable continuity errors, abrupt camera movement when there shouldn't be, and edits that seem to be just one beat off. But Scorsese does this on purpose to make the audience feel both out of place and uncomfortable, and he does it very well.The juxtaposition of the beautiful sets while Teddy dreams of his wife, and the bleak, film-noir set of the mental institution are also quiet compelling. This just goes to show you the range of the directors capability and how he is able to combine two very different setting to create an intriguing story.Unfortunately, after the first two acts (which were near flawless), the script seems to fall apart. The twist is not only predictable to many viewers, but has also been done multiple times. There are many things in the first two acts that make it seem like the twist could not be possible and you walk out of the theatre thinking to yourself, ""wait but if that was so, then why did this happen?"" Though unintentional, some of the dialogue throughout the film also seemed quiet comedic as if it came out of one of a scene in the ""Scary Movie"" trilogy. Lines like, ""I'm dead"", come out as comical instead of the tone that the director intended.Though flawed, Scorsese has created one of the most compelling psychological thrillers in years and has redefined the thriller genre. ""Shutter Island"" is a better film then Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"", but comes no where close to that of ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Raging Bull"". But when you've created films like those two, it's not understandable that this one is not as brilliant. This film is one that you need to see at least twice but when you see it for the first time, expect a slow paced psychological thriller, because it is NOT a horror film.8/10HINT: Though I will not ruin the ending for you, pay very close attention to the last scene. Though the narrative suggests one thing, something Teddy Daniels says and how he acts during this scene suggests that it is not what it seems.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Artistic curlicues decorate a thin, derivative script...","Once director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from moviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the massive commercial success of ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster' filmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese name became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has chosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young, raw Scorsese. With ""Shutter Island"", an adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of Shyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, whose ""The Shining"" seems to be an inspirational starting point for this thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a U. S. Federal Marshal in 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from a locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep turning up in Laeta Kalogridis' poor script, which incorporates (at various intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide that is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid, for the most part--Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his actors--though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is feeling his role. His frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a petulant nature, which, coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't lend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a family man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out of seeming miscast; since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on the star's shoulders, the final denouement isn't the heart-breaker it should have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features excellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with overwrought profanities ill-suited to the era.

With this film, it actually has a great plot, and since it's a psychological thriller, you actually have to pay attention and think (duh). No bathroom breaks during this movie, or else you may miss something important.The twist with this film was perfect, and some people may have been able to guess it before they even seen the movie. Who is patient 67? But it's not until you see the full movie that you understand everything. It isn't a predictable twist, and by that I mean if you knew it before, you probably didn't know how everything came to be. I'm a hard movie critic, but I will probably see this once again, and will most likely buy this when it's out on DVD. It's that good.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island is another very good collaboration of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio,"When I agreed to watch this Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film with my movie theatre working friend today, the ""Skip It"" reviews of Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott were still on my mind but since I'd like to make up my own mind about anything, I thought, ""What the Hell."" I'll admit also up front that while I almost fell asleep sometimes during this, by the time of the Big Revelation, I was wide awake and wanting to learn more. Also, despite my almost sleepy demeanor, I was enthralled by DiCaprio's lead performance, by Scorsese's direction, as well as fine supporting performances by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Michelle Williams. Nothing much more to say except this was another very compelling opus by the great director and his frequent leading man that I highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scorsese delivers again,"Though not a masterpiece, Shutter Island delivers the goods and left me pretty much satisfied with what I witnessed on the screen. I don't believe Martin Scorsese has ever done a bad movie. I even enjoyed Cape Fear, which seems to be the movie which most critic's believe is his weakest film, and Shutter Island gives you what you want in a suspenseful thriller.It's 1954 and Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are detectives investigating the disappearance of one of the inmates on Shutter Island, which is an asylum for the violent and criminally insane. THe problem is that Teddy has skeletons of his own in the closet, and it is these same skeletons that hinder his investigation somewhat because he has nightmares of World War 2 when he was involved with liberating a concentration camp in Germany. He also has dreams of his dead wife who was seemingly killed in a fire set by a person who might or might not be an inmate on Shutter Island as well. WHat is real, and what is not? THese are questions that Teddy asks himself and make him feel as if maybe he is becoming a little unhinged.THe final act comes as somewhat of a surprise, but it was something that I saw coming nearly a half hour in when the first walking nightmare, as another character mentions, appears. Still, after the movie, I found myself asking some more questions, and they are questions I won't mention because I don't want to give any secrets away for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say that as a thriller filled with mysteries, this film works real well.Shutter Island is a movie packed with suspense, and it delivers the shocks as well, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The score worked well with the suspense, and the acting, including two key roles by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the doctors on Shutter Island, were all well done. Even the minor roles worked effectively to keep the pace and suspense of the film strong throughout the movie's entire run time.With the exception of the finale being a little expected, I still found Shutter Island to be a very well made movie. It ratchets up the suspense and then shocks you even more. THat is the way thrillers involving mystery should always be handled. Not Scorsese's greatest film, but not a weak movie either and better than many other movies of the same caliber. THis is one that is definitely recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
IMDb has this movie over-rated,"Warning: IMDb has this rated as an 8 right now and this is not an 8 movie. It is not a bad movie but you will be disappointed if you save this movie for a special night. It is more of a good afternoon type movie but you do need to pay attention so no paying bills or doing laundry during the movie.Leonadro DiCaprio does a decent job but he has had better movies. His acting here is a little forced and not great. Anthony Hopkins would have been a much better choice for the role. The movie lacked flow and directing was pretty poor. Martin Scorsese films really set-up a scene and situation to highlight the actor and unfortunately Leonardo didn't bring his 'A' game. Maybe I'm being to critical because the movie meandered around too much for anybody to really shine. The whole movie is just a really long set-up for the ending. The ending is cute but I felt a little jipped since I just struggled through a 2 hour setup.So, not bad, I recommend watching it, just don't get your hopes too high.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Traum und Trauma,"U.S. Marshal Edward Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule travel to the (fictitious) Shutter Island in Boston Harbour, which houses a hospital for the criminally insane. They are investigating the disappearance of one of the patients, Rachel Solando, who has been confined in the hospital after drowning her children.As the film progresses, however, we begin to suspect that Daniels may have other motives for visiting the island, motives connected to his troubled past. In a series of flashbacks we learn that Daniels' wife Dolores died in a fire two years earlier. We also learn that Andrew Laeddis, the arsonist responsible for starting the fire which killed her, is also incarcerated on Shutter Island. Is his real motive for seeking this assignment, therefore, to seek revenge against Laeddis? Or is it, as he claims, to investigate claims that the US government is using the hospital to conduct illegal psychiatric warfare experiments? The death of his wife is not the only dark secret in Daniels' past. We also learn about his experiences in World War II, where he was one of the American troops who liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He is also tormented by guilt about his part in the ""Dachau massacre"", when American soldiers killed a number of the German guards.One reviewer wrote that ""aafter four decades, Martin Scorsese has earned the right to deliver a simple treatment of a simple theme with flair."" I agree with him about the flair, but cannot agree with him about the film's simplicity, either in its theme or in its treatment. This is a very complex film indeed, and not only in terms of its plot, which I won't set out in any greater detail, as I don't want to give away the ending. The film deals with several interrelated themes, namely the relationship between reality and illusion, that between sanity and madness, and that between crime and law enforcement. Can Daniels trust anyone, including his partner Chuck or Dr Cawley, the head of the institution? Can he even trust his own memories, or is he suffering from hallucinations? Is he really who he claims to be? Is he really who he believes himself to be? At one point, one character points out the similarity between the word ""trauma"" and ""Traum"", the German for ""dream"". Etymologically there is no connection between the words- ""trauma"" is derived from the Greek for ""wound""- yet one feels that there should be, as a mental trauma and a dream are two different types of illusion.The influences on the film are also complex, and go much deeper than the standard modern thriller. An obvious influence is the film noir of the forties and fifties, the period during which the film is set. Another influence is the work of Alfred Hitchcock, who throughout his career, and especially in films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Psycho"", was fascinated by psychology and psychiatry. A third influence is the horror film; the plot can be seen as the modern equivalent of an Edgar Allan Poe story. (As in some of Poe's works, word-games and anagrams play an important role). Visually, too, the film, with its autumnal feel, mist-shrouded woods and graveyards, owes something to the horror tradition, although a distinctive visual style is also a hallmark of many neo-noir films. Some visual elements- a cave, a lighthouse- take on a symbolic importance of their own.I never really liked Leonardo DiCaprio in his teen idol phase in the nineties, but after ""Catch Me if You Can"", ""The Aviator"" (also directed by Scorsese) and ""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island"" confirms that he has become a fine actor and one of Hollywood's leading talents, especially as the mentally tormented Daniels, unsure of his own identity, must have been a particularly demanding role to play, as demanding as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"" and perhaps more so than the roles he took in the other two films mentioned. He receives good support here from Michelle Williams as Dolores (seen in flashbacks) and Ben Kingsley as the smooth and outwardly humane Cawley, who may be hiding guilty secrets of his own.As I stated, I won't give away the ending of the film, but I can say that it involves a startling twist when Daniels is confronted with new information which completely overturns everything we have previously been led to believe. This revelation seems to make perfect sense of all that has gone before, and it significantly takes place in the lighthouse, a structure whose very purpose is to lighten the darkness, so it can be seen in symbolic terms as an enlightenment for both Daniels and the audience. Or can it? Even when it seems that the truth has been made clear, there are troubling hints that this might not in fact be the case. What if Daniels has in fact been the victim of a massive and cruel deception? (To judge by the message boards on here, there are people who have interpreted the film in two quite different ways). This ambiguity, which in some films would have been a weakness, is here a strength, a good example of a film which actually becomes deeper and more profound because its meaning cannot be pinned down precisely.I was surprised that the film was not nominated for any Oscars, although part of the reason may have been the fact that its opening date was shifted, for financial reasons, from late 2009 to early 2010, thus making it ineligible for the 2010 awards. Despite this neglect by the Academy, however, ""Shutter Island"" confirms my view that Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors working today. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fear and Loathing on Shutter Island,"As with many other Scorsese films, you must watch this film accurately and actively from the beginning to the end, preferably in the movie theater, by yourself, alone. Then, you will start to feel the intended magic of this film. I can sit here and talk about great acting in the movie, great cinematography, great direction, but I will leave it to other reviewers. The greatest part of the film is that each piece of the movie is constructed in a way to bend and manipulate your mind, and at the end, after all twists and turns, your mind is completely confused, unwilling to interpret further, and its only objective becomes to question the sanity of its beholder. When you drive home, and you feel that you just got released from the asylum and you actively questioning your state of mental health while observing fellow car drivers for the signs of deception, lunacy, and yet again deception, you kind of know that the movie succeeded and provided a great cinematic experience. As for other reviewers, who question the stability of this movie by asking why, if being this good, it wasn't released in December for 2009 Oscars, I have a simple explanation, why release it in December and be nominated and go home empty handed, after the magician Mr. Cameron rightly takes all the awards, if you can release the film in February, go for 2010 Oscars, and have a greater probability at winning a few awards. As always, very clever move from Mr. Scorsese. Don't miss this one, it Will make you ""insane"" for at least 2 1/2 hours....guaranteed.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Scorsese thrills and chills,"Shutter Island is based on the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the man who penned Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. Needless to say this film too takes place in Boston, Lehane's stomping grounds, but this time we go outside of the city limits and into Boston Harbor. Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at a hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. He and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) must gather the facts, find some clues, and see what exactly happened to this missing patient.Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) runs the show on Shutter Island. He oversees all activities with the doctors, nurses, orderlies, and guards. It is his idea that the patients on the island are not prisoners but people who are in desperate need of help through more humane means. Teddy and Chuck soon find out that not all is as it seems on the island. It's as if everyone has a secret and is scared to tell.To make matters worse, Teddy suffers from nightmares and flashbacks about his wife (Michelle Williams) and her sudden death in an apartment fire. He tries to pull it together but the line between what is real and what is in his head slowly starts to blur, causing him to lose sight of what he is really on the island to do.With the help of a tight screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis (Night Watch, Alexander, Pathfinder) and spectacular cinematography by one of the best in the business, Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2, The Aviator), Scorsese is able to deliver a solid, psychological thriller. Starting with the script, I was happy that it wasn't just an exercise in exploiting the Boston accent, like too many movies and TV shows have done of late. It also does a nice job of keeping us involved with the story. Especially with thrillers, it is very easy to lose your audience if you present an idea or a plot point that is too over their head. Here we slowly learn more and more about the characters until finally at the end WHAM! The big turnaround and a very nice payoff. Credit is due to both Kalogridis and for Lehane's magnificent story.Richardson, who is nominated this year for Inglourious Basterds, makes it clear that there isn't going to be a lot of sunshine both in the story and on the film. The very first frame we see a boat emerge from the fog as it rolls towards Shutter Island. Bringing with it Teddy, Chuck, and one heck of a storm. Scorsese and Richardson were obviously going for a stylized effect, carefully selecting the appropriate lighting for each scene, a crucial element to the film's success. Each shot is clear, crisp, and emphasizes just the right colors or lack of color.The performances were right on the money. DiCaprio has developed quite an on screen presence. When he is in the shot we focus right on him. He gives 110% for every scene. Seeing as his character has a lot of emotional baggage, he plays it very paranoid and jumpy, unlike his partner Chuck who is more relaxed and level. DiCaprio clashes with the authorities on the island so well like Kingsley, Max von Sydow, and John Carrol Lynch. Also a great cameo performance by Jackie Earle Haley as one of the patients. His career is certainly looking brighter with each performance.There are a few downers in the film. I thought the middle of the film was a little slow sometimes and lacked the pace and intensity of the first and last acts. The flashbacks for the most part were a little too artsy, almost to the point where it was literally pouring down on us. They felt a little out of place considering the rest of the film, but it felt okay in flashback/dream form. They were very well shot and had a particular look that I enjoy (artsy).What I love about Scorsese, like other great filmmakers, is that regardless the theme, setting, or genre, he manages to add his own personal touch. Though there is certainly a touch of Hitchcock, the angles, composition, and overall look of the film is Scorsese. He's a incredible filmmaker who continues to make hit after hit after hit.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Get taken away with a two-step viewing,"'Shutter Island' is a suspenseful thriller that holds up to films such as 'The Sixth Sense'. Of course, that should be the very least you get when you put a legendary director like Martin Scorsese on the job. This is a film that will have you thinking and guessing even after you've left the theater. An amazing mind trip that takes the viewer into the surreal labyrinthine hell that is Shutter Island in the eyes of Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, a U.S. Marshall investigating the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane.Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in the lead role of this film. It is easily his best performance since 'The Aviator' in 2004. His performance is one of the most down to earth, believable ones in recent memory. When he emotes he doesn't downplay or exaggerate for the sake of the film. He reacts in ways I could easily imagine a real person. DiCaprio may not have starred in a movie nearly as successful as 'Titanic', but as far as acting is concerned he is 10x the actor he was in 1997.Scorsese is a genius. That goes without saying it. Martin Scorsese ranks up with the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles as far as influence of cinematic techniques is concerned. Some were disappointed by Shutter Island, saying that it doesn't live up to Scorsese's reputation. I don't think there is anything wrong with the directing in this film.The decision of composer and Scorsese-collaborator Robbie Robertson and Scorsese to use only classical music for the film is very Stanley Kubrick, but it also works very well in Shutter Island. Every piece of music manages to capture the scenes. It is a marvel how they make these pieces almost seem as if they were written for the film.Make sure to give 'Shutter Island' two viewings, and don't let the first viewing define your view of the film. You will learn most from the film after two viewings spread out over a period of time. After seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness. Somethings become more clear, while others remain a mystery.Don't write this film off after one viewing. If you do, you're missing out on the power of Scorsese's fresh masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Someone is missing.,"SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's first jab at doing a horror/thriller-type film since CAPE FEAR. However, there's no doubt that the film will disappoint many who are expecting a straight up horror film as the TV spots and trailers suggest. In fact, it's further from the truth. At its heart, SHUTTER ISLAND is all about atmosphere and the building of uneasiness, which, at times, do fail to work. It's not a perfect film, at least for me. It's far from it. I found the pacing to be slow at times and the mystery didn't quite pull me in as I expected it to be. Director Martin Scorsese also seem to have a hard time trying to build up suspense, especially towards the end.I also found it to be a frustrating movie experience, but I say that as a compliment. The film does get it at you in the head with the intentional inconsistent editing of scenes and making the viewers very confused with what the film has to offer. In the end, however, Scorsese manages to put all of the puzzle pieces together without cheating the audience. Sure, some might find the ending to be very bad and others might find it very obvious, but there just can't be a movie that everyone ends up liking.I loved how Scorsese refrained from using clichés from certain scenes that begs to have clichés be used. You know those scenes where the music builds up to a huge pop up scare? Well, there's none of that here. Scorsese lets the scenes play out for themselves, rarely using any building up of music at all. This is how he achieves the tone and atmosphere of the film. It's the working relationship between the cinematographer, production designers, director, actors, etc that molds every scene together which is one reason for this film to stand out on its own.The film brings along a lovely cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives it his all in here. He gives a terrific performance even as his mental state breaks down as the film progresses. Ben Kingsley does a great job in here as well along with a few scenes by Michelle Williams in her Boston accent and Emily Mortimer. Patricia Clarkson also shines through with her brief but important role. The film is also visually stunning. It's obvious that attention was put in every detail of a set and every other thing surrounding it.SHUTTER ISLAND is a film that is handled with precision and care, although sometimes losing it's focus on the big picture. It's not an Oscar-worthy film as some might hope it to be, but I enjoyed the psychological game Scorsese plays with in the audience's minds and the film's overall haunting story and tone. See this film if you like to enjoy a psychological thriller with a good story that supports a great cast and a fantastic director.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Highly enjoyable psychological thriller,"I went to see this film not knowing what exactly to expect other than a 2+ hour goose-chase Leo and his partner have to endure. Without spoiling anything, what I saw was a completely different film which caught me off guard and completely obscured my perspective of what I expected from the film. Instead, it opened my eyes, took me to the edge of my seat, and got me thinking about what was REALLY going on in Shutter Island.While the film doesn't exactly start off strong, it slowly picks itself off the floor and carries you to the very edge of your seat up until the last minute of the film. The true premise behind the film plays out very strong and it's fortunate that the great premise is also backed up by great actors who play their roles splendidly. It really shows that these film-makers and actors put skills and heart towards making this a highly enjoyable and highly intelligent psychological thriller.I felt that the only weak point in the film was the music. While the score definitely had some great atmospheric pieces orchestrated to perfection, it also had a loud and persistent cello note played almost to the rhythm to that of the Jaws theme. This note was played throughout the film. While it was a bit tedious, it didn't take away from the original tension built from the film's gloomy and suspenseful atmosphere, so it was easily forgiving.Fortunately, the minor score issue is the only thing that I could possibly find wrong about this film. Almost every other aspect of this film presents itself professionally and creatively. While it is certainly not a solid 10 in my book, I still gave this film a 9 because it's a highly enjoyable film if you simply learn to keep your eyes peeled and your ears open. With the exception of minor setbacks, the good(s) definitely outweigh the bad(s) and I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is looking for that breath of fresh air from intelligent psychological thrillers.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Leonardo and Martin Scorsese at their best, yet again","You cannot look away even for a moment. The movie wins everyone's heart from the premise to the closure. With the trailers and posters one could easily guess what will be the movie whirl around. A island where they treat mentally ill people,we sure ask questions on why was a Cop sent there and what will he find out.The suspense factor is really chilling and needless to say Leonardo has yet again performed at his best, the acting is so convincing that you get the scares and the chill goes down the spine. Mark has done a exceptional role in supporting the lead actor at the same time without any silly sentiments or dragging the storyThe movie starts with the asylum and that's where it stays all along, as we get into the scenes we discover the myths surrounding it and with every new discovery made; we think it is gonna connect the dots, but you need to wait. Also the special effects team has done a exceptional job in choosing the right atmospheric colors and sounds and have made sure we never come out of our shellThe movie is very cleverly paced, some might feel it is slow; but hey we are talking about a Martin Scorsese epic, he induces poison and the dose takes its time to reach your head. By the time it reaches there you are literally blow away and you will be awe-inspired by whats happening after that. I can only say the flash back should have been less confusing and to the point, but once you put the pieces together you realize you have witnessed something special.I wonder why doesn't Mark choose such meaningful characters maybe he is playing a second fiddle, but he does a damn good job, its characters such as this makes the casting complete. the movie is centered around only these two characters and the findings they come into. Every character is only given the required space in the movie to engage the audience and leave a question when they leave.Such impeccable direction and truly astounding performance makes movie watching worth while and going to cinema halls all the more enjoyable",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile if only for DiCaprio's amazing performance,"There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work I compulsively follow and run out instantaneously on or near their film's release date to see. But there are very few filmmakers who can make a movie, not a predetermined blockbuster, feel like an event. Yet somehow, Martin Scorsese manages to do it every time. And when Shutter Island was delayed from October 2009 until February 2010, you can imagine how disappointed I felt. But it helped build the anticipation even greater.U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to the titular island to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliffe Hospital in 1954. The hospital houses the criminally insane in various buildings, including some of the worst offenders in the country. As the pair begins interviewing doctors, nurses, patients and the like, they quickly realize not everything is right at Shutter Island. And with a ferocious storm heading their way and Daniels suffering from recurring hallucinations, getting out intact may be even harder than discovering the truth.Let me be clear on this, Marty Scorsese never makes bad films. He makes flawed films, he makes overly long self-indulgent films, he makes good films, he makes great films, and he makes brilliant films, but never bad films. Coming off his historic Oscar win for The Departed, it was clear Shutter Island was not even going to attempt to come close to repeating how incredible that film was. But in spite of that, Shutter Island comes off as a good movie but one that has flaws Scorsese easily could have corrected.The film is a slow burn of a mystery-inspired thriller. There are a lot of macguffins, a lot of inconsistencies and plenty of clues scattered throughout the film (almost surpassing the body count of The Departed), but it has a lot of trouble translating into something truly inspiring. When the film really begins unravelling and eventually hits its eye-opening climax, it becomes just as awesome as we all know Scorsese films can be. But for the most part, the content comes off as alternating between incredibly boring or incredibly fascinating. There is no middle ground at any point in the film, and I found the experience to be maddening in a lot of instances because the film just could not deliver on how incredible its trailer was. To me, Scorsese has always had a problem with the length of his films (looking simply at his last four films, two are pushing three hours in length and none are under two hours), and Shutter Island makes it incredibly clear how big a problem this can quickly become. For a thriller to be as riveting as it needs to be, it needs to keep the audience on its toes throughout its runtime. And unfortunately, Shutter Island only manages to do this half the time.Equally aggravating is the use of green-screening and special effects in the film. In some instances, it almost looks amateur in how badly edited some scenes are. It is fairly common knowledge that few films in 2010 feature the actors on actual sets but more often on special effects soundstages, but many of them trick the audience into thinking it is all real with some really good editing techniques. It seems these same techniques were only employed half the time for Shutter Island and with how much of a master craftsman Scorsese is, he really should have known better and put more time into ensuring the film looked perfect. And with a five month delay, there is next to no excuse for why some scenes cheapen the look of the entire film.But even if Scorsese is faltering as a filmmaker, DiCaprio continues to strengthen as an actor. He carries the film entirely on his shoulders, and never once do we take his conviction for granted. Daniels is a war veteran who suffers from hallucinations, and DiCaprio breathes depth, sorrow, anger, confusion and genuine fear into every frame he occupies. He is the focus of the entire film, and he fills its running time with a complex character that nearly makes his Oscar-nominated turn as Howard Hughes feel juvenile. The man continues to grow as an actor, and with each new role he takes on, he is moving ever closer to his eventual acting Oscar. And after seeing his whirlwind of emotions on display here and his emotionally devastating role in Revolutionary Road (the real film Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for last year), I can only hope it comes very soon.The supporting cast is all excellent in their roles. Ruffalo continues to impress as a supporting actor. He has yet to truly master leading man status, but he plays off with DiCaprio better with each scene that passes. Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch and especially Ben Kingsley all deliver great performances as the main members of staff Daniels and Aule encounter. The three of them are just great alternating between being cooperative and sinister all at once. Michelle Williams is an even bigger standout, despite the trailer giving away her main function in the film. I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more from Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley however. As great as they all are, they all appear basically in extended cameos. A little disappointing for how haunting their parts all turn out to be.If you can look past its boring sequences, the trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile. It is a good movie, but it falls short of greatness. DiCaprio is truly amazing in his role, but I cannot help but feel disappointed in the film as a whole. It easily could have been much better, but I think the five month delay ended up being more detrimental than beneficial for it.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Masterfully done,"Shutter Island is visually rich and very atmospheric in its opening scenes. An approaching hurricane with non-stop rain and wind give a claustrophobic sense of foreboding to the first third of the film.The filmmakers make liberal use of flashbacks to tell the story set at the insane asylum on Shutter Island. We see interleafs of torrential rain and driving snow as the detective played by DiCaptrio switches between the present and a past experience at the Dachau death camp. The mixing of his experiences at Dachau and Shutter Island are perfected by special effects images.Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Willaims, and Max von Sydow add to DiCaprio's impressive performance.The tone of the movie changes significantly near the midpoint. Don't leave to get popcorn then or you'll be wondering what's going on. In fact, you'll wonder that even if you stay. The film keeps you guessing until the very end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Didn't like the twist,It's 1954. U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) investigates the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. His new partner is Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). His wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) was killed by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. The agents are forced to give up their firearms. Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is in charge. Rachel Solando is the patient who has disappeared. Her primary doctor Dr. Sheehan left on vacation. Teddy is haunted by vision of the liberation of Dachau. Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) refuses to hand over any of the files and a frustrated Teddy vows to leave the next morning.Director Martin Scorsese maximizes the moody atmosphere with the creepy grand Gothic setting and the encompassing storm. The cast is amazing. It's a great stylish noir at the start. It's dark. It's creepy. It has a very weird vibe. There is a twist and it's very unsatisfying. I was buying into the movie but it pulls the rug from under me. It feels like the writer cheated and breaks any connection from the first half. I won't even comment on any believability or reasonableness of the twist. It was well on its way to a great movie. It's a small disappointment of what could have been.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter society..,"For American standards, this is a relatively difficult film, with an elliptical narrative, ""dead"" spaces, ornate direction, slow pacing, and so forth. It is also very uneven, tense and claustrophobic on one hand, but with lots of ups and downs on the other. At it's best, it is very intense, at it's worst, it is downright flat and predictable, and hardly helped by the anemic meaning.First things first. As a director, Scorsese is probably at his finest here, which is good. Compared to, say, Coppola, he is still evolving, which is the sign of a healthy artist. He is still not an auteur, but this is overall his best direction.Now, the little trick of having two realities warping around each other is borrowed by David Lynch, and is hardly causing any sort of sensation anymore. The ending with the lobotomy is also borrowed from Gilliam's ""Brazil"", as is the whole message in general, that in turn is borrowed from Orwell's ""1984"". The message here is that of a society evolving from the ghosts of a brutal World War II, that is seemingly democratic, but in reality authoritarian and artificial. The subtle references about McCarthyism are nice, but actually the whole message is rather vague, and in the end serves as a pretense for a claustrophobic existential thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not very good at all,"I went to this movie with three other friends and I had to convince them to NOT walk out of this movie. When I went to the restroom, there were several people leaving the theater, they were walking out on it. At the very end of the movie, there was a slight boo and hiss that filled the theater. It was clear that I was not the only one who thought that this movie fell way short.If you are trying to look for positives, there were a few. First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio was incredible. If he were not in this movie, it would have been a disaster. He is an incredible actor. He actually delivers a very inspiring performance. Secondly, there is a good story somewhere in there. I think that is what most people who liked the movie would point to. The story is good, it just so happens that it portrayed through terrible acting and a loose storyline. It comes across in a very disjointed (and LONG) way. This movie is WAY too long. It was over an hour into the movie before anything of substance happens.I also found that the movie was not scary, at all. Do not expect to be scared. You will not be. It's not as though being scared is a requirement for a good movie, but this movie is certainly sold that way in the trailers, etc.. It is not scary.In any case, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, except maybe a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Damn good,"I was very excited about this movie because finally I could hope that it will be some good movie by Leonardo DiCaprio whose acting is pretty good. Then I saw trailer and I didn't know what is it now . I thought that maybe Scorsese will do some suspense movie like Alfred Hitchcock . I think that this mixes of thriller with one really gripping atmosphere mixed with some horror elements . I am not fond of this movies and when I saw trailer I decided that I should maybe skip watching this movie . Then I was thinking about it and I heard that it is on Top 250 so I knew that it is must watch movie and I went to watch .Whole atmosphere on the movie is quite gripping and you can feel that your impressions about this movie will be great . That is because every scene has something what is really making watcher to think about it . This is some spark which is attracting watcher . Scorsese really did something what do we can call masterpiece . Really great details and great atmosphere were so attractive and so excellent . I think that Scorsese gave his best to do this movie because I feel that this one was really special and difficult challenge for him . I think that he accepted this challenge and made his another success . He is definitely the best director because his sense for making some great attraction for watcher and he is making us to think about his movies. There are a lot of great directors(Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg)but nobody is like Scorsese .Leonardo DiCaprio made his great progress in career and he finally showed that he is entering into group of great actors . His convincing acting and definitely great discipline made his role better . He was very mature and almost every his movement was followed with great dose of convincing and serious acting . He was definitely determined to do this the best . He was definitely like whole movie because he was into this gripping atmosphere . I like his acting because he is now very good in Scorsese's movies and he can remind us on great Robert DeNiro . Both of them were always showing their sense for being into their roles and to make their character like whole atmosphere in the movie .Mark Ruffalo was very good and his maybe hard role is well acted . I don't know why I thought that he was too bad but when I saw his convincing acting and great concentration . He was very determined to do something well because when you get role from Scorsese you have to be very pleased . I think that he acted like one really famous actor . He was reminding me on some great actors . He is I think the greatest surprise in whole movie .Ben Kingsley was really great because of his serious but damn good acting . His wise sense for acting made him first-class actor . He made one great masterpiece in acting . I think that he is maybe great even for many actors who acted some similar role . I don't know how but he made something on what I can say only ""Bravo!"" . Great activity in this movie and pretty great concentration on whole movie were factor why did I give 10 for this movie .That is because I like thrillers and directing and acting were great . Really good and gripping thriller which can make you thinking about it whole day . I would like to see another masterpiece by The Great Scorsese .",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the most exiting movie ever watched,"My rating explains my views. This movie made me spell bound. It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. I just finished the movie and I really am speechless. Can't say much as it speaks for itself. The story is amazing and never leaves you for even a second. I thought I got the story after just 40 odd minutes but then theses a twist and then again there is another twist and it never stops amazing you. Martin Scorsese has done it again, hitting the bull's eye with his favorite, Leo. The acting is above the limit and screenplay scores a perfect 10. The background music enhances the charismatic effect to a new dimension. Shutter Island scores a perfect 10 in all the areas and by far is one of the biggest recommend on my list.So be sure you watch this flick, because it doesn't get better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Shutter Island,"It's easy to get all riled up over the latest Martin Scorsese film starring his recent favourite actor of choice, Leonardo DiCaprio. After all, the destination is something of a big wool pulled over your eye, but as the saying goes, it's never the destination but the journey itself, and Scorsese pulls off a mighty fine psychological thriller whose horrific elements aren't what we get from the trailer with its chop-socky boo-moments, but were a lot more cerebral, tying in very closely with the entire feel of the film.In some ways, Scorsese helmed this film to Hitchcockian proportions, and constructed a tight mystery thriller which to my surprise, still had a lot going despite one knowing how it would end, either being a reader of the novel by Dennis Lehane (which I am not), or through the many clues that simply pepper the film from start to finish. There were some jarring moments which I thought pared down to bad editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, or wondered if Scorsese was being very slipshod in bridging cut scenes or continuity laced with perturbing errors, but all these were played out for a reason, and by the time the final reel unspools, the dust will settle.Which I felt was perfect in getting you under the skin of DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels, a US Federal Marshal assigned to the titular Shutter Island which houses a mental institution for the criminally insane, because one of the inmates, or patients as Chief Psychiatrist Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley) insists they are called, have simply vanished through the walls, and a search has been deemed futile. Together with new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the federal marshals soon stumble upon an uncooperative lot in the facility, coupled with the usual crazies who play on your mind with their various testimonies.And to make it a wee bit complex, there's a brewing hurricane that prevents our cops from leaving, Teddy's visions of his dead wife coming back to haunt him, and a growing conspiracy that involves inhumane experiments that those in power allow to happen clandestinely to be performed for the advancement of neuroscience, and to create almost zombie-like perfect killers/soldiers ala The Manchurian Candidate. As mentioned, the narrative sucks you in and keeps you engaged, though some parts because they can get repetitive (remember, it's all for a reason), may hang you out to dry if you're not paying close attention.DiCaprio has grown from strength to strength as an actor, and frankly, he almost single- handedly made this film work. Without his charismatic presence and fine performance, many elements presented in Shutter Island may not be pulled off successfully, since it relied heavily on the actor playing Teddy Daniels to really show a vast range of ability, and more importantly, to make you feel for him totally in his predicament to dig deep and discover just what hanky-panky is going on in the island, while haunted by many ghosts from the past. There were some physical scenes which were obvious a stuntman had taken over, but no substitutes can be used for his dramatic moments of course.The supporting cast also put up a commanding performance, from Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, to Max con Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Jackie Earle Haley. Talk about a star-studded casting against a very gritty and scary backdrop, boosted by very nifty special effects when the narrative calls for it. And for those who prefer their horror in old fashioned terms, there are, in my opinion, eerie images enough to shock and make your goosebumps stand, thanks to anticipation being build, plus the actual deliverables that gave me the creeps.So climb onboard the ferry to Shutter Island, and allow the latest Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle to bring you on a slow brewing mystery ride that straddles the fine line between fantasy and reality, complete with plenty of discussions on the mind and sanity check. Incidentally, the next DiCaprio film out later this Summer, also deals with the cerebral, and helmed by Christopher Nolan. Now that is something I want to see, but in the meantime, an excursion to Shutter Island is recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Less impressive than expected,"This suspense thriller relies mostly on a number of clever plot twists, which to me is also its Achilles heel. Throughout the entire movie, I had the annoying feeling that it was always rather obvious what was going to happen. The script isn't quite as mysterious or complex as the makers assumed it was, it's not particularly difficult to figure things out. All other aspects of the movie are nothing short of brilliant though. DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both perfect for their roles, the scenes they share are the highlights of the movie. The style of the film is also very well-crafted, the images are beautifully gripping. Still, none of that quite holds up when the key twist is rather predictable.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Have We Already Seen The Best Picture of 2010?,"""Shutter Island"" is an excellent film! From the opening scene, it had me interested. With each scene that unfolded on the screen, that interest does not let up. Something new comes up to confound, to confuse and to obfuscate. The film follows US Marshall Edward Daniels as he investigates the disappearance of one prisoner/patient in the island prison complex for the criminally-insane called Shutter Island. I cannot really say anything more without spoiling it for you. This film needs to be experienced first-hand!This is classic film-making by Director Martin Scorsese. His visuals are just riveting and disturbing. His approach to story-telling is impeccable. Your brain keeps on working while you watch it. I want to watch it again to get all those small details I may have missed, and I know there are many. I think I may have already watched the Best Picture of 2010, and it is only February!Leonardo di Caprio, what can I say? He is such an intense actor. Since his recent series of serious films, from ""The Departed"", then ""Blood Diamond"", then ""Revolutionary Road"", now this, he just keeps on improving his craft. I was sold about how he tackled this most challenging role of Edward Daniels. I think he is on track to finally winning his Academy Award for Best Actor.The supporting cast composed of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and the venerable Max von Sydow was very effective. Michelle Williams was haunting and creepy. I cannot even say what their roles are without risking to spoil things. It is that good that way. The film is very original. It is mentally-stimulating. Just the way I like my films.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Excellent, well-made thriller","While I thought some elements of ""Shutter Island"" were a bit overplayed in order to superficially ratchet up the suspense (I most specifically refer to the ridiculous music at the beginning which suggests something particularly ominous is about to happen, although in how many films does something particularly ominous happen at the five minute mark?), overall, I found the film a worthwhile application of Scorese's encyclopedic film knowledge to the thriller genre. His decision to do this is comparable to his doing ""Age of Innocence"" or ""Cape Fear"" – it is a bit out of his comfort zone. But this is why Scorsese is a great director. As accomplished and critically acclaimed as he is, he is not afraid to push boundaries and attempt to tell a story in a different way, or even to work in an almost completely different genre, than he has before-and while perhaps ""The Age of Innocence"" is not his best work, it was not terrible, reminding us again how well-versed in films, and also how talented, he is.Admittedly, he is certainly not a newbie to suspense. ""Cape Fear"" was a fantastic re-make. I can't think of many better re-makes of films. It scared the pants out of me and I don't scare easily. In that film, he used a terrifying protagonist (portrayed memorably by one of his prime muses, DeNiro) to increase the suspense surrounding a judge who began to fear for his life when a convict he had sentenced completes his term and returns to try and make the judge's life miserable. Scorsese in that film didn't need to use any actual violence or gore in order to scare viewers. Our knowledge that DeNiro's character was out there, determined and fearless to exact revenge on the judge who had put him away, is enough to scare us.In ""Shutter Island"", Scorsese delves into an admittedly different area in order to scare us, but once again, the fear of what we don't know far outweighs the terror of some gratuitous, splashy act of violence. In this instance, the film is about a US marshal approaching the eponymous island in an attempt to find a woman who has escaped. As DiCaprio and the excellent Mark Ruffalo's marshals seek answers from warden Ben Kingsley (at his most reptilian) and Max Von Sydow (who, seeming to have discovered the fountain of youth, becomes ever more chilling) about the whereabouts and the particulars of the woman's disappearance, they become increasingly enmeshed in a murky, shadowy world in which motives and simple sequences of events become more and more baffling.The cast assembled by Scorsese is fantastic, and he gets some wonderfully including some of the creepy performances from all of the leads – from Michelle Williams at her most opaque to the most detached Patricia Clarkson, from Ted Levine as an eerily vanilla warden to Elias Koteas as the lunatic Laeddis. For my money, this is not one of DiCaprio's best performances. It is fair, but his dramatic range in this performance doesn't seem to capture the true breadth of a man who is this troubled. His palette of emotions seems strangely mute for such a volatile character. That said, it is not his worst performance either. Compared to the rather thin presence he summoned in attempting to be a gang leader in ""Gangs of New York"", this is excellent work. It isn't his charismatic tour-de-force in ""The Departed"" or even his chameleon-like work in ""Catch Me If You Can"", but he does convey a man who is ill at ease.That said, credit for the success of this picture has to go to Scorsese. His technical proficiency and ability to originally and excitingly tell a story are used masterfully here. The film was originally a book by Dennis Lehane (also the author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") and apparently (though I haven't read the book), Scorsese's re-telling of ""Shutter Island"" is quite different from Lehane's. That it is so well reviewed and not too harshly criticized by devoted Lehane fans is a credit to the originality and quality of Scorsese's interpretation of the book. Many fans have said they saw through the final twist from the get-go and I don't deny that is possible. As for myself, I'm not interested in trying to out-think a director. I watch a film and take in the action without trying too much to anticipate what will happen. Perhaps you are one of those who saw the twist coming. If so, more power to you, but if you weren't trying to figure out what would happen, and were just letting the film wash over you, you shouldn't be criticized.Scorsese has originally re-interpreted an excellent piece of fiction and it's rare when a movie isn't significantly overshadowed by a picture. Again, not having read the book, I can't comment on that, but this is a well-made, somewhat scary film, so credit to Scorsese for that.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Martin Scorsese channels Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick,"The story is set in 1954, Two federal Marshalls(Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo), are assigned to a case on Shutter Island, where at a mental institution, a patient disappears, without a trace. While there investigating, they discover things are not what they seem, has every twist and turn keeps coming into play, and knowing who to trust and who not to trust, but the main twist of the whole story, is the one that will shock you the most.Martin Scorsese brings the suspense of Alfred Hitchcock, and weird artiness of Stanley Kubrick, and does it quite brilliantly. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite brilliant here, he really throws himself out there. And the supporting cast are also good, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley, and Patricia Clarkson. This is a thriller you should check out.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just a breath of fresh air!,"""Shutter Island"" is definitely a breath of fresh air in the Thriller world of film. The Thriller genre was going down the drain with ""Legion"", ""Twilight"", and ""From Paris with Love"". ""Shutter Island"" kept the viewer on the edge of their seat, biting their nails, and wanting more by the time it was over. There were only a couple of ""jump"" moments in this film but when they came up on the screen they were absolutely affective. ""Shutter Island"" is what you would call a psychological thriller, those are the kind of films that keep the viewer thinking and paying attention and trust me you have to pay attention in this film. Leonardo Dicaprio was and is a phenomenal actor, he was perfect for this role. The way he showed emotion was remarkable. There wasn't really anything that I didn't enjoy about this film. But it is one of those films that you have to see more than once to understand it. I will tell you that I had a lot of trouble understanding the ending the first time I saw it, but not the second time. Martin Scorsese did an awesome job making this film, definitely one of his best works. I HIGHLY recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Although Predictable, Nonetheless Just Shy Of Being A Masterpiece","Whenever a Scorsese film comes along, it's something of an event. Always able to entertain while also creating thoughtful film, he has a way of crafting a film that few can mimic. Sure enough, Shutter Island is another of these films. Yes, it's psychological horror is predictable, but this doesn't deter from a great film about the horrors of dementia during a time period when crazy people were thought better left ignored than treated.This is certainly a different kind of film for Scorsese. While it has the same characterizations we're used to, characters who are products of their environments and must adapt, it also feel like Martin's take on psychological horror. And it works to great degree. There is plenty of suspense and the asylum itself is often times creepy, specifically Ward C. What shines most here is Leo DiCaprio's performance as the troubled Marshall Teddy Daniels. In a lesser actor, this role would have come across as too melodramatic and ridiculous. But here, we have a thoughtful character who comes off as believable. There is a scene at the end that even hits like a brick. While DiCaprio was once merely a teen idol actor showing glimpses of a great actor, this has cemented him as one of today's greatest actors. It might be hard to believe, but he certainly stands out as Teddy, something I can say about very few actors in recent films (Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds being the last one).Now, the film certainly has its issues. It feels like an old fashioned psychological horror, complete with hallucinations, literal closed doors we know we will eventually see opened, and obvious red herrings. The film doesn't feel very innovative and it even feels like it's taken a step backwards as far as film making goes. The ultimate truth, once it's revealed, also feels pretty obvious. Certainly, anyone who has seen these kinds of horror films will no doubt make a guess as to the truth and be correct. And, at first, it's a disappointment that the answers aren't less obvious. There are also some early issues with the music, as the overbearing score when they enter the compound, while foreshadowing the disturbing things to come, is so powerful it seems silly.However, the film is saved by the directing primarily, of which Scorsese once again shows why he is a master in Hollywood. The characters in the film are so well crafted and directed, that the message here becomes clear and even the films obvious twists shine in their displays of humanity. This is ultimately a film about the treatment of crazy people. Most would rather see them dead, a testament to the mindset of the time period, while a few would rather try to cure them. And this is what Scorsese does best. He explores the building blocks of our history, delving into areas of society we think we might know, but are ultimately shown anew. And Shutter Island is no different. This is a different take on a subject explored previously, but never like this. Shutter Island is a great film, yes, but it is because of its message, because of its take on its subject that makes it a worthwhile film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
To the lighthouse,"Not quite sure what genre this piece of psychodrama schlock from Martin Scorces belongs too, but it's an interesting piece, straining perhaps after the heights of say Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" or Clouzot's ""Les Diabolique"", but falling a little bit marooned on its own shore by the time we reach the conclusion.For one thing it's too long and frequently disappears up its own backside in its clever-clever exposition, plus, I guessed the ""twist"" very early on in the piece. Also Leo DiCaprio is no Gregory Peck and for me never really engaged my sympathy or even general interest as Scorcese explores the canyons of his mind.The symbolism throughout is a little heavy - handed too, the bleak, isolated Shutter Island itself akin to DiCaprio's tortured mind-scape and the lighthouse as his shining way-out, although I suspect Mr Scorcese doesn't really want us to get too metaphysical here. If anything it comes off best as a homage to that strain of movie psycho-horror usually peopled with Vincent Price or possibly the comic pulp fiction of the same era.I enjoyed it and applaud the director's left-field excursion away from the mainstream - interestingly the last time he ventured near this territory was in the unashamedly populous ""Cape Fear"". I got into it more once I realised Scorcese was presenting entertainment over art, but felt it could have been drawn tighter together into a more coherent and exciting whole.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The greatest thriller of the past 5 years.,"This one is definitely a great work, Scorsese never seizes to amaze us, he's simply a genius and this film has greatness written all over, the direction is really accurate and the treatment for the little details is just flawless, it is certainly not the best we've seen from Martin, but is definitely, from my very critical P.O.V., the greatest thriller from the past 5 years.The acting is superb, led by the usual Scorsese's formula partner, Leonardo DiCaprio, who I believe gave an impressive performance, award worthy and really memorable, he's never acted better, followed by a passive aggressive Mark Ruffalo, who's sometimes overshadowed by his own flat character, a very mysterious Ben Kingsley, who softly takes the lead in his scenes, and again Oscar worthy, a very complex von Sidow, who gave just another memorable role, and the always creepy Jackie Earle Haley, that stood so little in the screen and still captivates as a very complex and grounded criminally insane. The ladies in this film didn't have much to work with, Michelle Williams did well as a very depressed death lady and Patricia Clarkson was impressive enough for the 5 minutes she was on, well achieved, if you ask me.Technically perfect; the cinematography was beautiful, the editing was really fine, the one thing I could complain is that at times the score was over-dramatic, however, I can't say it wasn't good, the production design nailed it in all its levels, the sound was really mesmerizing and the little visual effects were good as well, the scenes were Teddy was with his wife really reminded me the graphic ensemble of ""American Beauty"", I find similarities in the visual composition of both.Overall a great story that holds it in suspense from the very first minute and never loses charm throughout itself, you must take it really seriously because there are many details that you won't get until the very end, so it's a very enjoyable flick that award fans must keep an eye, despite 2010 in cinema is still in diapers, this seem like a very hard one the miss for the 83rd Academy Awards, hopefully it won't lose its momentum, being released so early in the year and far from award season.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""There's No Moral Order As Pure As This Storm.""","Shutter Island begins encircling us with the first sinister notes even under Paramount's logo. Like the ensuing film, they're menacing. This is Martin Scorsese's haunted house movie, given the insatiable quivering apprehension we sense when thrillers don't defuse all the suspense with action sequences. He's a master of accompanying image with music. This is one of his very most effective endeavors in music placement. He seizes the piano and strings of a minor piece by Mahler for every drop of its sensory character, waxes Kubrick with Penderecki's dissonant clusters, finds parallels with John Cage's hypnotic incoherence, the steady tonal pulse of Ingram Marshall.Shutter is an obscure, jagged island off Boston, where a Civil War fort has been acclimated to a prison for the criminally insane. We close in by boat under descending skies with Marshals Teddy and Chuck, played by the strikingly symbiotic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. They're to inspect the vanishing of a childkiller. There appears to be no way to escape the island alive. The evasion of one prisoner might not necessitate the involvement of Feds unacquainted with the circumstances, but we never question that element. Not after the foreboding enclosures of the prison appear, the investigators guided into the office of Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley with that ominous charisma he's gotten down cold in his career's latter half, continually deflecting all Gandhi-typecasting.Experiencing the novel before the film was my mistake. It took four theater viewings to completely separate the two. The film's more lavish, much less concise than the unfolding, and especially closing, of the book, but there are stunning additions by Laeta Kalogridis that flood the film with thematic alarm bells, making it resonate more deeply and pensively than even the revelatory rattling of the novel. Scorsese chisels through the real world inch after inch. It's plain that Teddy has no notion of what he's getting into. The premise seems elementary: The woman's missing, Teddy and Chuck will search. But the frigid concrete walls ensnare them. The offices of Cawley and staff, equipped for war commanders, look thinly modernized from silent Fritz Lang or Robert Wiede films. Flashbacks convey Teddy's torturous experiences since WWII, which provided classic noir's bleak percussion. Shellshock could be seen in men struggling to appear self-assured in their veneers of undistinguished outfits, heavy smoking, fedoras worn low. DiCaprio and Ruffalo both assume this appearance. While Ruffalo purposely seems more like a disposition than a character, DiCaprio fittingly makes it feel more like a buoyant front.DiCaprio commands some astonishing emotional scenes, modulating sharply between suspicion, aggression, bewilderment, agony. Had Paramount not postponed the release to a less Oscar-wary date, DiCaprio would doubtlessly be nominated. Indeed, the entire cast is outstanding in performances so unusual in substance. Many are figments, double-blinds, imposters, even mere functionaries. But all color Teddy's journey so dynamically. Michelle Williams effectively embodies a broken dream. Ted Levine inhabits an ominous duality as the Warden, who arguably may define the loonies-running-the-asylum cliché, but is he so loony? Maybe he's seeing more clearly than everyone else. Patricia Clarkson looks so unlike herself, possibly because her scene seems so convincing, yet so off-kilter. Emily Mortimer and Jeffrey Dean Morgan could be all Teddy's looking for, yet both baffle and intimidate him, and us.There's a flashback merged with a dream that may be the closest Scorsese has ever brought me to tears. He uses Max Richter's tender strings, loss literally raining all around Teddy and the wife that'll only be real, in his arms, for another few moments. Scorsese's never done a scene remotely as surreal, or romantic, before. It's astounding seeing him extend his breadth into untapped territory. Indeed the film's foremost impact is on one's senses. It's a premonition of disquieting enigmas: How did this woman escape from a locked cell in a sealed ward, its panels able to endure cannons? Why do Cawley and the dubious Dr. Naering, played by 81-year-old Max Von Sydow---who I'd still dare not mess with---feel like they're lying? Why do the prison's practices spark Teddy's flashbacks to freeing Dachau? These sorts of wringers are at film noir's core. Characters never enter a noir without some major burden. They have unresolved dilemmas, submerged anguish. Nevertheless, why are the others so odd? Kingsley tastefully bleeds intimidation whenever he smiles, then mixes his signals with kindly etiquette so gracefully that he might as well be wiping off the menace with a silk handkerchief. Not to mention two supporting actors, most memorably psychopaths in Zodiac and The Silence of the Lambs, here play lawmen.There's electrifying imagery in Shutter Island. There's a lighthouse, a cave on a cliff, dizzying falls to waves pounding on rocks below. A storm draws nigh. Light drips through clouds. The wind seems sorrowful. That's what the movie is: Ambiance, foreshadowing, the deterioration of Teddy's self-assurance, even selfhood. Scorsese induces pure dread, in various keys. Sculpting Robert Richardson's grandiose, angular, intensely colorful cinematography is Thelma Schoonmaker's trademark use of manipulated speeds, freeze-frames, those dang flashbulbs, as well as the ever more discriminating and poetic use of the cut from one shot to another that we always find in Scorsese's work.Some either think the ending doesn't hold water or the movie building towards it doesn't. What would be more gratifying? Compared to other films with similar twists, Shutter Island is much more understated, without the urge to repeat earlier moments for redundant effect during the revelation, which instead is played gradually, dawning on us. This is all of a story, even the pieces that don't seem to click. One's inclination is to distinguish what goes before, and make rational deductions. However, what if you can't peg precisely what went before? What if there were concealed things about various characters? What if the movie's perspective isn't objective but splintered? Where can it all go? We wonder. So does Teddy.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Wow! I mean really, WOW!!!!!!!!!!","How can someone not love Martin Scorsese? He continually reinvents himself and usually comes up with some of the best films ever seen in Hollywood. And he's also tried almost every genre there is: from deep sports dramas (""Raging Bull"") to horrifying case studies (""Taxi Driver"") to poignant period pieces (""The Age of Innocence"") to blockbuster action thrillers (""The Departed""), he adds a generous touch of greatness to all his films and makes them memorable in our minds. He does the same with his latest cinematic triumph ""Shutter Island"", a psychological thriller of almost surreal proportions and breath-taking beauty; it's not your typical Martin Scorsese film (then again, no Scorsese film is TYPICAL Scorsese), but his genius is apparent throughout the entire two hours and twenty minutes of the film.The story follows Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a war veteran who's investigating the disappearance of a dangerous psychotic murderess from Shutter Island, a secluded high-security prison for the criminally insane. The island itself is enough to give you the creeps: the only building is the prison itself, and the rest of the island is a vast wilderness of falling trees and jagged rocks. It's constantly being beaten by rough waves and storms, and the island is situated in the middle of nowhere; the only way in or out of the island is through its feeble port, which is controlled by the US army. The wardens at the island are mysterious and creepy (they're Ted Levine and John Carroll Lynch, the psycho murderers of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Zodiac"", so you get the picture) and the chief doctors and psychiatrists at the prison are even creepier: Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow), very intelligent specialists who always seem to be on the 'patient's' side and who mysteriously are uncooperative with Teddy's investigation.A patient named Rachel, a woman who drowned her three children, is one of the most dangerous inmates at the prison. She's quite violent (they say), and she lives in a delusion where her children are still alive and where the prison is actually her home and the inmates are her neighbors. During a stormy night, Rachel goes missing from her cell...which is quite strange, given the amount of security this particular prison offers, and she is now out and about who knows where. Teddy arrives to Shutter Island with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate her disappearance and to aid the wardens in her search. Nevertheless...Teddy has a secret agenda in accepting to help this investigation. As a war veteran fighting in the liberation of Dachau during WWII he learned of some horribly inhuman psychological experiments that were being conducted by the US government on the criminally insane, and he plans to uncover if Shutter Island has some connections to these experiments (which it probably does).Teddy is a highly tormented man: his experiences in Dachau, where he came in full view of the horrors humans are capable of have left him scarred. Not only that, but his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) had recently been killed in a fire accident in his LA apartment, where the pyromaniac janitor who worked there had been proved guilty and had been sent to Shutter Island but of whom (mysteriously) no one in Shutter Island has heard of. With a heavy heart and a heavily-laden agenda, Teddy aims to uncover the truth these creepy wardens, psychiatrists and patients are withholding from the world...but Shutter Island turns out to be more than Teddy can handle, and he soon finds himself in a nerve-shattering race to stay alive and, more importantly, to keep his sanity.The movie has all the elements of a pitch-perfect thriller, and it is just that. It's a thriller that has you breathless from the very first scene all the way to the very last horrifying twist at the end. Over two hours long and it doesn't waste a single minute. Once again, Scorsese gives a heavy dose of depth to his characters, especially Teddy whom we come to understand and identify ourselves with very early in the film. Every single scene is perfect! The cinematography is breath-taking and sublime, the lighting is a thriller's dream of perfection, the sound design and the music augments the film's tension to nerve-shattering levels and the exemplary acting makes the events unraveling on screen and the truths we discover all the more astounding. The screenplay, adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel has little or no flaws, and Scorsese seamlessly weaves all these quality aspects into one of the best films of the year! What can I say? I'm afraid that I can't say too much, for if I utter another syllable of the plot I would be giving the game away, and the individual aspects of the film work in such perfect symbiosis that they CAN'T be reviewed piece by piece lest the film is deprived of the wonder it conveys upon watching it. Suffice it to say that it's one of the best Scorsese films ever: VERY intelligent, suspenseful to a tee, deep, poignant, entertaining...you'll want to see it at least twice; I did, and the second time around it hadn't lost an iota of its greatness. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!! Oh, by the way: I can't fathom a possible reason why this film was left out of the Academy Awards this year. There's no reason, human or divine, why it shouldn't have received some nods. I can only hope it will be taken into consideration for next year's Academy Awards lest the Academy wants to indirectly declare themselves a fraud.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another mediocre Scorsese effort.,"Honestly, have we decided to give Martin a pass? Everyone raved about the Departed and it was a bad remake, heavy with metaphor and horribly miscast. Now we have a ""thriller"" with a predictable twist, ludicrous plot line and laughable dialogue. Seriously people; this is the guy that gave us Raging Bull and Goodfellas and Kundun. Now we're stuck with Gangs of New York and this piece of garbage. Unbelievable how many people are giving this movie such glowing reviews. It's as if the mystique of Scorsese has grown to such epic proportions that no one is willing to question or criticize him without facing the wrath of the film community. Well, I say keep your film community, I'll keep my ability to discern between great storytelling and overproduced crap.

Enjoyable Experience at the Matinée,"This film did what few films have; it made me think.I had higher expectations of this film for many reasons. One, Scorsese directed. Two, great cast. Three, the reviews on IMDb have been high.About half way through this movie I was glad that Scorsese was at the helm and not M. Night Shyamalan. It has that kind of feeling that you get watching one of M. Night's movies, but since Scorsese was directing, I didn't know that there would be a great ""twist"" or just an ending. Scorsese usually holds onto something to reveal at the end, but you can't ever anticipate the outcome.DiCaprio was outstanding, and Ruffalo did an incredible job portraying his character. And I think Scorsese outdid himself with this one. This wasn't a project that you would immediately point out that it was a strong point for him to direct. But he guided this dark tale to a great ending.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be taken in by a movie and anyone who likes to be provoked into thought.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just Amazing,"Shutter Island' is a movie that falls under the category of psychological thrillers and it can be a movie that even after a long long time, would keep me guessing. The storyline was so brilliantly constructed, with a turn that caused me to think that I was going crazy with the characters. It's a lesson in suspension, where literally nothing is as it appears. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a compelling performance that will make it difficult for you to leave your seat from the very beginning until the end. It has become almost like a haunting experience, with the eerie music and an engaging plot that forces you to keep your mouth shut. Whether or not you are into films that are experimental with your conception of real life, this may be what you are looking for.

Scorcese's on a roll here,"Scorcese has often been called America's greatest living director. Certainly with classics like Mean Streets, Taxidriver and Raging Bull to his credit decades ago, and others like Goodfellas and Gangs of New York in the intervening year, there is much weight in holding him in such high esteem, along with the expectations that come with it. My first impression with each new film since Goodfellas has been that its lesser Scorcese. He appears to have fallen from the lofty standards he set early in his career. The themes of the film do not have the gravitas one expects of a Scorcese film etc. On first viewing, I felt that way about both Gangs of New York and The Departed. Second and third viewings changed my opinion and I now know both films to be classics and the Scorcese magic is self evident.Shutter Island, which is a big move away from the broad range that Scorcese normally works within, is a horror-thriller film - well, more thriller than horror and thus more mainstream than his usual fare. The only other mainstream Scorcese film that comes to mind is Cape Fear. While I was never impressed with Cape Fear, the original B&W noir classic being far superior, I readily admit to loving Shutter Island from the first frame.People forget that Scorcese is the original film nerd and his understanding of cinema and the great masters is unparalleled. In this visually enchanting masterpiece, I saw clear shades of King Kong, the Val Lewton films of the 40s e.g. Isle of the Dead, Hitchcock's Vertigo and North by Northwest and of course the expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. However, it was all of a piece with a clear visual style that gelled and worked. There are remarkable set-pieces littered throughout the film - too many to mention. The performances are uniformly great. While, De Caprio, Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson are all acclaimed, Mark Ruffalo is less well known and shines in this, his best role since Zodiac.I won't go into the plot details but given that this is a thriller, suffice to say that there is at least one major plot twist. I've seen several reviewers commenting on and emphasizing the big twist. Many saw it coming and disliked the film, others couldn't see the twist coming and loved the film as a result. I think that basing your opinion on the plot twist misses the point. With the large number of thrillers that Hollywood churns out each year, I don't think is a plot twist out there that hasn't been covered threadbare by multiple films. What is important to me is the visual sense and style, which is present in Shutter Island in bucket-loads!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island,"Shutter Island is a 2010 film directed by Martin Scorsese, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio. This film is absolutely amazing on every aspect. Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of best performances in this film, along with good performances from Ben Kingsley, Michelle Willams, Jackie Earle Haley and Mark Ruffalo. The script is complicated, well written, and after a second viewing, makes you realize that clues were left behind all along. But the best thing about this film is its atmosphere. The island is designed in an absolute perfect way. With telling Cinematography and symbolism sprinkled across its entirety. The films editing and sound are very commendable as well. The film contains a lot of symbolism. The fire and water complex, and the multiple subtle hints of dialogue and action throughout. The film's score is brillant. I didn't even know that ""On The Nature Of Daylight"", was originally from this film. This film creates a grand illusion to the protagonist and the viewer. For most of the film, you are left believing in a fake character created by a real person. The viewer is just like Andrew in the fact that the world around them (the film) is set up, staged, and an elaborate attempt to get them to accept their doing and regain sanity. I'll have to watch this film more times to get every context clue. Spoiler Alert: Andrew killed his wife after she killed his kids. He was sent there, and created a fake U.S. Marshal named Teddy Daniels, and created the disappearance of Rachel to have something to investigate. He is also looking for Andrew Laeddis. The man he says killed his wife, when it was actual him. In ""reality"", he was doing this to take the blame and guilt from himself, and not face reality. The doctors played along, and set up the entire story. He begins to believe that he was set it up by the Doctors, and that this place was a Nazi brain experimental camp, and begins to hallucinate. He eventually finds out about the scheme, and this is the second time its happend. In fact all of the dreams and nightmares he have, feature a girl saying save me, who we first belive to a jew prisoner, but is actually his daughter. He wakes up and appears to have accepted reality, but later, it is revealed that he hasnt, or has he. He walks off, presumably getting a lobotomy, so his memory and feeling will be evaporated. This is the way I interpret this.He has accepted what he has done, but cant live with it, so he pretends to still be Teddy, in order to get his brain washed. Basically, his self dies without having killed anymore people. Terrific film, haunting, disturbing, thrilling, perplexing and a reality mind bender. ""we have the ability to deny reality even when it staring right back at it us, we always want to hold to what we want to be true."" The denial of reality, the creation of blame on someone else, the guilt and the trauma from killing or doing something or someone you cant get rid of that feeling. Perspective is everything in the interpretation of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scorsese Embarks on A Journey to The Mysterious Island!,"As Martin Scorsese's impeccably assembled thriller Shutter Island opens, we see a ferryboat emerging out of a Stygian murk so impenetrable it might well be taking Orpheus to the Underworld. On board are two U.S. Marshals fittingly attired in a trench-coat and fedora - frazzled WWII veteran Teddy Daniels (a resilient performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, delving into the psychological depths of his character) and his affable new partner Chuck Aule (a wonderfully understated Mark Ruffalo) heading towards Shutter Island, a storm-battered, rugged fortress occupied by Ashecliffe hospital, a high-security federal asylum for the criminally insane, where they have been summoned to investigate the disappearance of an delusional, infanticidal inmate Rachel Saldano. Daniels immerses himself into the investigation with unhealthy abandon.But he has quite a few demons of his own rattling around in his head as his dogged determination is undermined by crippling migraines, disconcerting memories of his recently dead wife Dolores (played with a detached coolness by Michelle Williams) and haunting visions of the horrific scenes he witnessed during wartime. The asylum staff and the patients are equally edgy and disturbing - almost comically sinister, so are the twin leaders of the clinical staff: the courteous but steely Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and the ironic, provocative German, Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). The paranoid marshal's fractured psyche soon begins to unravel a web of lies and conspiracy as the storm rages outside, and a succession of curious encounters suggest the sanatorium is being used for noxious experiments by the federal government in furtherance of the cold war, and he has been drawn there as an intended victim. But as Teddy's nightmares become indistinguishable from reality, we get a brilliantly constructed psychological thriller that threatens to upend our protagonist's grasp on veracity.What starts as a locked-room crackerjack mystery soon transforms into a trippy, psychological freak-out as doubts are cast over our protagonists sanity, with enough red herrings and unexpected twists to keep the mind engaged - eager for the next surprise. What Martin Scorsese does best is set the mood, an atmosphere of impending doom. Based on a tightly plotted, willfully schlocky pulp thriller that novelist Dennis Lehane penned, Scorsese injects the movie with an air of ambiguity - every moment is charged with suggestion and, frankly, insanity - forcing you to pay attention. As you are wrapped up in the wonderful characters, disturbing pathos, and taut pacing, Scorsese has fun indulging his cinematic sleight of hand. Scorsese packs the film with so many thrilling details, surreal asides and masterful set-ups that we can't help but enjoy the ride. And the cast is having fun as well, diving into their characters and ladling on the innuendo with arched eyebrows and shifty glances.Resembling a psychotropic reverie or unhinged fever dream, Shutter Island finds Martin Scorsese at his most technically accomplished as he triumphs with a powerful noir pastiche that sends the audience into a world of psychosis and paranoia.

Scorcese hasn't lost his touch!,"I love Martin Scorcese. There are few filmmakers in the history of cinema who are as capable of crafting a cinematic tour de force as he is. He is part of a great generation of filmmakers that includes Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, and of that generation he is the only one who is still consistently pumping out kick-ass movies. All of the filmmakers above have each directed at least one total stinker.Not Marty though.For me, Scorcese's films generally fall into three categories. There are the masterpieces, this category includes the indisputably awesome Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and The Departed; there are his films that while good, for one reason or another fall shy of greatness, these include Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, Kundun and Casino; finally there are the films where it seems he's stepping outside of his comfort zone and experimenting with different genres. This last category includes his remake of Cape Fear, After Hours, The King of Comedy and his latest film, Shutter Island.Shutter Island is Scorcese's first foray into the horror genre since 1991's Cape Fear. The film, based on a book (which I have not read) of the same title by novelist Dennis Lehane, is set in the 1950's on an island in Boston Harbor that houses a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane. Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo play a pair of U.S Marshals who travel to the island in order to investigate an escaped inmate. Once on the island, the Marshals quickly realize that everyone, including the two lead psychiatrists (portrayed by the always great Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow) are keeping secrets from them. It is clear that there is more going on than they had originally expected, paranoia and claustrophobia ensue. This is an extremely tough film to write about without giving anything away, and I strongly recommend that you get yourselves to the theater and check this one out as blindly as possible.The entire cast deliver outstanding performances, and if this film were released later in the year I would say that Dicaprio would be guaranteed a nomination for next years Oscar. I hope that the Academy, not prized for their long term memory, can keep ol' Leo in mind. This is absolutely the most deeply layered and interesting role he has ever tackled.To be honest, there are issues that I have with this film. Again, I'm walking a thin line here while trying to say something without really saying anything, but I will say that in the hands of lesser talent this film could have been a silly convoluted mess. However, in the exquisitely clever paws of Scorcese, and with the enormous amount of talent on the screen, the end result is an extremely creepy, atmospheric thriller that's sure to crawl around in your brain for hours after you finish viewing it.3.75 / 5 on the Awesome Meter",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Although set in a different location and time, it is basically the same story. I quite liked this one, but much prefer The Ninth Configuration for being the 'original'.I noticed a few continuity mishaps in the filming at the beginning of the movie, and cannot relate them to the story that later unravels. Being Scorcese as meticulous as he usually is, I have to accept that he made them on purpose... but cannot understand such purpose.Dicaprio is only OK. I was delighted to see von Sydow again!

A dazzling mess,"Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, ""Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!"" Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Intense, pure Scorsese","Martin Scorsese has always had the ability to pull his viewers in. His movies usually take place in a tormentingly bleak and familiar modern world, mixed in with small hints of grandeur, exotic and downright unfamiliar. Like so in this case as well. Shutter Island has a familiar feel to it. The idea of a mental asylum has been deeply ingrained into our collective cultural psyche and Scorsese uses that, presenting us an island that's both a cliché and something terrifyingly new. The colours are just a bit off, the characters sometimes step away from the roles that we have given them in our heads, the plot doesn't dance to the pipe that we all expect to hear. It's a harrowing experience at times, which is exactly the reason that makes the movie so interesting. The movie constantly throws us questions that we start to answer from our experience with these kinds of movies, but then we realize that the answer doesn't fit and we are left feeling lost and intrigued.Not to say that all of the twists are completely unexpected or even that original. It's a thriller after all and some genre conventions are still being respected, lovingly I might add. Scorsese has the ability to raise the ante, make us question our decisions and expectations, and at the same time make us guess and ponder about the case. Which makes for a great thriller. Add in some really nice acting, very nice editing and cinematography and a score that's just right for the mood, and you have in your hands an excellent film. Though I personally didn't care for the constant flashbacks as I thought that they broke the mood, but afterwards I could see their purpose, so my singular big complaint was reduced to a nitpick.All in all not Scorsese's best film, but a great piece of film-making, nonetheless. It's everything that a thriller should be and keeps surprising its viewers all the way to the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Well made but quite disappointing ...,"Scorsese is one of the best directors out there and since he has created some true masterpieces in the past I was so keen to watch his newest work 'Shutter Island'. My expectations for this movie were incredibly high which maybe resulted in even bigger disappointment. This movie was - in my opinion - not the next masterpiece that i wish it would be.Once again Scorsese's main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio with whom he worked the fourth(?) time in a row now. And yes - the whole cast in this movie is doing a good job. Scorsese could also provide a really well directed movie for sure. There are some great images and good camera work in this film.The big problem that the movie has is in its plot. I wont give anything away from it but what really bothered me is the way the story develops. The pace is pretty slow and as I'm looking back there are not many scenes i can remember. No real highlights throughout most of the film. Also the lack of suspense - there was no time in the theater when i was frightened or anything like it ... it goes on and on with lots of dialog and some - really cool - flashbacks to the past of the main character but does not really get anywhere with it.While the ending itself is pretty good again and saved some credit points for the movie it just doesn't work. What a pity because it seems like the whole movie relies entirely on it... The reason it doesn't work is simply because you already got the main ""twist"" half into the movie and you are not really impressed when it finally happens though there are some cool details and kind of a second little twist at the very end.All in all it was a bit of a mess, doesn't really work as a psycho-thriller and though it was well made it did not entertain me a lot.See it or skip it? Well I'm not sad that i saw it but i don't think you have to see it ... maybe rent it for less money when it comes out and give it a try. Cheers.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Shutter Island: Riddled With Flaws,"Shutter Island, the new film from Martin Scorsese, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Personally, I had great faith in the film and was quite looking forward to it. The premise seemed quite interesting and possessing of wonderful potential.And that it was: Leonardo DiCaprio is US Marshall Teddy Daniels, sent to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner from the eponymous institution for the criminally insane. Working through the stress of a recent tragedy, he falls deeper and deeper into the mysterious case, where everyone seems to be hiding something.When I first saw Teddy's partner Chuck, and heard in my head the words he was about to say (""You okay boss?""), I knew things were not going to go as well as I hoped. Predictability reigned supreme. From that clichéd 50s detective line to the ""twist"" ending, bearing all the subtlety and surprise of a loud and luminescent train, things were often painfully obvious. The beginning is annoyingly over-dramatic, the score astoundingly over the top. Plot-exposition-by-numbers soon follows, as well as the overstated oddness of this island. After a very flawed introduction, the film does turn in a better direction. The middle was far more enjoyable than what came before, winning me over somewhat with its developing strangeness. It's not long, however, before the clear signs are given and we see the ending about halfway into the film, making the rest rather a waste of time. We plummet dramatically into a worse third act than first. I was shocked at Marty's descent into intensive plot explanation, taking perhaps half an hour of drawn out dialogue followed by dramatisations of that very dialogue and making me feel as though he thought I was a child incapable of understanding what was happening. For goodness' sake, Ben Kingsley even unveils a drawn out explanation from beneath a velvet cover. Grow up Marty, and don't be so condescending. The movie also owes far more than it cares to admit to The Shining, desperately yearning to be the infinitely superior film for a good portion of its running time while adding the music of Cape Fear gone mad. My poor ears.Shutter Island is riddled with flaws. It is clunky, overly long, shamefully evident, unoriginal, inconsistent in quality and poorly derivative of a far more enjoyable film. There is enjoyment to be found, however, in the fun middle section and closing statement; one which did at least lend gravitas to its climax. A poor film it may be, but it is at least a fun one at that. Scorsese has underperformed here, though not entirely terribly.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Tense, provocative and practically impeccable from a technical point of view, ""Island of Fear"" is one of the most underrated films in the exceptional career of Martin Scorsese","Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, author of other literary works that resulted in film adaptations of good caliber such as About Boys and Wolves, Isle of Fear is a crime thriller with an extremely macabre tone to the point of being sometimes even difficult to watch, but which challenges, under the guise of suspense, our perception of reality. In 1954, federal police officers Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rachel Solando, an inmate/patient at an island's psychiatric unit - actually a large boulder, a ""bombed"" version of the famous Alcatraz - on the coast of Massachusetts, finding a hostile environment both from the psychiatrists, Drs. John Cawley and Jeremiah Naehring, played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, and from the prison officers and criminals interned there. And that's not counting the violence of nature itself, with a very strong storm that doesn't take long to start and that reflects all of Teddy's mental confusion that already starts with his discomfort on the ferry on the way to the island and that only gets worse.Dark and claustrophobic, Shutter Island starts from a well-arranged plot already in the pages of Lehane's novel. However, what makes it a less common cinematographic work is Scorsese's ability to bring it into the realm of moving images. Throughout the film, there are memorable sequences, such as Edward and Chuck's frightening arrival at the prison, which recalls the best of the 50's crime and suspense cinema - Alfred Hitchcock, Jules Dassin, Otto Preminguer, Fritz Lang, Samuel Fuller and Nicholas Ray appear, for different reasons, to have been references for Scorsese. The director conducts the plot in a way in which the viewer is involved, curious, and at the same time afraid of what is to come. This is the main characteristic of a good thriller: the connection with the audience.Robert Richardson's camera, Hugo, JFK and The Aviator (for which he won the Oscar for best photography), alternates panoramics, wide and grandiloquent shots to intimate, even invasive close-ups that confuse and deceive the viewer. At the same time, the indoor and outdoor shots gradually gain more complexity and labyrinthine characteristics that make the island complex, initially seen with a benevolent camera and a lighter and even colorful color palette, increasingly dark and oppressive, sometimes even just as terrifying as on the cliffs near the lighthouse and especially in Wing C, dedicated to the most dangerous criminals. The great art direction, led by Max Biscoe, Robert Guerra and Christina Ann Wilson, who does a wonderful job in creating the scary environment in which the film takes place. It's also worth mentioning the film's oppressive soundtrack, which also contributes to Scorsese's homage to the B-movies.Other brilliant moments in the film are Edward's surreal delusions, especially the one in which his wife dematerializes to ashes in his arms. And what about the scenes of Edward and Chuck inside the asylum's maximum security wing, which they manage to break in when the generator that supplies the island with energy fails? Great. There is also a special sequence, which shows a Nazi death camp, in which director, cinematographer, cast and art direction work in a dizzying way, showing us beautiful and shocking scenes. These few minutes focused on the 2nd. War can be heavier than many epics based on these conflicts. I also highlight the dream scenes between Daniels and Dolores, all plastically quite interesting.Furthermore, the script by Laeta Kalogridis, in her fourth feature, sprinkles the work of visual clues for the great final revelation that Scorsese materializes in a disconcerting way in the film, playing with perceptions, with memory and with the profound estrangement that the production causes. However, this same script is marked by a great imbalance. If the whole construction of the mystery works well - but perhaps more thanks to the visuals of the work -, the same cannot be said of its ending, which seems more like a race to reach the ""shyamalanesca"" twist. It's not even a question that logic is lost or that the events of the finale betray what came before, but rather that Scorsese can't efficiently keep up the rhythmic rhythm of the opening two-thirds, with the montage of Thelma Schoonmaker, his partner. Long-time professional getting lost in the back-and-forth, the intensification of action and the relative bureaucracy of ""explanation"".As secrets are revealed, tension rises and mysteries are unraveled. The script is well tied and the ending, despite surprising, manages to fill in the gaps left by the mystery. This does not mean that there will be no doubts, and the viewer will probably end the movie thinking about everything that happened, still digesting all the events. The story itself may not impress these days, but that's not Scorsese's proposal. The film takes place in 1954, at the height of the Cold War, after World War II, the horror caused by the death camps was still on everyone's mind, including the few scenes where DiCaprio's central character has flashbacks of his passing through one of these fields, which manages to be a stronger scene than many movies have tried to do with just that focus and have failed.Scorsese dominates the narrative by delivering fragments of Teddy's past, combining the tension of an approaching storm and all the tension present in the prison where everyone hides the truth. The director's trump card is to build everything slowly and with good doses of mystery, while letting his character practically suffocate in front of something beyond his control. There are discreet clues present in the script to situate the audience, such as the looks between some characters at certain moments or even the hilarious green tie of DiCaprio's character. It's the subtleties that reveal the truth, and yet, when the director allows the audience to piece the puzzle together, it's always a unique experience - and one that gets better with each review.However, it is by portraying the hero's torment as a result of his memories that Shutter Island really takes on the contours of a masterpiece: constantly bringing flashbacks and/or delusions in which the planes are dominated by suspended materials (snow, rain, ash or roles), the film illustrates the ethereal, fickle and distressing nature of Teddy's memories while, from a purely analytical point of view, fascinates by the brilliance of its symbolism - as in the moment, for example, when we see Michelle Williams partially and almost simultaneously charred, soaked and bleeding.Emotionally devastating in its final minutes (the shot in which DiCaprio appears hugging his three children, in the lake, represents the moment of greatest terror of the projection), Shutter Island still has an ending not only impeccable, but also enriched by a tragic irony.. Unable to achieve self-redemption (and how could he, after all he's been through?) and frustrated in his attempts to run away from himself, as his doctors insist on bringing him ""back"", Teddy finally discovers the way. Definitive way to leave his suffering behind - and his final speech already represents one of the most emblematic moments of Scorsese's career as it indicates the protagonist's decision to deliberately use the madness that had dominated him in the past as a farce that allows his self-destruction. And just as Nicholson's Jack Torrance was finally ""absorbed"" into the spirit of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels seems to decide that the labyrinth of insanity he'd used as a defense mechanism was the best he'd ever done for himself. - and it would be better to lose himself there forever than to be rescued and live with the tragic and monstrous nature of his own life.Dominated by a conspiratorial atmosphere, since all the characters seem to be hiding something from the protagonist, Shutter Island has a fascinating cast. It's interesting to mention how ideal Scorsese's partnership with DiCaprio is. Previously working on ""The Aviator"", ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Departed"", success is achieved again here, with the addition of DiCaprio's constant evolution as an actor. He does very well in conveying to the viewer the growing paranoia and panic that his character goes through. Daniels is a man who has been through a lot of traumas in his life and his stay on Shutter Island ends up exposing them to us and to himself in an overwhelming way. Mark Ruffalo presents himself in a very restrained way, despite having a scene in which the actor loosens up a lot in an important scene between him and DiCaprio. Michelle Williams, who appears only in flashbacks and in Teddy's dreams, appears quite artificial in the scene, being the weak point of the cast. Ben Kingsley is back in good shape with the ambiguous Dr. Cawley, a pleasant surprise. Max Von Sydow, with his powerful voice, has little less than a cameo, and it's sad to see him so little in the scene, even though he has a great dialogue with DiCaprio.Shutter Island is a highly recommended experience. The film's only flaw is that it appears to be longer than it actually is, but all the items mentioned above manage to overcome this problem. The feature represents cinema from a more experienced, more practical and more courageous genius. Tense, provocative and practically impeccable from a technical point of view, ""Island of Fear"" is one of the most underrated films in the vast and exceptional career of Martin Scorsese that goes deep into its themes that, even though already worked by the director, take even more contours. Dramatic thanks to the way it decided to approach them. In the end, we are presented with a film that reveals that our actions are not more powerful than the way we choose to face them. And after all, what would be worse: living like a monster or dying like a good man?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Masterpiece of the 20th Century,"This title is undeniably one of the 20th century's greatest cinematic achievements. It stands as a testament to the incredible talents of its cast and crew, led by, the always, brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio, who delivers what I consider to be his finest performance to date.Scorsese, who usually is extraordinary, doesn't disappoint in Shutter Island. This is a visual and narrative tour de force that takes the viewer on a mind-bending journey into the depths of human psychology and paranoia. Scorsese's masterful direction infuses every frame with an eerie and unsettling atmosphere, keeping the audience on edge throughout the film.DiCaprio's portrayal of Teddy Daniels is nothing short of extraordinary. He captures the character's complexities, vulnerabilities, and inner turmoil with a depth rarely seen in cinema. His performance is a true highlight of his illustrious career, and it's a testament to his dedication to his craft. But the excellence doesn't stop with DiCaprio. Mark Ruffalo, delivers one of his most captivating performances as Teddy's partner. Ruffalo's chemistry with DiCaprio is palpable, adding depth and authenticity to their on-screen relationship. Ben Kingsley as well, a legend in his own right, graces the film with his presence and impeccable acting skills. His portrayal of the enigmatic psychiatrist at Shutter Island, is chillingly convincing, keeping the audience guessing about his true intentions until the very end, unbelievable acting. Not to be forgotten, the supporting cast, especially John Carroll Lynch and Patricia Clarkson, contribute significantly to the film's success. Their performances are nuanced and captivating, helping to create a world where nothing is as it seems.What truly sets ""Shutter Island"" apart is its mind-bending plot and impeccably crafted script. It weaves a web of intrigue and suspense that keeps you guessing until the final, jaw-dropping reveal. The plot twist in this film is nothing short of sensational and is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it. In addition to its stellar performances and mind-bending plot, the film boasts remarkable cinematography, evoking a hauntingly beautiful yet eerie atmosphere. The visuals perfectly complement the unsettling narrative, creating an immersive experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""Shutter Island"" is a cinematic masterpiece of the 20th century. With Leonardo DiCaprio's unforgettable performance and Martin Scorsese's impeccable direction, it stands as one of the best-written and most memorable movies ever made. I wholeheartedly give it 10 stars and consider it a must-see for any film enthusiast.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Mediocre at best,"It's 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sidekick Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are on the ferry to Shutter Island. The island could be Alcatraz, except that instead of criminals, it houses the criminally insane. One of their inmates has apparently escaped, and Daniels and Aule have been sent to investigate. But the investigator turns out to be the one being investigated.Shutter Island gets off to a fairly good start. It does a competent job of building the apparently normal, but-you-know-something-is-going-on atmosphere. Ben Kingsley is nice and creepy as the frosty psychiatrist Dr. Cawley. You just know that he and his team are hiding a Dark Secret. However, it quickly goes downhill, and like Daniels, I was also searching for a way to abandon the island at the half-way point. It picks up again in the second half, but just around the point where you think it's going to get interesting, you realise you've seen it all before. That said, even though the dénouement is predictable, it's done well enough to stick with to the end.Acting-wise, the only one worth watching is Ben Kingsley. He plays the ambiguous Dr. Cawley to perfection, and sent a little shiver down my spine each time he appeared on screen. Leonardo DiCaprio never rises above his usual 'Hello I'm Leonardo DiCaprio playing a character in a film' performance (apologies to his fans, but I just don't rate him) and Mark Ruffalo as the sidekick is unremarkable.It's 20 years since Scorcese made Goodfellas (1990), 22 years since 'The Last Temptation of Christ' (1988), 30 years on from 'Raging Bull' (1980) and 34 years since 'Taxi Driver' (1976). I can't help feeling he's losing his touch. This has all the hallmarks of a film churned out just because those concerned needed to make a bit of money.Shutter Island is at best mediocre. There's nothing new or original in it. Go see 'A Beautiful Mind' instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm sure there was a story in there somewhere. A story that has been done a million times over and much, much better.It is impossible to cite specific instances of guffaw-inducing movie-making in Shutter Island--because it was so darn awful THROUGHOUT! The first clue was that inane pounding, silent-film-organ-like music that introduced every scene you in which you were supposed to scream--and not laugh hysterically. If they had cut out all that flashback nonsense, which of course I am sure Scorcese thought was so wonderfully 'artistic', they could have got the film down to about 90 minutes and could have had, well, certainly not a GOOD movie but one that was definitely not as awful as what was produced. Reminded me a lot of Gangs of New York, which also started out very strong but then went on for 100 hours. At least that was an interesting subject and prompted me to buy the book it was based on and read it. I certainly don't feel that way about Shutter Island.

Surrealism,"Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock.

An unexpected ending,"Shutter Island, is a 2010 American movie based on the novel written by Dennis Lehane directed by Martin Scorsese starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Ben Kingsley.The story follows Teddy Daniels, a U. S federal Marshal and his partner Chuck Aule sent to an island of Massachusetts known as Shutter Island, a mental hospital for the criminally insane, to investigate for the disappearance of a patient. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, as the story progresses, the plot becomes more twisted and more complexity adds to it.From top to bottom the performances are strong and forceful, and the powerful manner in which screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis keeps the story grounded in the deep emotional of its characters kept me on the edge of my seat. Shutter Island is an original film that has re-ignited the thriller genre exceeding the supposed limitations of its genre and offering its audience something challenging and psychologically fascinating.I would recommend this movie seeing a second time. In fact, it is better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time. It is a film that will leave you breathless, and searching for answers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Fun to sit through, but little longevity","After two decades of making the gangster films that his name's synonymous with, Martin Scorsese goes for something else entirely: a period-set mystery/horror/thriller that takes place in a remote, island-bound lunatic asylum during the 1950s. Scorsese openly admitted that his film's highly influenced by the Val Lewton-produced horror films of the 1940s, where lighting, camera setup and atmosphere play key roles and the emphasis is on toying with the viewer's imagination, conjuring demons in the shadows instead of trolleying in the latest variant on Frankenstein's monster.And for the most part, SHUTTER ISLAND is a decent piece of filmmaking. The movie's distinctive look is a highlight, with the old horror movie clichés (dark and stormy nights, forbidding buildings) brought vividly back to life. Scorsese even employs some dodgy back projection during the car journeys in homage to the films of yesteryear. Leonardo DiCaprio is another strength, bringing to life the character of his tortured investigator Teddy Daniels and experiencing some highly disturbing nightmares along the way.The supporting cast is packed with familiar archetypes played by familiar actors: the reliable partner (Mark Ruffalo), the urbane but slightly sinister asylum head (Ben Kingsley), along with many others including a trio of villainish types (Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas). As the film went on, things began to jump out at me: clues, sometimes over-obvious I thought, pointing towards a twist ending. The suspense builds and the story deepens and I become more and more convinced of the way the film was heading. In the end, I turned out to be right; I'd sussed it early on.As the credits rolled, I realised that I hadn't been entirely impressed with the production overall: it's well-made, certainly, but it covers exactly the same kind of ground that I've watched in countless B-movies from the 1930s onwards. I couldn't help but sense a slight pretentiousness to the script, a 'look aren't we clever' feel to the plotting. When compared to a similar psychological movie like THE MACHINIST, SHUTTER ISLAND comes up short. It's fun to watch once, but slightly vacuous, and once you find out the nature of the joke you're not going to want to go over it all again.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Welcome to the Mean Streets of the Mind,"There are two ""light bulb"" moments in Shutter Island, director Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller. The first goes off early in the film where the viewer concludes the film they are watching is a complete bomb. The second illuminates in the final reel where the realization sets in that one's just witnessed a minor masterpiece in the Scorsese canon, and a movie far superior to the best efforts of the majority of directors working today.Though it may be hard to believe, Shutter Island careens dramatically from abysmal to genius in a couple of film reels, in what has to be the most astonishingly pleasant about face for a movie since light started being exposed to acetate.Based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone, Baby, Gone), Shutter Island tells the story of two US marshals, Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo), who are sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at the Shutter Island facility for the criminally insane, a fictional isolated island akin to Alcatraz, off Massachusetts.Daniels investigation slowly unveils that the facility is being used as a prototype ""black ops"" base whereby psychiatrists, building on Nazi experiments, are seeking to transform select patients into ""Manchurian candidate"" like killing machines.Yet all is not what it seems and that serves as both the Achilles heel and beautiful lynchpin underlying Shutter Island. No sooner does the story's continual messing with the audience's head begin to grow tiresome, than it suddenly transforms into a splendid revelation, integral to the overall composition of the film.Peppered with acting firepower, even in its brief supporting roles with unsettling appearances by the likes of Watchmen's Jackie Earle Haley, and Silence of the Lambs' Ted Levine, Shutter Island fails to encroach upon the turf of such Scorsese masterworks as Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but rather is more on par with The King of Comedy or his remake of Cape Fear for its directorial savvy and acting prowess. Superior to 2006's The Departed, but short of Goodfellas, this is a slightly above middle-of-the-pack Scorsese film. Such is the body of Scorsese's work that even his middling efforts come across as gems compared to much of what comes out of Hollywood these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Scorsese fosters the inanity of Hollywood,"If you've seen the trailer, and are a cinema-goer who enjoys thrillers or mysteries, you already know the plot of the first half of the film. Thus, I won't chronicle the movie's events, as that will neither persuade you to, or dissuade you from, seeing this film. Obviously, the following will be subjective. It is a review, after all.First of all, I highly respect Scorsese as a film maker and an artist. His characters, infamous for their actions and humanity, have always been directed with a rare finesse. He picks stories with grit and emotion and is a master at such. Of late, however, he has seemingly acknowledged he can't outdo his acclaimed character masterpieces (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas) and has turned to genre pieces. I had high expectations going into this one, despite it being a February release (confounding). I was hoping, if not for a return to form for Scorsese, at least for something as entertaining as Departed, or as gorgeous and deliberate as the Aviator, or as vindictive as Gangs of New York. It had these qualities, but their respective stage time was uneven, intermittent at best. Onto the filmThe atmosphere isn't gripping, but it is done in a lovely fashion. The story isn't captivating, but it is intriguing. The score isn't a subtle undercurrent, but it sure gets loud. The CGI is distracting, and I felt that many shots were uninspired and completely reliant on the location. But, as expected, the acting is commendable. Some of the cinematography is very nice. Also notable are Teddy's backstories, which were well implemented and interesting. Moving on, my gripes.Critics are saying that the big twist (and it's a biggen) is either completely shocking, or completely nonsensical. In reality, its both. It's both because it comes out of almost thin air, and just makes you feel stupid. Don't be alarmed after the dust settles, though, because I doubt that 10% of the audience will have a notion of what ultimately happens. The ending isn't decisive, and I don't mind ambiguous endings, but this was just silly. There are discrepancies that may make you want to pull your hair out. Without saying much else, as so I don't ruin anything, this was ultimately disappointing. The first half was superb, but the first climactic point is actually a poor plot device in disguise, whereafter the story takes a hard dive into mediocrity. While this film is certainly above average, it's entertainment value is greatly diminished by its latter components. It saddens me that a living master is contributing to inanity in contemporary film-making.Also, by the time the credits roll, you should have realized you've seen this film a few times before. I will not list any of them here, though, as they would ruin the fun of discovery! Enjoy, and happy viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Someone is missing!  Yeah.  Scorsese.,"I don't want to be cast asunder for words of heresy but is Martin Scorsese losing it? I only ask because Shutter Island is a load of old claptrap. The reviews I've read seem to be unable to make their minds up about it and IMDb seems to have lost its marbles a little by awarding it 8.1 and a place in the coveted all time Top 250. Surely not for long when common sense kicks in and people review it for what it is. A mess.The movie really is a tram smash of ideas, styles and plotting. There's a neat twist in it but the utterly gratuitous Dachau strand to the movie is verging on the disgraceful. Parts of the film, certainly in the first half flashback to Di Capprio's experiences as an American GI liberating the Dachau concentration camp would be, you'd have thought, central to the plot. Not a bit of it. This strand hangs about meaningfully but without meaning. But that's the issue with this whole movie. It seems to want to inject meaning into a genre that really is just about entertainment. In doing so it lifts ideas from The Shining (some brilliantly), Silence of the Lambs (unconvincingly) and Hitchcock (at his worst) but they go nowhere. The cinematography flits about from the stunning, the scene in which DiCapprio and his young bride embrace during a fire is mesmerising, to the laughable - again DiCapprio is featured driving through a forest as a passenger with the Asylum's head warder in front of a blue-screened background that could have been shot in 1954 (the year the movie is set) - I suspect the latter was deliberate. If so it was another misguided idea.The grading leaps about from 21st century hi-def to 1950's colour-noir and can't seem to decide what it is that it wants to be.Dicapprio is unconvincing, so too Rufallo and Sir Ben Kingsley? Well, he is actually lampooning himself. Awful, truly awful.Do not waste your money on this rubbish.4 out of 10",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

DiCaprio was solid, as always, Ben Kingsley did his usual classy, impressive job, the film looked great (some very Hitchcockian tones and textures), the music was good, and the script was well done. The flashback/fantasy sequences might have been somewhat over the top (Peter Jackson indulged himself in the same way in ""The Lovely Bones""), and overall this movie was just not as good as the sum of its parts.

Am I the only one who found it complex?,"Let me clarify who I am so you can choose to put this review in perspective..I became a huge fan of Leo Dicaprio (LDC) after watching Aviator. Then after watching Departed and Blood Diamond I strongly feel he's the best out there. I also admire Scorsese but mainly because of his LDC movies.Honestly this film was nowhere near the league of their previous collaborations. I am not averse to complex scripts - loved Memento, Sixth Sense, Prestige. But it becomes too complex if the viewer has to retrace the scenes and differentiate the illusions from the reality. The movie is probably more suited for purists who can try hard to make sense of everything that unfolds towards the end.On the plus side, LDC gives another standout performance. I read in some site that he was extremely stressed after this movie and its not difficult to see why. Its a very difficult role and LDC is one who literally transforms himself into the character he portrays.Background score is good. The movie is shot very well and has apt locations.Most importantly the movie keeps you glued till the end. So its definitely worth watching once for anyone who likes a mystery.

He is just brilliant, and I can't think of a film of his that I've seen which I didn't at least think deserved credit for it's efforts. You can always feel the labor of love in every frame.Is this Goodfellas? Taxi Driver? Raging Bull? The Aviator? Far from it. But, I've always held this film in high regard because Scorsese went for something that he had never done before. You can say of course that he pulled off some thriller/suspense/horror with Cape Fear, which hinged greatly on De Niro's performance, but with Shutter Island, there's just an... atmosphere to it that is so brilliantly realized. Writing-wise, I don't think it's Lehane's best work. Marty though, he took this material and, in working with Richardson and the rest of the crew, created something truly memorable. A great cast as well, with Leo driving it home as always.It was pretty predictable, and has some flaws, sure, and I understand those complaints. But, it's not so much that the plot always needs to surprise us, perhaps just entertain us and compel us. Scorsese knows how to do that. He does things with this film (especially visually) that he had never done, and hasn't done since.As a film lover, I'm proud to have it as a part of my collection, -- well, I own all of Marty's films so maybe I'm just biased, ha -- but I really do think it's something special, and a must-see for any lover of cinema. Don't pay attention to some of these extremely negative reviews and give it a chance! As always, with film, keep an open mind!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

DiCaprio and Scorsese prove a incredulous duo yet again.,"Having only seen one of the double acts now a total of four collaborations (The Aviator) the pressure was certainly on for DiCaprio and Scorsese to produce another masterpiece that exceeded their previous work in any and every way possible to prove they were still as capable as ever since their first outing in 'Gangs of New York'.Shutter Island which is arguable Scorsese's most chilling film to date despite being labelled as a psychological mystery-thriller is a clear monument to one of the greatest directors around that he is as close to his celebrated status as he is in his synchronized partnership with DiCaprio.Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is a U.S. Marshal whom with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) investigates the disapearance of a mentally ill patient from the island, which unfortunately proves a giant emotional and physical effort for poor Ted. If he isn't being haunted by his dead wife in his dreams then he's pulling at strings about trying to work out how a patient escaped a locked cell with no shoes. Bummer eh?But as expected one mystery leads to another then another giving this more twists than a Curly Whirly and plot that leaves you forever guessing the unguessable. So as you can imagine the ending is an indulgence that's both immensely satisfying and one in keeping with the surprise element of plot shocks and the shocks guaranteed to scare.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Nicely done, I hated it","If you abstract away the performance of the actors, which was brilliant, the imagery, which was most of the time very good, although sometimes over the top, the movie is a pretty straight forward example of a type that I personally dislike. Telling you what type that is would spoil everything, so I'll just give you this: prepare for an ending that might suck.That being said, let's not abstract the actors yet. Leonardo de Caprio played very well, with a performance reminding me of The Aviator, while the supporting cast, even if having rather limited roles, did their job very well. If you look at the distribution, though, it was only to be expected.The way the movie was shot was very nice, with images both visually nice and emotionally charged. Sometimes, though, special effects and scene manipulation went overboard, as is the case with the dreams and the scene when the German soldiers fall in the same rhythm as the camera moving...Bottom line: if the idea behind it doesn't annoy the crap out of you, then you will probably like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A movie on ADHD,"A Federal Marshall going to investigate the escape and disappearance of an inmate in an Criminal Insane Asylum. Great plot the trailers were outstanding. DiCaprio was stellar and believable as the Marshall. In fact all of the acting was good. The problem with this movie was the disjointed script. The movie did not really flow and seemed like a poor copy of an m night shyamalan film. M Night needed to be involved in this screenplay. I was so bored, dozed off twice, that I did not really care where the plot tried to take me. The saving grace was the strength of the cast but the cast could not overcome a very poor screenplay. Scorcese dropped the ball on this one. Much too bouncy. Like a mind that bounces from idea to idea and never really gets anything done. Don't waste your time on this one.

Fantastic Psychological thriller,"Am I real? Or is everything around me is true, who am I? Yup these are some weird doubts that pricked my mind after watching this 2010's Psychological thriller ''Shutter Island'', initially this movie seems to be moving from neurotic to the psychotic, but it's only at the end we come to know that Edward Daniels aka Andrew Laeddis (DiCaprio) is suffering with some serious psychotic illness.This film is about the formation of new identity in order to disclose the previous unpleasant events happened; the movie begins with US Marshal Edward Daniels and his investigation partner Chuck Aule come to the Shutter Island (an isolated mental asylum for criminally insane) on the investigation of disappearing in-patient Rachel in the course of his investigation he never get the proper cooperation that he expected from the Hospital authority, this make him to think that something is wrong in that place meanwhile his hallucinated image of his wife tells that Andrew Laeddis the one who was responsible for killing his wife is also in the same island, he also tries to find him, in the course of finding him he also encounters some unexpected characters like George Noyce and ''the real Rachel Solando'' from them he learns that the hospital is conducting the experiment on the patients in a very barbaric way using the method of lobotomise and even he is under their experiment, knowing this he comes to the lighthouse the place where he believed that operation takes place and there he finds Dr.Cawley who tells Daniels that he is not in any kind of investigation he is been in that island from two years under the treatment for killing his bipolar wife who killed their children, and his real identity is not Edward Daniels instead he himself is the Andrew Laeddis, and his so called partner Chuck was his doctor who treated him and the entire plot was the part of their treatment to make him cure, he initially don't believe these and faints, when he is woken up he accepts the truth that he is Andrew Laeddis, but after sometime when he tells his Doctor whom he believed as his parter about escaping from the island they think he is not cured and they decide to lobotomise him and at last with the statement of ""Which would be worse? To live as a monster or to die as the good man'' he goes to be lobotomised.The entire tricky plot is so interesting that every bit of the movie is very curious, the must watch flick for every Psych-thriller fan, it's been neatly made without any flaws to be found (though some could be exempted) DiCaprio is fabulous with his performance, his neat portrayal of an investigator and the psychotic patient were mind-blowing, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley are the best overall its curious plot holds you up to the end, the cinematography and the unique BGM's are some other +point of these movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The price of progress is such a pity,"great story, loved the book and the story carries the film but for me it just doesn't work as a movie, the book allows you to imagine the scenarios whereas the film has no choice but to force them on you. de caprio does a decent job as the confused and tormented ted daniels but memories of the beach came flooding back In his performance, can't help but feel he was miss cast for this pivotal role in the movie. a decent watch that will leave most baffled as they leave the theater, it's just a matter of interpretation really. The movie has it's moments in particular with the setting and portraying across to the viewer the feeling of being trapped with the island and the dark stormy weather which does good things for the film. However a better overall experience is to be gained by reading the book before watching the movie because it truly is a better read than a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A definite letdown,"Let me say that I went into this movie without having read the book. I was coming in blind, so to speak. Also, I was coming in hopeful. A psychological thriller starring Leo and being directed by Scorsese? Who wouldn't be a little excited? However, my excitement ended shortly after the opening credits.The entire movie was boring, predictable, and I found myself not caring about any of the characters. From the first five minutes, the obvious and supposedly twisted ending is revealed all too easily for the careful watcher. It gives you a feeling that the creators of this film don't think the audience can figure things out for themselves. Everything is handed to us and there's no time for suspense because everything is being answered before you can become curious. There is a great score that's guaranteed to give you goosebumps, but the film doesn't deliver anything but a few jumps here and there.All in all, this film was a horrible miss at a psychological thriller. Both Scorsese and DiCaprio should stick to what they know.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is a movie that will leave you questioning what's real and what isn't.,"This is a spoiler-free review.This movie's ending (which I will avoid spoiling) is EMOTIONALLY GUT WRENCHING. Do NOT spoil this movie for yourself. It is best watched without researching ANYTHING. Moving On.This movie marks the return of the Dynamic Director-Actor Duo Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, which is always a good sign, what with Inception among other movies.From the get-go, the film seems visually stunning, with one of the most amazing filming locations I've ever seen. The time period of our setting being the 1950's, everything fits in : The medical practices, the clothes, the language used ; it's all meticulously crafted into one hell of a story.Our Main Character and Protagonist, played by none other than Leonardo DiCaprio, is a U.S. Marshall and Ex-WWII soldier with a tragic backstory. He is sent to investigate a case involving an escaped patient at a Mental Institution for the Criminally Insane, accompanied by his partner ""Chuck"".However, he gets suspicious of the establishment, making discoveries, alongside his partner, that there is something much bigger than just housing for the mentally unstable. This leads to one of the most divisive, and genuinely amazing, endings I've ever witnessed. I can only use one comment to describe the ending without spoiling anything :That twist will hit you so hard you could pass for a pack of Twizzlers by the end of it.The script is incredibly well crafted, taking into account every detail that will lead up to an amazing finale. Every single scene in the movie offers something to the ending. It is truly one of the most remarkable executions of a storytelling I've ever witnessed. Even things you would believe to be pointless and thrown into the film just to make sure people expecting an action movie don't nod off, comes back full circle.As for the plot's believability, it's crafted well enough to pass, but that would only be the case were it set in modern times. This movie is set in the 1950's, which changes everything in this movie from ""Hardly Believable"" to ""Completely Plausible"". The suspension of disbelief in this movie is used to it's maximum potential.The Characters are built perfectly for the story, which only makes even more sense towards the ending.And the final line of dialogue in the film is one of, if not the most, impactful line of dialogue I have ever seen delivered. It was done in such a way, that it only increases the questioning you had about the twist ten-fold.The cinematography and lighting is ON POINT ! As well as the effects in the film. (Albeit a few cheesy moments in the dream scenes, but easily forgivable due to it being, well, a dream scene)Overall AMAZING movie. When you can make something unimportant become important at the most crucial moment of a movie, and have it make PERFECT SENSE, you have my vote.As a closing statement : Inception's ending ain't got jack on this.If you don't like the ending, that's fine, but you have to give it credit, it'll leave you blown away for 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on how hard you take it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Scorsese's most precious gem,"I loved how ""Shutter Island"" executes a plot that viewers may find plain and obvious but will ultimately leads you to a long-lasting realization and appreciation. The film successfully gave what viewers' want more from a mystery-psychological neo-noir thriller but with an extraordinary twist.

I still cannot comprehend this film...,"Writing this review weeks after watching Shutter Island, you would have thought I could now grasp exactly what happened. However, I still remain the same as the night I finished watching... dumbfounded. With sterling performances from all the actors and a twisted complex plot, this was truly a movie that made me sit up and listen.Shutter island is the story of a US Marshal investigating the escape of a patient on the island which is revealed as a hospital for the criminally insane. At the beginning of the film I thought I had it pegged - a simple investigation where a terrible truth was uncovered. Although, as the plot unfolded viewers begin to peer into the life of Teddy Daniels the investigator for the case. This added layers to what I thought would be a simple plot. Disturbing dreams and recollections paint Teddy's confused and strange past calling the viewer to question his sanity. As the film went on I became more tense and at many points terrified of what was coming next. I admit to watching through my fingers at various points but my sheer curiosity took over as I needed to know what happened next.As I have previously stated the performances given from the cast were amazing and truly convincing. I felt each character was very well cast and the intense nature of DiCaprio's character was perfectly portrayed. I especially liked the performance from Michelle Williams as Teddy's dead wife, Dolores. She is a haunting presence on screen and made me feel truly uncomfortable at points.Vivid and disturbing imagery made Shutter Island hard hitting and therefore, stayed with me for days afterwards. It was difficult to distinguish between what was real and what were hallucinations. This put me on edge and queued a stream of unanswered questions running through my head. Just as certain questions were answered more were sent running through my mind. This kept me interested through the duration.I don't wish to spoil the ending but all I can say is that it's a real curve ball. I still to this day am not sure what to think! The end left me craving more as if two hours wasn't enough.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Shutter Island. It evoked strong emotions and kept me on my toes. I would highly recommend this film to any mystery lover. I leave you to draw your own conclusions as to what the truth really is.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could use some editing,"This movie could have been cut by about 30 minutes, and to my mind would have given it better pace and more appeal.The movie took too long to get to the twist at the end - which I admit was pretty good. I did feel there was too much 'filler' in this movie to stretch it out.The acting performances were competent. My personal opinion is that DiCaprio gets terribly miscast at times (e.g. The Aviator), but does well in this role.For me, my attention waned at times but I stuck with it. Was it worth it? I guess so at 7/10!!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

This Movie is a Horrible Experience,"...made more so by Scorsese's mastery.It's as though Michaelangelo mustered all of his talents to paint the mangled bodies of dead children.Despite superb acting and direction, and a masterful score, the movie didn't actually work on me. I became removed by a faltering second act, a second dream sequence that detached the story from itself, and a disappointing degree of predictability.But as a parent, I'm glad I was de-immersed. It largely inoculated me from the dreadfulness that would follow.But the rest of the audience was, apparently, not so lucky. As I left the theater what I saw were psychologically traumatized people as a morose darkness had descended upon their Friday night.If your idea of a good evening out is to be severely psychologically disturbed, this is a movie for you. Dead ringer anyone? Which begs the question: Why? Why bother making this turd of a movie. Because you can? F you Mr Scorsese. The world's ugly enough without your vision.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"masterpiece thriller-drama hybrid with an incredible score, top tier acting, and cleverly told story","With the exception of the ""cave scene,"" which comprises maybe 10min, this is a flawless movie to me. That particular sequence just didn't seem necessary and how it was filmed across a flickering flame added to the headache. Aside from that, I have zero gripes. My adoration of the soundtrack means a lot, because usually in movies that have any element of horror tend to be overbearing and annoying, but this one was spot on, especially powerful during particularly dramatic sequences. And what a drama. It really accumulates at the end but throughout via dreams and hallucinations, Scorsese offers haunting beautiful - for lack of a better word - cinematography and effects, while DiCaprio delivers what I consider my second favorite performance of his career. Coincidentally my second favorite Leo movie, Inception, came out this same year. But he's not the only star; Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, and Max von Sydow were all incredible. As were smaller roles such as Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, and Ted Levine with an exceptional little monologue. The true icing on the cake is the storytelling and how it's delivered; the ending packs a memorable punch and despite its length, intricacy, and some hard to watch moments (namely the brilliantly filmed Holocaust ones), this flick deserves multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Gripping thriller,"The 2009 made but 2010 released Scorsese film Shutter Island was a very entertaining thriller in similar genre to his remake of Care Fear. This film is set up as a crime thriller with two marshalls (Leonardo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo) sent to an island that housing around 66 of the most dangerous criminally insane psychiatric patients. Their job is to investigate 1 missing female patient with the assistance (or not) of the hospital staff led by Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow. Suffice to say, things get much more complex with Leos character suffering from increasing migraines & some PTSD symptoms relating to the loss of his recently deceased wife (beautifully played by Michelle Williams) & his experience as a US soldier closing down a Nazi concentration camp. This is an absorbing complex film that is technically excellent as one would expect from Scorsese. The performances are really good although it is initially difficult to take Leo seriously. He looks like a little boy clothed form the dress up box. The plot twists are interesting & the music creates a foreboding sense of doom form the opening scene. There are some plot holes or areas left unexplained at the films end. It is lengthy at almost 2hrs 20 minutes but it is well paced.

"Thrilling, but predictable","I came into this movie expecting a horror type movie based on some of the commercials on television and the previews, but I was very mistaken. This movie was very much a psychological thriller. Leonardo DeCaprio fans will absolutely love this movie, as he is excellent in it. Mark Ruffolo is also very good in the movie, but by far, Ben Kingsley steals the show, I believe with his portrayal of a doctor for the insane. While I was at the edge of my seat for most of the movie, I did find that the end of the movie was very predictable. Many reviewers have stated that it was shocking, but for some reason I found it almost to easy to predict. Perhaps, it is due to viewing so many Martin Scorcese films in the past and preparing myself ahead of time for the unpredictable.

Actually worth the time and effort.,"Initially I had doubts about this movie because I have a thing against Leonardo DiCaprio. But I decided to get past my dislike and watched the movie anyway.And it was actually a great movie, especially the storyline and plot. It had lots of really cool twists and turns, and you were always left in the dark, with only sparks of chances of knowing what was actually going on. And that uncertainty really worked well for the movie. And I must say that I really liked the ending of the movie. Not your typically sappy Hollywood ending here.I must say that DiCaprio actually put on a great performance in this role, as much as I dislike his previous movies, his performance in ""Shutter Island"" was actually astounding. And of course, he was helped good on the way by Ben Kingsley, who also put on a magnificent performance.I haven't read the book, so I am not familiar with how true to the novel the movie actually is, but having read other reviews, it seemed that the movie is loyal to the book. But regardless, the result of this movie is a solid thriller with a really good story, and you are never given a bone as to where the story goes, and it is so unlike most other thrillers out there.There is something dark and foreboding about the entire setting of the movie - having a mental institute on an isolated island somewhere. And on top of that, the patients there are criminally insane. Just makes it all more interesting (and dangerous). And, for me, the setting was very believable and very well detailed. There was a certain unique style to this movie, and I loved the way it was shot - superb and interesting camera usage here.I surely was taken by surprise by this movie, and I recommend that you watch it if you haven't already seen it. Especially if you like thrillers that toy with the psyche and if you like movies that are totally unpredictable. I give it a 7 out of 10 rating because of the storyline and the setting, I didn't let my usual dislike of DiCaprio influence this rating in any way. So trust me, this movie is actually worth the time and effort.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You may go insane...,"Martin Scorsese is a director who I've always respected. All the films that I have seen of his are outstanding. Shutter Island proves why he's such a talented director.Back in 2010 when Shutter Island came out, it only got mildly positive reviews and didn't really win many awards which is something I don't understand. This movie is a gem that is equally interesting and intense.The cinematography in this movie is great. This is a movie which requires the full attention of the audience. When I saw this movie, especially on my second viewing, I noticed many clever hidden clues and details that were so purposeful to the main storyline. The music is really good. It forms this ominous notion that leaves a cold feeling in your stomach.Our main star, Leonardo DiCaprio, gave one of the finest peformances of his career. DiCaprio invoked a variety of emotions to his character which made us really care about him. Mark Ruffalo was also really good but I felt that if someone else would've done his role, they might've done a better job. Ben Kingsley gave a really good performance as well. Michelle Williams is such a good actress and she shows it here. The level of depth and emotion she brings out to her short but meaningful role is incredible. She is terrific here.Having seen the movie twice, my appreciation towards this film grew a lot. The writer, Laeda Kalogridis, did the source material justice. Her script brought so many twists and turns to the plot that I had completely no idea where the film was headed. I loved the sense of ambiguity given to the story and its characters as it made the ending of the film much more surprising. The screenplay along with Scorsese's direction made it feel larger than life. Scorsese used this script and his approach to directing it was marvellous. The atmosphere created throughout is consistent. There is a constant sense of intensity and suspense lurking within each shot. As the film progresses, it starts to get more insane and this feeling of insanity is what goes through your and Teddy Daniels' mind. This allows us to relate to Daniels and be with him on a personal level. There are many subtleties that are included in the framing of the shot which Scorsese purposely implemented. That's what makes Shutter Island a smart film.If you watch the movie once, you may notice a few editing errors. However, after seeing it again, you perceive those errors in a different perspective and realise that there is a reasoning for it. That's the beauty of Shutter Island. Each viewing gets better and better as you discover more and more. If you haven't seen this movie, I urge you now to go see it as soon as possible.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Movie,"In recent years, movies have been adding psychopaths or mentally unstable people into them. Shutter Island is yet another movie that revolves around that concept. Shutter Island though, is different from the rest. Shutter Island is a movie that will draw the attention of anyone who watches and it is quite possibly one of the best movies in the past ten years. It has everything needed for a great movie. The development of the characters in the movies makes it something special, something unlike any others movie. The actors are first class actors who fit their parts perfectly, and the plot is intriguing and twisted which always makes for a great film. One thing that makes Shutter Island such a great movie is the overall development and story behind the characters in the movie. This is especially true for the main character Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, a US marshal, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Teddy Daniels' story is one that continues to grow more and more intriguing throughout the movie. He is met in the opening scenes of the movie, and the viewers are given a slim glance into who he is. As the story continues to unfold, questions about Teddy and his past experiences continue to arise in flashbacks, forcing the viewer to continue watching, anxious to see what comes next. Though the main character, Teddy Daniels, is the most developed of all of the characters in the movie, the supporting characters add an eerie feel to the movie too. The patients in the hospital that are introduced throughout the movie are all, for the most part, strange, creepy characters, but the stories they tell are equally important, as they all begin to tie together and even give subtle hints to the ending of the movie.The characters in the movie, Shutter Island, make the movie the masterpiece it is. These characters would be nothing though, if not fueled by the right actors. The cast for the film was brilliantly put together. Robert Cargill stated, ""The acting here is incredible. DiCaprio and Ruffalo lead a tremendous cast."" And he's right; they did indeed lead a great cast. The actors do a great job throughout the movie of fulfilling each of their roles and bringing their character to life. Leonardo, especially, does a great job of portraying the role of a US marshal stricken by grief following the loss of his family, as well as an ex-soldier plagued with the images of World War II. The superb acting makes the characters that more believable to the viewer. Other actors such as Patricia Clarkson, who played the role of ""Rachel 2"" also, do a great job of adding to the movies story. Even while only holding brief minutes on screen, Patricia's character becomes crucial in the movie's plot when Teddy meets her. She gives Teddy information which in essence serves as the turning point for the whole movie!The plot of the film is most important in making it as great as it is though. ""From the opening shot, Scorsese creates an atmosphere of gloom and uncertainty that permeates the entire film."" says Jim Vejvoda. The first scene of the film is of Teddy Daniels and his partner riding to Shutter Island. The foggy mist rising up from the sea and the lack of sunshine peeking out through the clouds creates the eerie feel that continues throughout the rest of the movie. Teddy and his partner's reason for going to Shutter Island is made clear early in the movie. They are going in to help find a patient who escaped from a secured room just a few nights before. It turns out though, someone has alternative reasons for venturing to the island. Teddy is motivated by something deeper than just the missing patient. The man who killed Teddy's wife in an arson is supposedly a patient on Shutter Island, and Teddy wants to find him. Also, as the story progresses, an idea more sinister begins digging deep into Teddy's mind. He becomes increasingly weary of the Island's true intent and its operations. He believes that in the light house just on the edge of the island, doctors are performing Nazi like tests and he swears to expose and ""blow the top"" off of Shutter Island. These dark aspects of the plot make the movie that much more interesting and eventually leads to an unexpected, twisted ending.There are tons of movies out there that revolve around creepy things like psychiatric hospitals and crazy patients, but nothing compares in quality to Shutter Island. Shutter Island is a movie worth watching. It's more than just a movie about crazy people in a crazy hospital. Rather, it's a movie with depth, mystery and excitement. It's a movie that contains all of the prized pieces to making a hit movie. It has nicely developed characters, a set of A-list stars, like Leonardo DiCaprio, who bring life into each individual character, and a plot, which is one that is intriguing from beginning all the way to the unsuspected end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Started off hating it, ended up liking it!","Two cops visit a hospital for the criminally insane to investigate a disappearance.Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo.Written by Laeta Kalogridis ( Screenplay). Dennis Lehane (Novel).Directed by Martin Scorsese.This is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.At first I didn't like it at all. I couldn't stand the annoyingly loud background score and the artyfarty dream sequences. And right from the beginning I couldn't take to Mark Ruffalo's character, there was just something weird about him and his accent that I couldn't put my finger on.But as the movie goes on it builds up to an amazing and shocking climax. I didn't see it coming although I had a feeling something wasn't quite right! Looking back, this one is one hell of a cleverly constructed script and I'm guessing we have the original novel to thank for that. What started out as an annoying movie actually turned out to be really good and I want to watch it all over again to (without spoiling anything) see what references I missed.I still think it was a bit too artyfarty at times and that background music was too loud and annoying and there was something about the cinematography that I didn't quite like, but overall I think it actually worked.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Movie is excellent,"This is some kind of future movies.Movie which requires a good concentration because there are a lot of details that you have to see to understand a movie better. All that I can say is that movie is excellent.Very interesting theme with good actors and great plot.A movie can be a bit arduous but in the end you see that everything was planned excellent.I also have to say that Leonardo Di Caprio is very good actor for movies like is this.Lastly,I just want to recommend this movie for all who like ""serious"" and heavy movies in which you have to realize what the point of movie is and what did the director try to say.I also have opinion that this movie deserves a better position on the IMDb top 50 scale that it has now.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like mind blowing twists? Do not miss this one,"Shutter Island is a psychological thriller that keeps its audience riveted throughout its entire duration. It was made by one of my favorite directors, Martin Scorsese, known for Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Departed, The Irishman, etc. The movie takes place in 1954, on a remote island named Shutter, which has a very specific purpose. It's an asylum for the criminally insane. The main character in this movie is Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a U.S. Marshal, who is assigned to go to the island with his recently assigned partner, Chuck Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo), to investigate the disappearance of a murderer who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane. The atmosphere of the movie is pretty unique, dark and thrilling and the island itself does a great job of making you feel trapped, stuck and with no way out of it. This is definitely not a movie you play just so you can fall asleep easier. Its plot is pretty complex but not too confusing and I propose you watch it carefully because every little detail matters. The ending has a mind blowing twist and could probably leave you thinking for a while. My suggestion is to watch it more than once, it's a whole another experience and it's much easier to connect all the puzzle pieces. Perspective is really important in this movie. The audience is put in the shoes of Teddy, but watching it the second time, that might not be the case. It's a movie where you, and also the main character, are trying to stay sane while searching for answers. If all of this mentioned above is something that interests you and makes you curious, you might want to check this one out. I highly recommend that you do.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Alcatraz meets Hitler,"I wanted to give this a 10 but was forced to give it a seven. This was a good movie and I was expecting it to be more of a period piece as Marty's movie's usually are. However, aside from the hat that Leo wore there was not much to this, ya know? The movie subject is interesting. I was expecting this to be some kind of Ghost movie but it was more of Alcatraz meets Titanic. Robert DeNiro has a very brief cameo as one of the prisoners in the civil war wing. There is a fair amount of violence but it's mostly where you have these flashbacks about Hitler's Germany. All in all not bad. Good cinematography. If you are expecting to see Goodfellas I would suggest renting that movie or Casino. This movie is not quite what I was expecting but it was still good,",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
