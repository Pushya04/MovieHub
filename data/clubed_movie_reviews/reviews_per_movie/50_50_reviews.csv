this movie gets it,"As someone who was diagnosed with cancer two years ago (non-small cell lung cancer--and a nonsmoker to boot!) I've been through the gantlet, from 4 different kinds of chemo, several surgeries, and a wide variety of medical care from indifferent to deeply caring. So, trust me when I tell you, that this movie gets it.It gets what it is like to receive a horrific diagnosis out of the blue, the numbness and shock of dealing with it, the well meaning friends and acquaintances who say the stupidest things (""every time I feel sorry for myself, I just think of you...""), and those friends who really become your rock as you go through the miasma of treatment and try to still make your life have meaning. Again, this movie gets it.Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen deserve high praise for the honesty that they bring to their performances. There was not a false note anywhere. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. I plan to see it again when it is released in a month.This is a quiet film but it packs a great deal of power. I thought the humor was wonderfully placed, because without humor, life with cancer is unbearable. As too many folks know so well. Go see it and be entertained and learn a bit and rejoice in life even with cancer.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The perfect balance between drama and comedy, '50/50' depicts cancer the right way","Most movies don't know how to handle cancer. Heck, most people don't know how to handle cancer — and I'm not talking about the patients. Cancer, or any other terminal illness for that matter, almost always plays some kind x-factor in a film — that is when a film even dares to enter a realm often deemed depressing and ""not for the movies."" Most often, scripts will position cancer as a tearjerking emotional turning point in a film or as the initial spark of some banal ""live life to the fullest"" comedy.""50/50"" puts an end to that. Written semi-autobiographically by cancer survivor Will Reiser, it would seem it takes one to write one. Although cancer drives the entire story, the story doesn't fixate on cancer or melodramatize the terrible truths we already know about potentially fatal illness. Perhaps you could tell as much from the trailer thanks to some typical Seth Rogen antics, but the injection of contemporary R-rated humor is neither irreverent, insensitive nor an attempt to simply put a positive spin on a depressing subject. Life — believe it or not — doesn't stop for cancer. People don't sit in the hospital the entire time and then lie at home in bed the rest. Reiser's story provides a mostly unforced and honest depiction of a young man's diagnosis and treatment for potentially fatal spinal cancer, one where cancer isn't the conflict in and of itself, but the way it so dramatically changes the behavior of the people whose lives it enters and positively and negatively alters relationships.Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his spree of playing absolutely lovable main characters as Adam, a play-it-safe 27-year-old who after the initial shock handles his diagnosis in stride, keeping his ups and downs internal other than when the script cues him to let it out a bit. The more external symptoms come from Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and mother (Anjelica Huston).Other than focusing on these relationships, director Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness"") puts particular emphasis on character perspective, which will change instantaneously at points throughout the film. In one terrific sequence, Adam enters the hospital for his first chemo treatment and gets bummed out by all the sick and ailing people in the hallway. After the older men he meets while getting treatment (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) give him some marijuana-filled pastries, he leaves down the same hallway high as a kite, suddenly elated despite the same negative images lining the hall. Levine understands that so much of how you deal with cancer relates to mood and perspective at any given time.Levine coaxes brilliant and thoughtful performances out of his actors. Even though Rogen exerted his usual shtick a bit more than needed, he handles his character as written, someone who wants desperately to help his best friend but hides behind shallow self-centered form of support that many men turn to because they can't communicate emotions all that well.The women of ""50/50"" also deliver if not more so. Howard's character is an unlikable mess but she gives her performance convincingly. Anjelica Huston perfects the ideal on-screen mother, the best since Melissa Leo's Oscar-winning mother in ""The Fighter."" Anna Kendrick also continues to blow me away with her talent. She plays a psychiatrist working on her PhD who receives Adam as just her third patient. She gives such lifelike quirks to her characters and Katie plays right to her strengths.But in a drama/comedy about cancer, the key lies in tone and for that Levine should become an A-list director. ""50/50"" could have easily turned into a Hollywood hack-job like the various comic-toned cancer films before it, a film that either overplays the dramatic or overcompensates with the humorous, but ""50/50"" might be one of film's best balancing acts between the two. The shifts feel completely natural between moments of deep sentiment and moments of levity. Those who can't help but fixate on this being a movie about cancer will likely have to remind themselves to feel serious when ""50/50"" just wants you to simply absorb it as you would any other film.Other than some predictable moments and plot devices to give the film a nicer Hollywood sheen, ""50/50"" provides a genuine and heartfelt movie experience, one that neither goes for the emotional sucker punch nor the sugarcoated version. Instead of making us look at cancer in a specific way, it makes us look at the way we look at cancer — or any uncomfortable subject — the way we talk about it or don't talk about it, the way we interact with those who live with it and the way we cope with it ourselves. That way when someone we love has a serious problem, we can ultimately do what's best for that person.~Steven CVisit my site, moviemusereviews.com!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Tears, Laughs, Life Lessons","Greetings again from the darkness. The great Richard Pryor had a portion of his act dedicated to having a heart attack, based on his real life experience. I guess if he can generate laughter from a coronary, there is no reason writer Will Reiser and director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) can't view Cancer as Comedy. There is little doubt that the subject matter of this film will limit its audience, but for those brave souls who give it a shot, I believe you will find it funny, touching and insightful.The film introduces us to Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is a very nice, very normal, very low-key guy who works at a radio station as a writer ... a very conscientious radio writer. Adam experiences a nagging pain in his back, which is unusual for a healthy 27 year old. After a few tests, the emotionless doctor informs him that he has a rare spinal cancer ... also very unusual for a healthy 27 year old. From this point forward, the film borders on brilliance at times.Adam's girlfriend is played by Bryce Dallas Howard; his mother by Angelica Huston; and his best friend by Seth Rogen. Each reacts in different ways to Adam's diagnosis, but what's really interesting is not just how these people react, but also how Adam reacts. He moves forward in his meticulous manner, but all the while we know the emotions are brewing. We see this in his sessions with his therapist-in-training played by Anna Kendrick.Seth Rogen's character is basically a carbon copy of his act in 40 Year Old Virgin. He spews profane one-liners faster than our ears can process. Despite the aggressive front, Rogen's character is a friend with a heart ... and one who doesn't hesitate to share his medicinal marijuana.So while Rogen's character generates much of the laughter, the real treasure of this film is in the subtleties of each character in certain moments ... and each character has their moment. Many will compare this to Adam Sandler's film Funny People, which also starred Seth Rogen. But this movie has infinitely more depth and substance than that one offered.My warning: brace yourself. My theatre was filled with tears and sniffles, with significant laugh out loud moments mixed in. This is an emotional, self-reflective film that will confound you as you inexplicably laugh while listening to cancer talk.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's a balancing act.,"How does a filmmaker combine humor and drama in a story about a 27 year old man diagnosed with cancer? Easy: Just give them equal measure with the title 50/50 -- light treatment of a dark subject.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to deal not only with his own emotions when he is diagnosed, but also those of a close friend, Kyle (Seth Rogen), an inveterate partier and ribald quipper, and his chronically worrisome mother (Anjelica Huston). Losing his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) along the way adds to the potential downbeat.Yet director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser keep it all as upbeat as possible, not in small part due to Rogen's constantly funny chatter, which comes at just the right times as the plot gets heavy with cancer surviving techniques (the film turns out to show the way to battle: with humor).Of course, Rogen has had training playing a similar role in Funny People with Adam Sandler. No one plays a weed-smoking buddy better than he. Gordon-Levitt is also an actor who can just about better than anyone else play the soulful, endearing, slow-moving romantic as he did in (500) Days. As a cancer victim, he engages the audience in observation of a vulnerable hero, who fights with a serenity and equanimity that could be a model for those wishing to survive and those who wish to help.50/50 is a comedy with compassion, a distant cousin to the prevalent bromances that rarely treat the support men give each other in times of real danger. Usually it's vacuous women who supply that danger and significant support. Hooray for the men this time.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Film,"Just saw this at an Advanced Screening 2 hours ago in Huntington BeachThis film doesn't have a title nailed down yet. It used to be called I'm with Cancer but IMDb has it listed as Live With It. The title we were shown in the film and the title that was on the invite was Get Well Soon. They asked us our opinion of the titles (Also include was the title Bright Side) but no one really liked any of the titles. So for the sake of confusion I'll call it Get Well Soon.Get Well Soon is the very believable story of Adam, a 27 year old nice guy who waits at cross walks at 5:30 in the morning when nobody is on the road and other joggers have already trotted past. Adam writes stories for radio programs and seems to genuinely care about the stories and the people who are listening to them. After persistent back pain, Adam goes to the doctor and is diagnosed with Cancer. He is assigned Katherine, a doctorate student who is getting experience for her dissertation, to talk to about his new problems.This film will immediately draw comparisons to 2009's Funny People which unfortunately can't be ignored. But fortunately, aside from the fact the main character is diagnosed with a terminal illness, this is a completely different film. Where Funny People had a lack of connection with its main character, due to Adam Sandler being a prick to everyone and being rich on top of that, Get Well Soon's Joseph Gordon Levitt is the everyman that everyone can relate to. He does a fantastic job expressing the feelings of calm fortitude as well as isolation. You can see it in his face. It's the little things that make a film feel authentic. Levitt's performance is heart breaking and uplifting at the same time. He maintains a steady calm for most of the film that just feels real. You know this is a dark comedy when there is a Patrick Swayze joke in the first 20 minutes of the movie. I'm not sure if that one's gonna stay in the final cut though lol. This film is very funny throughout. All of the people in the after film focus group said it maintained a perfect balance of comedy and dramatics. I saw Love and Other Drugs and liked it but this film is much more streamlined and has no extraneous scenes.Seth Rogen is absolutely hilarious. I'll be the first to get my opinion out that Rogen is great in everything he's in but he really killed it again. Weed smoking is given a fantastic treatment by this film, like director Jonathon Levine's previous work the very amusing The Wackness. There are two scenes that are a creative and effective way to show the effects of marijuana. I love the way they shot a conversation between Adam, Rogen and two of Adam's older cancer friends. Anna Kendrick plays a similar role to the one she played in Up in the Air. She does a great job in this too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Angelica Huston is his over bearing mother.I rated this film an ""Excellent"" which is the highest possible rating and which 18 of the 30 people who stayed after agreed with. 11 said ""Very Good"" and 1 said ""Good."" I really enjoyed the film. It didn't really do anything wrong. It might have a bit too much profanity for the older crowd but its central story is so appealing. On that note actually, there were several people who said they would not have come to the screening if they knew full well that it was about cancer. I feel that is so extremely narrow minded that no one should even admit that to a group of people. Please if you are on the fence and ""don't want to go to a depressing movie"" get over it and see a fantastic, hilarious film in Get Well Soon.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious and touching at the same time,"Mixing cancer and comedy doesn't seem like it should go so well, but 50/50 is a film that makes it work. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Adam, a 27 year old easy going guy who unexpectedly gets diagnosed with cancer. The film details his struggle to beat the disease and all the hardships that come along with having to fight a disease as crippling as cancer at such a young age. Adam is surrounded by various other people in his life that all influence him in different ways. Seth Rogen plays his best friend, Kyle, who always tries to help Adam out, but doesn't always know how to go about it. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist, Katherine, whose attempts to help Adam cope with the cancer work at times, but at other times she just can't find the right way to connect with the grieving youngster. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Adam's girlfriend and Anjelica Houston is one of the strongest characters, Adam's overprotective mother. The film is a compassionate tale of love and friendship while simultaneously being a raunchy pothead comedy. The overlap is strange, but it works incredibly well.There are so many ways to do a comedy film about cancer wrong, but very few ways to do it right. 50/50 thankfully manages to find the sweetspot of this risky terrain and succeeds in being a charmingly touching film as well as a wildly hilarious one. The writer of the film, Will Reiser, based the film on his own experiences with fighting and beating cancer at a young age, and his passion and understanding of this story shine beautifully through the film and its characters which surely all resemble Reiser's own friends and family in some way. 50/50 doesn't lean too far to either side of the comedy versus drama spectrum and it always maintains a consistent level of heartwarming hilarity balanced with touching sincerity. The drama and comedy weave in and out of each other perfectly and seamlessly with neither genre feeling inappropriate or out of place. It is sincere filmmaking at its finest.Moreover, 50/50 just does a great job with its balance of genres, but also with the overall story and the great characters within that story. We grow such passionate empathy for Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a way I never thought could be possible. The film draws us into his troubled world so well and we are rooting for him all the way, cheering on his every move and growing more and more attached to him with every passing moment. We also grow to love the supporting cast who, with the exception of one particular character but I won't spoil anything, support Adam through all his hard times. The characters are all so well written and they play their key roles in Adam's life perfectly. 50/50 is a movie structured to where every character serves a major purpose in furthering Adam's development as well as the development of the plot. And so as we watch the relationships between Adam and the people in his life grow and fade we develop a deeper understanding of his character, making 50/50 an incredibly human story.It's always nice to be so surprised by a film's quality. I expected good things from 50/50 from the first time I saw a trailer, but the movie itself exceeded my expectations. It is what the dramady subgenre is all about. It is a film tailor made to be the subgenre's posterchild. I laughed, I lamented, and I was brought close to tears at how heartwarming and touching of a film 50/50 is.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It is a nice film,"50/50 ; the novel of a man who infected with cancer, he doesn't use car since being dangerous and risk of death. Leadind actor Adam, even when he crosses the street, he waits the green light is on. He has unhappy relationship is about to finish. Joseph Gordon Levitt acts Adam's role. And the event named the film : The Adam 's chance of getting over %50. From the moment he learns the disease, he passes four period as emotional. Gangrene relationship, illness father, paranoid mother, close friend and therapist accompany him in these periods. First period is negligence : everything is OK. Director shows us people can be selfish with the behavior of mother and deceptive girlfriend. When he know that his girlfriend is cheating, he pass second period : anger. Of course, we can see it in therapy séance. In this period, side effects of chemotherapy is seen. During the chemotherapy, he meets a friend and his friend dies. With this death, he passes the third period : emotional upset. He learns that therapy doesn't answer the purpose, he should get surgery. This event affects him, too. I think his nervous breakdown in car, in terms of acting, is successful. Due to nervous breakdown, he passes the last period : acceptance. These events develops very fast.

Considering it as one of my fav movies,"50/50 has pretty much everything an amazing movie like this can offer. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you'll come out of the theater very satisfied. I cried for about a whole straight 20 minutes in total and laughed or glued my eyes to the screen the rest of the time. This movie will make you not only appreciate all the work went into it, but it will make you appreciate life itself. It is so brutally realistic. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Seth Rogen are a great duo and the supporting cast does a great job as well. This movie was made with respect for its viewers. It takes something so serious and so taboo to laugh at and makes it a comedy and a drama. It exceeds in both genres. If I am correct, this movie is somewhat based on the Screenwriter's life who also went through something very similar and most of the events in the film are based on things he had to go through as he also got cancer in his 20s.Go see 50/50! You will not regret it at all! I am considering it for one of my favorite movies, but I think that is just a bit too soon as I need to have multiple viewings to judge if a movie is one of my favorites. I can guarantee one thing. 50/50 is an instant classic!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Proves why JGL NEVER broke out as leading man,"Nicely done overall. Great blend of pathos and humor without becoming maudlin. Bit disappointed by JGL. Either his character is a tad underwritten and/or he just doesn't possess that extra leading-guy spark needed to get the film to the finish line. He's absolutely captivating in the scenes with Anna Kendrick., though. Certainly enough to make this worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Certain to capture a slew of Oscar Nominations,"I thought this was a better film than ""The King's Speech"" or ""Social Network"" my two favorite films of last year. Nothing this year has come close so far to the sheer brilliance of 50/50. It is the best ""disease of the week"" film ever made, which sounds like a backhanded compliment but I don't know how to describe the genre any better.I have always felt that Gordon-Levitt along with Gosling are far and away the two best young actors working today. I thought that Gordon-Levitt deserved an Oscar nomination for ""The Lookout"" but knew that was never going to happen. This is his time. His performance as a young man battling cancer is pitch perfect. You will laugh and cry along with him throughout his difficult journey. His best scenes are with his therapist played by Anna Kendrick. She was good in the overrated ""Up in the Air""; she is great in this film, playing another neophyte in a high powered career. She will be nominated as well, no doubt.Seth Rogan has the role of his career thanks in part to Will Reiser, the screenwriter, who was able to take the whole sexist, slacker, pothead thing that Rogan does and add a dimension of humanity. I think both of them also deserve Oscar nominations. Because of the nature of his role I would be surprised if Rogan gets one, but not too surprised. He is just hilarious and at times very touching.Finally we come to Jonathan Levine, a director that I had never heard of prior to this film. He is fantastic with actors here and has a great style. I say he is a shoo in come Oscar time.Now this review has really centered around Oscar and that is for a reason. It will not be released for awhile and I was lucky to see a preview screening in Denver last night. I could think of no other way to get the point across more clearly that this is a brilliant film that you must run to when it is released.One more thing. I made the mistake of taking my 13 year old daughter thinking the R rating was more about the pot and the language, and that the message of the film would overcome those issues. I kind of regret it. I really don't mind her having seen the film in an overall context because the message is terrific, but man was it raunchy and uncomfortable to sit through with her.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Living with cancer.,"When it comes to high-emotion situations in real life, few are more extreme than a diagnosis of cancer. Add in the fact that when Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Adam Lerner is only 27 years old when he gets the news and you already have a story primed for melodrama and loaded with tears and cheers. First-time writer Will Reiser uses his own experience with cancer at a young age to play down the dramatic aspects of illness, and instead showcase the lighter side of things, showing that even when you have cancer you still want to get laid and stoned with your best friend. It's not a strict comedy by any means, there are quite a few moments that got me a little choked up, but Reiser clearly set out with a goal to show things a little lighter than cancer is usually treated in the film. For the most part this works and, although at times I felt it was a little too light, I enjoyed Reiser's more authentic portrayal of a diagnosis like this.The film sets out to be an unconventional cancer movie, and it achieves at that but it's still so much a cancer movie that there isn't any room for anything else. Yes, getting a severe diagnosis like this still leaves room in your life for comedic moments, but it also doesn't control every second of your life. It felt like every frame of this movie was about cancer, and there wasn't any room for just...life. When Adam's best friend is a jerk it's about cancer, when his mom is too worried it's about cancer, when his girlfriend does something awful it's about cancer. Adam learns his diagnosis early on in the film and we're not given enough time to understand the character before this, so the whole thing ends up revolving around the cancer. The whole thing would have benefited so much by getting us to have a stake in him before he gets the news, but instead Reiser builds the entire movie around cancer; which it should be, but not to this extreme.Reiser focuses everything on the cancer, and as a result there's a lot of stuff that gets left behind, namely the supporting characters. In approaching Adam, they take on the guy full force, helped by a great performance from Gordon-Levitt. I was a huge fan of Gordon-Levitt in the mid-2000s when he had this incredible streak of solid performances, but then he kind of faded for me and I was worried that I wasn't going to be impressed by him again. Thankfully I found this to be a return to form for him, taking on a character who shuts himself off and meets people's desire to help with aggression but quickly making him likable and easy to root for. As I said earlier, I wish we had met Adam earlier so I could have had more of a stake in him, but Levitt makes up for it with a very sympathetic performance that taps into the root of what it's like to have something like this take you over so young.It's when we get to the rest of the characters that I think Reiser slips up. For the most part, all of the supporting characters are so thin that it's hard to really appreciate any of them as real people. Reiser works so hard on making the cancer aspect feel more genuine and unique that he doesn't spend enough time with the characters to make them feel as such. They all just feel like these movie types we've already seen instead of real people, the most offensive of which being Adam's therapist played by Anna Kendrick. Buying Kendrick as a therapist is hard enough to get over, but the way that they treat this relationship is honestly one of the most offensive and ridiculous things I've seen all year. From the second they meet it's such a Hollywood display of incorrect cutesiness in a film that, for the most part, was dealing with things in a pretty realistic way that it was honestly jaw-dropping to this absurd relationship develop. Kendrick and Levitt try their best to make up for it, they do have a very sweet chemistry between them, but for me there was no getting around how absolutely ridiculous this whole relationship was. It dragged the film down a lot for me.For a while the title of the film was going to be Living With Cancer, and I feel like that would have been a more accurate name for it. Reiser should be admired for his approach to dealing with cancer, especially at such a young age, but I wish he had spent a lot more time on the actual living side of things. There are a lot of genuine emotions going on here and I appreciate Reiser and director Jonathan Levine not going the easy route with melodrama and emotional manipulation that you find in most stories dealing with this topic, but the film has quite a few contrivances that betray the characters in order to benefit story progression and the therapist relationship is something that left a bad taste in my mouth all the way through. There's still a lot to be admired though, so at the end I've come down pretty much in the middle when it comes to the overall product.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Outstanding Film, Even Better Performances","Adam (Gordon-Levitt) is a rule-following, mild-mannered twentysomething who lives in Seattle with his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas-Howard), and works at Seattle Public Radio. His life takes a sudden and dramatic turn when he is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that has taken over his spine. A laidback kind of guy, Adam handles each hurdle with surprising ease and levity while engaging in somewhat helpful counseling from Katie (Anna Kendrick), a young psychologist the hospital assigns him. Before long, though, his complex relationships with Rachael, his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), and his needy mother (Angelica Huston) become even more convoluted with the introduction of chemotherapy and medicinal marijuana into his life. As the severity of his condition increases, Adam begins to reassess his life, his relationships, and the nonplussed façade he uses to get himself through.The inevitable comparisons between ""50/50"" and 2009's ""Funny People"" are unfortunate. While I stuck up for ""Funny People"" more than most of my colleagues, even I will admit it is an incredibly flawed film that misses the mark on many levels. ""50/50"", then, plays out a bit like what ""Funny People"" should have been, right down to the performance of Seth Rogen. It is, first and foremost, a very funny movie and that is where ""Funny People"" first went awry. You can't make a comedy about cancer, or any other serious illness for that matter, and fail to produce a genuinely funny script. Laughs come often and organically. I also quite liked that writer Will Reiser (who based his script on the events of his own battle with cancer) makes it clear early on that he intends to laugh at cancer and if you're not up for that, you're in the wrong theater. That is not to say that the disease itself or the havoc it wreaks on Adam's life is disrespected or ignored; in fact, ""50/50"" gives a fairly realistic view of the hell that is aggressive cancer and the sometimes even more aggressive treatment. ""50/50"" is bold but soft, a combination that works well.The dialogue between the characters in ""50/50"" flows with tremendous ease, especially in the scenes involving Adam and Kyle. This dynamic between JGL and Rogen is the meat of the film and the two play it out brilliantly. They have a chemistry that Anne Hathaway only wishes she could develop withwell, anyone. (That was an unnecessary shot at Miss Hathaway. My apologies.) They reminded me of the type of friendship I might have with any one of my closer pals if we cursed more and occasionally smoked pot. Adam's other relationships are a bit awkward but whether this was done on purpose or not, it serves the narrative well. In my mind he would have a tense partnership with Rachael because they're clearly not suited for each other and any furtherance of his friendship with Katie beyond doctor-patient would be a bit odd.All of the supporting actors hold their own. As spot-on as I might have been with JGL all those years ago, I would have never guessed, after reluctantly watching ""Twilight"", that Kendrick would be an actress whose performances I truly look forward to. This isn't quite to the level of her work in ""Up in the Air"" but it is good and believable nonetheless. Huston's character seems a bit over-the-top in the early going but the depth of her character comes to light in the late stages and Huston pulls it together splendidly. And Rogen gives what might be his best performance to date. To be fair, I'm not much of a Rogen fan so I'm far from an expert on his value as an actor. But whereas he was completely outclassed in ""Funny People"" and pretty much plays the same character in almost every film, he shows a little more strength in ""50/50"" than he ever has before (with the possible exception of ""Knocked Up""). I actually liked him and I haven't felt that way toward him very often.But of course, the weight of ""50/50"" rests almost entirely on the shoulders of JGL and he holds up to the challenge. One of the best compliments I can give an actor is to say that he and his character become one and the same. That's what JGL does here and that's why ""50/50"" succeeds. He envelopes himself into the Adam character and makes his portrayal incredibly believable. It is almost like watching a documentary on a young cancer patient. Adam handles his disease with class and dignity but not without emotion. His outbursts are few but powerful and through them JGL sells the story beautifully. Simply put, this guy is a star and ""50/50"" serves as the announcement of such to those of you who didn't already know this to be fact.""50/50"" is honest and at times tough to watch but never purposefully harsh or depressing. In fact, it is generally positive but in a way that isn't all sunshine and unicorns. It is smart, hilarious, and even touching while all the time remaining respectful of the audience's ability to relate to difficult circumstances without artificial emotional fishing. It is an excellent film marked by one outstanding performance that deserves the attention received come Award Season.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Comedic, inspiring, dramatic, tearful, and effervescent","After playing a bad boy rocker with a full head of hair, Joseph Gordon-Levitt now plays a nervous Cancer-patient with no hair at all. 50/50 is loosely based on the story of Will Reiser, who wrote this film, and is telling us his story and struggle through the character Adam.Adam is played by Levitt, a marvelous actor who is continuing his string of quirky, yet well made independent films where he plays an off-the-wall protagonist. Adam is twenty-seven and works for a Seattle radio company. He is informed that he has a rare form of Cancer called Neurofibrosarcoma, and is told he only has a 50% chance of living with it. Frustrated, but moving day by day in a seemingly calm manner with his buddy Kyle (Rogen), Adam continues his long journey only to be bothered by his annoying, self-centered girlfriend (Howard) frequently. Through thick and thin, Adam starts to cope with his disease and manages to stay calm for most of the picture.We all have to die at one point. It's part of the life. But I can't imagine the sadness and calamity brought upon someone who finds out they have a rare form of Cancer and that their chances of living are fifty-fifty. At twenty-seven nonetheless. My mother, who has work in a Chemotherapy unit for about a decade, said that the youngest she has even seen someone die from Cancer is two and a half years old. Some people, hardly get to experience life at firsthand because of Cancer.There are so many forms of Cancer, rare and common, harmless and not, that your chances of getting it are very high. Getting it is at random, but coping with it is even harder. While 50/50 has a heartbreaking, and is sometimes emotion-testing and tear-jerking, it still has a strong comedic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, who is rather unfairly bashed in a majority of his films.The acting is superb by both leads, the parents of Adam played by Angelica Houston and Serge Houde are portrayed effectively and in a loving way, and the screenplay and Johnathan Levine's direction never fails or works against this film in any way. Three years prior he was creating good chemistry between Ben Kingsley and Josh Peck in The Wackness. Now, he's finally mastered in creating two characters that do nothing but sparkle when on screen together. You can't really call this a Seth Rogen film because while his comedy is here, his underlying sweetness shows through the cloth of this film more than it has ever done before. The last time he gave a performance this well done was in Sandler's Funny People.Thanks to a wonderful third act in terms of direction and screenplay, you get an all out emotional breakdown from the characters and yourself. 50/50 has a way with making emotional moments not seemed contrived, but welcomed. I think out of everyone in the theater, my mom was more emotional than the average person in the general public which is understandable.Many films have come out this year, and many have been ignored. Comedies and dramas alike have been swept under the bus with other blockbusters in theaters at the same time. I plan on doing a list of the top ignored and underrated films of 2011. I hope 50/50 doesn't make that list.Starring: Joesph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Bryce Dallas-Howard, Angelica Houston, and Serge Houde. Directed by: Johnathan Levine.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Seth Rogen on a drama,"How many drama movies about cancer treatment, with suffering performances and a true story of overcoming have been made and even became tiresome way? Well, the young director Jonathan Levine and Will Reiser (screenplay) found a formidable new vision of it all.The film tells the story of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man of twenty-seven years working for a radio company in Seattle. He is informed that he has a rare form of cancer called ""Neurofibrosarcoma"", and is told he only has a 50% chance to live with him. Frustrated, but moving day to day with a seemingly calm, with the help of his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), Adam continues his long journey of recovery. Only to be bothered by his irritating, selfish girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). But with the help of the, half embarrassed but very helpful, psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Adam then proceeds to deal with their illness and can remain calm during most part of the film.There are so many forms of cancer, rare and common, harmless and that their chances of getting it are very high. Start is random, but dealing with it is even more difficult. While ""50/50"" is a moving, and sometimes it is emotion-test and tearful, he still has a strong comic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, and several occasions that Adam and Kyle meddle.The film is a drama, that works as a comedy very well written. Some may find this a defect, but rather a quality. Adam throughout the film faces its situation near death in a lively manner. It's as if the film were telling us, ""if it is your last minutes, let then be smiling!"".The cast is terrific, even comic, Seth manages to have an interesting dramatic performance; Anna Kendrick formidable as ever; Angelica Houston and Serge Houde as Adam's parents with great performances; but who shines above everyone is Joseph Levitt with a fantastic performance, proving to be an very promising actor.Thanks to a wonderful third act, in terms of direction and screenplay that never fail or work against the film at any time, the public has an emotional breakdown all of the characters and the story itself and fantastic to witness.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"WoW!!! I expected this to be good,, but not this good,,,","I remember seeing the trailer for this when it came out,,, planned on seeing it, but got busy I guess. Well,, now this movie takes on a WHOLE new meaning that it wouldn't have then. I lost my thyroid to cancer 6 yrs ago,, and while that has a much, much higher survival rate than what this character in the movie has,, still,, it's life altering cancer.Now,, all of that being said, this is an excellent movie! Levitt never ceases to impress me. Who'd have thought that kid from Angels in the Outfield would be giving performances like this (although,, he was pretty good as a kid). Rogen was his usual self,, but he brought the right amount of comedy. Kendrick,,, oh how i love thee ❤!! Especially when you play characters like this. Howard did a good job of playing the kind of woman I'm trying to avoid! Lol,, no really,, she's always great. Anjelica Huston rounds out the main cast as Levitt's worrying mother.Seriously,, this was really good. Go watch it!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
it's a meaningful  film that indicates an ill person and the changing role of girlfriend except for his best friend and family.,"Fifty fifty It's a great film. When I watched this unique film, affairs affected me. My thoughts changed. Ilness, friends, family are a big part of our life perhaps; all our life. There are always risks for people, always vagueness. In this film a man becomes cancer and has hard times. He has a girl friend. She supports and tries to give hope him in early times. However she deceives him one day. He also has a friend who is very funny. The friend always supports him. His mother is very anxious about him and his illness. She cares with him closely and calls everyday his son. The boy has an operation and get over from cancer. Friends and family is vital. So we must always be aware of this essential point. In conclusion, it is very important to support ill person in case of an illness. Don't forget! Real friends appear in our hard times.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Joseph Gordon-Levitt has really come into his own....,"Considering that I am a guy who went through cancer treatment when I was 26, this film naturally hit close to home. On top of that, I could see a lot in the film that worked--stuff that really connect with what it's like to go through this hell (such as the horribly detached way the doctor broke the news to the guy about his illness). It sure helped that the writer, Will Reiser, had gone through this himself.Joseph Gordon-Levitt did not even register in most folks' minds until recently. He was just THAT kid from ""3rd Rock""--a rather inconsequential series at that. However, recently he's blown a lot of people away given his breakout performances in ""Inception"". He's shown here in ""50/50"" that he can do well now as a star. This is quite a jump from his TV days as a scrawny kid.The film, as many people know, is about a guy who finds out he has cancer. The film is not the deepest thing--just one guy's experiences with the disease as well as the experiences of those around him. In some cases, people really come through for them and in others, folks show their inadequacy--just as in real life--and just like what happened when I was ill. I liked this and I also liked how the character was NOT noble--he was just a guy. Well worth seeing, that's for sure.Now I do have a few minor reservations in this excellent film. First, while I liked Rogan quite a bit (such as his using his friend's cancer to help him score with women as well as the way he reacted to THE breakup), he is VERY crude. Funny, yes....but VERY crude. Parents might want to think about this Secondly, the psychotherapist character (Anna Kendrick) is possibly the worst therapist in movie history. She apparently has no boundaries, no training and is a sweet idiot. Hopefully folks WON'T think that any of her behaviors are acceptable!! And, I cannot imagine ANY college allowing anyone that dippy to go near patients!! I used to be a psychotherapist many years ago--and I actually trained young counselors to do therapy. Even the dumbest and most inept grad student I ever met was light-years better than this goof-ball! Enjoyable but 100% unrealistic and the character should have been rewritten a bit to at least make her a bit more believable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a surprise of a movie...,"Alright, I was thinking this to be a comedy, as it was labeled as comedy here on IMDb, but it was more of a drama, though with some sporadic comedy here and there.The story in ""50/50"" was actually quite captivating, and you really got into the story and the characters because it was all just so very believable. The story is about Adam who is diagnosed with a rare cancer and then comes to see life from a new perspective, and learns about what is important in life. What makes this story so good is that it is something that could (and did) happen in real life.""50/50"" is carried a long way with the impressive acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (playing Adam). He was phenomenal in this role. I am not much of a fan of Seth Rogen (playing Kyle), but he did a good job in this movie as well.Don't expect to be laughing hard throughout this movie, because the comedy in here is subtle and not really of the kind meant to make you laugh. The comedy is, however, used at just the right moments and it helps boost the story along. Also, there are some touching moments in the story as well, so for the more sensitive spirits, you might want to have a box of tissues at hand, just in case.""50/50"" surprised me, especially because it wasn't just another comedy, as I had expected because of Seth Rogen. The story surprised me and it swept me up and carried me along, and I was genuinely impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance in this movie.I strongly recommend that you watch ""50/50"" if you haven't already seen it. It is really one of those life-enriching stories that brightens up your day and makes you feel good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lame,"I looked forward to 50/50. I enjoy JGL's acting and thought I'd get a kick out of seeing him play a young guy who learns he has a very serious form of cancer that might take his life. One reviewer suggested that the film would remind you how every day is a gift. Being unemployed with bills, I needed that kind of reminder.I'm still depressed. I didn't think this movie was funny, insightful, touching, or distinctive. A young guy finds out he might die from cancer, his shallow girlfriend can't hang, but his buddy does and keeps his outlook positive by encouraging him to use his cancer to get laid. In most films, I can get lost in the story and film as a whole world. In 50/50, however, I always got the sense that these were actors running scenes and they were all strung together to voila! Make a movie. The relationships between characters were for the most part cliché--the annoying mother, the shallow girlfriend, the inhuman doctor, the loyal buddy. And, if I were facing death, I would probably request an experienced doctor and not allow to be a guinea pig for a 24-year-old trainee.But I gave this film 6 out of 10 because the last 20 minutes were indeed quite heartfelt. If I were you, I'd wait until this comes to red box near you.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good balance of humor and drama,"50/50 walks a fine line in being comedy about a man in his 20s getting cancer, but it manages to find the sweet spot in finding genuine laughs amidst such a depressing story. Gordon-Levitt is terrific and Rogen and Kendrick work well in their supporting roles. It doesn't surprise you too much, but it is very effective in its telling of an inspiring and worthwhile story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, not great","This is my first review ever so I'm still looking for the right way to do this. You can read the plot here so I'm going straight to the good and the bad.I'm going to keep it simple. The good is, that there is almost a perfect balance between the drama of a young man being diagnosed with cancer and comic relief. That is, the first and last half hour of the film nail it perfectly. In the middle however there is to much comedy and profanity. I'm 24, it has nothing to do with my age, it just didn't fit in this film. The problem here is Seth Rogen. I'm a fan. I like all his movies and jokes. But he's supposed to be Joseph Gordon-Levitt's friend and all he does is try to get laid. Besides that, he doesn't show any human emotion what so ever, in the whole film. Seth Rogen could really prove to the world that he was a good drama actor, but he blew it. Then a couple of comments. Gordon-Levitt's performance is perfect. The perfect amount of (outside) putting everything in perspective and the pain you can see on his face. The story is well told but it should of focused a little more on the drama. Less on getting laid and more on the relationship with his girlfriend. This is a problem mainly in the middle 30 minutes of the film.I give it a 7/10, I believe that without Seth Rogen, and more focus on the main character's problems, it was easily a 9 or 10 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Note that I've had cancer myself,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance in this movie is spot-on. The emotions, thoughts, and feelings portrayed in this movie are spot on.I'll say this: having had cancer, everything in this movie is very relatable. I'm sure those of you who have also had cancer can agree with me. For the rest of you, I can't say much more than that for me it's relatable: which in my opinion is one of the main dimensions of great movies. Can the viewer relate to the story? From the other reviews it appears the movie does a pretty good job of getting a typical viewer hooked via that hook.As for the writing of movie, it's not GREAT (but it's good), and often fairly predictable, but not in a cliche way. It's still good writing, and even when what you expected comes true, it's still satisfying, and I would think that you wouldn't feel as though you had wasted your time.Now my sales pitch: I wish for you to watch this movie, because its moral is one that cannot be overstated. I won't repeat it here. You'll just have to watch the movie. It's also a great look in on for the most part what it's really like to be diagnosed with cancer.I hope y'all give the movie a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Funny cancer movie,"Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Kyle (Seth Rogen) are best friends co-workers. One day Adam is told he has cancer. The news hit everybody in their own way. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) tries desperately to be helpful. His mother (Anjelica Huston) is shocked. He has trouble accepting help from his super young therapist Dr McKay (Anna Kendrick). It might be Kyle who deals with it the best.This is based on Will Reiser's cancer story when he worked with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on the 'Da Ali G Show'. Seth Rogen is really funny as the inappropriate friend and their funny cancer bromance. Anna Kendrick is super sweet and provided some great funny moments. Bryce Dallas Howard is oddly hilarious as the bad girlfriend.This is a good happy cancer movie. So if you have cancer, I highly recommend it. If you don't have cancer, maybe get some before watching this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a pleasant surprise this movie was!,"50/50 completely took me by surprise. It was genuinely funny, heart warming, emotional, and entertaining.It benefitted from a great collection of characters and a really stacked cast. Joseph Gordon Levitt is great and needs to be in more films, he really nailed this role. He played the part to perfection, nailing the subtle comedy while also delivering the powerful emotional beats. Of course Seth Rogen was fantastic, when isn't he? I also loved both Anna Kendrick and Bryce Dallas Howard. They both had great roles and played them perfectly.The story was really enjoyable. It had a tough job of blending cancer and comedy, but remarkably managed to find such a great balance. It zig zagged from hilarious moments to heartbreaking ones seamlessly, and was really impressive in this respect. The screenplay was sensitive and crude at the same time, which I loved.50/50 is a perfect blending of genres. It has romance, comedy, drama - what more could you want?A great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm in the middle on this one,"I will start by telling you 2 things about this movie that I think are important to someone about to sit down and watch. This is not a very fast moving tale, it does plod along in spots where I believe the director was trying a convey a subtle point. The other thing you need to know, and this is most important thing, this is not a sappy, tug at your heart strings kind of a movie. This was a fairly honest portrayal of how one man deals with the idea that he only has a 50% chance of living.Both the lead actors are good, I am thrilled to see JGL branching out he is an extremely talented actor. If you're expecting a typical Seth Rogan movie, it's not this one, he is really very good at portraying the best friend who at first doesn't have a clue how to help his friend deal with his situation. Not one time did he go into the ""Hey look at me I,m a funny fat guy.

A Very Strong Dramedy,"Not much to say about this one - it's just a really good time. If there is one thing I should give this film credit for over everything else, it is that it nailed the balance of tones. It's manages to juggle lighter hearted and more serious moments really well, and it makes the film an enjoyable time as a result. The cast are great, the characters are mostly well-developed and the ending is really strong, and left a good taste in my mouth. Only major issue was the ex-girlfriend who was pretty annoying and not very well developed, but other than that, this is a smart, enjoyable dramedy, and I would definitely recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Intense,"The movie is more intense and extremely real, then I expected since it is rated as a comedy. It's a very down to earth film that causes it to be a little depressing as it shows the entire struggles and reality as a person battles cancer. The overall movie was very well written and really managed to hit the heart strings. It was fascinating to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting as he transformed his character from one spectrum to another. But Anna Kendrick's part was poorly written as it didn't flow right with the movie. Her lines were awkward and no therapist is that unprofessional or clueless. I feel this movie would have been better with more comic relief.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm sure it was hard for Lewitt's character too, yet this one won my heart and was a winner throughout. Loved Rogen and I've always loved you Anna Kendrick! It's a surprising watch as the roller coaster of emotions will keep you hooked. Thanks for making this film!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Cancer Isn't Funny, but it Can't Hurt to Laugh","Dramatic Comedy is a tough genre. Sometimes they are too serious and not funny and sometimes they are too funny and it's too much of a comedy. The movie is called 50/50 but the drama to comedy ratio is more like 80/20. Joseph Gordon Levitt start as a 27 year old man who gets diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and is given a 50/50 shot of staying alive. Seth Rogan is his best friend and he is hilarious as always. Levitt goes to a treatment center and meets two older cancer patients and they are also very funny, but other than that this movie was straight up drama.Is 50/50 a good movie? Eh, yes, it has a lot of emotion and Joseph Gordon Levitt makes the character very believable. Cancer is a very hard thing to live with affecting so many people. He has a girlfriend and she eventually shows her true colors. A lot of the scenes in this movie felt real. The relationships between Levitt and other characters felt real and how he treats them was expected. He didn't want a therapist so he gives her attitude. He is sick of his overbearing mother so he ignores her. He and his girlfriend don't have the best relationship which in this situation can be expected. It was Rogan and Levitt that had the best relationship because we see Levitt's character smile and be normal. It was good for him and better for the movie. The comedy came in at the right and wrong time but it really lacked. This movie straight up wasn't that funny. Rogan is the center of all the comedy, as he should have been, but I wanted to laugh more in this movie. I expected to laugh more in this movie. When the comedy was there it was hysterical. Something happens between Levitt and his girlfriend and Rogan's character is right in the middle and you can tell this scene was written by Rogan himself or completely improve. I was laughing so hard in this moment and a few others but the core of the movie is a cancer story. The dramatic moments are really well done but the majority of the movie is predictable. You have seen this movie before time and time again but it is still entertaining. I expected something a little different than what I got but predictable does not always mean bad. There were a few moments and outcomes I did not see coming but the majority I could have written myself. At first Levitt hates his young therapist. He is 27 and she 24, and it is obvious they grow on each other and become a love interest in the least expected of ways. In the cancer treatment center Levitt meets these two old guys who also have cancer and they are a riot. The first scene with the three of them was great. One of them gives Levitt pot cookies and that whole scene is great and hysterical. When the three of them are together it is pure entertainment, but then the drama bug comes around and kills one of them and we never see Levitt interact with the remaining one again. That was a shame but it was a big reality punch in the face. I felt really sad when he died and it hit me as hard as it hit Levitt. This movie touched me as it probably touched most people because we all know somebody who has cancer or is affected by another family member who has cancer. In a more cheerful note Seth Rogan is in this movie. I love Seth Rogan, he may play the laid back pot head in every movie but he does it so well. There are few people who could pull off what he did. He made a terrible situation not as terrible. He isn't laughing at cancer or saying it isn't a big deal, but he is saying it isn't the end of the world. You may have less time than the rest of us and that is unfortunate but he tries to make the best of it for his friend. Yeah there is that one scene where they use it to get laid but come on that would probably work in real life. Overall 50/50 is a dramatic comedy and one of the better ones I have seen. I'm not crazy about this genre but I am crazy about any movie Seth Rogan is in. I had doubts going into this movie and as predictable and emotional as it was, I did enjoy it. I had fun with this movie through my laughs and fighting back of tears. The characters all felt real and the endgame of all of them felt real. Levitt's father in the movie has Alzheimer's disease but in all honestly I thought it was wasted. I think he was supposed to be used for comedic relief but he isn't really used. He says a few lines but other than that he stands around and looks stupid. There were a lot of things I liked and a lot I didn't but it is still a solid movie I found entertaining so it gets a very high WillyT Recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Couldn't Get Through It,"JGL is a great dramatic actor. When he plays the quirky cute card, however, he makes me want to throw myself into oncoming traffic. This and 500 Days of Summer rank among my least favorite movies of all time. Contrite, painful, not funny, awful character development, just plain bad.I don't understand why people like this movie. You don't care a lick about any of the people. He is mopey and frail (not because of the cancer, mind you), Seth is supposedly this great womanizer (who most women wouldn't bang with a stolen vagina), and his therapist (don't worry, not revealing anything) is so patently bad at her job it makes you wonder why real therapists didn't stage a mass protest outside of theaters.Not remotely inspiring at all.

"Mixing humor an drama perfectly, ""50-50"" does not value the sadness necessarily linked to cancer, but rather highlights the more human side of us all","The plot elaborated by Will Reiser has as its greatest merit the ability to transform a personal quasi-tragedy into something light and accessible to the majority of the public. Reiser, who had never written for film and until then had been working as a television producer, saw his life turned upside down when, before he was even 30, he was diagnosed with a very specific type of spinal cancer. His chances of recovery, as the title itself already announces, were 50%. Half to half. He could either die or be cured - it was the same on each side. Without letting himself get discouraged, he took advantage of the situation presented and decided to take stock of the life he had been leading until then: he got rid of his girlfriend who only exploited his good will without reciprocating in kind, he faced work with a new spirit and tried to reestablish ties with the family, especially with the domineering and needy mother.Well, at least that's how it was according to what we see in 50% of the film. Yes, because although it is a plot based on a true event, it is not very clear - except for those involved - to what extent what we see on screen really happened or not. Reiser is a longtime friend of Seth Rogen, who in recent times, with films such as ""The Green Hornet (2011)"" and ""Knocked Up (2007)"", has seen his status in Hollywood grow. Thus, he took advantage of this newly acquired power and encouraged his friend to put his experience on paper and helped him transform it into a friendly production, which deals with a very difficult period in anyone's life with good humor. Perhaps the work also served to exorcise the trauma, and if so, it seems to have worked.Even affected by the fear of an insignificant future, Adam tries to go about his daily life in a normal way, but the problem (and the solution) are others. Friend Kyle doesn't quite know how to react, and adopts the stance ""50% chance of survival? I thought it would be worse."" The overprotective mother Diane, accustomed to life's setbacks (her husband has Alzheimer's), takes on the boy with a suffocating maternal instinct. Not to mention the co-workers who, instead of a man, see a walking corpse before them. Suffering from the effects of chemotherapy, the young man goes through all the psychological phases of the disease, always closely accompanied by the inexperienced and at the same time adorable therapist Katherine. He then regrets his life little lived, he didn't even get his license due to the high accident rate. To make matters worse, his current girlfriend doesn't deal with the situation in a human way, so to speak, literally burying the guy at the bottom of the well. The truth is that Adam is an only child, super protected, super stigmatized, and his choices for women of dubious character are a reflection, in fact a contrast, of the relationship he has with his mother.And after courageous (but elusive) acceptance comes fear. That's when the penny really drops, not only for Adam, but for everyone around him, who until then had dealt with the situation in a surreal way. It is difficult to immediately understand the full meaning of witnessing a young person suffering from cancer, even though he is weak and bald. It's more than our minds can process for a while. ""50%"" necessarily suffers from a slight identity crisis when it comes to establishing its gender, at least until its first half. Despite obviously being a dramatic comedy, the youthful style of humor - which comes to life mainly with the character Kyle - can at times come up against the seriousness of the ""cancer"" theme. But this strangeness is the great difference of the work, which does not try to alleviate the situation at any point. The ""discrepancy"" does not harm the result, quite the contrary, it means that in the end the film gradually evolves, maturing through the facts, thus achieving the perfect measure between its unappealing drama and the lame humor, managing, above all, to be relevant for anyone who has already experienced the topic.Containing priceless and politically incorrect moments, the film abuses black humor and the use of ""medical"" drugs. Adam at one point tries to get laid using the fact that he is sick, at another, he walks through the hospital high on marijuana candy laughing at bagged bodies. One of the film's best jokes plays on the death of a famous American actor. Total freedom of thought. In dramatic moments, we are touched mainly by the character's fears and anguish, by the impotence of friends and family in the face of the young man's illness, and by the idea that a life full of possibilities can come to an end for no plausible reason.Jonathan Levine's direction is uncompromising and courageous. Using commendable internal lighting, Levine focuses on the details, emphasizes the interpretations and values, above all, the exceptional text by Will Reiser, who used his own story as the basis for the script. Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves to be the perfect choice for the lead role. His Adam is very reminiscent of the character Cameron, from ""10 Things I Hate About You"", an extremely good boy (sometimes manipulative) who is attracted to girls who don't value him. Now, with great works under his belt, the actor quietly raises the level of the film as the protagonist, using all his flexibility for humor and drama. He handles the drama faced by the character with delicacy and simplicity, and even though he knows that in the end everything will work out - after all, the guy survived to tell his story, right? - it is impossible not to be moved by certain sequences. Huston's small but efficient appearances also contribute to this, as a somewhat absent matriarch, but who is always feeling guilty for that reason, generating the necessary comic relief for the topic discussed. Seth Rogen always plays the same role, which in this case works. Kyle is immature and often acts irresponsibly and cluelessly, however he is an inseparable friend. Completely unaware of reality, his reactions are the literal transcription of how most men would act in a situation like this. Working better on your dramatic side, it is interesting to analyze the chemistry of this unlikely duo.Another point of support in his recovery is the newly qualified therapist Katherine McKay (Anna Kendrick), who, as she doesn't have much experience in providing care, ends up offering the patient hospitality as if they were friends, which has more than positive effects. Here we should criticize Will Reiser's script, as we feel enormous discomfort in the protagonist's relationship with the therapist. Looking from the perspective of the professional relationship they should have, as patient and therapist, she goes beyond insurmountable limits several times, which is not excusable due to lack of experience. It's wrong on so many levels. Obviously, this is fiction, but reinforcing this type of problematic relationship in films only brings disadvantages for potential patients, who may believe it is possible to maintain a relationship of this type with the therapist, and it is not.On the other hand, the script deserves some praise. As difficult as it is to touch on this subject, I found the part that shows the difficulties faced by Adam's girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), important. The two were in the early stages of dating and there was still no real commitment on her part. Upon receiving the news, she took the attitude that society expected of her, but not the one she really wanted to have chosen, which led to a series of embarrassments that could have been avoided if she had been honest with him from the beginning. Not knowing how to deal with difficult times for the people around us is something that happens very often in relationships of all types, from friendships to long-term marriages. When one of the parties lacks sincerity, the frustration ends up being worse than the truth, and this regardless of whether the relationship is long or not. When we are going through difficulties, it is common for us to take extreme positions: either we hope for general understanding from the nation, or we think that no one needs to help us, and, in both cases, we end up frustrated with the reactions of the people around us. In Rachael's case, because she didn't have the courage to admit her weaknesses, she ended up making a situation that was already difficult worse, and it didn't need to be like that.In the end, ""50%"" starts off shocking and ends up moving, something difficult if we are to analyze the humor that served as the basis for the film. With a creative script and a director who knows how to make the most of great performances, the story is important because it does not value the sadness necessarily linked to cancer, but rather highlights the more human side of us all, the one who sympathizes with other people's sadness, who tries to be positive even when everything indicates the opposite, who laughs nervously to keep from crying, who suffers in silence without fully understanding what he is feeling, who is afraid of death, but who faces his destiny with courage, because after all, he is going to do what, right?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simple but effective,"There was a time where Joseph Gordon-Levitt had a really promising career. Seeing him in Inception and Don Jon showed me how capable he was. It's sad we don't get to see him nowadays because he had huge potential and 50/50 is a great example of his acting abilities.50/50 follows Adam, a young man who gets diagnosed with a rare type of cancer and has a 50% chance of living and we see how he struggles to fight against the disease.This is a film that is the definition of simple but effective. The story is not complicated at all but it's told in a very lighthearted and touching way. Writer Will Reiser found a great balance between comedy and drama as they never clash with one another. There's not a moment where the comedy goes too far or the film gets overdramatic. It's all kept fairly realistic which makes the story all the more believable. It may feel weird having comedy in a film about a dark subject like cancer but it's used in a way to show the positive side of it. It shows us how we should live our life to the fullest and always keep on smiling day in day out no matter what.The performances by every single actor is spectacular. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely terrific here and makes us feel really sympathetic towards him due to what he goes. Seth Rogen is perfect for playing Joseph Gordon-Levitt's best friend. He's very funny throughout and there's a great amount of character development to him. Anna Kendrick is also great and the bond she builds with JGL is executed brilliantly. Anjelica Huston and Bryce Dallas Howard also do their roles justice.The writing in this film is excellent. It's clear how Will Reiser takes his own personal experience and makes something incredibly moving. I love how each character develops and the impact they have on Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character which helps him grow as a result.50/50 was executed really well surprisingly. It's got a great amount of humour to make you laugh and a great amount of drama that's both emotional and heartwarming.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
nice movie,"'50/50', Inspired by a true story, is a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease. '50/50' has a good start, a mediocre middle & a feel-good end. The depiction of it's protagonist's battle with cancer, and his entire journey, comes out well. Reiser's Screenplay is engaging. Jonathan Levine Directs this story well. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are passable. Music is excellent. Performance-Wise: Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels in the lead role. Seth Rogen is routine. Anna Kendrick is emerging into a very, very fine performer. She delivers a fantastic performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is very convincing. On the whole, '50/50' is a genuinely good effort. i like it :)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I gave this movie a 50/50 chance of being good...,"...but lost.I am sick and tired of Hollywood letting music and soulful shots of people in buses or walking in the rain stand in for thoughtful dialog and resonant character development. I felt like this was written with a big crayon on butcher paper.And before anyone says, ""Oh well, he's never been through that, he has no idea,"" let me preemptively respond (joke, see?) with the fact that au contraire, I have so been there and it was nothing like what was portrayed in this horrible excuse for entertainment.Bleah. An hour and thirty-some-odd minutes of my life sucked down a boring, shallow, tube of trite clichés. I would recommend stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork over wasting your precious life with this steaming pile of excrement.OK. My sweetie-pie says I should perhaps give an accurate review and not just trash the movie with both hands and feet. So here is my more thoughtful consideration: It was basically a limp, half-hearted attempt at mixing a Seth-Rogen-style comedy with a tear-jerker-movie-of- the-week. It's probably not as horrible as a 3 (I mean I gave Planet of the Apes a 5), but I felt I had to balance out all the 9 and 10 reviews this got. I mean really? WTF? 10? That's a ringer review right there. Companies can buy those reviews, or maybe it's someone who worked on the movie or something. No one in their right mind would give this thing more than a 6, 6.5 at the very absolute most.So, yeah.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laughter is the Best Medicine,"50/50 is a drama. And a comedy. And one of the better films to come down the pike in 2011.Because of the very nature of its story, it should be no surprise that the movie is emotionally draining. What might be surprising, though, is that it's uplifting in equal measure. Rather than wallowing in the wake of its protagonist's recent cancer diagnosis, it takes the route of allowing its audience a glimpse into the life of a man who's struggling to overcome more than just the disease that serves as the proverbial MacGuffin. At times, the movie is guilty of conforming to indie/rom-com clichés that have defined the genre for the past five (or so) years, but the leads are so likable—and the writing is so crisp, poignant, and utterly hilarious—that it's hard to point to such tendencies as a fault.As usual, Rogen and company are able to bottle the ""real life"" conversation and observations that assign a tangible identity to the neo-nerd pop culture that is the twenty-something male of contemporary society. Because of this, what could have easily been a draining slog through the life of a disgruntled cancer patient becomes a celebration of latching onto anything (and everything) that has substance. The evolution of Adam (Levitt) is realistic and touching, and by the time the inevitable ""confrontation"" takes place, you'll feel like you've endured something miraculous.To further comment on the layered plot and what it implies about the needs of everyone ""surviving"" all walks of life would be to ruin some of the more unexpected revelations that come from 50/50, so I'll end by saying, quite simply, that it's a wonderful movie.In fact, there's a 99.9% chance that you'll leave the theater with a huge smile on your face. And I'm willing to bet not too many people saw that coming.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great drama! Really moving! 8,"I do not understand why this movie was not released in my country. I think it is one of the most moving dramas I saw. This one is short and well-paced. It means it is very entertaining, as well as moving and shocking. It contains some humour, as well. I have not seen any more movies directed by Jonathan Levine, but he did an excellent job in this case. The cast is good, without many stars, but with actors portraying very believable roles and nice characters. Joseph Gordon Levitt, still very young as an actor, has an excellent career. He does very believable jobs. You should see him in movies like ""Batman: the dark knight rises"", ""Ten reasons to hate you"", ""Looper"", ""The lookout"" and ""500 days of summer"". He is good at many different genres and roles. He is the protagonist and does an excellent job portraying the part of a young man who suffers from a very serious cancer. Seth Rogen, a specialist in comedies, delivered his best performance in the movie. I did not like him much before. He is the main character's best friend and adds a comedy tone. The actresses Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard and specially, Anjelica Huston, are very good in their female-roles. The whole cast is excellent. The best thing about the movie is its capacity of making us believe what it tells. It actually made me feel in the characters' foots. I almost cried at the end. There are some disgusting and necessary scenes. It is curious that it adds some humour in the scenes (I guess some patients like this tell jokes in order to take it easier as a therapy). The movie makes you value your health even more. In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good movies, specially dramas... 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Funny, sensitive, intelligent treatment of cancer-in-guy-too-young-to die story","Cancer movies have been done and overdone, but there's always the chance that someone will do something new and different. Here, there are several new and different angles. The super acting job by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who manages to show many sides of a particular human reacting to a particular human problem, helps take this story up several notches from the usual tearjerker. Most of the characters (cancer victim, best friend, girlfriend, novice therapist, parents) are given three-dimensional lives. Standing out, aside from Gordon-Levitt, are Angelica Huston as the Mom and Philip Baker Hall as the chemo infusion-buddy. The script, which I believe is based on a true story (that of the screenwriter's own experience), and the direction by Jonathan Levine, keeps us interested, sympathetic, and laughing, even if it also allows us to share in varieties of suffering . It's not just the disease that's a problem here; it's also the nature of the relationships between people who are close, love each other and are challenged to connect in a positive way. I only wish that Seth Rogan had more to do (or, could do more with it) than the one-note, stereotypic role he has in this film. He's the same guy in all his movies. What if it were HIS character with the cancer? Now that could be an interesting sequel.",,Anonymous,Romance

Perfectly balanced complimented by excellent performances!,"This heart-wrenching laugh-out-loud comedy will take you through a mixture of emotions; you will be laughing your head off with it's perfectly placed humour and falling into deep self-reflection on the importance of life and well-being which we all so carelessly take for granted. This poignant story is about a 27-year old healthy, reserved, safe character Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt) who is suddenly diagnosed with a rare and malignant type of cancer and is given a 50/50 chance of beating it. The story develops the unique relationships between the malingerer and his friends and family and how everyone handles the stress and grief differently.The screenplay really deserves credit; it deals with the traumatic illness of cancer in an honest way, without ever feeling fake; and the acting really compliments that, Joseph Gordon Levitt gives a truly believable and excellent performance of a young man facing this trouble; and the best friend (Seth Rogan) portrays his characters sentimental big heart underneath his awkwardly funny and sexually-driven personality perfectly. The scenes between the trainee psychiatrist (Anna Kendrick) and Adam are a pleasure because of her obvious instant attraction conflicted by her obligation to stay within the boundaries of patient conduct and give her best professional objective help.The story is primarily a comedy but its subtleties and underlying themes are truly excellent and what makes it thoroughly pleasant to watch and a touching experience. The importance of the comedy value throughout the film is essential for balance; and to remind the audience that a smile and a laugh between friends and family can always help ease the brutal and grave reality of life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A tad over hyped but still pretty funny.,"Who doesn't adore Seth Rogen? And who isn't lusting after Joseph Gordon Levitt? Not very many people, that's what makes this movie good, the unusual team up of these two polar opposite actors. So JGL gets cancer and of course he starts to lose his hair and all the other stuff that goes along with cancer treatment but there by his side is his trusty best friend Seth Rogen in all his comedic cliché but excellent glory.It's pretty good that the subject of cancer can be used in TV and film and it not be a total drag and make you depressed, between this film and The Big C I think a lot of people are enjoying TV and movies about cancer. Seth Rogen does the film so much good, he's just such a lovable guy it's hard not to like him, JGL is also pretty good as usual also, although his character does sometimes get a bit boring. Anna Kendrick is so great in everything, she is a very talented young actress and I hope people like her continue to get the good roles, she manages to stand out in everything she's in.I've heard so many great things about this movie, and I agree with a lot of it but it is a little over hyped, I mean it's good but i have seen better this year , in all honesty I don't think this movie will clean up in awards season, there's just too many other movies that are better.This movie kinda brings together two audiences, the older generation who like serious films and the younger crowd who enjoy the Seth Rogen style comedies, and both audiences will be pleased.

Bryce Dallas Howard and especially Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall are all great in their supporting roles.With solid direction and good script, this movie is one of the better movies I've seen from 2011.

"This movie might be separated 50/50 when it comes to the audiences, but I liked this movie","This movie is a good blend of seriousness and comedy mixed into one film. Serious because of the cancer aspect of it and how a likable character deals with it. I would have passed on this movie to see it in theater but it has Joseph Gordon-Levitt facing cancer so it was a must watch. I didn't really like Seth Rogen in movies lately, well actually I just didn't care. But he was a key character in this movie and he was the one that actually added decent comedy elements to the movie. His character actually made the movie less depressing and bearable, because without his character this would have been a dark and just plain depressing. Mostly because Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Adam is a guy that just let society and the people around him push him around while trying to do everything right. He doesn't smoke or anything like that and is a healthy guy and yet ironically he ends up with cancer. Not that cancer is something funny or anything like that but Seth Rogen played a important role for the lighthearted mood of it during certain parts or else the movie would have been just too serious. This isn't a groundbreaking movie about cancer but it's a believable movie about a guy dealing with cancer that has a 50/50 chance of surviving. It's a good movie that you will actually start to care abut the characters and actually had my attention most of the way through. The serious dramatic parts and comedic parts were blend in pretty well in this without being forced and even the romantic elements fit right in as well. It's a movie that is worth seeing at least once because of the good mix of different elements and because it has good character development.7.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Serious, saddening and comical - all in one.","I was impressed with how well this film keeps within reality of its serious subject, but at the same time is able to make its audience giggle. It does not make humour of the subject of cancer, instead, it shows the reactions of an individual who attempts to cope with it. How he tries to find the light within the darkness and the effect that those around him have on his situation.You gain a real sense of the trauma that a person goes through when they are diagnosed, however, in this case, we follow an individual who does his best to stay positive and how his life can suddenly change from the moment he is diagnosed.It is touching, enlightening and softly comical.The stars of this film are excellent and do a great job of portraying the very real scenario that it is based on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50 hits the mark 100%,"This is a good film. It is a very good film. I was tempted to give it a 10.0. It will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you assess yourself and life. It raises lots of questions without trying to force too many answers. Sometimes life throws you a curve ball. You can miss it, duck it, hit it back or get hit and take a dive. The best bet is to stay in the batters box for the next pitch. You might strike outor you might get a walk. This film has nothing to do with baseball. I just like baseball metaphors for life.Good-time buddies Adam (Gordon-Levitt) and Kyle (Rogan) are bouncing along in life. Adam looking for love and Kyle looking just to get laid. Opposites attract even with guys. Then, the seemingly ""good one"", Adam, gets diagnosed with cancer. Bad things happen to good people after all. But in his own bizarre way, Kyle sticks by his buddy in thick hair and thin. Adam's new girlfriend (Bryce Dallas-Howard) bales on him. Adam's Mom (Huston) reacts like a real loving mom would. Adam's Dad is so far down the road with Alzheimers, he has no clue. It is just as well. There are so many messages here it is hard to sort them all out. The fact is when a sudden death of a young person or cancer strikes, there is no solid playbook to follow. No one really knows what they will do, even when it happens. Even good people can fail the test. Just stand in the receiving line at any funeral of a young person. It's awkward and messy. People fumble when handed the ball (sorry, another sports metaphor). Just being there and taking the pain along side your friend or loved one is all that you are expected to dobut do it.The 24 year old newbie therapist, Katherine (assigned to help Adam cope) is trying so hard. She knows what she has been taught and tries all the cliché tricks, but she realizes she must learn from her patient what she needs to know. In a sense, Katherine represents all of us. We all need to care and love, but also need to listen and learn from those who meet with challenge or tragedy. Often doctors, friends and family end up getting aid and comfort from the victim. Adam supplies the stability to everyone, even though it is he who has the cancer. TMG refuses to tell you more. This movie needs to unwind and reveal itself to you. I assure you, you will learn, laugh, cry and enjoy the experience. Take someone you care about and hug them when it is over. Let them know you are with them, in good times and in bad, for richer for poorer and in sickness and in health. You don't need to be married to give that support to another human being.My co-host Joy Lynn says: As I noted on my Facebook page, if you plan to see 50/50, take a few tissues. If you are a mom of a 26 year old son, take the entire Kleenex box. The overall theme in this film is very similar to The Way! You cannot, and perhaps more importantly, should not, live life alone. You need a ""community"" of people to help carry your burdens. In this case, a dog (almost a person!), a therapist, a parent, and a best friend fill the bill. The saddest part of this movie for me was that fact that Adam began his struggle very much alone. The writer did an excellent job portraying the loneliness theme in this film by not having Adam drive, no true girlfriend, only one parent available emotionally, a ""retired"" greyhound dog, and only one friend Kyle (who was yet to prove his worth). No one can feel your pain—but each can help you carry the burden little by little. They may fumble trying, but each can offer something if they are willing to try. Thankfully, the story added some humor — not too much so to be disrespectful, but just enough to take the edge off. This is a very real movie – my favorite kind!! A few loopholes here and there made for a slow start, but once the chemo started, the movie began a new path.",,Anonymous,Romance
Story of a lucky man,"This is a film, avowedly based on a true story, with substantial critical admirers; I can only say I found it charmless, shallow, smug and unlikable: a romance weepier about cancer with a very serious attitude. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a 20-something guy with a sketchily imagined job in public radio. Seth Rogen plays Kyle, his goofy skirt-chasing buddy and wingman. Bryce Dallas Howard plays his artist girlfriend Rachel. One day, Adam complains of back pain and breathlessness and the next thing you know he is diagnosed with a form of cancer that, he learns from the web, gives him a 50/50 chance of survival. However smart and savvy the movie looks at first glance, this is basically yet another example of sentimental Hollywood Cancer: Adam prey-emits the traditionally understood byproducts of chemotherapy by shaving his head and there seem to be no other serious symptoms,other than having to abandon sex with a super-hot girl in midstream because it's too painful. Rachel is aggressively dumped because she cheats on him, and Kyle is bafflingly exultant, actually encouraging him to burn the painting she gave him. Is that supposed to be funny and heroic? Rogen's character just looks boorish, ugly and misogynist. This film leaves a strange taste in the mouth.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great, except for Rogan","If it were not for Seth Rogan doing what he does best, this would have been a great film. Of course, his role is not fiction but it is about his real-life self in what is based on a true story.As for Love-Hewett - he is just as great as he always has been. He is one of those who can expect to have a very long and productive career. Howard and Kendrick are good in this film, essentially playing characters very similar to those in previous roles. It's nice to see Huston, Frewer and Hall as well - all of whom turn in their typically great performances.The direction is also great. As indicated above, it would have been nice if Rogan's character were not such an annoyance. Humor and wackiness are great, but an obnoxious, crude character is not a plus, even if the character is real.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most realistic take on a cancer diagnosis,"This film sheds light on the confusing range of emotions experienced by a cancer patient, his friends, and his family. It also shows the struggle that all of them face to cope with the diagnosis, treatment, and risk of death. While 50/50 odds are fairly high for stage 3 or 4 cancer, I would still recommend this movie to anyone who is diagnosed or knows someone diagnosed with cancer.All of the supporting cast perform their parts expertly, making it abudantly clear how the cancer diagnosis has affected them and their coping methods. Even the least likable character is still completely relatable as someone who feels stuck in a situation they didn't want to be in. Gordon-Levitt performs excellently, and it's very easy to imagine him as a real person, which compels the audience to sympathize with every one of the wide range of emotions that he experiences.The realism makes this movie an excellent resource for anyone affected by a cancer diagnosis, though this same realism does hold it back from being a great drama by never presenting the emotional knock out punch that one would expect from a Hollywood drama. However, 50/50 still lands some solid punches and provides excellent life lessons.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Alas, while not special, it does in its own right stand out as a well executed film in its genre, albeit not mind blowing in this aspect.

"50/50, as the title bargains, is a movie of two halves.","50/50 is half-morbid, half-humorous; it's half-serious, half-light- hearted; it's half-bromance, half-rom-com. Indeed, 50/50, as the title bargains, is a movie of two halves.Loosely based on screenwriter Will Reiser's personal experience, 50/50 presents Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) as a naive young writer whose happy-go-lucky existence is stopped short by the diagnosis of a Schwannoma spinal tumour (yes, that's right, a Schwannoma spinal tumour).The Internet forecasts a worrying survival rating of 50/50 for his tumour, but with the convenient help of his skirt-chasing, beer-guzzling bro Kyle (the disarmingly charmingly podgy Seth Rogen), Adam ventures to outsmart the odds, playing with a weak hand but a strong heart. It warms even the coldest of folk. Just ask me. This is a bromance for today's emotional bro. Its excessive sentimentality almost makes it a 'weepie' – but don't worry, dude, it's still boisterously macho. Like when Rogen encourages Gordon-Levitt to mutilate his ex- girlfriend's artwork with eggs, blades, and a make- shift flamethrower.We first see Adam jogging and it's symbolically fitting for a performance which warms-up before breaking into a full sprint. It successively captures (even if only sketchily) the processes of cancer, from denial to sensing injustice (""That doesn't make any sense though. I mean I don't smoke, I don't drink I recycle.""). Each time wild fear visits his eyes, it compels you to pretend there's something in yours.Katherine (Anna Kendrick as an endearingly naive psychotherapy student) is drafted in to comfort Gordon-Levitt, with resultingly tender exchanges and chipmunk smiles. Matt Frewer and Philip Baker Hall provide more comic relief as two cancer-stricken and lovin'-it old timers, as Gordon-Levitt's cancer 'touches' (what a horribly gentle euphemism!) everyone.Rogen, who puts the 'ro' in 'bro', does his thing (equipped with genital hair jokes, surprise!) as laugh-snatching to Gordon-Levitt's tear- jerking. The initial fear that his usual over-the-top-ness will dilute the effect of the tragedy is dismissed, with even Rogen submitting a decent performance.But the direction is without nuance. Director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) adopts a flag-waving methodology in order to express the contrast of his 'cancer comedy' movie. The old bedfellows – Humour and Morbidity – renew their volatile relationship without even looking one another in the eye (as in 2009's Funny People). With a wink and a smile, Seth Rogen waves the flag of Humour: our cue to laugh. Ha, ha, ha. Soft acoustic string-plucking is truly the sound of Morbidity and Levine tediously evokes and re-evokes this stimulus, as we become sad, sad, sad. The comedy and the tragedy are seldom combined, leaving us with only a craving for the blurring of these lines.Laughter, as fame holds it, is the best medicine (with runners-up morpheme and marijuana close behind). 50/50 realises this but it does not allow the humour to metastasise to the grieving body.In the end 50/50 is a funny and moving film. But, without much effort, it falls short of being an important one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The mostly weird, but the funny and the beautiful of the comedy of cancer","""50/50"" takes the dying-of-cancer genre and mixes it with the crass-and-crude comedy genre. The result is a film which is half-touching and half-funny, and only barely adds up to a whole. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has made a career out of playing the nice guy with the simple and subtle reactions, usually in light comedies, but as 27 year-old Adam there was a bit too much of the nice and light.Seth Rogen has made a career out of playing the bumbling best friend with rude lines and sexual innuendos. As usual, he was still pretty funny here. But it is a weird mix when one friend is dying of cancer and the other is making jokes about getting laid in high school. It is also exactly what the film was trying to do.Adam is trying to come to an understanding and acceptance of the finality of his life, and it is his life. He wants everybody to understand that. Whether it's the unhelpful assistance of his passive aggressive girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), or the awkward joke-making of his best friend, or the incessant meddling of his mother, Adam just wants to be left alone. Not actually alone, alone, but alone with them.There was something void in Adam's struggle of his fate. He was perhaps too staid during a part of life that those of us who are the same age as him, won't be able to have the same understanding. Either way, there was something missing for that needed level of sympathy.What was missing was a humorous, touching and compassionate love interest. She arrived in the form of the beautiful and funny Anna Kendrick. She was our connection to Adam. She was the one that was able to meld the comedy and the dying-of-cancer tragedy into something that wasn't weird. I would like to say that she came into the picture too late and was used too little, but ""50/50"" was trying to make it more about Adam and all the relationships in his life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A serious subject (cancer) handled in a humorous way.,"The movie is inspired from true story. It gives us a glimpse of a true cancer patient with respect to family and friends and the process of treatment.A few instances that lift up this humorous treat as per my perception are stated as follows :1) The character of Levitt's best friend-Seth Rogen, his friendship, his nature, his attitude, his swearing - give us idea of one's male friends in an entertaining way.2) How they dealt with a cheating girlfriend, her getting caught followed by breakup, I mean how it unfolded was epic.3) The other patients associating along with Adam while chemo was a humorous treat as well.Final Verdict: It is worth adding to your collection.

I really recommend.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laugh-Riot/Tear-Jerker: One of the year's best films.,"They did the impossible. They made me laugh hysterically during a cancer film. The performances are fantastic, especially Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick. If there is any justice, these two will become massive stars with this film. Huston was also marvelous. Seth Rogen played the same character he always has but I didn't mind because his character is a crucial part to what makes this movie work so well.Everyone gives a honest performance and the situations are genuine. There are some great laughs but there are also some heartbreaking moments. This definitely a movie for our time, and being a twenty-something myself, I connected with any aspects of this film, especially the relationship between Gordon-Levitt and Rogen's characters.This has been a great year for R-rated comedies and I believe this film is head and shoulders above the rest. It's a laugh-riot and a tear- jerker and it's one of the best movies of 2011. My highest recommendation. Go see this movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Watchable..,"Young, smart men in their early 20s should not be knocking at death's door, and while we know that the Reaper waits for all men, getting a sneak peek at the mechanics of mortality holds a Dante-esque fascination. Mix in everyman color commentary from Seth Rogen (at his absolute best here) and 50/50 becomes an extraordinary observation on the cycles of life. Rogen is just the best friend - it is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, avid re-cycler and public radio producer, who is diagnosed with life-threatening cancer. His chances for survival are ""50/50"" and the all-consuming treatment that follows offers just enough of a clothesline on which to hang a number of moving and funny scenes. In addition to Rogen, we meet JGL's emotionally smothering mother (Angelica Huston, Oscar nomination ensured,) cruel girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard, Hiss) and the always terrific Anna Kendrick as JGL's therapist and, well, see the movie....",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of my favourite,"What a story, so much moving scenes storied in this one. The main thing its not important that a young men fights cancer, rather its a story about how he finds the real people in his life. We are with someone we don't know actually they care about us or not. Its the main thing they should accept us as we are..The bonding between family, friendship between Kayle & Adam its just marvelous.

A pleasant watch with a touching story ........,"The Opening :- 50 / 50 was a nice dramedy with decent performances and good story line. The Story :- Adam was a regular guy with a 9-5 job, a beautiful girlfriend , an always-there-for-you buddy but his life turns Topsy-turvy when he is diagnosed with cancer. His world is shattered as he learns about the disease , the pain and suffering he had to go through, his girlfriend cheating on him. How he struggles to fight the disease and lead a normal life is what comes next. The review :- So ,overall , I loved the film. It had simple story , fine performances and a tight script. Simplicity of this movie is what makes it so special. The direction was right and so was the handling of the screenplay. The background score was amazing. Joseph Gordin Levitt and Seth Regen were impressive through the film. On the flip side , it could have been more engaging by few minutes The bottom line 50/50 is a good watch with good direction , OK cinematography , nice background , decent performances along with a heartwarming touching storyline. – Good : 3 / 5",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film succeeds is because it feels honest,"50/50 could have been a dark, bleak movie or a sappy, manipulative fairytale. Instead, this film manages to walk the fine line between drama and comedy quite well. It presents a realistic look at a life-changing event, with excellent performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick. Seth Rogen plays his usual, irreverent self. I think the reason that this film succeeds is because it feels honest.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely disappointing,"My only guess why this movie has gotten so good reviews is that it deals with a difficult issue, but that isn't nearly enough to make it worth watching IMO. This was the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time.I found it very slow and boring, unfunny, predictable and unable to ""draw me in"". I couldn't care less about the main character, which is something I feel is really essential when comes to movies like this.The movie is absolutely not a bad movie, per say, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Seth Rogan Crude,"Awkward movie to watch. Great chemistry between the two leads. Really could have toned down on the vulgarity in particular Rogan. Everything was about getting laid.

Comedy?,"For me this movie raises two questions.
1. How does this movie get classed as a comedy? I cried more than I laughed. Just because there is a few laughs and Seth Rogen is in it doesn't make it a comedy.

A heartfelt journey through life's uncertainties,"'50/50' has quietly remained with me since I initially watched it, and upon a recent re-watch, it reminded me of an important lesson: life can be cruel, but it's the people around you who make you realise why it's worth living.Dealing with a topic as emotionally charged as cancer could turn viewers off if the content matter is not handled appropriately. Here, it is dealt with expertly, with the level of care it deserves. A perfect blend of realism and humor.The film is a semi-autobiographical take on the journey of one dealing with the dreaded disease, loosely inspired by screenwriter Will Reiser's own experiences.Aptly titled ""50/50,"" it revolves around mild-mannered Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a 27-year-old radio journalist who is thrust into a world of anxiety following an abrupt diagnosis of spinal cancer and learning he has only a 50% chance of survival, much to his shock and disbelief - 'That doesn't make any sense, though. I mean, I don't smoke, I don't drink... I recycle!'.Gordon-Levitt plays the character with real boldness - avoiding playing the victim while also unearthing the existential angst and worry of anyone in his shoes.Adam's best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogan), tries to do his best to support him. While sometimes acting for his own benefit - using his friend's illness as a sympathy card to pick up women at bars - Kyle has good intentions and isn't only on-screen for comedic relief. Seth Rogen breaks out of what you expect from him after the early scenes and delivers a supporting performance of real substance and note, rather than being the go-to guy for a cheap laugh. Kyle is the friend everybody wants - he is a brother-in-arms and has Adam's back throughout the entire journey.The script is so well-written and drops little gems of humor at times where it could fall fail of being bogged down in its harsh content matter. Bolstered by Rogan's comedic stylings, it keeps things light enough to turn the growing lump in your throat into a laugh. ""50/50! If you were a casino game, you would have the best odds!"" The comedic elements are weaved in nicely, and it never plays on cancer as the punchline. Instead, it deals with it face-on and uses the humor sublimely to take the edge off.The film explores the power of human connection and the importance of finding joy and meaning in life, even in the face of adversity.The supporting cast is solid - Bryce Dallas Howard portrays Adam's girlfriend, Rachael, an abstract artist who is not equipped to deal with Adam's sudden diagnosis and doesn't rise to the occasion like Kyle does, and Anjelica Huston plays Adam's overbearing mother who is having to balance a husband with severe dementia and a cancer-stricken son.But the standout is Anna Kendrick, who portrays Katherine, Adam's psychologist, in what I believe is her best on-screen performance. She brings authenticity and a certain quirkiness to her character - trying to remain professional and portraying herself as a veteran in her field, while not having much real experience. You can imagine that as a person in that role, it can break you down, especially for someone as new in the field as herself. It's the way Kendrick delivers the performance, which is subtle, truthful, and sometimes even sad that wins you over.The pacing of the film allows the barriers to slowly come down between Katherine and Adam, providing it the time needed to establish the relationship between the two.What starts as a one-way conversation, with Adam not revealing much about himself and feeling frustrated at being assigned a novice therapist, grows into something much more meaningful. Katherine provides the much-needed touch of the arm, which reminds Adam that there are still things in life worth enjoying. The ever-growing closeness of the two culminates in something sweet and heartfelt.'50/50' never tries to make any deliberate big statements on its subject matter, but it really focuses on the human element of a scary and uncertain journey. It's a film that will evoke a range of emotions in its audience.Overall, I'd give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Another Bromantic Classic,"In terms of subject matter Director Jonathan Levine's 50/50 is similar to Funny People, minus the 45 minutes they take out to Monterey to see about Adam Sandler's married ex-girlfriend. Subtract that 45 minutes from Funny People and we would've had the pinnacle of comedic drama in what we know today as a bromantic comedy.Besides Click, Funny People allowed Sandler to provoke an eye socket warming cathartic reaction. Now subtract Sandler's sense of humor from that movie along with the 45 minutes he takes aside from the most dramatic feature of the film, which altogether ruined Funny People's chances and you have Joseph Gordon-Levitt with Seth Rogen alongside as a 50/50 chance of landing somewhere closer to this type of comedic drama's intended goal.By now since Inception, and 500 Days Of Summer, everyone likes Levitt enough to not only pay closer attention to such a complex illness, but to also empathize with his metamorphosis from a no license having health nut, to a balding thin medicinal marijuana smoking, cancer patient.Rogen lends himself to this feature as merely a helping hand with just enough comedic quips and antidotes to help Levitt through this illness without letting the audience forget exactly what they are dealing with. The occupations of these characters take a sideline to this disease. Levitt's reaction to this illness is certainly something real enough to set things off with. Cinematically the trip his mind takes over the edibles and the chemotherapy is definitely something new introduced to this genre of bromantic comedies as it is also something enough to keep every one's attention.Funny thing about these comedies that intertwine themselves with drama is how much it constitutes and dignifies what is basically a romantic comedy for bros. Other films of this genre are Along Came Polly, 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Funny People, etc. It must have been this type of feature that inspired movies like I Love You Man, movies like this years' 50/50. By leaving out the potty humor 50/50 is the closest this genre of bromantic comedy has gotten to what it has always lacked in subtlety. Something about this attempt at such a style is what makes me wonder where this type of comedy is headed.As far as 50/50's release in theaters, I say see it, if you've already seen everything else that American cinema has to offer, from Drive, Moneyball, and Warrior. Otherwise it makes for a great date.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Poignant, magnificent, and simply unmissable","Based on the personal experiences of screenwriter Will Reiser, ""50/50"" is an honest blend of intense, heartfelt emotion and dark, irreverent humor. It's a rare and mesmerizing film that will have you laughing one minute and crying the next. Viewers will be profoundly moved by this inspirational tale of a man coming to the grips with his morality but chooses to embrace life instead and discovers passion, friendship, love and humanity during the process.I've always admired Joseph Gordon Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun, Inception) as an actor, and he deserves an Oscar for his performance as Adam: a man who suddenly discovers that he's diagnosed with a spinal tumor. The film benefits from Levitt's lukewarm tenderness, appealing charisma, and unmatched vulnerability in order for the storyline to be credible.Teen sensation Seth Rogen (Knocked Up, Pineapple Express) on the other hand is crude and vulgar as usual playing Adam's best friend. But he displays a sense of sympathy, affection and earnestness while playing the average-everyday slacker character for a change and manages to deliver a sensational and fulfilling performance. The meat and potatoes of this precious gem lies beneath Levitt and Rogen's irresistible and undeniable chemistry and their ability to establish a kinetic on-screen bromance. Being able to accomplish that shows how much potential these talented individuals have.The sharp and brainy script will have you bursting out with laughter and tears, and the influential messages about finding humor beneath pain, valuing the purposes of life and living everyday like it's your last will bring out joy to even the most careless people alive. The important life-lessons will challenge audiences-alike to go back and rethink their lives.A few scenes should have been left in the editing room, but it's still a genuine work of art and extreme geniusness that stands out as one of the more thoughtful films in recent years. Even though I'm yet to be diagnosed with cancer, ""50/50"" has come to mean a great deal to me and I urge anyone who isn't moved by the time the closing credits roll to check their pulse immediately.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Solid Final 20 Minutes, if You Can Get Through The First Hour and 20","I feel a bit guilty being a dissenting voice on 50/50, as it tackles such a serious subject matter, and a has a very likable lead character. But in the end, there just wasn't much substance to this piece, until the final few minutes, for me to really invest in it.Most of the material in the script is dealt with the slack, off-handed ""Dude, remember the time you got cancer? Yeah, sucked, huh?"" type of way.The film works so hard to not be serious or over-dramatic, that it winds up with almost no drama at all. When a serious moment does arise for the character, a pop tune is inserted into the soundtrack, to make sure we as the audience don't have to sit with the pain and confusion that the character is feeling. We can simply zone out for a bit, while we sway to the music.Now, I certainly wasn't expecting ""Terms of Endearment"", or a super-serious drama, but I also wasn't expecting the topic to be handled in such an incredibly frivolous, predictable, and frankly, sometimes boring manner.The film doesn't quite work as a drama, and even though there is a few genuinely funny moments, they are certainly not enough to sustain it as a comedy. The plot itself is fairly cliché and predictable. You'd have to have never watched a film before not to know just about every development that will come to pass; other than the eventual health outcome of the Levitt's character. But frankly, even that was tipped off to anyone who saw the weeks of promotion in the run-up to the film where Seth Rogan speaks about the film being based on a true story.What basically saves the film in the end is Joseph Gordon Levitt's likability factor, and a very strong performance by his mother, Angelica Houston, who unfortunately, didn't get more screen time. Had the film focused on that, it may have been stronger. Seth Rogan's character seems only to serve as a device for comic relief, to make sure we don't get too down.The last part of the film ends strong and hits all the emotional buttons (it would've made a great short), but the majority of the film is basically another arrested development story, with Rogan's character acting like the affable, 12-year old boy, providing his fair share of penis and weed jokes, that we've grown to love...or at least tolerate. This was surprising, after I'd heard so much talk about how different this character was from all his others.I'm sure it was very difficult, especially in today's filmmaking environment, to get a film about cancer made. This is likely why the director and writers tried to lighten it up whenever possible. But one can only dilute a potent cocktail so much before it simply gets too watered down to drink.Unfortunately, I will likely remember very little about this film, except for the end, which was handled quite well. For me, it just wasn't enough to make up for the insignificance of the first hour and twenty minutes.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite Funny and Moving!,"50/50 is probably the only movie I have ever seen that took a very serious topic such as cancer and turned it into a comedy or I should say dramedy. It works because there is a nice balance between laugh-out-loud comedy and very sad, serious moments. I laughed incredibly hard in some scenes and even shed a few tears in others. I liked the tone of the film because it has that off-beat, quirky, non-mainstream feeling to it.Jonathan Levine's film is about a 27-year-old guy who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Because of his disease, he truly finds out what kind of person he is thanks to all of his family and friends supporting him such as his wise-cracking friend, over-concerned mother, and his shy, quirky therapist.Joseph Gordon-Levitt certainly has his acting chops on hand. He proves he can still star in indie films such as this after appearing in big blockbusters like he did with Inception. He brought a certain charm to his role. I was surprised to see Seth Rogen in a movie like this. This is probably his best role he played to date. Anjelica Huston goes over-the-top as the freaked-out mother. Anna Kendrick is just the right person to play the therapist with her quirky personality.Overall, this is a very good film that brings out the lighter side of the disease. It has a central theme that suggests people to be optimistic in times of disease and peril. I'm glad they didn't make a very serious movie or I'll be shedding tears nonstop. Jonathan Levine has a great career ahead of him after this movie. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rogen's most mature film,"""50/50"" is a 2011 dramedy directed by Jonathan Levine starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen.
⚪
All in all, screenwriter Will Reiser has taken a tragic chapter of his own life and, with the help of Rogen and Levine, turned it into a light-hearted dramedy that finds the perfect balance between feel-good humour and sentimentality and sadness, both without letting it become too distastefully hilarious or utterly depressing. There are several films that depict this terrible disease and in the majority of them, it ends up as a heart-breaking, gut-wrenching drama, as it is only the natural consequence of how to deal with the situation. Hence, I was fascinated about the existence of this film. A comedy centred around a young men who has cancer? Is that even possible, especially if Seth Rogen produced it? As it turns out, it is completely different to the other works of the iconic comedian. The most important aspect that defines this film is that it doesn't deny the nastiness of cancer, but at the same time tries to show this serious issue from the more optimistic perspective. The basic tone of the film is of course sad, but the comedy aspect overshadows it most of the time and encourages the viewer to always look on the bright side of things and to not forget to laugh, something that in situations like this, is sadly forgotten. Another point that makes it so magnificent is how Point Grey Pictures, the production company of Rogen and Goldberg, managed to assemble an outstanding cast for its feature film debut. Aside from a splendid Gordon-Levitt who shares a weird but convincing chemistry with his co-star Rogen, we get future ""Pitch Perfect"" superstar Anna Kendrick as the unexperienced therapist, ""Jurassic World"" lead actress Bryce Dallas Howard as Adam's girlfriend and the one and only Morticia Addams herself, Anjelica Houston, as the caring mother. And you can bet that all of them perform wonderfully in their own way (Rogen isn't acting much, to be honest, so). All of them portray characters that couldn't be any more lifelike, likeable and sympathetic and they are one of the films biggest strengths. The other strength is the film's wonderfully build up plot, as it starts out rather humorous and cheerful, but becomes more and more serious and powerful the more it proceeds, all perfectly shown by JGL's marvellous performance that is defined by apathy which increasingly makes way for extreme emotions. I wasn't expecting a thoughtful film like this from the guys that made ""Superbad"" and the director of ""The Night Before"" - it is a sensitively narrated gem and by far the most mature entry into the oeuvre of Rogen. A personal tip for those who look for a sophisticated dramedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring,"'50/50' is a film that I really wanted to like but ultimately it was a complete bore and I struggled to watch it all.Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen, I had high hopes as I really like both the actors. I have nothing bad to say about their performances but throughout the film you just don't feel any emotional attachment to JGL and SR is kinda just there for cheap laughs (not really laugh out loud moments, just some things that'll make you smile).The plot is a delicate subject but doesn't really draw you in. There just isn't anything happening and I found myself looking at the clock (sign of a boring film). I certainly wouldn't class this as a comedy, it is just a drama that fails to deliver what it could have done.Overall I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend this film.

"Not a comedy, but not bad either","50/50 is about a man, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who discovers he has cancer and only has a 50/50 chance of surviving.The fact that his best friend, played by Seth Rogen, takes a prevalent place at his side on all advertising, might make people think that this is a comedy. It isn't. Sure, it has its lighter moments, but, ultimately, it's a drama. And it's quite a good one too.Cancer is affecting more and more people and the more the media can do to raise awareness is a good thing (my humble opinion). I watched Weeds (granted a comedy through and through) and a character got cancer in that and was basically better a few episodes later.50/50 tries to show, as best a light-hearted film can, about how cancer can affect relationships. It's not totally dark and nasty, as many cancer sufferers can sadly relate to. It tries to appeal to a wider audience.If you want something a bit serious, I'd recommend this (only the TV series Breaking Bad has dealt with cancer better in my opinion).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Also the joys of parenting add a real factor. A true story is brought out and sometimes thats what people need. Overall quite well executed and excellent performance by Levitt. Definitely recommended to those who haven't seen it. I am rating this movie 8/10 for its gentle humor, heart-warming element and the theme of friendship and truth evinced in this piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the finest films of the year,"Young radio writer Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is happily living his life when he is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Frustrated and gob-smacked, Adam tries to carry on with his life living with a disease that has a 50/50 chance of killing him. He lives with his selfish, self-centred girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is more fond of partying than looking after Adam's interests. Always there for him is his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), who is always on hand to provide medical marijuana, and his trainee psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick), while Adam's mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) has difficulty accepting it.Seth Rogen and his writing team have already blended comedy-drama with disease in the brilliant and vastly underrated Funny People (2009), which brought out an award-worthy performance by Adam Sandler. Yet where Sandler's characters' disease was a prop that would propel his character in re-evaluating his life and choices, in 50/50 it is the focal point. We follow Adam though every stage of his illness, from the emotional torment and confusion after his diagnosis, through to his chemo, to the final operation that may ultimately kill him. Screenwriter Will Reiser, who wrote the film based on his own experiences, beautifully juxtaposes the sad and profoundly moving along with the funny. It is more heavy on the drama than the comedy, but the film is still hilarious, mainly thanks to the supporting actors.Levitt is an extremely likable and hugely talented actor, and after years in independent cinema (starring in the likes of the wonderful Mysterious Skin (2004) and Brick (2005)), seems to be finally getting his deserved big break after the recent (500) Days of Summer (2009) and Inception (2010). Here he uses his every-man charisma to create a wholly believable nice-guy character. Ultimately though, the film belongs to Seth Rogen. He is surprisingly touching as the reliable best friend who can only communicate his affection with cock jokes and trying to get Adam laid. He also hates Rachael, and when he finds out that she is not putting out for Adam, he has possibly the best line of the whole film - ""if I was your girlfriend, I'd be sucking your cock right now!"".Anna Kendrick also does herself no harm, expertly playing cute and sweet, and one half of a potential romance that I was really rooting for. The fact that Adam may die before they have a chance adds to underlying sadness. With Levitt and Kendrick as the two players, 50/50's rom-com moments achieve far more in small doses than the majority of other rom-com's can only dream of reaching. Huston displays why she is still an acting powerhouse, with her concerned yet hard-as-nails mother stealing the few scenes she has.It is a film full of great performances, but special mention must also go to director Jonathan Levine, who keeps any technical flourishes to a bare minimum, allowing the actors to play out the fantastic script in front of a mainly hand-held camera. A wise decision, as the subject matter and the brilliance of the dialogue doesn't require flashy moments of quirkiness. He does, however, deliver an amusing and weirdly moving scene where Adam, stoned from his cancer-buddies 'special' macaroons, wanders down a hospital corridor in slow-motion, giggling at everything he sees, which includes people in various stages of their cancer and a dead body.One of the best comedies of the decade, and one of the finest films of the year. 50/50 can sit alongside those other modern greats from Rogen and his gang - Superbad, Knocked Up (both 2007) and Funny People. Powerful, uplifting, hilarious, sad and extremely moving - it is not often that a film can achieve so much in such a subtle way.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Rogen Ruins It,"What could have been a low-key, extra-special slice of life story (featuring as it does a extra-special performance by the always extra-special JGL)is ruined by the unbelievable and crass performance of Seth Rogen who destroys any believability or good-will the story has built up every time he appears on screen. Movie-makers have got to realize a little bit of this fat-friend-with-the-dirty-mind-and-mouth-to-match goes a long way. Rogen has out-stripped his meager talents and worn out his welcome by now, and throwing such a putrid character in such a heart-warming story is a major mistake. Everyone else plays it on a realistic level - Anna Kendrick is wonderful as the therapist-in-training, and Anjelica Houston - well, what can I say? Joseph Gordon-Levitt positively lights up the screen every time he appears, but all too often he appears with the woefully charisma-challenged Rogen and, well, the movie and JGL's performance suffer accordingly.",,Anonymous,Romance
A movie that will touch you for the rest of your life!,"Know a lot of us know (unfortunately) what it's like to feel when we get diagnosed with something we didn't expect, not necessarily cancer.. but it shocks us and some go through a deep and troublesome process. I did for my IBS and it's caused by my stress. I too wouldn't have the best sessions with a therapist and soon went through the alienation faze. I was so depressed until I realized how some friends could help I and how much I could help myself..This movie really shows that along with so much more! The movie is heart-warming and for a majority of the last half hour is very depressing, thanks to the superb acting by the talented Joseph Gordon Levitt! He really shines as does the entire supporting cast! It's a mixed bag of emotions, with a slight upbeat comedic touch due to Seth Rogen and his amazing portray of a dumb ignorant, slightly horny friend(a friend who well can relate to), but has a good heart.Everything in this movie is very well done and I would recommended it to everyone!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie of the Life!!!,"There are many movies we see that come and pass by like a wind near the ocean. But there are movies that don't leave an impact on you but introduce you to the way of life. The jagged mysteries of our lives which appear bad, disagreeable, horrible, nauseating and sickening on a normal day suddenly appear delectable, ethereal, delightful and diaphanous after being introduced to a master piece like this.The world gives us the opportunities to get a life but we all choose to take the unprecedented path to show how unique and different we are. This remains true to people trying to lead a normal life as well (just like the guy in the movie did). But the truth lies in the fact that we all trying to make a difference (or looking for a different approach to a problem) is a sign of us being ordinary beings. We all die after all.The work of the screenplay writer is just too good. Timing is the key to this motion picture. It surely brings watery chemical (highly malignant in the presence of someone and benign alone ;)) in the eyes of the viewer. Trust me on this one but i have got to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the only man i know who could have done justice to this man who underwent the misery alone although he had all his dear ones behind him without his knowledge. I just wish that all the loved ones be not just behind an ailing man but also beside the person who need not necessarily have to go through so much for your Kind Attention. Mourning for loved ones is easier than being with them through thick and thin.May lord have mercy on all!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Equal parts humor and melodrama combine for a decent flick about a young man living with a cancer diagnosis,"This is a well thought out well executed movie. Joseph Gordon Levitt's character is a boy scout of a person who doesn't smoke, drink or even walk across the street unless the traffic signal is green. Despite this behavior he gets cancer and is given the titular 50/50 chance of survival. So begins a fine balancing act between heart warming comedy and weepy, tear inducing melodrama. There are some cries and some chuckles along the way. The movie steers clear of the really deep, dark, depressive places that one might dwell. This whole endeavor has that 'Average Joe' sort of feel that really works for this narrative. Seth Rogen does an excellent job as the slacker best friend who embraces his friend's plight but also isn't above trying to use his condition to score with the ladies. The only part of the story that is hokey and flimsy is the love story. Within seconds of meeting all the players you know exactly how the love story angle will turn out and the part played by Bryce Dallas Howard seems more caricature than actual character. This is mostly a good story though that quite deftly walks the line between the sadness and hardship of such an endeavor while also capturing the humor that still remains even in the face of death.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The film balances humor and genuine emotions.,"50/50 is not a typical tearjerker. Instead, it's a funny and heartfelt portrayal of a young man named Adam, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is diagnosed with cancer. The film skillfully balances humor and genuine emotions. Gordon-Levitt's performance as Adam captures the complexities of navigating fear and frustration. Seth Rogen provides comic relief without trivializing the seriousness of the situation. Anjelica Huston shines as Adam's concerned mother. While the movie doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of cancer, it also finds humor in unexpected moments. Ultimately, 50/50 is a touching story about friendship, resilience, and finding joy in life's toughest moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's at times like these, you know the people who you can actually depend on.The movie is mainly carried forward by the two brilliant leads, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who takes care of the drama, and Seth Rogen, who takes care of the comic relief.

50/50 2011 Review,"""50/50"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bruce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston, and many more, and is directed byJonathan Levine. Jonathan is known for his work in ""Long Shot"" and ""Warm Bodies"", which are both incredible films, but this is one of his older projects, as this came out in 2011. This film is about a man named Adam, who works in radio, he's very healthy, and he recycles a lot. He is dating a girl named Racheal, and is very close with is best friend Kyle. But Adam seems to have very painful back aches every now and then, and when he goes to check with a doctor, it is later revealed that he suffers from a spinal tumour, which unfortunately gives him cancer. But he has a fifty percent chance of survival. So Adam seeks help from his friends, and a therapist named Katherine, who is 24.This film, was so hilarious, but also very tragic in many ways. Never did this film become to funny, nor overly sad. This film never drags, even when Adam is just lying on the couch, it never feels boring, there's always something happening, wether is was emotionally, physically, etc. As an audience, you really feel that this person is irritated with this illness very much, he can no longer do things that he could do before life sleeping with women, he didn't even have the chance to get his driver's license. This man is torn to his core. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the best part of this film, this was by far his most underrated role, and one his best roles, if not his best role. Obviously one of the most hilarious scenes in the film are whenever Adam hangs out with Kyle. Kyle cares very much for Adam. He takes him to his appointments, he takes him out to cheer him up, they even smoke weed. He is the most hilarious part of the film no doubt, and Seth Rogen portrays the character so well. Racheal, who was Adam's former girlfriend, really isn't s good girlfriend at all whatsoever. She was never there for Adam when he desperately needed him, she never took care of him, and there's one major thing that she did, but I won't go into that as it contains heavy spoilers. And Katherine, was probably the most positive part of the film. She's a 24 year old therapist, and you first see her you directly know that she's obviously new to this, as Adam was her third patient thus far. She always tries to enlighten this man, who is trying to stay calm most of the time, but when he has a breakdown in front of this girl, who is really trying to help him, who really does care about Adam, it's heartbreaking. She is always there when he needs her for anything, she gives him rides home, she loves this patient, and Adam loves her.I would highly recommend this film for people who want to be humoured, or for people who enjoy upbeat but serious films. This movie has no flaws that bring this down. This is never a boring movie, and all the performances in this film are incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very Precise,"A film that seems very true and honest to every circumstance that's going on within the film as well as all the emotions anyone would go through if one was afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance. I won't speak for people that have been afflicted with that unfortunate circumstance and who have beat it.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor in the sense that he can switch it up real well playing the white trash guy, the hessian metalhead, or just your regular likable joe as he does in 500 Days of Summer and this film. He plays about half his roles like this film, so you would think you're just seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing himself which is sort of the case, however he goes so deep within the circumstances that he's in, that no matter how similar the character may be from film to film, there is always a distinct difference in the character because again, he goes so deep within the circumstances of what is happening to that particular character he's playing.That is very good acting. To be able to switch it up on one hand and play completely different characters like he did in Hesher, Looper, Don Jon and Killshot, but then at the same time to play similar type characters as he did in 500 Days of Summer and this film, and to still give that feeling that he's someone else in each of these films. He's an amazing actor.And one has to love Seth Rogen, he's so funny. He always brings a different side of humanity to these types of films as he also did with Funny People. Rogen brings true sincere honesty and laughter in the worst of situations to where you don't see Rogen as being a person who lacks compassion, but as a person who has a lot of compassion to give in the only way he knows how to give it. Very good film all around, a good cry at times, and one to remember.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Drama, Comedy Split 50/50","50/50 is the anti-MOW. Hot off the festival circuit as the much buzzed-about ""cancer comedy,"" its hype doesn't tell the whole story. Directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness), 50/50 is a dynamic blend of offhand humor and compelling character study. Just don't go in expecting one or the other.Loosely based on his own experiences as a twenty-something cancer survivor, screenwriter Will Reiser assembles a flawed cast of characters for his retelling – himself most of all. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is not a take-charge kind of guy. He greets his diagnosis with cynicism and reclusiveness, and at his age who can blame him? Holding his life at arm's length, he severs ties rather than strengthening them.It's a notion that Levine actually undercuts. Whether it's his direction or just the conventions of a hero-narrative, Adam frequently comes off better than he deserves to. His cancer gives him carte blanche to abuse and ignore his friends and family, and it's important that those unflattering traits get their due. The cathartic climax is about tearing down those walls.Levine is more forthcoming with the foibles of other characters. Seth Rogen plays Adam's pal Kyle, a predictably crass and outgoing foil to Gordon-Levitt's narcissistic introvert. Adam's girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes away looking particularly ugly, and is admonished by Kyle in one of 50/50's funniest scenes. Anjelica Huston and Anna Kendrick play Adam's overprotective mother and fledgling therapist, respectively, and Philip Baker Hall makes an appearance as a fellow cancer patient with an affinity for pot.Rounding out the cast is Serge Houde as Adam's Alzheimer's-afflicted father. Unlike Adam however, his condition seems superfluous, occasionally lending 50/50 the maudlin air of an issue film. Which is odd, because elsewhere the filmmakers strive to remove sentimentality from the equation. In fact, the nitty-gritty of Adam's treatment is relegated almost entirely to off-screen action. The film focuses instead on the impact it has on his life. Consequently, and in the interest of levity, the threat is diluted.In that respect, 50/50 isn't even about cancer. The common storytelling mistake, as Reiser sees it, is treating the disease as subject; Reiser's subject is himself. Cancer is just the shitty thing that happened to him. The film begins like any other buddy comedy, and initially feels stilted because of it. Even the obligatory reveal and diagnosis of the disease comes across awkward. But it gradually builds into something significant.The beauty of 50/50 is in the way its characters behave and bounce off each other. There's no bromance a la I Love You, Man – the friendship portrayed by Gordon-Levitt and Rogen is subtler. Adam's eventual turn from reticence to reliance makes his transformation as a character more compelling than his struggle with cancer. After all, it's not about that.I don't envy the marketing team tasked with selling 50/50 to the general audience. Cancer isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser, but you can't bill it as a comedy without being at least a little disingenuous. Resier and Levine's film delivers a unique hybrid of emotion and entertainment that tries, not always successfully, to pave new territory – which is admirable in and of itself. Whether 50/50 is remembered more as a cavalier drama or dark comedy remains to be seen, but you can bet it won't go down in history as another after school special.",,Anonymous,Romance

"A very good, balanced movie.","I dunno why, but I expected 50/50 to be a good movie, and gladly I wasn't disappointed at all. This movie is great for two reasons: First, it deals with a tough subject(cancer) in a realistic way. It does not try to depress the viewer, or make fun of cancer. Instead, it takes the middle road, smoothly balancing between drama and humor. And it succeeds doing that.The second thing that makes this movie good is Joseph Gordon Levitt. While Seth Rogen is kinda in his usual role(which works great in the humor department) Gordon Levitt provides the real ""guts"" of this movie. His low- key acting and ordinary, imperfect character is great and allows us to easily identify with him. You believe his sadness, happiness, and charm. He's one of today's most versatile actors in my opinion. Anyway, I highly recommend 50/50..there's a 80/100 chance you'll like it (;",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"50/50 Is a Pretty Good Way to Describe My Reaction to This Movie -- Half Liked It, Half Didn't","""50/50"" was marketed as a buddy movie, but those going into it with that expectation are bound to be disappointed.Seth Rogen does play best friend to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a young man who's diagnosed with a rare and vicious type of cancer, but he has relatively little screen time and the film isn't about their relationship. Rather, it's about Gordon-Levitt's life and attitudes in general post-diagnosis, and the effect the possibility of his impending mortality has on his love life, relationship with his mother (Anjelica Huston), etc. I'm actually glad it steered clear of many of the ""young-person-dying"" clichés that can make movies like this so dreary. But it's not an entirely successful movie either, aiming for a black comedy that the screenplay doesn't pull off. In fact, the writing is the film's biggest problem; too many scenes feel too implausible, and while I don't necessarily relish wallowing in grimness for grimness' sake, the ending felt entirely too happy and pat to be believable.On the other hand, the movie has some strong things to recommend it, notably the performances of Gordon-Levitt, one of the most talented and underrated young actors currently working, and Anna Kendrick, who delivers a sparkling turn as Gordon-Levitt's therapist.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Smile. Cry. Feel grateful you don't have cancer.,"Cancer is probably the most egregious of all diseases. Once the doctor proclaims those doomed words, it becomes a sword hanging over your head with the rope getting burnt every minute. That leads to redemption, as shown in movies, and acts as a catharsis; I vent to let it all out, now that you know that the clock is going to chime soon. This theme has been frequently exploited by films. Hindi movies like Anand did it, Japanese ones like Ikiru has been there too. Heck, even Hollywood served it through Funny People, The Bucket List and a plethora of others. And then came 50/50.Staking someone's chances of survival or death at 50/50 is the worst thing you could do to a dying man. At 90/10 he knows he is a goner. At 60/40, he still knows he is a goner. But at 50/50, he will only be a goner if lady-luck decides to screw him. And that glimmer of hope, is torture most unbearable. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a twenty-seven year-old, who does things every twenty-seven year-old is expected to do - jog, not smoke or drink, obey traffic rules, not force his girlfriend into having intercourse and work honestly. Does any of that look like a cause for cancer? Hence, it comes as a bolt from the blue for him, when a rather sadistic, heartless wretch of a doctor blurts out in the most unsubtle way imaginable 'It's a malignant tumour.' Blur out, start music, life in slo-mo - Adam walking through the crowd in a daze, Adam reading about neurofibrosarcoma schwannoma online, Adam travelling in a bus staring outside the window and Adam breaking the news to his girlfriend - end music. He then tells about it to his closest, and apparently only, friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) who reacts by saying that he wants to throw up. Finally, he tells his paranoid mother, who has enough on her plate managing her husband who suffers from Alzheimer's.Adam then enters mental therapy with a twenty-four year-old nearly-a- doc, Katherine (Anna Kendrick). He makes new friends at the cancer centre, takes drugs for the first time, shaves his head entirely, and learns to cope with life with the help of Kyle, who constantly insists on him getting laid, along with coping with the pain of his girlfriend cheating on him and them breaking up, before finally undergoing a make- it or break-it surgery.Here is a a problem with that story - it is predictable. The idea, per se, isn't bold or daringly original - it is used, hackneyed and washed up. If you want to impress your new girl by predicting the future, you should take her to the film and keep saying what is likely to happen next, because it does happen that way. Even with the look in her eyes, you know Adam's girlfriend is going to break up sooner or later. Judging by the relation between the two, you know that Adam and Katherine are sooner or later going to have something between them (Dying Young, anyone?). You know Adam is going to do things he has never done before - like taking drugs, driving a car or burning a painting. Adam makes two friends at the cancer centre, and you know that someone is going to die. These aren't spoilers; these are events that you know are indubitably going to occur in the film.But, here is the worst of all - the tagline of the film, as it proudly proclaims on the poster, is 'It takes a pair to beat the odds.' Past this point, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what happens in the end.If you forgive the movie for that not-so-little-blunder it does make a rather enjoyable and emotional watch. By making the character of Adam so morose, pitiful and submissive even, it justs makes you want him not to die, which creates an emotional attachment between the viewers and the protagonist; a must for a film of this genre. He is a good man, but cancer has the tendency of always picking the good guys. The film brings forth a plethora of sentimental moments, that thankfully aren't mawkish - the way he responds to the doc's cold-hearted tumour statement, portraying the initial impression of mocking disbelief, but you can see the smile fading as the doctor pronounces his death like a radio broadcast, Adam learning about his girlfriend's betrayal, him being wheeled in for surgery after longingly hugging his mother - all deeply touching and heart-rendering, especially so because Adam doesn't deserve it.What is interesting is the interplay of colours imposed in the movie. The colour scheme of each scene varies with Adam's emotions. The screen has yellow as the dominant colour when Adam tells about his condition to his girlfriend and mother. It is white and bright when Adam is relatively happy, when with Katherine and in the company of Kyle. The palette changes to a darker shade of yellow when he is alone and depressed. These subtle changes, are not only wonderfully done, but also elevate the feeling of morbidity and joy.The background track, despite being used infrequently, works wonders for the movie. It plays a role similar to the colours, and strikes a resonating chord. Both the lead performances are adroitly delivered - Adam as the morbid cancer-inflict and Kyle as the ebullient friend-in- need. It is heartening to see Kyle maturing from a get-drunk-get-laid guy to a person who cares, drives his friend to the hospital and reads 'Facing Cancer Together.' In a similar way, it his heartening to see Adam smile through his pain and sorrows. Sadly, 50/50 adds plenty of characters that serve no major purpose whatsoever, instead of leaving it as just an Adam-and-Kyle show.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not a surprise, but love it!","From the very beginning of the film, I guessed what is going to be happen at the end. So, it wasn't a surprise to me, but anyway, I love happy endings! Either way, as this was based on a true story, someone's experience, where the person beat the cancer, I doubt if there is any alternate ending where he doesn't. It would make no sense. My favorite scene was probably the one where Adam finds Kyle's book on helping someone who's going through an illness. The other favorite scene was the one, which Adam was shaving his head. On the other hand, while most of the people found the therapist-patient relationship not ethic, I liked the energy between them, it isn't violated in this film, I think. Because I am a person, who is of the opinion that love is great. Also, this kind of story needs a bit romance. So, I loved this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thoroughly Enjoyed,"I was quite hesitant about watching this film as comedy and terminal illness are two things I wouldn't expect to mix very well. However, the names involved pulled me in and I actually thought it was beautiful.Gordon-Levitt is your average man who discovers that he has cancer and that his chances of survival are 50/50. The film follows his attempts to cope with his illness, his struggles with his treatment and the difficulties these two elements cause between him and his loved ones. Gordon-Levitt handles the serious of the illness, and portrays a sweet, vulnerable character that's irresistible to the audience whilst Kendrick, the psychiatrist he goes to to help him through this awful time, takes the edge of with her lovable awkwardness. This means that you don't feel guilty for being amused when Rogen delivers his vulgar belly laughs as Gordon-Levitt's best friend who has good intentions but is in denial about how serious his friend's condition is.It's a different, sensitive story for the comedy world that is carefully handled and brilliantly told.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"50/50 Four Young Actors, Showing Why Their At The Top Of Their Class","50/50 is a truly extraordinary movie. This is a mini-masterpiece that is as thoughtful and compelling as it is funny and real. Written by Will Reiser and directed by Jonathan Levine 50/50 faces the emotional devastation of cancer as well the physical ravages of chemotherapy with the perfect mixture of pathos, wit and compassion, steering away from melodrama. This is clearly no accident as our protagonist Adam, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt starts the conversation with his mother about his potentially lethal diagnosis by asking her if she was familiar with ""Terms Of Endearment."" Mr. Gordon-Levitt appears in virtually every frame of the movie allowing us to see the confusion, pain, fear and virtually every other possible emotion without letting us feel pity for this kind, rather unremarkable young man. Adam innocently makes an appointment with a doctor to find out why the pain in his back won't go away, only to find that that he has a large malignant tumor pressing on his vertebrae. In a state of shock he begins the process of hopeful healing, including ""chemo,"" hence the famous head shaving scene. The scenes when he is receiving the chemotherapy are shared with Philip Baker Hall as Alan, a fellow cancer patient. These hospital scenes could easily have been a devise for gallows humor or cornball father/son wisdom, but instead Adam and his Alan make easy conversation and Alan introduces his younger friend to the joys of medicinal marijuana.Adam's support group is led by his best (and seemingly only) friend Kyle, played to understated perfection by the wonderful Seth Rogen (who is also one of the producers of the film) and his less-than-supportive girlfriend Rachel played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who earlier this summer played another unsympathetic role in ""The Help."" Anna Kendrick plays Adams young psychologist Katherine, who is actually the female equivalent to Adam. She is nervous, shy timid and loveably unsure of herself, Ms. Kendrick burst on the scene in the wonderful ""Up In The Air,"" going step for step with George Clooney, and she does not fail to live up to those expectations. She is all sweetness and light and exudes an unparalleled sense innocent charm.Anjelica Huston appears as Adam's overbearing mother, but plays her role with the same subtlety as the rest of the young cast. It would have been so easy to go over-the-top as the prototypical Freudian cliché nightmare ""mother-from-hell."" She is a woman dealing with her own tragedy as the sole caretaker of her Alzheimer-stricken husband (Serge Houde), when she learns of her son's illness. adding burden on top of burden. She is far more to be pitied, than scorned. Ms. Huston is as wonderful as you'd expect her to be.Most of the movie relies on the chemistry between Rogan's Kyle and Gordon-Levitt's Adam. They truly deliver, without a single reference to the unfortunate term ""bromance."" This is a wonderfully, subtle, nuanced, deeply thoughtful piece of filmmaking. Bravo.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Friendship, love, laughs  and survival","This was pretty good, but I guess because I'd heard so much about it when it first came out I was expecting more. I was also severely distracted by the fact that this was filmed in Vancouver (subbing as Seattle) so that I kept thinking things like; where's the cemetery in Stanley park? Nice day for a jog under Lions Gate bridge. Anyways that's just me.There are several humorous moments along the way as Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to keep Adam's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) spirits up through his 50/50 survival rate cancer diagnosis, his treatment, subsequent pot smoking and loss of his bee-atch of a girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard). She is very good in those types of roles.Adam is a pretty dull, dry character, the one scene that he got me in however was right before he goes in for his surgery and he's so scared, turning to his mother for comfort. Very raw. I also liked Anna Kendrick as the bumbling therapist. Great cast here. 12/25/13 ""I'm peeing right now."" That line cracked me up.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting Take,"50/50 (2011) is a different take of a serious drama (with mixed comedic elements) from Seth Rogen. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is heartbreaking yet understated as twenty-something cancer sufferer Adam, though at many times his character comes off as completely unlikable which makes it hard to root for him.Though within the film, Seth Rogen's as the best friend Kyle steals majority of the film with his typical wise cracks and Seth Rogen type humor. I can understand many people disliking his character but there is a certain charm to it, and his character elevates the film.50/50 has been praised for its serious topic surrounding cancer and the method in which the film goes about it. Although the film is predictable (in the end), it is quite an interesting take.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a hidden gem!,"I think this film features Seth Rogen's (Kyle) best acting and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Adam) was as solid as ever. I really enjoy this movies tempo and atmosphere right from the very beginning. The characters are great with a self-centered but surprisingly caring best friend. A comfortable, but using girlfriend. An emotionally struggling mother held a distance. An extremely cute, nervous, up and coming psychologist and two older friends that share similar events. This movie never slows or dulls out. It shows the strength of people who struggle and how they cope and how the coping becomes easier with all of the right people in place. This movie has Adam discover other sides to people he has known and loved. It also shows us that love is not always where you look for it and how it sparks up under the worst of circumstances. An excellent movie that is entirely underrated!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overrated, but certainly has it's moments","Seeing this movie reverted me back to when I saw '(500) Days of Summer,' and not just because Joesph Gordon-Leavitt headlines both. When I went to see 'Days,' my expectations were inflated because of all the buzz I had been hearing, which ultimately left mem a little disappointed when it didn't meet them. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the film, but I didn't fall in love with like everyone else. The same thing happened with this film, I enjoyed it for the most part, but still had my reservations.I'll start with what I liked, mainly, Joseph Gordon-Leavitt. He really puts this film on his back and delivers a great performance. He's funny when he has to me, and believable when he's playing a dramatic role. The more I see him on screen, the more I'm convinced he's blossoming into one of the finest young actors of his generation. Anna Kendrick, who plays the naive therapist, really establishes great chemistry with JGL, and the two play off each other very well. Seth Rogen, while he really does just play Seth Rogen in every film, has his best role I've seen him in, meaning he is only he doses (one can only fathom so much Seth Rogen.) And the story, for the most part, is meaningful and realistic (the screenwriter based it on actual circumstances), never falling into Hollywood clichés and melodrama, which is refreshing.As for my criticisms, I have a few. Too much of the film's humor relied on juvenile jokes. Maybe it has something to do with the film's serious material, but no one ever seems to have a problem with the constant sex-jokes, which grew old fast. Bryce Dallas Howard's character, the 'bad' girlfriend (what else?), didn't seem to move the story further and acted very one-dimensional. Her not being in the movie at all would of been a benefit, allowing more time for the growth between the otherwise interesting characters.But the good outweighs the bad here, and it's an enjoyable, if not somewhat forgettable, little movie worth seeing if you have some free time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50 completely,"Well, 50/50 is the way I felt after watching it. Not bad, but not good. Not amazing, but not frustrating. Half comedy, half drama.Written by Will Reiser and based on his life, I think that the movie fails badly first of all because this attempt to mix drama and comedy using a so difficult illness as cancer is something that naturally takes it to inevitable cliché moments.Then you have all the main cast performing the same again. Joseph being that suffering personification as in (500) Days Of Summer (2009); Seth Rogen being that boring and over the top ""funny"" character that tries to make people laugh and forget that it's a drama; Bryce Dallas acting as the same selfish girl; Anna Kendrick the same insecure and enthusiast as in Up In The Air (2009); Angelica Houston the same old mother. And none of them giving a truly and brilliant performance.And the result is the same movie about cancer and its difficulties of surviving. Javier Barden did it. Meryl Streep did it. Susan Sarandon did it. Michael Keaton, Emma Thompson, Debra Winger... and the list goes on. This is just another one. It seems honest, but it's cheesy instead, trying hard to be something. There are a few funny moments, but none of them for Seth Rogen's hard efforts. And a few tear moments for the right using of impacting scenes and score.That's it and only, a movie to be watched on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

I give 50/50 more than a 50/50 chance to have movie staying power!,"Due to my over 50 certifiable corny puns that I insert in my film reviews, there will be most probably more than a 50/50 chance that you will find my review of the new comedy-drama ""50/50"" very ""repunant"". See what I mean! Anyways, let me cut to the chase. ""50/50"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam, a Seattle radio journalist who in his mid 20's is diagnosed with a form of spinal cancer; too ""syllabistic"" to pronounce. Adam, as anyone would be, is first stricken back with his diagnosis and even though he maintains his resiliency is still internally profoundly hurt with the situation. He finds some sort of zany support from his best friend Kyle, who is with Adam through the cancer battle, but actually uses Adam's sickness to meet beautiful women. Kyle is portrayed by Seth Rogen, who ironically enough lived his Kyle role when supporting best friend Will Reiser through his cancer ordeal a few years ago. And Reiser even rose up through the challenge and wrote the ""50/50"" screenplay. Adam's girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) does her best (or better her worst) to support Adam through the ordeal. Adam does get mental aide from a perky newbie psychiatrist Katherine played by Anna Kendrick. Adam also receives some ""I am there with you"" support from a couple of older cancer patients Alan (Phillip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Brewer) who share chemistry and chemotherapy with Adam. The legendary Angelica Houston portrays Adam's overbearing but loving mother Diane. What makes ""50/50"" primarily work as a medication for narrative dullness are the eccentric characters in the film, and Reiser's witty screenplay in authentically balancing out the gravity of the situation with respectful comedic doses. All of the performances get a first-rate diagnosis especially the under-appreciated Gordon-Levitt and the alluring Kendrick; I was psyched up mentally and physically in their scenes together. Rogen was his usual ""rogenish"" but was the film's primary comic relief. And I could live to forever to watch Phillip Baker Hall performances. I am glad that Director Jonathan Levine stayed alive with the ""50/50"" project because the director usually has more than 50% accountability on a movie's success or failure; and in this case it was more of the former than the latter. ""50/50"" is a movie I could view more than 50 times, and the percentage shows that you will second that notion. I hope there is more than a 50/50 chance you will see this gem as soon as possible. ***** Excellent",,Anonymous,Romance

Outstanding tale of survival and friendship,"Let me start by saying that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as well as the rest of the cast and production team, deserved many more accolades for their work in this film. Recently, more films have been mixing and bending genres. 50/50 delivers a strong mixture of comedy and drama, never verging on weepy Oscar-bait or immature comedy. It is a difficult task to find some comedy to counter balance Cancer, but writer Will Reiser draws appropriately from his own experiences of illness and with friend Seth Rogen, co-star and producer, to ensure that the story moves along organically and smoothly.Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines as Adam, never letting the character have a dull moment. His chemistry with Seth Rogen and the other supporting characters (Anna Kendrick and Anjelica Huston, to name a few) builds on the strong screenplay. Be forewarned, the movie is probably not for everyone, (Seth Rogen even spoke once regarding some people being taken aback by the cancer theme present in a somewhat comedic form) it's definitely a winner. Too bad the major awards looked past this one (although it did receive two Golden Globe nominations).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly touching and funny movie about a delicate subject,"I was a little skeptical about this film before watching it, I suspected the high ratings might be because of the subject matter (sensitive subjects such as cancer always seem to get high ratings, regardless of the actual worthiness of the film). But in this case I was wrong, and was in for a good surprise. The seriousness of the subject was balanced with humour in just the right amount. The acting by Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick was outstanding; and Rogen, whom I normally avoid like the plague, gave a surprisingly honest and deep performance. The film deals with many issues related to serious illnesses such as cancer, especially in how friends, acquaintances and relatives react to the patient, and also how the patient deals with it all. Definitely an emotional film, and definitely worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
sensitive and delightful,"This is a sensitive and delightful portrayal of a young man's fight against the big C, Cancer. Gordon-Levitt has back problem and he finds out that he has cancerous growth in his spinal cord. Rogen is his close friend who helps him in these trying times. However, he also uses him for getting laid himself. Anna Kendrick is the psychotherapist who counsels Levitt and slowly begins falling for him. Philip Baker Hall is an old cancer patient whom Levitt meets in the hospital. Angelica Houston plays his mother who has her hands full what with a husband who is suffering from Alzheimer's and a son recently diagnosed with cancer. The acting is great all round with Levitt and Rogen outperforming every one else due to their great chemistry and fantastic characters. Rogen gets to mouth some very hilarious lines. The direction is very balanced and Levine never makes this an over the top sentimental affair. The travails of a person who has just learnt he has cancer are shown in a realistic manner.I liked it quite a bit. In Hindi movies, the cancer patient is shown as a hero who is running around, uniting lovers and shaking his ass at weddings. Wish the Hindi film makers could learn something from a movie like this. 3.5 out of 5 for 50/50.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not what the advertisements made it out to be, but so much more","I went into 50/50 thinking it would be just a movie poking fun at cancer with him trying to use his cancer prognosis to pick up chicks but that's more or less just his friend trying to force him into that and not Joseph Gordon Levitt's character really into it at all. The story is about a young man in his 20's who gets unexpected news from his doctor that he has cancer. All the while he has a girlfriend who if it wasn't for the cancer news probably wouldn't have stayed with him so she's not really there for him and is a very selfish individual.

You Won't Quite Know How To Feel...And Perhaps That's The Point,"While watching ""50/50"", I had the strange experience of being an ""outsider looking in"" at the events transpiring on the screen. Having never battled cancer myself, I found it difficult to make any judgement on the actions.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. As he struggles to cope with the diagnosis & treatment of his disease, he is ""helped along"" (in a variety of different ways) by a greenhorn therapist (Anna Kendrick), his smothering mother (Anjelica Huston), and his ""best bud"" (Seth Rogen).There are times when this movie seems downright ridiculous and seems to veer from any coherent narrative. However, there are also moments that will bring tears to your eyes. It is a very strange flick in that sense.The reason for the strange-ness? The crazy collection of characters present. Levitt himself proves me than capable of carrying the show, and his relationship with ""Kendrick"" provides probably the best moments in the film. But then there are the auxiliary cast, who you will alternately hate and appreciate in equal doses. I'm usually a fan of complex characters, but in ""50/50"" I would actually use the word ""uneven"" to describe them.Thus, I have to give this film a middle-of-the-road rating for now (perhaps at some other point in my life I will appreciate it more/less). It's like those personality tests you take in college that ask you to rate something on a ""scale of 1-5"". When you aren't quite sure how you feel, you give it a three.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Satisfyingly realistic,"Ok i guess I'm or was on a rom-com spree. But this hit hard.Joseph Gordon Levitt starring 50/50 turns out to be a solid movie with equal amounts of humor, realism and despair. The realism depicted is pretty fresh. Certain character scenes done are exactly how you'd react when someone you care about gets hurt. How one can be ignorant to be the people who care them. Anna Kendrik is in this and she's just adorable and she's a med student so thats an automatic win for me. Wish we could have had a bit more of her. The death and that despair has been handled perfectly it makes you cry at the perfect moments. Joseph Gordon Levitt really made me think what would happen if I were in that situation and how I'd have to handle it.Seth Rogen is equal part good and equally on the nose but he provides a good balance to the movie.Yeah, this movie is pretty good.

Definitely a Go-See,"At first I didn't know what the climate of this film would be. It co-stars Seth Rogan but I didn't know if it would be OK to laugh. It's about cancer but I didn't know how I would end up feeling. Well, it felt real. And it WAS OK to laugh. Matter fact, the movie covers the topic of cancer in a revolutionary way. We feel the gravity of the disease, the toll it takes on all those affected, the uncertainty of the prognosis. Yet, we also get to be silly, to laugh, to make jokes, to LIVE through this with the antagonist. Rogan and Joseph Gordon-Levitt work very well together. The story-line is smart, the script is engaging, the laughs aren't contrived. It's just a good overall movie. And it's one where we don't really know what's going to happen with Gordon-Levitt's character until it all happens.

It's Okay...,"This film is not great; it is good for a laugh and some touching moments, but it is flawed in several ways. There are several moments that taint the atmosphere of the film and keep it from being great or even very good.1) The performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt was slightly unbelievable. He never shows his true emotion in the film. Are you telling me that after all of the tragedy that strikes him, he doesn't ever cry? 2) Product placement. HOLY CRAP! This movie was practically a commercial! Swiffer, Apple, Prius, and North Face were all shoved down my throat in this film.3) The humor was forced at times. It featured too many sophomoric sex jokes and pop culture references. That said, there were some genuinely hilarious moments to partially redeem the film.To me, these make the movie feel less touching than it purports itself to be. This movie is a crowd-pleaser, Hollywood comedy that tries to balance regular jokes and personal tragedy. I don't think it succeeds in being great in either respect, but it is funny and deeply touching sometimes. It can be predictable and easy to understand, two aspects which aren't present in its antagonist, cancer. Watch it if you aren't particularly critical of films or if you don't expect a realistic portrayal of cancer patients.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

50/50 (2011) - That Head Trimming Scene was Hilarious!,"After a highly acclaimed critical buzz, ""50/50"" was introduced as a comedy about cancer, and it's heartbreaking effects. But, let me just say, that this movie is really laugh-out-loud funny. But, most of all, this is actually a heartwarming and dramatic tale, with a giant heart. This is one of the best movies of the previous year of 2011. With a well-written and heartwarming script by Will Reiser, which is based partially on his own personal experiences, ""50/50"" really shows how comedy and drama can mash up together, and it can make a really special film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers another winning screen performance as Adam Lerner, a 27-year old who surprisingly gets cancer, and now everyone is trying to help him out, from his gorgeous and unexplainable girlfriend, portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, and his over-protective mother, portrayed brilliantly by Anjelica Huston. Anna Kendrick is just clear perfect as Katie, an unexperienced therapist who helps Adam during his rough time. The next thing we know, a real connection starts to grow during their daily sessions. Seth Rogen is just flat-out-funny, but just because we see this guy as a high pothead, that does not mean he can't also do drama. This guy has a big heart, and he's always there for Adam. Philip Baker Hall has his best and funny scenes playing Adam's fellow patient. The casting ensemble is just superb in this movie. Nearly everything in this movie is a mark of pure brilliance. The casting is brilliant, the script is well-written, the message is touching, the laughs are hilarious, and the drama is real. Directed brilliantly by Jonathan Levine, ""50/50"" really shows the true meaning of life itself, and it shows the fear that this could be the last day of your life. From the opening scenes to the end credits, ""50/50"" is one of the most heartwarming, dramatic, and comedic movies of this or any other year. The script, the cast, and the movie itself is perfect in every way. ""50/50"", in my review, ""a hilarious and heartwarming tale that impresses"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good!,7.5/10 I watched this movie the other night after reading some very positive things about it and Im glad I finally gave it a watch. I have always liked Seth Rogan and Gordon Levitt is quickly moving up into hollywoods A list. This is a great original movie with some great acting and great writing. Its a mixture of comedy and drama and it does exactly that makes you laugh then makes you feel.This movie is about a young man who despite never smoking or doing anything bad has somehow managed to get cancer. They put him on this medication that has a 50/50 chance of working so his odds are pretty good as cancer goes. Then his friend tries to help him during his toughest time.This is a great story of human emotion and friendship. It has its funny moments but also its heart wrenching moments as well. Great movie give it a watch.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amazing, Emotional, Fun, Real.","Just watched 50/50. This movie was incredible. A content warning to start, there is language, depiction of recreational drug use, and one scene of intimacy that does not contain nudity. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was incredible as always so nothing new there but Seth Rogan delivers the best performance of his career. Seth's overt persona is nothing new but he masters his control of the subtle as he never has before to deliver a character you truly feel connected to by the end of the film. Anna Kendrick may have been type cast again but she truly fit in this role and did a great job. Overall I loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone with the one caveat being the content warning I started with.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Following the life of a young guy with cancer (Gordon-Levitt), 50/50 is profound and pure enjoyment","Many films about cancer are actually only about 'movie cancer'. These have characters who say they are sick but their disease does not seem to interrupt their lives at all as they continue on normally until one day they unexpectedly disappear because of their phantom cancer. The rest of the films concerning cancer realistically show their characters with aches and pains, traumatic responses to chemotherapy, and emotional breakdowns. 50/50 shows real cancer and not the fake movie kind ala this month's Gus Van Sant film Restless.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old sound editor for Seattle Public Radio. His relationship with his girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is looking up as she is starting to spend more and more nights over at his house. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) is also a major part of his life mainly as chauffeur, work mate, and deliverer of crude comedic one-liners. Adam has everything going for him and finally decides to head to the doctor to check out some nagging back pain. When the doctor blindsides him with a whole bunch of really long sounding words relating to a tumor on his spine, Adam's world stops on a dime and all of his plans and expectations just pack up and fly out the window.He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink, and he recycles. How on Earth, especially at 27, could he have a tumor? Chemotherapy begins right away as does a myriad of other doctor visits and awkward sessions with a 24 year old therapist who looks even younger than that. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) is assigned as Adam's therapist to help him sort through his feelings; however, he has a very tough time adjusting to the fact that he is her third patient ever and their rapport takes an immediate hit when she has no idea who this Doogie Howser person Adam keeps mentioning is. Adam also notices how his friends and family relationships change regarding his disease. Which of his friends will step up and stick by him in his troubled times? Will his girlfriend stay supportive, will his best friend want to keep hanging around and will his mother (Anjelica Huston) be able to keep it together enough not become another emotional problem in his life? 50/50 was written by Will Reiser and is loosely based on his real experiences with cancer. Reiser is a frequent co-writer and friend of Seth Rogen which is why he shows up in the sidekick role here. Coincidentally or not, this is also a reprise of a character Rogen played in Funny People when he became Adam Sandler's sidekick when he had cancer. Rogen's character Kyle is very similar to his wise-cracking, vulgar characters from Knocked Up and Pineapple Express. In fact, it probably is the same character just with another name because he plays them exactly the same.The two actors who really rise above the rest in 50/50 are Gordon-Levitt and Kendrick. Continuing a remarkable series of characters from 500 Days of Summer and Inception, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very believable as a young guy who must come to grips with a new reality he did not sign up for. Also, the talented Anna Kendrick shows up in a very familiar role because the audience saw her do the same thing in Up in the Air; she plays a character where she is judged as too young to be effective. Unlike Seth Rogen, Kendrick is extremely capable and her scenes with Gordon-Levitt are as uncomfortable and stunted as they would be in a real hospital.Bryce Dallas Howard has now played back to back roles as an extremely unsympathetic and callous character; this summer's The Help has Howard as a conniving villain. She should be careful lest she is typecast as the wicked witch next. Thankfully, Anjelica Huston is here in her juiciest role since 2007's The Darjeeling Limited or even 2004's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. She does not get too many plum roles anymore which is a shame because she steals the scenes she is in as the emotional wreck of a mother. She overshadows Gordon-Levitt and annihilates Seth Rogen when they share the screen.I mentioned Restless earlier because both of these films were released close together, have a main character with cancer, and are even both based in the Pacific Northwest. 50/50 is supposedly shot in Seattle and has one or two establishing shots with the Space Needle in the background but the vast majority of it is obviously shot in British Columbia. 50/50 looks and feels that much better because I saw Restless recently and it was so ridiculous in how it showed a character with cancer that 50/50 shines bright above it.Even though I complain about Seth Rogen's acting, 50/50 is a very powerful film and does not match the comedy its preview promises. There are scenes to laugh at, but there are many more which are truly deep and prompt meaningful responses from the audience. 50/50 is a delight to watch and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will be happy you took the time to seek this one out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A perfect forging of comedy and drama,"This is a touching and heart-felt movie which left me thinking ""why did I like that so much?"" because of its simplicity.It is best to go into this film cold, without any knowledge of story or outcome. In fact, the title of the film reflects one of the key plot elements later in the film, which could only work by creating the perfect balance of drama and comedy that 50/50 manages to do with great aplomb.Seth Rogen plays the lightest version of his weed-smoking down-to-earth character that seems to appear in every thing he does. This is not a criticism. If you like Seth Rogen then you'll probably like this film.I found myself unexpectedly welling up at times. The scenes between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick's characters are amongst the best in the film, merging a nice balance of realistic dialogue and sharp screen-writing.And if the end leaves you feeling a little deflated, keep in mind that it is based on actual events that happened to the scriptwriter. Mostly likely though, you'll come out of this film feeling lifted and grateful.",,Anonymous,Romance
Gordon-Levitt's performance gives the film authenticity,"An impressively realistic and nuanced chronicle of a 27-year-old cancer patient, enclosed in a somewhat Hollywoodized wrapping which includes the goofy (albeit warm) comic-relief friend and the customary (albeit sweet) romantic ending. Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels in the lead; he plays Adam with a sensible level of understatement, not falling for the temptation of frequent and loud emotional outbursts. It is Gordon-Levitt's performance which gives the film the authenticity to balance its otherwise lightweight comedy and predictable structure. I have no doubt that Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick could make a cute couple, but their romance here is too plot-driven and convenient to befit the film's otherwise intelligent handling of a serious subject matter that most people will be able to identify with in one way or another. The ever-charming Seth Rogen gives us another hour-and-a-half of his now familiar on-screen persona. And considering the fact that 50/50 evidently is loosely based on writer Will Reiser's own battle against cancer, accompanied by real-life friend Rogen, I suppose we must now conclude that Rogen's just being himself in front of the camera. I'm excited to see how long his 15 minutes will last.(Review written in 2012.)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies for 2011,"This movie was just great. Perfect balance between comedy and drama. This movie makes it so easy for you to love the characters. The casting was perfect, and the story was amazing! This movie was emotional in so many different ways. They made a movie about something so serious, funny, but also kept it serious. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is awesome once again. Anna Kendrick is cute, brilliant, and perfect for the role. Seth Rogen, his best performance yet, in my opinion. This movie is damn near perfect. It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and what I hoped it would be. You can really relate with the characters and enjoy this flick. So many good things going on with this movie and is a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"'You could be having sex with hookers whilst skydiving, and your last wish is to drive a car?'","It was so right to make this a comedy. It would have worked just as well as a drama in the 'Philadelphia' tradition, but adding humour was a great decision, as it eases tension from a morbid subject. I felt good after seeing it and don't have a problem with recommending it, even during Christmas.We first see Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) smiling while jogging cautiously. He stops at traffic lights even though there isn't a car in sight. We understand why: Adam is a hypochondriac. He doesn't drink or smoke, he recycles and he has cleaning-OCD. He couldn't be more health conscious.Adam's beautiful girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) believes in positive energy and probably only stays with him because few others would tolerate her falseness. Adam has a best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogan). He's the loquacious type, whose defining trait is that he's addicted to sex, or at least the pursuit of sex. He's a younger and dirtier version of John C. Reilly's character in 'Cedar Rapids'.That's about as much of Adam's world we see until we're hit with it: He has cancer. Worse still, it's a form so rare that no one, not even other cancer patients, have heard of it. One guy tells Adam 'the more syllables, the worse it is'. A random website suggests his chances are fifty-fifty - 'Not bad odds', Kyle reassuringly tells him and adds, 'If you were in a casino, they'd be great odds!'.Adam is assigned a rookie doctor, Katherine (Anna Kendrick), which doesn't inspire much confidence, but being such a nice fellow he goes with the flow. Their chemistry develops naturally and before they know it, the doctor-patient barrier has been broken.Gordon-Levitt gives a credible performance. His characterisation doesn't particularly elicit our sympathy, but I sympathised with him nonetheless. Anjelica Huston plays his doting mom. I've seen her play a similar character before, in 'Buffalo '66', but like Kendrick's repeat performance from 'Up in the Air', hers also doesn't harm the film in anyway.The funny moments are very funny indeed, but the dramatic ones manage to top them. It's especially brilliant when you have scenes, like the one where Kyle exposes Rachael, that contain both. Philip Baker Hall's cameo as a fellow cancer patient is wonderful. Here he's cast against type and is perfect as a cantankerous, weed-ingesting, profane old man. This kind of character can't be unfunny (remember Alan Arkin in 'Little Miss Sunshine'?).I've know a few people who have cancer. What strikes me most about them is how relaxed they are. Many people assume that knowing you have cancer, especially a terminal form, would be unbearable. But for many patients the opposite is true. They accept their situation, remind themselves that death is natural and spend every second they have left doing the things most pleasurable to them. It isn't paradoxical to hear them describe their diagnosis as 'liberating'. Their behaviour is to be admired.www.moseleyb13.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a potentially disastrous idea turns out to be both hilarious and poignant,"50/50 is being advertised as a ""comedy about cancer,"" which hardly sounds like a good idea for a movie, especially one that's advertised as ""from the creators of Superbad"". Cancer is obviously a very delicate subject, and there was as much risk that 50/50 could become too goofy and insensitive for its own good as there was for it to become too melodramatic and manipulative. I'm glad to say that the film is surprisingly poignant, realistic, and funny. For every crude joke, there are enough interesting character dynamics and real human emotions in this to make it a solid, thoroughly enjoyable and heart-wrenching film.That fine balance between comedy and drama can partly be attributed to Will Reiser, who wrote the story and script based on his own experiences with cancer. The script manages to find enough humor in Adam's situation, mostly thanks to his friend Kyle's attempts at cheering him up (such as using his cancer to pick up girls). However, the story also makes sure to deal with the serious issues around the disease too, such as how Adam handles his situation and the various ill-effects of cancer treatment, as well as how his diagnosis effects his relationships with his overbearing mother, and his girlfriend.While the script itself does a good job of bringing in humor to an fairly dramatic story, it's the actors who really bring out the emotions of those affected by Adam's disease. The supporting characters are all well cast. I have to admit that I'm not really a huge fan of Seth Rogen's usual raunchy style of humor, so I tended to get annoyed by a lot of his lines. However, he plays Kyle with the right amount of charm, and it works, for the most part. If you are a fan of his, I can't imagine you'd be too disappointed by his usual R-rated jokes. Plus, I heard that Kyle was actually based off of the real Seth Rogen, who is a friend of screenwriter Will Reiser, so who better to cast? Other strong supporting cast members include Anjelica Huston as Adam's over protective mother, who brings out just the right amount of sympathy for her character. Anna Kendrick also stars as Katherine, Adam's inexperienced therapist, and works well as the earnest, somewhat bumbling, young doctor.The best part of the movie though, is quite easily Joseph Gordon Levitt as Adam. Levitt was perfectly cast in this role, and a lot of what I said about the film ""not getting melodramatic"" can be credited to his understated performance. He does a wonderful job of showing us what Adam is going through, from the initial shock, to his early optimism, and finally his succumbing to the fear that he really has no hope of survival. Watching Adam's journey, you really feel like you're getting to know him as a person, and understand what he's going through, which makes the climax all the more emotional. I can't imagine anyone reaching this scene without their heart racing, or even shedding a few tears.Sometimes I get too caught up in reviews and such to notice how movies are actually doing at the box office. Considering the great critical reception for this film, I was surprised to see that it hasn't been all that popular at the box office. While the topic may sound like a strange one for a comedy, 50/50 works well, thanks to its well balanced script and a great cast, topped off by an award-worthy performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt. If you've been going back and forth on whether you should see this in theaters, or have been ignoring it because it might make you feel sad, I say go see it! It might make you cry, but you won't leave feeling sad. If anything, you'll leave the theater feeling uplifted by the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Remarkable,"When i heard this film is based on a true story, i found it interesting. But it is a weird movie, how can it be categorized of comedy movie about a man fighting against cancer? It is certainly imaginative, although it does not lose its depressing part, but the emotion of the film is broken by stupid jokes of teenagers. The things that saved the picture are the performance of Joseph Gordon Levitt and the form the film shows the way of living a life with cancer. This is remarkable because is extremely realistic; in other words, the things that Adam start doing when the doctor diagnosed him cancer are the same that everyone would probably do. You wont get out of the hospital planning to take what remains of life; you will denied that you are fine, get angry with the world, you will discovered who your true friends are and refuge in what you find first. If all this were not interrupted by the silly relationship that is going nowhere with the girlfriend, the pointless sessions with the psychologist and the friend that does not know if to help or not Adam; In my opinion even if this movie might not be in the top,i like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Has enough humor and heart to elevate it beyond similarly-themed films,"While it could have gone the route of being maudlin and going for a cheap emotional gut punch, 50/50 is a fairly well-written, honest portrayal of someone who finds out they have cancer. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a guy who ""doesn't smoke...and recycles"" but finds out that he has a rare form of spinal cancer. Together with his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and a novice therapist (Anna Kendrick), he eventually comes to terms with his condition despite the many setbacks he experiences. Chief among these is a cheating girlfriend (Dallas Bryce Howard). I mean, what girl would cheat on her boyfriend after he finds out he has cancer? That was pretty low, and made her character extremely unlikeable. Of course, most of the central cast is unlikeable in some way. Adam becomes kind of a prick once he finds out about his condition, although this is somewhat understandable. Less understandable, although it's intrinsic to the type of characters Seth Rogen usually plays, is Kyle who uses Adam's condition as a way to hook up with women. Even though I can understand that someone who finds out they have a potentially terminal illness might use it to score, actually seeing it play out in a movie was kind of crass to me. Thankfully, the film doesn't stay there. Generally speaking, the plot was rather predictable in terms of the romantic aspect. You just kind of know that after Adam breaks up with his girlfriend he'll eventually end up with his cute therapist because that's just the way things work. I can almost forgive it since Anna Kendrick played such a dorky, likable person, but clichés are still clichés. I also didn't buy her for a second as someone working on their doctorate. Still, the performances were generally good and I couldn't really find fault with anyone. What really saved the film for me from being just a run-of-the-mill ""cancer comedy"" (kind of odd to see those two words juxtaposed) were a couple of key scenes late in the movie which provided the emotional weight needed to anchor the film and provided a counter-balance to the crude humor that one would expect from a comedy starring Seth Rogen. But even though Seth Rogen is in the film, this is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's movie all the way and he does a great job of carrying it. Overall, I liked it a little more than I thought I might at first. The plot is rather predictable and cliché at times, but there was a lot of humor and heart that lifted it beyond other similar films.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

JGL continues to develop as a actor and having seen him in Hesher and now this I am convinced that he will soon be one of the most sought after names in film.

He plays the broken but brave best friend to perfection, never willing to let his friend believe that its over but secretly knowing that this could well be it. It takes you on the emotional journey of the sufferer and his immediate circle of family and friends. It highlights the high points which are uplifting and the low points which are heartbreaking. It grabs hold of you and gives you an indication of what cancer is like, how it affects you and how it can damn well destroy you if you let it. But it also teaches you to never give up. This makes you feel which is what a great film should do.This is as real as it gets.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Life is a Crapshoot ( Well, You're Half Right Anyway )","This film is mildly recommended.50 / 50 is the aptly name dramedy about cancer. Half of the film works beautifully ( the more serious half ) and the other part not so well. Part of the reason is that the comedic elements don't gel with the film's romantic subplots which tends to trivialize its more important disease-of-the-week subject. The grueling scenes of chemotherapy, the callowness of the medical system, and a patient's sudden setbacks just don't build to any significance due to the sit-com hijinks that befall the film's initial interesting premise.Loosely based on a true story of screenwriter Will Reiser ( renamed Adam ), and real life friend of Seth Rogen ( renamed Kyle in the film ), 50 / 50 starts off very promisingly as we meet the likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the lead character who is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. His good life is slowly coming undone as he breaks the news to his best friend ( Rogen ), his girlfriend ( Bryce Dallas Howard ) and his mother ( the talented and underused Angelica Huston ). Therapy sessions are on order in the form of a perky and cute psychologist named Katie ( a miscast Anna Kendrick ) as Adam also befriends other sage cancer patients ( winningly played by Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer ).Yes, it all sounds very predictable and it is. Director Jonathan Levine doesn't set the right tone at all for his film. The characters are not fully realized, especially the role of the therapist who tends to break every ethical boundary of her profession. Levine also allows Rogen ( one of the film's producers ) to ham up his role as The Buddy who tends to upstage Levitt every chance he gets. ( And this is one of Rogen's most restrained performance to date. )Yet it is the remarkable talents of Joseph Gordon-Levitt that rescue the film. He subtly captures the horror of his dilemma and projects a bittersweet melancholia as he copes on a daily basis. This actor is so gifted and he is developing a fine resume with his challenging film choices.In fact, due to his acting prowess ( and the skilled support of Serge Houde as the father and the previously mentioned Ms. Huston ) the film's final hospital scene delivers just the right mixture of pathos and humor that most of the film struggles to achieve. Were that Ms. Huston would have had even more scenes, 50 /50 could have become a truly memorable film experience and its odds at success unmatched.

Emotional movie with some funny parts,Drama's are usually not the kind of movies I'm going for but with this one I'm glad I did. I would not really call it a comedy even though there were some funny moments with Seth Rogen. But it's about cancer and like most of us eventually in life we get to know somebody that struggled or died because of cancer. And it's not a pretty decease to watch evolve. But nevertheless the bit of humor there was in the movie perfectly balanced out the tragedy of having cancer. It kind of reminded me the excellent show The Big C. Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to never grow up. He still looks so young. I always have to think about 3rd Rock from the Sun when I see him but in 50/50 he proves he can play something else then pure comedy. The movie itself is very easy and pleasant to watch even though it's about that nasty decease and there are frequent sad moments. It might not please everyone to watch it but I'm sure for a lot of people that were confronted with cancer it will cheer them up a little. Better then I expected.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Very good, respectful and funny","A lot of films have been made about cancer in the past few years.

Humorous and Touching Story of Dealing with Cancer,"Cancer casts a wide net of emotional devastation. 50/50 does an excellent job of capturing the many facets of people dealing with this disease. The story, directing, and acting make you feel with part of the downward emotional and physical spiral of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt's character as he deals with the 50% probability of surviving his cancer.I'm a big fan of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt's films, and his acting here is exceptional. He captures the whole spectrum of emotions as his character looks in the face of death. Despite the difficult circumstances and the anger, frustration, and hopelessness that comes with it, his character continually seeks out hope and rays of light.50/50 does a wonderful job at providing insights into both decaying relationships (main character's girlfriend), evolving relationships (main character's mother - excellent acting by Angelica Houston in a supporting role), and new relationships (main character's therapist and fellow cancer patients).50/50 has many touching moments, as the main character uncovers the strengths of his relationships, as his family and friends deal with their own emotional challenges while trying to help the main character. Seth Rogan does a good job as his aimless, foul-mouthed best friend, and he provides many humorous moments with his loud and direct manner.Overall, 50/50 does an excellent job with a difficult subject. 50/50 excels where Funny People, about Adam Sandler's character facing cancer, failed a couple years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Remarkable,"An absolutely poignant, refreshing, and deeply emotional film, 50/50 takes more than another step into unforeseen territory with its unique approach on a cancer story that is both at times hard to watch and yet surprisingly funny. Joseph-Gordon Levitt gives a great performance as Adam, truly capturing the most of his unfortunate experience and situation with such gripping emotion you'll forget he's simply just acting. Seth Rogen also provides the film with its comedic relief, unsurprisingly, but does prove to be more than a worthy addition to the film and his character certainly makes for some quite hilarious moments. Most of the supporting cast in total is also quite good. The film's script is layered and seemingly perfectly executed, and its cinematography truly captures the feel and tone of the film. In the end, 50/50 was a surprisingly funny, moving, and remarkable film- that is not only bound to stand the test of time, but captures the hearts of everyone watching along.

How to stay positive while dealing with the most negative situations,"This is one of the best movies, if not the best movie, of 2011. Everybody in it did their job perfectly, and with that, this is an example of perfection.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is perfect as Adam, the guy with the cancer. Everybody reacts in different ways to how he has cancer, but it's with how he reacts to it himself that attach's us to his character. We know that, even if he says that he's at ease, he's really not, and that is something that, in this movie, Gordon-Levitt knew how to work. For that, he gets applause.Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen, in this movie. Now, to all you Seth Rogen haters, I know it may sound like a bad thing, but it actually isn't. He is the comic relief of this movie, and while he has the most profanity in this movie, his character is a likable character, based on the fact that he is the one that Adam looks to the most for support in this movie.Anna Kendrick is great in this movie as well, as the nervous therapist in this movie. While she is his therapist in this movie, we know that there are some feelings between the two, even when Adam is with his girlfriend.Speaking of his girlfriend, Bryce Dallas Howard is who we hate the most in this movie (or, at least, who I hated the most), but no worries: it is solely her character, and not her acting, that we hate. She may seem like a good girlfriend, but as we see later on, this is not the case (I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched it).Anjelica Huston is very good with the limited amount of screen time that she is given. She is the overbearing mother who just wants her son to be okay, and will do anything to make sure that he's okay.All in all, a perfect movie that shows that it is always good to make the best out of the worst situations. Everybody played their part well, and everybody deserves a round of applause. Academy Awards, take note of this movie, and its performances. 10/10 for me.",,Anonymous,Romance
"hope,fight, and love","I think this movie bases on the hope,facing with the cancer and the secret love. These all things are well-developed in the movie. I got the know Joseph Leonard Gordon-Levitt in the ""Inception"" which makes me admirer of him. As if he was born an actor. He is definitely capable of doing this. In this movie he looks like a prim and meticulous. He has a bro who is fond of girls and his bro is really cheerful. But when he learns that he is a cancer, he is shocked and starts to search how much he has chance to get over this sick. His bro says that everything will be okay. He tries to feel him comfortable. His bro gives a party to celebrate Adam's life. Then, Adam starts to receive chemotherapy from a lady who is doing her postgraduate. Not to remember, Adam has a girlfriend who does not love him and has a mother who is so anxious. His girlfriend cheats him and they break up,of course. Over time,the therapy does not work and the operation is needed. In the meantime operation is over and he will be got better in time. Adam starts to date with therapist and to live the life again :)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was a perfect and dramatic film.,"The film was exciting and dramatic.In some parts of film,love was dominant,but some parts of film were dramatic.As I understood the name of the film,50 50 either death or alive.That is,it has a meaningful film.lets mention about the film.A healthy man lost his hope to life when he faced with death suddenly.And moreover he broke up with his girlfriend.This got upset him more.then he is going to a doctor and doctor directed to a therapist.At first,he can't share his feelings and thoughts with therapist and he treats her in a biased manner.And at last Bay Adam feels different feelings to therapist In fact,therapist was also feeling things to Adam but she doesn't show it clearly.At the same time,he has a close friend named Kelly.Kelly helps him in every situation.Kelly is with him every time.They spend together.Later Adam operated seriously and got better.The best nice thing is that they fell in love each other.In short,the film was perfect.The film was tragic and comedy.Also it has a good act.The quality of view and sound effects were perfect.Ithink,the film should be watched.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Acting! Some of the funniest dialog I've seen.,"If there is anything to be said about this film, it is that the acting is fantastic. The story is good yet almost typical from what I would expect, but the acting and script is where the film really stands out from many other movies. The dialog between characters is absolutely hilarious at times, and about exactly what I was hoping for. One character that may get overlooked is Adam's mother. She is not in many scenes, but when she is, the actress plays her character spot on. I would describe her as an absolute nervous wreck, at times, and others as a typical worried mother. She did a fantastic job of making even me feel awkward for Adam at times. I don't know that overall this film will be very memorable as a whole, but I think there are certain scenes that will be. In particular the scene where Kyle, Seth Rogen's character, is helping Adam shave his head. This scene is spot on with how men are and act with one another and the scene is just simply a classic example of great acting. Also many scenes with Adam's therapist are quite memorable. Again, I wouldn't say 50/50 as a whole will be remembered as a classic or a top film years down the road, but I think certain scenes, lines, or dialog will be.For my full review, visit http://visuallyimpairedreviews.blogspot.com/2012/03/5050.html",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I didn't want to watch this film. So glad I did,"Cancer and Comedy.Two things that should never be mixed together.However 50/50 does, and it works. Using the phrase comedy is slightly miss leading to be honest in this case. There are some really nice light comedic references/situations that lighten the mood of the film without detracting from the seriousness of it but in essence it is a drama. A heart felt, well written, well directed and extremely well acted masterpiece.In a nutshell it is a very believable journey of not only one mans struggle with cancer but also the effects it has on people around him.Before I went to see the film I was very apprehensive as just the thought of cancer makes my stomach turn and the last thing I wanted to do is watch something depressing and upsetting. Both of these elements rarely make it in to 50/50 and I just sat back and enjoyed it from start to finish.What a great story and a great film. I highly recommend you go and see this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Major Disappointment,"Summit Entertainment may be a successful studio, but Fly Me to the Moon is their most decent work. If there's anything about them I could observe by watching The Ghost Writer, it's that their interference tends to botch movies with massive potential. Sadly, 50/50 is no exception by a long shot.
The premise: a young man is diagnosed with cancer and is told that he might survive.
Cancer is without a doubt one of the most active diseases in movie history. So much so, that if anybody ever finds a cure, that person deserves the nobel prize.
To see somebody survive makes for a unique concept. Unfortunately, the studio's interference turns it into its average snooze fest. The cast members do their best to make themselves 3-dimensional, but Seth Rogen is the only one to shine, let alone be amusing. At least no careers are ruined.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very Worthwhile, what u need to know","What you need to know before committing to this is: The story line feels like a great indie (but the maybe bigger budget for an indie ($8 million) got exceptional actors and production quality.)
The story is great. It makes you feel. The themes, the takeaways, and the things that resonate with you make it certainly a great movie to see if you like a story. And also if you've had cancer or know someone. Many movies can be predictable evening with great stories. Movie maker know what audience has one and give it to them.

So Natural,"From where I start, well the only thing that came is that this is so natural, I mean the acting, the story, the characters everything is great, but I dont wanna talk about al those things, I just want to say that this movie is so touching, it is funny and at the same time it made me cry. Especially, the mom-son relationship and love, oh my God, and the friendship.
While I was watching this movie I was planning how would I write a review, gathering topics, because it was so pleasant and touching in every aspect.

"It's good, but it could've been better.","I know, I know; you're saying ""Mister Blueghost, what in the world didn't you like about this film?"" Well, first off I did like it for what it was. BUT, and this is the director in me talking, you don't survive stage 4 cancer of any kind. Personal experience tells me this. If the plot of the film had been given a slightly higher emphasis instead of a casual nod (i.e. the mechanics of what the cancer was actually doing to our leading man), then the film would've shined.As it stands now, we have a writer (or writing team) that dropped the ball on a number of issues. First of all films focus on the emotional elements of all stories that they tell, but here we got a real sugar coated ending that makes for a film that I really wouldn't care to see again. Modern marketing dictates that we get an upbeat film to keep drawing in ticket goers. Ergo, what's-his-name survives not only the surgery, but the cancer itself. No ambiguity about it.But hey, it's essentially another chick flick married to the buddy-flick genre. Implication; happy ending.But, what would've made for a better market draw over the long run would have been the ambiguity of survival at the end. Dude gets the girl at the end. Dude survives to get the girl. But we're never privy to the entire cancer experience, just his perspective on how it effects his social life, and nothing more. We don't see his personal insights, not really. We see his mood flux, but not a different perspective on the world. We don't get the sense that he's changed too much for his entire experience. We really don't.He lives. He comes out on top, and his friend is the best friend anyone in the world could ask for. But for all that we don't see a real adjustment in character. Which begs the question if there really needs to be on in the first place. Meh, maybe not, but if you survive a life threatening experience, then you're bound to have a different outlook on how the world looks, feels, smells, sounds and just vibes in general. I'm not sure we really get that.The film is what it is. It was a little too raunchy in terms of the sexual language for my taste, but it got its point across with great alacrity.My vote is that this is a sugar coated cancer film that could have been much more than it ultimately became, but it's a decent flick for what it is.Rated-R for language and some mild sexual situations, it's not exactly a family film.Take a chance on it, and judge for yourself.*eidt; 11/27/11* p.s. a bit of a remake of the Italian film ""One for Two"".",,Anonymous,Romance

A Powerful Drama with a Light Comedic Edge,"When you're trying to advertise a heartfelt drama/comedy about one guy's struggle with his cancer diagnosis, perhaps it's not best to lead with the line ""from the guys who brought you SUPERBAD"". Not because I was fooled. No, I read reviews and follow news on movies that pique my interest. But the general movie-going public who relies solely on advertising when making decisions on what movies to check out, they might've felt a little gypped. I thought this movie was misrepresented in the trailers and TV spots, and I wonder if it led to the mediocre box office results. I didn't really see a lot of ads for it and the ones that I did see try to spin it as a ""laugh-out-loud"" comedy. Not quite. The movie is based on screenwriter Will Reiser's personal experiences when he was diagnoses and subsequently beat cancer in his mid-20s. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Adam Lerner, an employee for Seattle Public Radio and the ultimate personification of risk avoidance. He has no bad habits and won't even cross the street unless he's given the OK from a pedestrian signjust in case. Which is why it comes as such a surprise to him when he's diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on his spine. The odds aren't good, with most people finding a 50% chance of survival in the best cases. Now he begins the process of coping with his illness and his 50/50 odds with the help of his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his artist girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), his over-bearing mother (Anjelica Huston), and his new therapist (Anna Kendrick).Yes, 50/50 is just as much a comedy as it is a drama, but it's not fair to label it as being in the same vein as the previous Rogen/Goldberg movies (SUPERBAD, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS). The association is a loose one and the comedy isn't on the same level. 50/50 doesn't really rely on vulgar language, shock humor, or absurd situations for its laughs. It's a much more natural humor that arises from the strained situations between it's characters. The drama is actually much more prominent here and there are some real heavy scenes in the movie that'll put a lump in the throat of the hardest person. The entire third act of the movie, the vibe shifts to a more serious tone and features some of the most heart-wrenching bits in the entire film. People might not have been expecting such a serious approach to the film because of how it was marketed. You're not going to find yourself laughing yourself to tears at zany situations but you might just find yourself tearing up when Adam is preparing for a potentially dangerous surgery. Not so say that the movie isn't funny, because it has some great moments. The humor is really blatant, but it's enough to earn some chuckles from the viewer. It's a tamer humor that falls more in line with movies like OUR IDIOT BROTHER as opposed to the usual Apatow-style comedy.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has somehow managed to skyrocket into the spotlight with awesome roles in a long line of recent major films (I officially forgive him for his Cobra Commander), does an amazing job in this movie. I'm almost surprised that he didn't receive more critical attention for 50/50. He rides a perfect balance of strength and despair in the face of his own mortality. Seth Rogen is the primary reason this movie must've earned it's R-rating. He provides his trademark brand of explicit humor and ranting. Funny, yes, but it didn't really feel like it fit in with the rest of the movie. It's hard to see two characters as different as Adam and Kyle as actual friends, but Rogen has enough as a ""good buddy"" vibe that we buy him in his role. We believe him as a lovable loser who means well because that's what he's usually casted as. Anna Kendrick is adorable as a rookie therapist who's assigned to help Adam deal with his emotional struggle and still hasn't quite found her groove. Being that Adam is only her third patient, she's still trying things out and it's funny to watch her settle into her position. Not to mention, she has an excellent chemistry with Gordon-Levitt and you find yourself hoping the two get their happy ending. But this movie isn't about their relationship, it's about Adam's battle with cancer and how he, and everyone close to his life, comes to terms with it. It's a light-hearted comedy about a tender subject, but handles it in such a way that you feel the weight of the matter.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It wasn't all that original in style, sort of funny, and well put together.","The movie starts you off showing the less glamorous mundane realities of the working life, and introduces the main characters, Gorden Levvit and Seth Rogan. It drops the news of the cancer, without any dramatic buildup, or transition at all, leaving an effect of suddenness which people inflicted must feel. Gordon Levitt, I thought was great throughout the movie, and his character kind of created a calm helplessness throughout the movie. It played heavily on his mom / girlfriend issues, while Seth Rogan bombarded the script with stoner humor and constant efforts to take him out and get him laid. I have never had cancer, or dealt with anyone that is going through cancer, but it seemed like Gordan Levitt rode that emotional roller-coaster white knuckled.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Equally funny and heartwarming!,"Sometimes movies that portray illness and hardship can come across as a bit cynical. Like the producers and director are carefully manipulating you to cry in certain scenes. And they can get a little sentimental and sobby. This movie didn't feel like that at all. All the emotions you get while watching this film, happiness, laughter, anger, sadness, and so forth, comes to you naturally, as you become engrossed in the story and grow more and more sympathetic of the characters. There's also a lot of comedy in the movie, many of the scenes were both funny and sad at the same time.My gf would normally never spend money to see a drama/comedy movie in the cinema, as she feels the big screen and sound system needs some explosions or giant robots to justify their existence, but she absolutely loved this.This movie was fantastic, highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impressive and thought-provoking,"It has been one of the most thought-provoking films which I have watched lately. I found the film emotional, entertaining, enjoyable and challenging. In my opinion, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance is immensely prosperous. There has been a 27-year-old public radio journalist who has cancer. When he learned this disease, he was at a loss. It sounds fearful because he is a young man, there should be long years to live; however he was caught a bad disease. This matter also makes me think about some of these questions: Why am I the person who had cancer? , How much time left? , Would I die? On the other hand, I found the film a little bit of superficial because the disease has not been discussed thoroughly and the film reminds me love story film. At any rate, I think one and all should watch this film just because ""50/50"" reminds how substantial our life and our health. If we lose sense of well-being, we are not able to cope up with life, and this film aims to recite this truth. After a while his girl friend starts to cheat him. His bosom buddy reveals this fact. That is another rueful event while striving with disease. This scene also purposes to tell that in the hardest times we realize people's real intent.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb,"I'm usually skeptical of contemporary films that don't suggest a particularly original, daring, intricate or beautifully executed/filmed plot, but 50/50 really surprised me.50/50 does a beautiful job of balancing comedy, drama, tragedy and heart-warming content. It had me laughing throughout, and sobbing from the middle to the end-- a rare reaction of mine to films these days.What I enjoyed most was that the humor was subtle, sometimes suggestive and dead-pan, rather than overly overt and obnoxious like most 'comedies' these days. Moreover, I appreciated the heart felt touches fused with the realistic base of this film that provoked rolling tears, and the compulsion to re-evaluate my life and the people in my life that are dear to me. The cast is also all around excellent... Gordon shines, once again.Watch this film; I don't think you'll regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

For those who have not seen this film and are reading this review I would strongly recommend you watch this film, if you got a good sense of humour and a good heart then you will without a doubt love this movie. I personally believe that Joseph Gordon Levitt is not given the credit he deserves, to be honest, I was not very fond of him because I was too interested in other actors such as Johnny Depp and Denzel Washington. But when I watched the trailer for this film, I really got interested.The movie is based around Joseph Levitt, I will not give away the story but from what you read, the movie is about him suffering from Cancer. How he did not win an Oscar for this performance I do not know!It is without a doubt a heart touching and funny movie that will not let you down. My review and most the other reviews on here will suggest you watch this film! So listen, and watch this film because it will be of your liking, whether your an action type or horror type, you will without a doubt like this!To some, Joseph Gordon Levitt may seem like a ""Who is that?"" type actor at the moment, but in a year or two or maybe even when people see The Dark Knight Rises, that is when they will realise and say ""Levitt is an awesome actor"". He will be the next big thing in Hollywood. And after this performance, he has been recognised even more.Do not wait till next week or next month, get the movie and watch it.

Beautiful portrait how friends and relatives cope with a maybe (50/50) fatal spine tumor,"I saw this film as part of the Ghent filmfestival 2011, in the same week as ""Halt auf Freier Strecke"" aka ""Stopped on Track"" (Dresen; 2011) having a similar theme. Both portray how relatives and friends try to cope with the announcement of an immanent death due to a tumor diagnosis. Particularly interesting is how some evade the issue, while others rise to the challenge.Both films succeed very well in showing how friends and relatives initially react, and how good or bad they find their own way in dealing with the issues at hand. The two films are very different in all other respects. The chances for survival for the spine tumor are 50/50, hence the title of the film, contrary to the brain tumor in Stopped On Track that is not curable in any way. Optimism is not appropriate for the latter film, because of the known fatal end result. In counterpart 50/50 a positive outcome is uncertain but feasible. This allows for humor and optimism, as that may well improve the chances for survival, according to popular belief.Several nice touches are thrown in as extra ingredients. Firstly, we see the doctor explaining the diagnosis. His whole talk is directed to the notes and diagrams on his desk. He seems unable to look at the patient (Adam) before him. Secondly, when Adam's mother is invited to dinner, she apparently expects an announcement that he is going to marry his girl friend, or even that she is pregnant. Instead, when she learns about the tumor, she is annoyed that he waited two whole days to tell her. Thirdly, we see a group of four patients receiving chemo therapy on a regular basis. They gradually get to know each other, becoming sort of friends. At one day they discover that only three are left, after one died recently. Something everyone saw coming but still a shock for the three, emphasizing their possible near future the hard way.Adam's friend Kyle has a very prominent role throughout, taking care of the humor department. In a delicate situation like this, his efforts might be considered inappropriate and too much to witness. In other words, you love it or you hate it. But he certainly has a better side, as appears later on. When buying support books recommended by the psycho therapist, Kyle abuses the sad story around Adam as opening lines to get girls interested in himself. But deep down he is not all opportunistic. We see with our own eyes that Kyle really has read the support books, shown by a lot of hand written notes in the margins.The psycho therapy sessions with beginning therapist Katie could be hilarious, where it not that she does not act as a model for her profession. She does all the things that her tutors have forbidden, in her eagerness to comfort the patient. She can't help herself, sometimes even to the extent that it is embarrassing to watch. Can this be intentional??Finally, an operation is needed to remove the tumor. I cannot reveal the end result of this operation, if only to avoid a spoiler. Anyway, the film comes to its finale soon after the operation. Its end result is less important than what happened in between, how everyone was able (or not) to deal with the situation. It lets us think how we behave ourselves when this would happen in our own lives. Maybe this film prepares us for this, and makes us a better patient, friend or family member.All in all, I'm very satisfied with the film, the main actors and the ingredients for the story. You cannot help getting involved in how these people react, and their problems in doing their best, but not always succeed in that. I gave it 5 stars (out of 5) for the public prize competition when leaving the theater.",,Anonymous,Romance
Joseph Gordon-Levitt Is Good Like Usual,"This will be a 3-part review.1. As a ""Joseph Gordon-Levitt movie-lover"" I'm glad to say that this time Joseph Gordon-Levitt has done it again. 50/50 is successful mostly due to his stunning portrait of a young man diagnosed with cancer. Upsettingly, it seems to stop there. His strong performance aside, the rest of the cast does not offer many surprises.2. The story does not try to be ""big"" or have the kind of intention to cater for a very wide array of audience groups. Nevertheless, it is still successful. The script is nicely written depicting the start to finish of a man's physical and psychological battle with a rare case of cancer. 50/50 feels like a nice little independent film and is presented throughout with that spirit.3. If it were earlier in the year, I might say this can score a few Oscar nods. However, at the current stage almost close to the end of the race, I can only say the only possible category in which 50/50 can get a nomination is probably Best Original Screenplay, and it is not even very safe. While the Best Adapted Screenplay this year seems to have solid locks like Hugo, Descendants, Moneyball, we are still not very sure whether the Academy will nominate Young Adult or Bridesmaids over 50/50 beside the locks like Artist and Midnight in Paris. I'd be happy to see this get recognized, but with the Academy nowadays, I guess you never know. We'll just wait and see.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly Enjoyed.,"The fact of it being a film built up around a man diagnosed with cancer, while containing comedy may result in you being astonished. But really, it's a good even mix of both realism, comedy and the additional romance here and there.My summary is as it is. My watch of the film was very enjoyable with the laugh-out-loud moments, and then the tense heart touching ones. Exactly why I rate the film a 10/10.The acting was great, the storyline of the film was sometimes not what you'd expect, surprising, but that's what makes 50/50 such a good film. I'd recommend this film to any mature people, since I believe it won't be such a big hit with teens.

On friendship,"This a film about a young man struggling with spinal cancer. The alterations in his relationships with his girlfriend, best friend, parents and therapist are tried to be depicted. For me, it is a very difficult subject to make a film about. In such films, acting should be way above average and Joseph Gordon-Levitt performs averagely. On the contrary, Seth Rogen is great and played an excellent best friend. Overall, the film involves little comedy and weighs more on drama side.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

These feelings didn't meet but film is very different movie than the others.

Lame,I usually like Seth Rogan but in this movie he fails. He tried to be a person simply being innocently incompetent at showing empathy by being superficial and hiding real concern. But he just ends up being unbelievably irritating. This is mostly the fault of Gordon-Levitt who is so lame he gathers no empathy from anyone. He is the proverbial limp dick who destroys the whole atmosphere. His heart was not in it. His mother tries to make up for previous remote motherhood - and we end up understanding why she was aloof from him in the first place. His laughably rude doctor would normally be sued for his blunt treatment but we end up almost siding with him. His incompetent support psychologist is beyond cute and useless. She was almost driving him to suicide - but Gordon-Levitt has simply no energy to even contemplate such a decision. In the end he gathers the least empathy from the people viewing this movie. The ending is as cheesy as it can possibly get. Don't waste your time. You only live once. This is not 50/50 but 100% useless.,3.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50: A Chance Worth Taking,"Jonathan Levine's new dramedy 50/50 hits all the right notes. It takes the most essential of the human heartbreak and turns it into something real, emotional, and, surprisingly, hilarious.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a young man stuck in a flux between his girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) and his nagging, desperate mother (Anjelica Huston). Matters only get worse, naturally, when Adam finds out he has an extremely rare form of cancer on his spine. His best friend (Seth Rogen) tries to find the positives in the situation, like getting laid out of sympathy, while Adam tries to figure everything out with his young, inexperienced psychologist (Anna Kendrick). As you can imagine, there is a good amount of heartwrenching scenes, but the thing that makes them great is they're not overcooked. It plays so much on the realism, that makes it even more powerful.Will Reiser's script calls for a lot more than tragedy, however. It's a tricky subject to tackle, but Reiser does it almost perfectly. As much sadness that could be in a film about cancer, there is just as much, if not more, time for laughs. Seth Rogen gives his usual performance, but the personal aspect of this film (he essentially plays himself; Gordon-Levitt being a form of Reiser) takes him to a slightly new, better level of the performance he has given countless times before. The only real problem with the film is its misogynistic undertones, mainly from Rogen's character, which don't add to the film, and essentially demoralize it in a way. It was funny once, but the continuing notion seems a bit too crude for such an emotional story.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam perfectly; he is sweet and charming but you feel his struggle and the confusion as to what to do when faced with this in your life. Both supporting women give great performances. Anjelica Huston plays Adam's mother with a desperation to find someone; her husband has Alzheimer's and her son now with cancer, it drives all of Huston's choices and though she plays her kind of crazy, you understand all the while. Anna Kendrick gives her finest performance. Very grounded, but so well-crafted, her performance is not loud in any way. I often forgot that there was a celebrity behind the character, that's how great she was. If Up in the Air didn't prove Kendrick as a rising star, 50/50 has to.Director Jonathan Levine doesn't seem to intervene too much in this film. The film feels well-guided but not super-imposed, like many other directors feel. The film feels so true to life, to the subtle triumphs that everyone with cancer has to at least tackle. He doesn't turn it into a sappy epic, he allows the characters to play as they would play in real life, and that is maybe the most resonant of them all. A",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie to make you feel,"Feel what? everything. 50/50 was a movie I had been anxious to see. It took me a couple of weeks to actually convince someone to come with me. Their excuse always being that they didn't want to see a movie that made them cry. Thankfully i convinced my good friend to come with me who has had a close family member who has had cancer. And I, myself lost my mother to cancer. The movie was such an accurate portrayal of a young person who has cancer and how it effects those around them.Yes, I did have tears brimming in my eyes for a large portion of the movie, but i also laughed aloud. I felt hopeful for the characters and felt that hope diminish. I felt rage and above all i felt compassion. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an outstanding portrayal of a young man in such a bleak and dark situation. Seth Rogen acts the perfect part of this young mans best friend who is trying to cope with the reality that his best friend has a life threatening disease. (mostly because this movie is mostly based on the real-life happenings of Seths friend and the co-creator of the movie)If you have any doubts about seeing this movie because you are afraid of shedding a tear or two my advise to you is to just go. You will NOT regret this! i have been unable to stop talking about it since I saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very good movie,"This film is about a cancer victim who remains relatively sane and calm after finding out about his illness, compared to all those around him. His friends, family, therapist, acquaintances all go crazy. This is a great premise for a story about cancer. I enjoyed this film very much. Also, I disagree with those few who criticize Seth Rogen's performance. I think he is brilliant. There are so many men essentially like his character, hard and profane on the outside, who have trouble communicating their feelings, with a soft lump hidden on the inside. I think he portrays this type brilliantly. Joseph Gordon Leavit (sp?) is terrific in the lead role. He is perfect for the role and gives such a measured performance, it builds beautifully. And Angelica Huston is so solid and believable as the mother.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a nice movie!,"Another fine example how to make a beautiful movie on a low budget but with a good story, skillful direction and and excellent performance by Mr. Levitt (and other cast, even Mr. Rogen). Despite the rather dark theme, the movie is funny and as close to real life as it can be. Probably the most important of it all - it's optimistic. Why such almost perfect movies never even get a nomination for the Academy award? Still a mystery to me.Highly recommended to everybody, especially to those who lose hope easily. There's something funny and good in everything. Give this movie 100 minutes of your life and you'll consider it well spent.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: 50/50,"If someone tells you that you have a 50% chance of survival, I suppose it will show whether you're an optimist or a pessimist, since the end result has an equal chance to swing either way. You cannot control the circumstance, but you can surely temper your attitude towards it. Such is this film's brilliance in allowing one to journey with the protagonist through what would be anyone's most difficult situation when faced with a severe medical condition that one has no control over, except to face the facts that Fate has dealt. And for a film that's supposedly all seriousness, there's excellent drama and comedy all rolled into one.Directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Will Reiser, whose life this film is loosely based upon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Adam, a radio jockey whose routine medical checkup turned out to be a discovery that he has spinal cancer, and has to undergo chemotherapy in the meantime. It's a rare form of cancer, and like most of us these days the second opinion comes from the Internet, which is where the title came from in sufferers having a 50% chance of pulling it through. Revealing it to friends and family is tough, but as you would know will go to show just who your true friends are who would stand by you and provide morale support as you tackle it, in all honesty, alone.What I thoroughly enjoyed about the film is its pacing, and its ability to cover plenty of themes from slice of life moments to the usual ones on family, friendship and romance even. It doesn't turn on heavy melodrama nor treat its material lightly as one would expect from its comedic moments seen in the trailers, but goes through it with plenty of dignity and decency despite the occasional tangent into crass jokes and vulgarities to lighten the mood once in a while, but ultimately drapes everything with sincere humanity that can be felt throughout the entire film, every step of the way.As always, Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows just why he's one of the best actors of his generation, able to straddle both blockbuster films, with smaller ones that calls upon his acting chops to deliver memorable characters so real, his Adam is just like one of your best buddies, where you get to partake in his ups and downs in life, taking note of shared milestones together. You'll really feel for his character here through this trial and tribulation. Seth Rogen as Kyle, Adam's best friend and work colleague also aced his role despite playing what he does best in being the comedian of the duo, but essentially he's reprising what he had done for his friend Will Reiser, although with a lot more dramatic license adding to it. Both actors share this wonderful chemistry that made 50/50 such a delight to sit through especially since they light up the screen each time they appear together in the same scene, and when Kyle takes it upon himself to reap some booty benefits from his friend's condition.Reiser's story doesn't have supporting characters who are one-dimensional, providing very rich stories and episodes in which they interact with the main leads, with so much room in character development you wonder at the efforts the filmmakers had to go through to solidly pack a punch in its pacing and narrative. Anna Kendrick whom was last seen as a rookie in Up in the Air opposite George Clooney, once again plays a relatively new therapist called Katherine, assigned to care for Adam. I suppose her fresh looks and girlie demeanour serves her well in acing such roles, while providing that subplot that finds no lack thereof in any romantic comedy. There's enough going on between Adam and Katherine without stating much of the obvious, and it worked marvellously. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael, Adam's girlfriend, and in recent films I suppose she's deliberately branching off from goody-two- shoes roles to becoming more of the type of women anyone loves to hate, and pulling it off no less. And veteran Angelica Huston gets a small role as Adam's smothering mom, who in all earnestness, is probably like any other mom who's absolutely protective of her kids.With an excellent, eclectic soundtrack to pepper the narrative, heartfelt performances even from Seth Rogen (whom you'd think is comfortable only in comedies) and a rich story with strong characterization delivered through what would be a strong ensemble cast, 50/50 gets my vote as being amongst one of the best films of the year. It's not flashy nor did it venture into sensationalism, but has this stoic confidence to tell it like it is, and rang through some really powerful and pure emotions without finding it necessary to employ clichés. Highly recommended!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50: A comically benign drama,"50/50 is everything that Funny People was to suppose to be and more. A topic that has often been misplaced and under sold in Hollywood, cancer finds a suitable home in this film. The film successfully places a comical twist to the morbid topic and brings a suitable amount of drama as we witness the characters progress. I think the comical element was purposefully integrated in order to convey the laughable simplicity of life when our ends draw shockingly close. A phenomenal performance is brought by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, perhaps making it his best debut thus far. It is only fair to also add that the character chemistry between Rogen and Levitt exceed all expectations. 50/50 is the cure we have all been looking for.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Go See It!!!!!!,"I just got back from a early screening of 50/50. I absolutely loved this movie! It was hilarious, as expected with any Seth Rogen movie. It was also equally serious when it needed to be. There were a few sad parts without being down right depressing. Friendship seems to be a big focus on this movie, you can't tell how much by the preview, but the message this movie portrays is something we all should live by. While the movie is about cancer, it looks at it in a completely different way. After the movie instead of feeling any type of emotion for the character all I could say was If I ever get cancer that's how I would want it to be! I was curious as to how Seth Rogen & Joseph Gordon Levitt would do on screen together because to me their acting styles are so different, but they were great and complimented each other well. I would definitely recommend it to everyone!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
it is a dramatic and funny movie.,"first of all, the movie is great. Justin Long plays his role lively.in the movie, he is funny and cute and loves his girlfriend sincerely. On the other hand, Alison Lohman's bleeding nose part is awesome. In the film there are a few scary parts loved by almost everyone who watched the movie. for instance; while Cristine is in her car, in the seat back Slvia Ganush's ugly,disturbing,annoying face comes directly to the rearview mirror or Sylvia Ganush's teethless mouth comes directly to Christien's chin. But i have to admit that , there is just one little tiny part that exaggrates the movie. It's Lamia's dancing part. when i said the movie was going great, then this part broke down all the magic. but anyway, like i already said, this is a good scary movie and one of my favourite scary movie of all time.

What Funny People Should Have Been.,"I am giving this movie 8 out of 10 just because I am super picky. I loved this movie!! I was lucky to catch a pre screening of the movie and have been waiting for the final version of the movie for a while.This movie is exactly what Funny People should have been. I found most of the situations in Funny People unrealistic and over the top and therefore had trouble relating to the story or the characters. As someone who has last several loved-ones to cancer, I know that seeing cancer in a ""comedy"" can be difficult for some. This movie was a perfect balance of comedy and drama. It brings a certain amount of peace with the idea of death (much like Darren Aronovsky's The Fountain).The comedy is very ""Seth Rogan"", and not for all, but I thought it fit the film perfectly!!www.travelbelem.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a realistic film,"Such kind of films try to reflect actions including ones people face in real life. This film is one of them which is also a bit complex. The sections of the film I mean all flow in a direct way.To details; actors and actress are quite successful when it comes to perform because when you watch that film from beginning to the end, they perform as if it is seen in real life itself. In this respect, the expectations which a viewer may have are met by this film. I strongly believe that those who watching that film will suggest it to their friends without waiting a second.However I do not see any deficiency in this film personally, maybe there are some points which can be accepted as problematic. These are the duration of the film, flow of ideas, final point which was given.As a result, considering all I mention above, spending two hours and watch that film would not be weird for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sweet,"50/50 falls very neatly into the very definition of ""dramedy"" - as the title suggests, it's a 50/50 split between the two. That's not to say that it isn't, in its heart, very much a drama; the poster and tagline that suggest a buddy comedy starring Seth Rogen should not be trusted. But it refuses to ever delve into kitsch or soap-operatic melodrama; it tackles a difficult subject with maturity, subtlety and yes, a sense of humor. It's lighthearted, but never tasteless. And it's this combination that makes it so realistic, so lovable and so easy to relate to. It's never too depressing or bleak, but it's also not unrealistically optimistic; and being a positive, honest film about terminal disease, it feels very refreshing indeed.Cinematically there's nothing very special about it. The editing and cinematography are actually very good; but just in a way that makes the film easy on the eyes and easy to connect to. Just like Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance, which is naturalistic and very strong but also subtle and quiet - which is maybe why he was snubbed so badly during award season. The supporting cast, too, are all deserving of praise - Seth Rogen (clowning around as always, but also a surprisingly realistic and compelling character), Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anna Kendrick, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer all deliver beautifully - but all their performances are toned down, they don't deliver any poignant monologues or soliloquies. They're all just believable and real human beings with flaws as well as virtues.All this makes 50/50 a film that may not leave a striking impression, but will stay with you in its spirit and its humanity - which may just be the point. It doesn't strive to be a great film, just a very good one, that diffuses some of the melodrama usually affiliated with a subject like cancer, and presents it much closer to what it would play like in reality - a part of life, one that hopefully one wouldn't have to experience, but a part of it nonetheless. It won't make any top 50 lists, nor should it, but it should be watched by everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not your typical disease of the week movie,"When I first heard that Joseph Gordon Lewitt and Seth Rogen and were going to star in this, I realized I just had to see this movie. Then I found out that IMDb said that this movie was going to be a COMEDY about cancer and I became skeptical. However, the reviews then started coming in and were mostly positive and I went in the movie with high expectations. I promise you that they were not high enough for this movie not only met but succeeded them with leaps and bounds!The plot is that Adam(JGL)has been diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer and has a 50% chance of survival, during his ilness, he learns more about what he truly had and life. His best frienld, played by the always funny Seth Rogen supports him along with his family and try to help him get through this.This not your typical disease of the week movie in which emotions are constantly being forced on you till the end and they fail to move you. As the movie moves on, Adam becomes a character you begin to root for and all I could think of was, 'please let him live'. Joseph Gordon Lewitt gives a groundbreaking performance as Adam, his best moments were the scene in the car and in the last few minutes.Seth Rogen provides perfect comic relief to this movie,this is my favorite performance from him so far and I see him in Big Roles in the future. and the jokes are balanced so perfectly with the script that they don't stray from the story. The movie is a perfect mix between comedy and drama. Its funny, it's sad and at many occasions, it's both.The acting is superb, it's beautifully directed, the song choice is awesome and placed at perfect timings. Most Importantly, I appreciate my friends and family a lot more after watching this.(I swear I got up to hug my mom at the end) Very few movies exist that made my heartache and nearly brought tears to my eyes from the sadness of what's going on, this is not one of them...because it BREAKS my heart and HAS ME CRYING like crazy in the the last few minutes.In my opinion, the best movie of 2011 and a definite must see.I give it a strong 10/10 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best original screenplay,"That is really inspiring and tells us that we should look at the positive winds in life that when someone has cancer, it's best to not let it defeat you. For example, being with friends, and finding true happiness with that special someone can help heal all pain within us all.

I could truly relate I felt the some way very good film one of a kind helped me out in my situation of depression. It is a very touching story and it tells how true people can treat someone who has cancer. I really thought I knew how it was going to end it totally surprised me. Everyone should see this. This movie is a serious piece of art''fighting cancer as a family'' something that we should start thinking new and now is the time. Best original screenplay, and best actor nods were totally deserved. I can't believe that this didn't get nominated for any Oscars. Josephs Gordon-Levitt most definitely deserved a best actor nomination. Thank you for making the best film possible for what it is like to be a Young Adult Cancer Patient.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Laugh and Cry,"I've never seen a film about cancer that was so real, that really said what needed to be said instead of cheesing everything up. I admit, it's a difficult matter to discuss without feeling you're treading on people's toes, but 50/50 does it perfectly.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Adam, is shown to be an upstanding citizen; waiting for the green man to cross the road, recycling, didn't drink, didn't smoke, that's what makes it all the more frustrating for him, and us, when he gets cancer. It not only deals with cancer, but Alzheimer's's as well, with some truly heart rendering moments. Look out for the beautiful volcano metaphor and you may guess Adam's (Gordon-Levitt) outcome.Basically, take your tissues but don't be afraid to laugh, Gordon-Levitt looks more like an alien with his shaved head than he did in 3rd Rock From The Sun. Seth Rogen offers some hilarious moments, including his analysis, ""every celebrity beats cancer,"" and Anjelica Huston is the perfect smothering mother.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I always like about reality of life.It is a feel-good and slightly comedy-drama about a young man's fight against cancer, aims to put a tear in your eye if not for long.

There's a lot of room for comedy when chances of survival are so high.,"50/50 is a fresh and original take on a very delicate subject such as cancer is, especially when it happens to a 27 years old young man. Unlike most of the other movies that have treated a similar story, 50/50 narration focuses only in the humorous aspect of it and avoids the tragic component. There are a few, subtle and very short dramatic moments in the movie, which are completely necessary to deliver a solid and realistic story, but this is a plain comedy 90% of the time, and when it's not, it really doesn't need to go for the low punch to succeed. 50/50 succeeds on involving every character around the patient and elaborating the story-telling through their relationship. In the end, this is a movie about friendship, love and family ties, and even when there's really nothing technically extraordinary about it, the result is very refreshing and entertaining. There are also some very funny gags, one of them a little dark, that made me laugh out loud. I enjoyed this movie a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Trying a cliché for a plot but succeeding in making a decent flick, 50/50 is all about introspection and livelihood","I had not really planned on seeing this one previously, but what sparked interest was the rave reviews I got from my friends. Running for the Golden Globe, they say. It deserves to be.Because it is very rare nowadays that you come across movies which doesn't contain any mushy love story- of people kissing under moonlight, running around hand-in-hand, staring at each other for a long time in the rain- but yet they manage to make you have that similar feeling, of being replete with emotions by the end.What I liked about this movie is that it doesn't make you sympathize with the protagonist-a sincere person in life, who is diagnosed with cancer-rather, it makes you walk with him, feel alienated, feel grateful and realize, that life can not be that bad no matter what happens.With a dash of humor to keep the movie from falling into that pit of boredom, director Jonathan Levine has done a memorable work with his cast, and ensured that every viewer understands the possibilities explored.There are people in the protagonists' life who let him down, there are people who stand by him, and there are some who are co-passengers in his journey- and in one way or other,everybody contributes.Not really showing what movies with such a theme usually offer(to start appreciating life all of a sudden,like never before)-since our hero is already a realist-50/50 will make to my list of movies which have titles like The Social Network, The Prestige etc.Performance-wise, I would say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt knew what he had to show, and did justice to the role. I expect him to become one of the biggest actors of the industry, in near future. He did not overdo things, and at the same time, did not make things paltry too. The right kind of expressions he had, I would say.Seth Rogen blends in well, as the quintessential friend who stays with you during tough times, but again, he is not like those typical sympathetic-he uses Levitt's medical condition to get girls-but by the end, he cares. I enjoyed Anna Kendrick's presence, and would really love to see her play in more movies.In short, a beautiful movie with promise of some really good moments, 50/50 is a surprisingly strong contender for the 84th Annual Academy Awards(yes the nominations are yet to arrive but I am positive), and also, a nice weekend-watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel good cancer story,"Joseph Levitt and Seth Rogan star in this cancer story. It is very watchable. Anna Kendrick is Levitt's therapist.

Whenever I view her, I think of her mother the famous ballerina who died suddenly in a freak car accident in the south of France. Her father John Huston could never replace her mother. And think Walter Huston was her grandfather. She is theatrical royalty. The chemo for the spinal tumor fails.

Your Typical Cancer Movie,"As described, the movie is about a 27 year old who is diagnosed with a rare kind of cancer. Sounds like an average sympathetic cancer movie, but what intrigued me to watch it is the mention of the word 'comedy'. Seems like an interesting combination and I was excited to see how these two elements blend. Nevertheless I was disappointed.Firstly, there wasn't any comedy to look forward to. The movie made you feel bad for the main character from the start till the end. The only comic relief in the movie was the atypical best friend of the protagonist who is perpetually horny. The kind of character you see in every rom com. It wasn't something you haven't already seen. All the punchlines are mentioned in the trailer, there is nothing more to it.Secondly, the characters and their back stories were thoroughly under developed. Things just happened throughout the movie without going too deep into any of it.

Other than that, this is a heart-tugging film that will leave you caring for the people in it and hoping for things to turn out the way you'd want them to. The topic of cancer, the treatment of that topic, the responses to the cancer will resonate for those who have either gone through it, known someone who has, or is involved with someone who is currently there. The emotions are honest and compelling.

It isn't every day you see something this deep still make you laugh on occasion.,"The movie is something of a wonder. A touching, perfectly balanced dramatic comedy with few missteps. It's also something of a personal story for screenwriter Will Reiser. In fact, the script is actually a sort of autobiographical story. He was diagnosed with cancer in his 20's before recovering, and this lead him to write the script to this movie.And this turns out to be the absolute highlight of 50/50. All of Reiser's characters are believably fleshed out, his pacing is completely confidant, and the movie is occasionally quite funny. But just because you see Seth Rogen's name in the credits, don't assume you'll see something completely hysterical. Reiser establishes a very deep, solemn tone that sometimes borders on depressing, but also knows when to pull back with some most welcome lightheartedness without undermining the serious issues the movie is trying to develop.And as for the cast, there's not a bad performance to be found. I can do nothing but sing their praises all day. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a tremendous, emotionally devastating performance that reveals an ever growing sadness as layers are peeled back. Seth Rogen provides the film with appropriate doses of comic relief while still keeping to the consistency of the film's dramatic tone. Bryce Dallas Howard and Angelica Huston shine wonderfully in their supporting roles. And then we get down to Anna Kendrick. I think that the film kind of played up her naivety in the film's first half a bit much, but I still couldn't help but be charmed by her sincere presence.I'm also really glad to see this one getting some awards traction.

Absolutely Brilliant,"I watched this movie as a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not entirely interested in the plot of the story as come on it's about cancer, that's a bit dark isn't it!? I was put off, thinking it would be too dreary or emotional for me and not the entertainment I look for in a film... I couldn't have been more wrong! I don't have a favourite genre, I like a bit of everything, but melodrama has got to be one of my least favourite, I would take comedy or action over it any day if given the choice. But this film is now in my all time top ten, not that you could exactly class it as melodrama, but that was the impression it gave me at first. It's got everything in it, Comedy, Drama, highs and lows. It's an emotional ride as it stays on a very serious plot line about cancer but remains funny while doing so and keeps you intrigued through great character stories played out with fantastic acting. Every person in the film delivers a ten out of ten performance with each part they play being vital to the story in whole. I could write a lot about this film as to why I liked it but I think that you should just watch it to find out for yourself as I don't want to give anything away apart from it's one of only a few films that managed to bring a tear to my eye. I would recommend it to anybody. The only reason I rated it 9 and not 10 is I dislike Seth Rogen, Don't ask me why, I just don't like the man I don't find him funny at all, however he is very strong in this and if I see him do more films like the part he played in 50/50 I may grow to change that opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The cancer dramedy,"50/50 was considered one of the best films of 2012, a comedy-drama tackling the serious subject of cancer. It would have easy for the film to fall into melodrama, sentimentality and being very much like a TV movie, but 50/50 was blessed with an excellent screenplay and a top cast.Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27-year-old radio journalist for Seattle Public Radio and man who is have problems with his girlfriend, Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). When he experiences back problem Adam goes to the doctors and it turns out he has schwannoma neurofibrosarcoma, a rare type of spiral cancer. It turns out he has a 50% chance of surviving. As Adam undergoes chemotherapy it effects relationship with his guilt ridden girlfriend, his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) who sees the cancer as a great way to get with girls, his therapist, Katherine (Anna Kendrick), his friendships with two other cancer patients and overbearing mother (Anjelica Huston).Will Reiser provided an excellent screenplay, a character driven story that is both dramatic and when it comic, genuinely very funny. There is funny dialogue and interactions between the characters and most of the cast has a moment to shine. But the comedy never distract from the drama and the characters. The characters were well written and reacted and acted believably, from characters using any old wives tale they believe to help Adam, people being sympathetic but unsure how to react when they hear the news, to Kendrick's character keeping referring to her university instead of her knowledge and experience.There is a great cast in 50/50 and there all play well defied characters. Gordon-Levitt has emerged as a great talent and shows his range with 50/50: Adam starts of as a mild manner, rather meek person who becomes more daring, outgoing and confidence after his diagnosis. Katherine's character serves as a way to deconstruct the psychological symptoms he is suffering and because of her recent studies sounds a bit more natural for her to speak like that a seasoned veteran.Whilst the main narrative is about Adam's cancer and the way it affects him and those close to him, but there are other parts of the story that should draw people in. There is the relationship between Adam and Rachael as Rachael feels compelled to be with Adam and his realisation that she is bad for him, the friendship Adam and Kyle, Adam's relationship with his mother in the third act and his blurring friendship with Katherine.Director Jonathan Levine does inject an indie-film vide to the 50/50, using indie music and musical montages, some visual tricks, for example after Adam gets high and when Adam and Kyle destroy a painting. Levine kept a very fast pace throughout and whilst the film does lean towards the drama, 50/50 is not hammed fisted and the comedy elements worked nicely. With the musical cues 50/50 has a slightly similar feel to 500 Days of Summer and continuing both films have a theme of women who are bad for their partners they work well together as companions pieces to each other.Considering the subject matter, 50/50 is an entertaining film and I can picture myself watching it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It actually works - a comedy about illness,"This was funny touching balanced realistic and entertaining movie about a young man who gets cancer.The screenplay is well written. There are laugh out loud moments which I won't give away. It's touching just when it needs to be, never depressing which is a relief. There have been some recent movies of people with cancer that haven't been good eg ""A Little Bit of Heaven"". It's a fresh approach and isn't clichéd or deja vu at all. Good dialog throughout and lots of realistic details.The characters are balanced and real. They are quite endearing and none are irritating. Bryce Dallas Howard acts well. She plays the tricky role of the girlfriend with the right touch. Seth Rogen is funny and not annoying as the best friend. Angelica Huston is surprisingly soft and good as the mother. Anna Kendrick is suitably awkward as the novice therapist. Joseph Gordon Levitt gives a very well rounded performance as the cancer victim not overacting but very convincing.Given the subject matter which could have been terribly sad this movie thoroughly succeeds as a feel good touching comedy about cancer. Quite amazing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant movie. A story that will make you reconsider things. Amazing performances !,"The movie came as a surprise me in every aspect. I picked it up by chance and well, I love chance.The movie is doubtlessly exquisite. It's somehow surprising to find a Comedy dealing with cancer without expressing some kind of disrespect to the sick people or banalising its graveness, but this movie does it almost perfectly. The movie is generally light and uplifting, with a fair amount of well-reckoned giggles, but at the same time very true and wistful at times, giving justice to anyone who had a real experience with cancer.The story of the film feels believable and real, basically because it's based on the real experience of the scenarist. All of the characters are really human and none of them is disposable or superficial.The strength of the movie stems from two sources : 1. The positive tone of the story : Although the movie is supposed to be sad and dark (A twenty-something getting an expectable cancer .. how sadder can it get ?), it turns out that the storyline takes a wholly different direction of events, turning the shock to a chance to live, and betrayal to a recovery experience. Simply put, the unexpectable positiveness of the story makes it absolutely worth watching. 2. Whilst the full cast is amazingly well chosen, the ever-close-to-perfection performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt took the spotlight, by far. The true, warm and hearty acting of the main man is THE secret ingredient of the success of this movie. Joe didn't only act out the character but embodied it in a way rarely seen nowadays. It even made me go back and watch other movies of his, and I wasn't disappointed, this man has it : Sheer talent, growing from one role to another, and blooming nice and clear in this portrayal. I was really angry when the freaking Academy didn't give him an Oscar nomination (it's not the first time Oscars disappoint me, but it felt more personal this once). Arguably, no other actor could've delivered this role the way Joseph Gordon-Levitt nailed it, thus I guess watching his pure talent overflowing in many iconic scenes is a reason by itself to watch the movie.The bottom line ? If you want to see a story that will bring Hope and Joy back to your life, if you are going through any kind of hardships and you want a breeze of happiness, if you have or had someone who had cancer, or if you simply want a great story played by amazing actors, go fetch 50/50, and watch it, NOW.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laughter is the best medicine.,"A comedy about cancer? That can't be right. Surely cancer is about as serious as it gets. The simple mention of the C-word normally fills people with dread; no one really knows how to react to it or what to say when they meet real life sufferers. However the one thing that has been clear to date is that people know not to laugh at it. That is until now.50/50 is a semi-biographical comedy/drama penned by Will Resier, based on his own personal battle against cancer. It is the sort of script that you feel could only have been written by someone who has been there themselves and boy does it show. In a film with subject matter as dark as this, delivering the right tone is essential. Too dark and you lose the film, too light and you lose the audience sympathies. It is with this in mind that Resier's script is something of a masterpiece. The tone is perfectly judged, delivering moments of genuine emotional turmoil, punctuated with relief bringing humour delivered via snappily written dialogue. This is perfectly highlighted in the moments that Adam is told he has cancer - 'I have cancer? I don't drink, I don't smoke, I exercise....I recycle....'. The whole tone of the film just feels real. You can imagine this is very close to how it was.The story begins with Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), as a healthy 27 year old working in a local radio station alongside best mate Kyle (Seth Rogan). After a period of back pain, Adam consults his doctor who after an MRI scan, diagnoses Adam with a rare form of spinal cancer with a survival rate of 50%. Supported (to various degrees) by his best mate(Rogan), girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas-Howard) and mother (Anjelica Huston), Adam embarks on a period of chemo and mental therapy, the latter delivered by the newly qualified Dr Katie (Anna Kendrick), in a bid to beat the cancer.Right from the off it is worth saying that this is Joseph Gorden-Levitt's film. Levitt as Adam delivers another hugely impressive performance, and one that had me fully engaged and rooting for him from the opening scene. He plays Adam with sensitivity and honesty, and you genuinely feel for him throughout the film. Adam is the perfect counter-balance to Seth Rogan's Kyle, whose idea of support appears to be predominately based on taking advantage of the situation to elicit Adam (and indeed himself) as much sympathy sex as possible. This brings some amusing moments, but it is later in the film as Kyle struggles to deal with the emotional aspects of the situation that Rogan really shines. Subsequent to watching the film I discovered the close friendship and history between the script writer Reiser and Rogan. This is quite astonishing and puts Rogan's performance firmly into perspective; he may well not have been acting at all.As Adam embarks on breaking the news to those close to him and indeed work colleagues (including the strangest work party I have ever seen), rather than gathering the required support base for Adam, you get the strong feeling that it is Adam who is leading everyone through this process; a bit like a support group but in reverse. Everyone struggles in situations like this and it is painful watching his relationships with his best friend, girlfriend and parents slowly unravel under the weight of uncertainty. At times Adam appears extremely lonely, and never forget lonely with a potentially fatal disease; this is heartbreaking to watch. Thankfully Adam finds solace in his newly familiar medical surroundings through fellow chemotherapy patients (played wonderfully by Philip Baker-Hall + Matt Frewer) and his therapist Dr Katie (Kendrick).It is with these two new groups that Adam begins to understand and importantly accept what is happening to him. Kendrick delivers another top class performance as Dr Katie, who as a newly qualified therapist with Adam as only her 3rd patient, is clearly still learning the ropes. The chemistry between the two of them is wonderfully awkward at times, but also very genuine. They are both new at this, but somehow Katie is able to lead Adam through his emotional roller-coaster so helping him concentrate on what is important. It is with this in mind, that one of the most powerful scenes in the film is between Adam and his mum. This genuinely emotional scene beautifully portrays the importance of the mother child relationship. It had me in floods of tears and I suspect I am not alone here.50/50 is a remarkably well judged, uplifting and strangely amusing film of which all involved should take a well deserved bow. It deals with a difficult subject matter sensitively, respectively but also I suspect from reading some other reactions to the film, very genuinely. It challenges the way we should look at difficult situations and importantly how we react to them, and with the people involved. Whilst I was initially concerned it would be a tough watch, it was one of the most genuine comedies that I have seen for some time. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bittersweet symphony,"I had the pleasure to watch this at a sneak preview. I really enjoyed its quirkiness and it's mix of drama and comedy. Jonah Hill may seem to do his known sch-tick, but if you stick around, you'll see another side to that story/coin. And he brings emotion with the (sometimes vulgar) comedy bits.Even the most unlovable character in this has something going for her. But you know what you are facing after the first few minutes. And if you like them, you will like the movie. Even if you think there are a few bumps along the ride (there are), the movie is more than worth it. One of the best films I've seen in 2012 so far. Sweet and dramatic, crass and soft and other things at once. And still manages to balance them out quite nicely.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You'll Laugh. You'll Cry.,"I know the title of this film is based on the odds of survival Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Adam is given when he's first diagnosed with cancer. But I think it also refers to the fact that half of this movie is a comedy while the other half is a tear-your-heart-out-tragedy that'll have you weeping uncontrollably (or maybe that's just me). Seth Rogan plays Adam's best friend Kyle and he's just brilliant in the movie, with the perfect mix of stoner comedy and loving friendship. And Anna Kendrick plays the young therapist who's completely unprofessional but for all the right reasons. It all adds up to a great tragic comedy or comic tragedy.8 out of 10 stars from me.

Perfect tone and a great cast make this a movie to see.,"Excellent movie. 50/50 is heartfelt and touching without being sappy or cheesy, and it doesn't hurt that it's genuinely funny at times. Great performances all around, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The guy makes all the relationships in the movie, be that with his mother, his best friend, or his psychiatrist (even his dog!) seem real. 50/50 has an excellent cast top to bottom, and the great script gives them a chance to show it.This is officially the cancer movie for people who don't like movies about cancer. I'm usually put off by this kind of film, but I was so impressed by the cast and the positive buzz around it that I had to give it a try. And I'm glad I did. What you'll find here is a refreshing take on a subject that can be really tricky to ""get right"". It's not just about Joseph's character, it's about the people around him, and it handles that in a very honest way. Can't recommend it enough, really.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The soundtrack blended perfectly and the direction was clean and ingenuitive .

An original and clever film about illness.,"When i first heard the idea of a comedy involving cancer i was a bit sceptical towards the idea as this could go so wrong if it is dealt with the wrong way. This was not the case with '50/50' as it had the perfect balance between comedy and the serious side of illness which is why i think its got such a good name.Joseph Gorden Levitt is brilliant in this film as he has been one of the actors that people have had their eye on and this is where he is going to shine. He provides a brilliant performance as the audience will want to cry and laugh with his character as he gets us so involved in the film and how he feels with the disease.At first i was worried that because it was going to be a typical Seth Rogen character that it could be a disaster but his character was perfect for the film. It seemed in the film that all of his 'cockiness' and acting a bit of an idiot like he normally does in his films was all his way of just dealing with what is going on so we sympathise for him. but he also, as always provides a lot of laughs.Levine did a great job with this film in creating the characters to be so believable and i look forward to seeing more films from him in the future.'50/50' is a great film about illness that is different than the normal all depressing stuff you will normally see in this type of film. it finds the perfect balance between comedy and the seriousness of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a sensitive movie !,"It is very sensitive and emotional film to its viewers. It is a success story of a young man who is struggled with a uncommon disease in the life.

His best close friend and his mother support him to beat this disease. By the help of them , he believes that he beats this disease whatever happened. While i was watching this film , it made me cry especially at the operation time while he is saying farewell his mother and his best friend. It is really amazing movie. It is an example the people who suffer with cancer. Also , it affects me while he was cutting his hair by himself , and i think everyone needs a friend like Kely.

What a tragic film,"One of the most meaningful film that i have ever watched. Because the events which occur in the film is so similar to the real life. In the film, one man's life are told. Firstly, he is healthy. But later some problems occurred. He learned his disease. His disease was cancer. There are many events occurred after that. For example, his girlfriend broke up from him, then he meet with some problems with his best friend. But while the bad things is go on, some good things happened. For example, he meet the doctor. And the doctor helped him in many cases. The other good event is his family. he has not seen his family since long time. When he become ill, his family came to beside him. Because they wanted to help him. I think one of the most important factor about the cancer disease is patience. It is emphasized successfully in the film. And the other important view of film is love. Even the real love. The doctor loved him whether he healthy or not.I recommend everyone to watch this film. The all scenes in the film reflects the reality of life. It is not known what will be tomorrow. The name of the film is so appropriate with the idea of film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A perfectly fine, honest, little movie!","Once you start thinking about it, it's quite amazing how few cancer related movies there are. Isn't it like 1 out 4 people gets cancer at a point during his life? In other words, everybody is effected by the disease now days, whether it is as a patient or as a relative- or close one. Everybody knows probably at least 1 person who had been diagnosed with cancer and chances are you lost a relative or loved one by the disease already. So with all the dramatic movies about the strangest diseases and conditions in the world; how come so few of them are about cancer? Sure, there are plenty of movies in which a character is suffering or dies from cancer but there are so few movies which chronicles entirely the life of a cancer patient, from the first diagnosis till his/hers death or cure.It's almost like there is still a taboo on the subject, though a more plausible explanation would perhaps be that it's hard to come up with a gripping and original story, that doesn't become melodramatic or extremely predictable. And this movie does cleverly avoid all of the clichés by not going for an all dramatic approach to its subject.It's probably true that this movie is not emotional as heavy or effective as it could had been but that's OK. I prefer a honest movie above a melodramatic one anyway. And this movie does feel like a very honest and straightforward one. The movie shows it's not all crying and pain when you have cancer but there is also still room for laughter and plenty of other emotions.And this is where the movie its greatest strength lies really. Yes, it's above all things still a drama but with a warm and comedic twist to it as well. The blend of drama and comedy might sound unusual, especially when considering its subject but it works out really well for the movie. It makes the movie feel incredibly sincere about its subject, without ever becoming a too heavy one, though at the same time you could still say its a bit of a tearjerker, which should mostly come from the fact that lots of moments in this movie should be recognizable, in one way or another, for some people.What I also loved about the movie was how unpredictable it was. The story doesn't really progress in the way you would think. As a matter of fact, once you start thinking about it, the movie is hardly about the cancer itself really. The movie doesn't show or tell you all that much about the development or potential dangers and side-effects of the disease but its focusing way more on all of its characters and how they are coping with it all.The approach this movie is taking is just great and refreshingly original. It's a really good job by director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser. You can tell director Jonathan Levine has an history in short and independent film-making, which gives the movie the right required tone, approach, pacing and overall atmosphere, which all of the actors and their characters also truly benefit from.The characters all truly feel like some really realistic ones. They are some everyday persons, being faced by something horrible, which they are all dealing with in their own way. The one is too worried and overprotective, the other just doesn't know how to handle it, while the other is using it to pick up some girls with. It's this diversity that makes this a very warm, honest, rich and colorful movie.And I really wish I would have a friend like Seth Rogen's character, if I ever got diagnosed with cancer. His character is perhaps the biggest surprise of the movie. The biggest surprise because it actually works out! You would think his humor and antics would be out of place in this movie but it adds really a lot to it. Yes, Seth Rogen is great in this but so it the rest of the cast really! It might earn the movie some Oscar-nods perhaps.One of this year's greats!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a genuine surprise,"FAR exceeded expectations. May even be one of my favorite films of the year - combines some of the comedy one might expect from the Rogen/Goldberg camp, but with really surprisingly strong drama that is carried a lot by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of the most reliably strong actors of his age (which is pretty close to mine). Jonathan Levine takes a very personal story by Will Reiser, who had his own cancer story, and doesn't do too much to make it overtly funny or melodramatic.Like his previous film The Wackness, he knows when to add a little style (when Adam takes his first weed in a while at the hospital, the world around him is in a fog, but he's so glad to be alive even when he sees a dead body go by he laughs), and then he knows when to just let the actors take the scenes where they need to go. Everyone feels like real people, which seems to be a rare commodity coming out of Hollywood, though a strength is that it doesn't feel like it's been touched by a lot of hands or committees.In fact, this is the movie I was hoping for out of Funny People, the Apatow film from a couple of years ago which also had Rogen as the buddy of a guy suffering from a possibly deathly ailment and going through some serious existential business. Here the stakes are really felt since the lead guy, and most around him save for one big exception are good people who want to do right and sometimes just find it so hard (Bryce Dallas Howard's cheating girlfriend, who still feels human even as the closest thing to this film's antagonist).In short - a film that's funny when it wants to be (and is), and is genuinely sad and heartfelt when it must be, with especially Levitt and Huston pulling their weight as top tier talent (though Rogen and Kendrick do their fare share too). 50/50 is that little dramedy which could really make an impact on the people who won't feel shy or turn away from what's been advertised solely as a ""cancer comedy"", which is not entirely accurate.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good balance of drama and comedy,"Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is 27 years old, has a loving girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), works as a writer for a local radio station and is a genuine nice guy. Life is good, until he learns that he has a rare case of spinal cancer, leaving him with a 50% chance to survive it. With the help of his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his overprotective mother (Anjelica Huston) and the young postgraduate therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick), he tries to tackle chemotherapy. Everyone has their own way to handle Adam and his disease, but is there really a way to help him as the cancer starts to take its tolls?This movie is inspired by a true story, the story of the writer Will Reiser, and Seth Rogen was really his friend in those hard times in real life. Now, combining drama and comedy is something difficult to do, but the director Jonathan Levine and writer Will Reiser manage to keep it at a good balance, at 50/50 if you like, without melodramatising it or turning it into a laughing stock. The story may pick up slow, but gets really good, revealing the difficulties Adam has to face and the friendship he receives. What I also like about the movie is the lack of romance. Sure, there is this thing going on, but it's really subtle and the movie would be about the same without it. They are not ruining the touching plot with a cheesy love story. On the story downside, there are a few things that seem neglected, like Adam's job or his old greyhound Skeletor. They are not important for the story, but the way they are introduced and sometimes mentioned, you get the feeling that there should be more to it. Levitt's acting is really good and you can feel all the different moods and stages his character goes through. And I'm really surprised, that Rogen cannot only play the funny parts, but the serious ones as well. It's also mainly thanks to his contribution, that the movie avoids drifting into a depressing one and can keep its drama/comedy balance. The characters are likable and generally played well. Overall quite a good movie to recommend. So, unless you prefer mindless action flicks or stupid comedies, go see this one, I enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

50/50 chance of being nominated for best picture,"This movie has received raves from every critic that I've heard from so going in I had very high expectations. Thankfully they were met. 50/50 is a superb film that tells the story of a man diagnosed with Cancer at an early age and finds out his odds are 50/50. First thing first, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favorite actors and this is such a tremendous performance. One scene towards the end of the movie brought me to tears because he was so good. Seth Rogen plays the same basic role, however he isn't annoying in this movie. He does go a little over the top at times but it isn't anything overly dramatic. The script written by Seth Rogen's best friend Will Reiser is based on his story of going through the process of learning that he had Cancer and how he dealt with it (Reiser not Rogen just to be clear). This is well directed and extraordinarily paced. The thing that impresses me most about this film besides Joseph is the fact that I never once asked myself how much longer the film was while watching. I was so engaged and into the story that I was just watching the movie and not thinking about anything else. That RARELY happens with me. It will be a crime if this film isn't nominated for Best picture, screenplay, actor, and supporting cast members (not all). I can understand if people are hesitant on seeing this movie for fear of it being too depressing given the subject matter but I assure you that it is a joy to watch. It has great comedy in it and while emotional it's just too good to miss. Please do not deny yourself the pleasure of watching this amazing film. It is worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good movie,"It is a good movie that i liked it. It is comedy and drama. The actors and actresses were so successful that they played very well. In this film, you can find things that in your life, for instance, the patient who is cancer and his cure process and his getting rid of cancer, except from this, there is a woman who is so helpful. I can say that comedy is not so much when compared to drama, that's these two items are so balanced. Apart from these, i want to say good things about the director and other workers in this film. They did their best, subsequently this film was turned up. Adam (Gordon-Levitt) is a mild-mannered who lives in Seattle with his girlfriend. His life takes a sudden and dramatic turn when he learns his illness. As he tries to understand his problem, he meets a beautiful therapist who is very helpful about his illness. Before long, Adam's complex relationship with his girlfriend makes him dump her, and his closest friend and mother support him about it. As the severity of his condition increases, Adam begins to reassess his life, his relationships and then in the cure, he likes his therapist and they start new life. In brief, it is a good movie, it can make you laugh or cry, but I recommend you to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
perfect,"It is one of the most impressive film for me. Because there is an idea in every scene of the film. While i was watching, i really enjoyed. But some part of the film i was affected. And also it gave many advice to us. First one is patience. Because in this film the man who is main character of film got cancer. He is struggled to many situation. He encountered lots of problem. For example, his best friend. The another main problem is, his girlfriend. It is so strange for me. When his girlfriend learned his illness he broke up his boyfriend. If you really love someone you should never divorce or break up. Except some situations. The another idea in this film is patience. Patience is one of the difficult aspect of life. But at the end of the patience, almost everything changes. And also in the film of 50/50 many thing changed. After got ill, he met the doctor. And he loved her. The doctor helped his about most important points. She supported him for being patient. This type of events can be live in the real life. That's why i said this film is the copy of real life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In addition to, mother of Adam who he could not get along with her in past supported to him. I was waiting a happy ending.

"So honest movie, so real","I am sure that my review will be more than short, because I have not so many details to say (the other 'critic' obviously had to say sooo much). This movie is really fantastic.What is the most interesting for all of us? Not so see how a man can beat 20 other guys, or to jump 5 meters up, it can be interesting, but we are very fascinated when we see THE REAL LIFE, pictured the way it really is. That's why, if the story is greatly and honestly said, some very ordinary things can be so refreshing, even though they are so normal and there is nothing special in them. But, they talk about us, about our lives.I expected some real drama and when I saw 'comedy' in your page, I had some doubts. What can be funny in being sick? But, the movie gave the answer. Such a tragedy is full of all specter of emotions and events: humor, denial, sadness, love, disaster, fear, saying goodbye, desire to live, desire to end up the whole suffering,..., and this GREAT movie gave us ALL.Its major value is its reality. All what you can expect in case of cancer, it is there. It is not some crying story, so predictable, so dark, this movie just nailed this topic.I am really satisfied when some 'predictable' movie surprised me so much. I am touched, I was crying, I was laughing..., just excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seth Rogen in a different role,"If you've paid attention to cinema for the past decade, you'll probably recognize Seth Rogen as the guy who wants to spend eternity smoking pot with his friends while they discuss bodily functions. But he gets a different role in Jonathan Levine's ""50/50"". He plays the friend of a cancer-stricken radio journalist (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). The movie manages to balance comedy and drama, as the friends have their usual fun while the neurofibrosarcoma-stricken Adam gets ready for chemotherapy. In the process, we meet Adam's overprotective mother, her Alzheimer's-afflicted husband, and some other people. Probably the most interesting character in the movie is Anna Kendrick's therapist-in-training. New to her job, she does what she has to.So, this is a movie that shows that even these guys who mostly star in silly movies can be versatile. Which is not to subtract from the performances of Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer. A fine piece of work.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Based on  a true story, absolutely fantastic!","This movie is fantastic! For those who are complaining about a comedy about cancer, how it is inappropriate, blah blah blah...they need to realize that Will Reiser who wrote this screenplay is a cancer survivor. He and Seth Rogan are real life friends and this movie is based on/inspired by their journey through Will's illness. So whoever wants to whine about it being inappropriate should eat their words.This film is the story of a younger man struggling with cancer, how he deals with possibly facing death, and how his friends support him. It's an interesting take on a very serious subject, but I think it is very realistic and shows a different side that most movies involving illness like this are afraid to show. Adam grows as a person while going through something most people cannot even imagine and develops new friendships with fellow cancer patients, a flirtatious relationship with his therapist, and examines the other relationships in his life.Anyway, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is awesome in this film. Anna Kendrick is amazing. Seth Rogan is hilarious, as always. I absolutely recommend this movie. Its funny, its sad, its uplifting. Definitely a must-see!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Slyly Comic and Ultimately Poignant Take on the Dreaded ""Cancer"" Film","Believe it or not, I wanted to see this movie based on just one line I heard in the trailer. Anna Kendrick's openly naïve therapist character says it to Adam Lerner, the cancer-stricken, 27-year-old protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt - ""You can't change your situation. The only thing you can change is how you deal with the situation."" It's a predictable bromide but one that spoke to me at that very moment since I just got laid off from my job the day prior. Facing life's unexpected twists is what this 2011 dramedy is about, and director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser find a poignant, funny and off-kilter way of handling a standard Lifetime TV-movie subject without losing respect for the characters. The film tows a fine line dramatically, but perhaps because Reiser has first-hand knowledge of spinal cancer from his own personal experience, the story doesn't lose its footing.The film focuses on Adam, a Seattle-based NPR staffer whose comfortable life is turned upside down when he learns he has malignant tumors along his spine. With little empathy, the oncologist tells him he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Buoyed by his boisterous best friend Kyle, Adam tries to remain optimistic despite his overbearing mother Diane, who wants to move in with him right away despite acting as a caretaker for his father, an Alzheimer's victim. Remaining disturbingly distant is Adam's artist girlfriend Rachael who promises to stand by him and nurse him back to health. However, as he goes through his chemotherapy, her commitment to him unravels. The movie addresses the bitter irony of how those one would expect support Adam without condition are the ones who are the most likely to fail. At the same time, he grows closer to two fellow cancer patients, as well as Katherine, the awkward young therapist who utters the line that rings so true for Adam.The acting is effective without excess. As a last-minute replacement for James McAvoy (""X-Men: First Class""), Gordon-Levitt gives a nice, self-effacing performance as Adam that feels right for the passivity needed for the role. Playing a version of his real self since he is Reiser's best buddy and the one who encouraged him to write the script, Seth Rogen provides manic, shaggy-dog energy to Kyle as a direct counterpoint to Adam and then surprises by deepening his character as the story progresses. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Rachael as a more subtle version of the malevolent character she played in ""The Help"", but she may be in danger of stereotyping herself in like-minded roles. Kendrick also plays a variation of a previous role as the ambitious careerist in ""Up in the Air"", but she does a better job of transcending her character's youthful exuberance this time. Easily stealing her few scenes, Anjelica Huston brings back her much-missed ferocity to Diane. Unlike most, this is a most worthwhile ""cancer"" movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A salty-sweet heartbreaking-heartwarming tragicomedy,","False advertising: it's the reason why so many people are disappointed with so many movies. A film's trailers and television spots are what convinces so many of us to go to the movies, and if a film's advertising is misleading, it is usually anything but a good thing. I've never seen a falsely advertised movie have better end results than ""50/50"". The film was marketed as a laugh-out-loud comedy in the vein of ""The Hangover"" and ""Superbad"". It's nothing like either of those movies, and oh, was I happy about that.First of all, I find very few gross-out comedies to be soulful and important. For the most part, they are just throwaway fluff that are impossible to be remembered. ""50/50"" is definitely more of a drama than a comedy, which can be assumed from its premise alone.It follows Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man who re-examines his life after a terminal cancer diagnosis. His diagnosis is some rare kind of spinal cancer, and his chance of survival is at about 50/50. He intends to learn what matters in life, and to live every minute to its fullest, knowing that any one of those minutes could be his last. His profane and ignorant best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) and his young therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) supply him with optimism and humor when he needs it the most.There has been a television show running for the past few years, with a similar concept called ""The Big C"", and this is pretty much that same kind of story. I love ""The Big C"", I think that it handles its difficult and horribly sad concept wonderfully, never making anything too dour or bleak, thanks to a much-needed sense of humor, however, despite being a fantastic series, not many people have seen ""The Big C"". What ""50/50"" is doing is basically telling the same story to a wider audience, and that's okay because of how strong it is on its own.Being decidedly more a drama than a comedy, it has the pathos and dramatic flare that I expected, but it has a way of surprising the audience. It had me crying actual tears, and then laughing audibly a moment later. It's more dramatic than funny, although it is also very very funny. The most refreshing part was that it didn't try too hard to be a laugh-out-loud comedy. It appears effortless, but it definitely works.Also, the supporting cast is dead-on. Anna Kendrick plays Adam's therapist, Katherine, a grad student working on her doctorate, whose third patient (ever) is Adam. Anjelica Huston plays Adam's overbearing mother, whose husband is dying of Alzheimer's. Huston gives a fiercely funny, yet understated performance. Bryce Dallas Howard is sure on a role. She seems to have a knack for playing terrible people. Between this and her role in ""The Help"" earlier this year, I wouldn't be surprised if her next role featured her kicking a puppy.I think I'm a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan. I loved his work in ""500 Days of Summer"", and he plays the easy-to-root-for everyman very well. I think Seth Rogen is funny, but he can easily be overkill. He plays the same role in every movie in which he stars, I find. However, he's clearly there for comic relief in this film, and he does his job fairly well.I also have to applaud the script by Will Reiser, which is apparently semi-autobiographical. I think the right actors were clearly chosen, and everything fell into place from there, but this kind of film could be a disaster without the right screenplay. It shouldn't have been as good as it was, if I think about it. I don't know why I love ""The Big C"" as much as I do, but that and ""50/50"" share the same nuance and attitude about life and death, which I really appreciate. While not quite asking the ""big questions"" (reincarnation, meaning of life, etc), ""50/50"" seems very wise and very intelligent. It's the best case of false advertising in recent memory.Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

it is a very good film,"The film is a comedy-drama. This film,we can see the balance between comedy and drama. The main actor in the film is a 27 years old man called Adam. Adam Larner,a young man who finds out that he has cancer. He feels in complex emotions due to cancer. After he gets cancer,he becomes so thin and faint. He loses interest in life and loses his confidence gradually. This movie adapted from reality. The name of the film is fairly considerable. Because, a very difficult situation in which there will be a 50/50 chance to survive. The actor and actresses are high qualified. I think, performers are very good with acting their roles. Adam's friend Kyle constantly tries to make Adam secure and happy. Adam's therapist Anna Kendrick, plays her supporting role admirably. With the help of his best friend Kyle and his young therapist Kendrick, he struggle to beat cancer. This is great story of human emotion and friendship.

A different take on cancer. Genius.,"I chose to watch this movie simply because my father and I could not find anything that suited both of our tastes. 50/50 didn't seem too dumb (his taste) or too rom-com (my taste). We sure did get lucky with this one. The movie had a little bit of everything without being too much, it's difficult to explain but this is a must see. There were funny parts, romantic parts, and sad parts - so it's hard to really put it into a category. It's kind of a category of its own really. One of the things I enjoyed most is how they portrayed cancer, and how they showed the toll it takes on everyone involved. It was so real. Nothing was sugar coated, I feel like it was a true story. The movie itself was so creatively made and different from anything I have ever seen. All of the actors were perfect for their rolls, and although Rogan is known for funny pointless rolls he did great in this. He kept true to his funny-guy reputation while still having a serious side which was perfect for his character. This is a movie I think mostly anyone would enjoy and instantly became one of my favorites. I will be recommending to everyone. NOW GO WATCH.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cancer comedy that's actually funny,"You're in a job you like, in denial about your struggling relationship, and you're not particularly close to your parents as your father is suffering from Alzheimer's and your mother is so much more emotional than you are that it's difficult to carry on a conversation with her. Then you get the news that changes your whole life. Is that the makings of a comedy? Will Reiser thought so and it's inspired by his life.Adam Lerner (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a producer for public television whose live-in girlfriend Rachael (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is a struggling artist. While they were not talking about it, it appears a break-up is inevitable. Adam's best friend Kyle (played by Seth Rogen) is urging him towards the door but Adam is unconvinced. Then, during a doctor's appointment he made to resolve back pains that wouldn't go away, he's given the news. He has a tumor on his spine and if he doesn't subject himself to chemotherapy and then surgery, he'll die. Kyle (Rogen) is determined to keep his friend in a positive mindset. Rachael (Howard) is given an out but doesn't take it and decides, instead, to remain with Adam and is supportive, at least at first. Meanwhile, his insurance also covers visits to a psychologist. That ends up being something of a double-edged sword as the in-house psychologist, Katherine McKay (played by Anna Kendrick), is very inexperienced.This is the second film in just over two years to feature a comedic take on a serious illness and Seth Rogen in a significant role. The first being 2009's Funny People with Adam Sandler. Having seen both, I can say unequivocally that 50/50 is not just a better film, but a great film. There are solid performances from all the cast, an interesting story and a satisfying conclusion that doesn't appear too good to be true. See this immediately.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Vidiot Reviews...,"50/50An individual using his or her terminal illness in order to get a date is as repugnant as someone using Match.com to get one.But that hasn't stopped the young sufferer in this dramedy from using pity to get into girls pants.Adam's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) world crumbles when he receives word that his chronic back pain is actually the result of cancer.Unable to deal with his recovery, his girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) dumps him, leaving only his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) to lean on during his chemotherapy.To help his emotional state, Adam starts seeing a novice therapist (Anna Kendrick), at the same time he re-enters the dating scene, both of which beget awkward situations.An upfront depiction of the devastating disorder, 50/50 eases the disease's depressing disposition with brash comedy and incessant optimism.Incidentally, cancer is particularly tragic for single men, since single women already dislike bald guys.

This is not an ordinary drama.,"Movies about illness are expected to be sentimental and dramatic. But the director Jonathan Levine blended this true story with comedy aspect and turned it to a movie.

Shockingly good,"I was amazed by this movie. I mean Joseph Gordon-Levitt always plays such dull boring characters and Seth Rogan can only play one character. Strangely they both play their usual roles and yet, it works in this movie.So Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds out he has cancer. A fairly rare case in which there will be a 50/50 chance to survive. In this movie we get to see him cope with the issue, and come to terms with the possibility of his death as does his best friend (Seth Rogan), his family, his girlfriend, and his new, inexperienced, young, attractive, therapist (Anna Kendrick).What I loved about this one was that it was not a sad story. Even in the worst of times this movie takes a humorous approach that works well, and not in too much of a way that makes you not take it seriously. We saw Seth Rogan in this kind of movie with Adam Sandler(Funny People) and it was a miserable FAIL. I think Joseph Gordon-Levitt's sort of straight man, dull quality is what really made this one different.Seth Rogan was OK, he always does a good job with his characters but then again he only plays that one stoner who never grew up, which, let's face it, its him. I think Anna Kendrick played her inexperienced psychologist role pretty well, I have seen her in plenty of other films, but she had never really had a stand out character and this was one where she did well.This movie is a not a comedy, yet has enough comedy in it that its very hard to call it drama as well.I really didn't want to see this one and did it begrudgingly. I am glad I did it was well worth it. Even if you don't like weepy sad stories that make you think about mortality, or illness, which I am usually not a fan either, this one is good enough to keep you laughing and not feel to terrible bad afterwards.Like my reviews, hate em?

50/50 is great! I can't imagine anyone not loving this film!,"Short Version: I loved it! It was both heart-wrenchingly emotional as well as laugh-out-loud funny. I would recommend any person to watch this movie.Long Version: It was almost flawless as both a comedy and a drama film, and managed to mix the two together quite nicely. The first thing I must say about this movie is that the acting is INCREDIBLE. I definitely expect some awards in these actors' futures! On the acting front, of course the leads (Joseph Gordon Levitt, Seth Rogen) did an amazing job, but the supporting cast was also amazing! In particular, Anjelica Houston stood out to me. She did an amazing job as Adam's mother in the film and must be recognized for going rather far from her type-cast (To be honest, I did not recognize her at first). Another supporting star was the gorgeous Anna Kendrick. Her role in this film was paramount. Anna did an excellent job as the ""newbie therapist""; She certainly brought a realness to the film. Other things that should be noted are the setting: Beautiful Seattle. Also, the writing in this script is phenomenal. Will Reiser did an incredible job of making the film fluent and smooth.

An Emotional Roller-coaster,"Films that deal with sensitive issues in a comedic fashion run the risk of being to trivial and not giving enough light on the dark matter that is at hand. 50/50 however takes this risk and succeeds in it's efforts. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, a young, healthy individual who is shocked to find he has a rare type of cancer with only a 50/50 chance of survival. Finding a comedic side of this is hard but director Jonathan Levine makes it so the characters bring a comical side to how they deal with the situation, rather than poking fun at the tragic event itself.Going into this film I had reservations having the memory of watching Adam Sander in 'Funny People' which failed to make me laugh, cry or feel any emotion at all. It came to my surprise however how 50/50 managed to change the emotion I was feeling within in minutes but doing so in a seamless way. This was mainly due to the central performance by Levitt who blew me away with how calm he kept his character throughout despite the desolate situation he is in. It's also worth noting that Seth Rogan, who plays Adam's best friend, Kyle, managed not to bring the obnoxious, drugged up performance he usually does but a realistic and touching approach to a friend who tries bring his friend through this time.50/50 is one of the best films I've seen this year. It deals with a dark issue while managing to keep a smile on your face throughout. It never minimalises the seriousness of cancer and never over exaggerates it. It keeps it on a perfect balance and is a film that's message is it's all going to be okay.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfectly Pitched,"As has no doubt been mentioned in every other review here, a young man's fight against cancer is not obvious comic material. To call this movie merely a comedy, however, doesn't give enough credit to the touching and sensitive handling of the subject matter.It would be so easy to veer into areas of dubious taste with the humour or to go overboard with the sentimentality of it all, but this film does neither. When watching in the cinema I could clearly hear the same people both laughing and crying.I can also do nothing but applaud the acting and the script. Seth Rogen does what you expect him to do and does it well. Anna Kendrick is so likable in all of the movies i've seen her in and this is no exception. Sooner or later that'll probably become annoying, but not yet. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding and Anjelica Huston adds some gravitas.One of the most worthwhile movies of the year without a doubt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50,"A dramedy about cancer is a proper hard-sell in the market, this wee budget film (although JGL and Seth Rogan are quite bankable names among their peers) has done a quite solid battle in the box-office last year (domestic total gross is $35 million against its $8 million budget), due to its very heartfelt closeness and touchingness of its concoction of the three- faceted narrative (love, friendship and family) revolving around our young protagonist who has been through an ordeal of a very rare spine cancer.Adopted from a true event of the screenwriter Will Reiser (who is a close friend of Rogen and takes on an ephemeral cameo too), the film has a rare pluck and daintiness in reciting the story from a very earthly perspective, no flamboyant hyperbole, the plot goes through a carefully measured but innately captivating melodrama (although the big question of the survival of the operation had never been doubted, the bare truth is the screenwriter himself is still alive!), it could be reckoned as a sequel of (500) DAYS OF SUMMER (2009, 8/10), JGL continues to generate his congenial drawing power through the rough road of a young man's battle with the malignant tumour, most of the time, he exercises a pleasingly lifelike mechanism to embody himself to his character without showing off the edginess and dominance which could be easily sensed. Seth Rogen mainly serves as a crude but kind- hearted friend (still too coarse with his sex-oriented jokes). Anna Kendrick is another mainstay of the film, utterly adorable and convincing as the rookie shrink, slightly uptight but accurately vivid (she is among my top 5 list of best supporting actress and JGL is inside my top 10 list of best leading actor). Ms. Howard again (after THE HELP, 2011, 8/10) finds herself in a very dislikable role, hope her career path will not be pigeonholed into the ""bitch"" category; Anjelica Huston, this time is quite far from her usual majesty, instead renders her prowess to manage a less glamorous presentation of a nagging but loving mother.Director Jonathan Levine's next film is the new TWILIGHT wannabe WARM BODIES (2013), one should feel confident that at least it will catch up with the closeness and touchingness in spite of over-exploiting the (vampire) zombie-cum-romance territory.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well crafted film,"¨A tumor? Me? That doesn't make any sense though. I mean... I don't smoke, I don't drink... I recycle.¨50/50 was recently nominated for the Golden Globes in the Best Comedy category, and deservingly so, but it could've just as well been included in the Best Drama category because the movie manages to find a perfect balance between comedy and drama. 50/50 isn't a hilarious movie, it really deals with some serious issues and it has its melodramatic moments, but it is difficult not to smile at this emotional movie. Director Jeremy Levine manages to put together a well crafted film that while at one moment has you holding out the tears, at the next has you laughing at the way some of these characters respond to the life threatening disease. It's a very difficult film to direct, but Levine manages to make a great movie thanks to a good story, a smart script, and a great cast. This is Levine's third film after debuting with the horror/comedy All the Boys Love Mandy Lane which I guess in a way was the beginning of this trademark for him in which he mixes up some genres. The script was perfect as well, managing the transitions from drama to comedy really well. Will Reiser actually wrote the script based on his personal life so I am sure this project was very personal for him, but it couldn't have been done better by anyone else. Reiser was actually pushed to write the script by his friend Seth Rogen who actually plays the same part in the movie that he did in real life, since it was in Rogen that Reiser found the support to deal with the diagnosis.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is only 27 years old when his life completely turns around after being diagnosed with a rare cancer disease and only has a 50/50 chance of surviving. He seemed to have a perfect life working as a writer for a radio program, living with his beautiful girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard), and always counting on his High School buddy Kyle (Seth Rogen) for a fun time. The diagnosis changes his life although at first he tries to continue being his normal self. Rachael and Kyle both decide to support Adam in their unusual ways, and Adam begins seeing a young therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) that the hospital has assigned to him to deal with the situation. She isn't very experienced and is actually a pretty bad therapist, but does her best to try to help Adam. Rachael doesn't even want to accompany Adam while he is in chemotherapy and only drops him off in the hospital entrance. Adam makes some new friends in the hospital during their therapy sessions together: Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and introduced them to Kyle as well. As Adam's relationship with Rachael begins to deteriorate he finds more comfort in his friends and his therapist. Adam also grows closer to his overprotecting mother, Diane (Anjelica Huston), who already has a lot on her plate taking care of his sick father. The story is really well written and makes for an entertaining film and some memorable characters.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a great actor although sometimes he doesn't get the recognition he deserves. He always chooses great characters and interesting roles to play. In 50/50 he is absolutely wonderful making his character very believable while responding to the terrible disease. Seth Rogen plays his usual self, although in this movie it makes sense that he does since he is actually playing himself and I am sure many of the things he says in the movie are really the things he said to Reiser in real life. Bryce Dallas Howard has to try to play a different role soon because she is being type cast into these sort of bad girlfriend roles. It would be good to see her play something other than being the villain. Anna Kendrick is great as always with her unique sense of humor, although she doesn't shine as much as she did in Up in the Air, but of course she didn't get enough screen time this time. Anjelica Huston is great as always. The cast really does a terrific job in this movie and I guess it's because they had interesting characters to work with. The balance between the comedy and the drama is just perfect making this Levine's best film by far. This movie has its similarities with another Seth Rogen film, Funny People, which I also liked, but I think 50/50 is much better crafted and balances the drama with the comedy much better than the previous movie (mainly because Funny People never really worked as well as a comedy, but 50/50 really does). I really enjoyed this movie and found the way it dealt with cancer and its characters was really well crafted. By all means don't miss this great movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It charges into a devilishly tricky frontier (melding drama with comedy, with a serious subject attached) and comes out virtually scar-less","I had a fair deal of doubts and suspicions walking into ""50/50"" because I knew that the territory it was delving into is a devilishly tricky and uncertain one: taking a subject as serious and relevant as cancer and using it as the groundwork for a movie that is half-comedy, half-drama. To be honest, a couple of times, it did reaffirm some of my pre-screening doubts. An early-on joke about Patrick Swayze, in particular, I felt crossed the line and sparked a burst of anger in me. However, apart from my few qualms and some uneven twists in the picture, ""50/50"" turned out to be quite a special little movie. And although it charged into that dangerous, borderline-taboo territory so boldly, it came out on the other side with virtually no scars to speak of.The movie was meant to be taken as a pure comedy in its opening sequence and it was here that I found my gripes. The way it treats the diagnosis of the main character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the early-on interactions between him and Seth Roger, were playing jokes with the subject of cancer and cancer patients, I felt, a little too brazenly. Virtually all of us have, at some point in our lives, met or known somebody ill with cancer. I am no exception and therefore a couple of the gags made me feel upset as opposed to amused. But that was early on, all contained within the first 30 minutes.After that point, ""50/50"" wields its dual-genre identity with astonishing deftness. My apprehensions were crushed as Mr. Rogen, as Mr. Gorden-Levitt's lifelong friend, helped him to try and live a little more before his untimely fate, whatever it may be, should roll around. The squeamish relationship between the protagonist and Bryce Dallas Howard at the beginning later turns out to be squeamish for a reason, as it opens up doors for a far more interesting, if predictable, dynamic. The said dynamic being between Mr. Gordon-Levitt as the cancer patient and an up-and-coming starlet named Anna Kendrick, as his counselor. I'll admit it, the outcome of their dynamic is by no means unexpected; anybody even remotely familiar with romantic comedies can see it coming from the word go. But the sharp writing and the charisma by the two talents involved make up for it and their relationship, I happily confess, is one of the more involving elements of the picture.The picture's dramatic architecture becomes surprisingly powerful, very close to (what I consider the pinnacle of movies dealing with the subject of cancer and life and death) Akira Kurosawa's ""Ikiru."" But it melds this magnificently with its sense of humor. And it accomplishes this, after the opening third, by making jokes about things that you might otherwise expect to be from a movie devoid of a deadly disease twisting the plot. Mr. Gordon-Levitt and Mr. Rogen make a great comical combination and share a number of humorous moments together, the biggest laugh being one where they take out their anger upon a canvas painted by an ex-girlfriend and then proclaim they ought to hang it back up, now that it's deformed and full of holes. Other great moments center around Matt Frewer and the late Philip Baker Hall as a group of elderly cancer patients, who ease the pain of their disease by cracking some jokes about it. Jokes that you would expect a cancer patient to make. And that is the key to where the movie can pull gags with its sensitive subject and succeed.""50/50"" is not without its faults. Apart from some iffy, insensitive jokes toward the beginning, the movie's photography by Terry Stacey is not Academy Award-worthy. The interiors are too gloomy and the exteriors are so soft it made me wonder if the cameramen ever heard of white balance. Anjelica Huston, as the patient's mother, frets too much before she even has a reason to fret about, and does not, until the very end, fulfill the dynamic the screenwriters obviously intended. It seemed more superficial to me than dramatic. And the pointless sex (oh, the pointless sex scene! How many times have we seen thee!)...well, I think I've repeated my opinion on that more than enough times in recent years. But in the end, the movie does come across with enormous sweeps of dramatic power and bombastic explosions of gut-busting humor, perfectly melding them together so that we laugh when we're meant to laugh and cry when we're meant to cry. As 2011 comes closer to an end, and the credits of ""50/50"" started to roll, I sat there in the theater thinking to myself: ""Maybe this won't have been such a bad year, after all.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly deep comedy,"I went into this movie knowing what it was going to be about, but I didn't realize how mature it was going to be. Considering that nowadays many comedies are just plain ridiculous, with terrible plot lines and unoriginal jokes, this was quite refreshing. It is definitely a comedy, and I guarantee you you will laugh in some spots, but it also gets pretty dramatic, especially towards the end.Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a terrific job, and Seth Rogen was funny, as always. The supporting cast, especially Bryce Dallas Howard, also did great work, and helped make this one of the best comedies produced in recent years.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It is a see-saw ride with moments of emotional introspect mixed with crude insensitive humor. Watch it for Lewitt and Kendrick,"Filled with a good sense of tumor!! That was bad, too corny. But thankfully the movie isn't. I've always felt a great sense of connection with Joseph Gordon-Lewitt's character in 500 Days of Summer and it extends to this movie too. A little disappointment is Seth Rogen's character that intrudes and demands attention but has nothing entertaining to say.Adam (Lewitt) is highly health conscious and practical. He is in a deteriorating relationship on denial mode. But a bigger jolt tumbles his world when he realizes he has a rare form of cancer and his chances are 50/50. This affects his practical nature too paving way for irrationality. Shuns his worried mother, dumps his caring girlfriend Rachel (Dallas Howard) who was intending to breakup just before he got sick but sticks around when she finds out, suspects his insensitive buddy Kyle (Rogen) of being selfish when he is trying to cheer him up. Finally he finds solace from his shrink Katie (Kendrick) who just started practicing - starting from him. He can't accept his fate but puts a brave face.After showering enough praise on Lewitt, another star of the show is Anna Kendrick. I was a little skeptical when she was awarded an academy nomination for 'Up in the Air' but realized her potential for little nuances only here. There are few characters and they are realistic and well developed except for Seth Rogen's, where he is Seth Rogen. Screenplay never lags - all packaged in a noteworthy soundtrack. The only misfire is its incapability to leverage on the suspense factor highlighted by the movie title.It is a see-saw ride with moments of emotional introspect mixed with crude insensitive humor. Watch it for Lewitt and Kendrick.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a diamond in the rough,"This movie really surprised me, I did not expect much because I did not see any trailer or ads for this movie before I started watching it but I got a really great experience. Surprisingly Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Seth Rogen had a really good chemistry going on, and the movie crosses a really tragic subject together with some great humor, so it got a bit emotional at times.I'm set to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been a 'diamond in the rough' and he has really begun to shine as an actor these last few years. He's come a long way since '3rd Rock from the Sun'. I'm also grown real fond of Seth Rogen, he's really different and charming in a way.This movie is definitely one to watch if you're in need to get some cheering up on a rainy day.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
'We all have to die at one point. It is part of life.',"It is unclear why this film - 50/50 - isn't in the lists for Academy Awards nominations. Perhaps it is because the subject matter (cancer) is tough or because the PR for the film wasn't broad enough. But watch it for yourself and marvel at the script (written by Will Reiser based on his own story of having cancer), the direction by Jonathan Levine who understands how to balance the two faces of life - comedy and tragedy - as well as anyone, and the astonishing sensitive acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and one of the finest ensemble casts assembled. This is a film that examines the effect of a cancer diagnosis on a young man, his friends, his love life, and the people with whom he comes into contact because of his disease. And those people include us, the audience.Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a 27 year old writer of radio programs, happy with living with his artist girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard) and spending his idle hours with his wisecracking goofy friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), has some back pain while jogging, visits a cold impersonal doctor (Andrew Airlie) who flatly diagnoses Schwannoma/Neurofibrosarcoma and informs Adam he must undergo chemotherapy to shrink the tumor of his spine before he can undergo surgery - the combined treatments offer a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam blindly accepts the information, shares it with Kyle, Rachel, and ultimately his mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer father (Serge Houde) - each of whom has a different reaction to the news: Kyle worries the Adam's relationship with Rachel is bogus (Rachel is having an affair despite the fact that she claims she will 'be there' for Adam), his mother overreacts a bit and joins a support group for families with cancer diagnosed, Rachel leaves, and Adam begins chemotherapy.At the hospital Adam joins two cancer victim men undergoing chemotherapy (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) and the three become close, sharing marijuana macaroons and keeping things light. Adam is assigned to a psychotherapy doctoral student Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is younger than Adam and the two begin a series of sessions that, though awkward, open windows onto reality and to their individual and shared emotional backgrounds. Adam's chemotherapy succeeds in causing hair loss, headaches and vomiting but doesn't shrink the tumor. Adam is lined up for surgery and each person in Adam's life shows Adam their true colors.Author Will Reiser has said 'Adam is very much an extension of me. But I didn't intend for that, it just happened. I just had so much I wanted to say. There's a real limitation on what you can and can't say - like you can't make fun of this, because it's taboo.' The result of his sharing his own experience is deftly portrayed in this rare comedy drama, allowing the viewer to see all sides of Cancer and how that diagnosis alters the life view of the victim and their support group. Seth Rogen has slimmed down and proves in this portrayal that he is capable of superb acting and character creation. Anna Kendrick, Anjelica Huston, Serge Houde, Philip Baker Hall, Matt Frewer and Bryce Dallas Howard render exceptional supporting roles. But the extraordinarily subtle and sensitive acting on the part of Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant: this is an actor who proves his chops in this career making role. His balance between pathos and the lightness of his comedic touch is simply worthy of an Oscar - or more. This is a surprising excellent film. Highly Recommended for all audiences.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everything can change!,"Fifty fifty is one of the best film which makes me smile and cry simultaneously. Although cancer and comedy are included at the same work, the film is realistic for me. While Adam who is writer of radio program in the film lives normal life, unexpectedly he diagnosed with a kind of cancer and then faces with difficult condition normally. In addition to struggle his own emotion he has to calm his anxiety mother. Along the story losing his girlfriend is also depressing situation for him. In this film, there are many advice for us. This film gives us a sign of what cancer is like, how it can affect you and how it can destroy you if people let it. But it also teaches us to never give up. The best part of the movie for me is that Adam saw a book is related how can beat cancer at Kyle's home while he thought that his best friend ignored him.What a touchy! The acting was great, the characters were great and i loved it.this film is related to the real love, too. Because ,when the Adam's girlfriend heard the cancer, she broke up from him. It is the other important point of real life. If you love someone, you should never give up in any case. All in all, we can easily understand that everything can change in any moment.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This a great film.,"This a great film.This movie took the cancer disease problem from a perspective of a real story and made a good affecting film that will make you cry at the end. This is one of the few movies that made me really cry. The acting was super good. The most wonderful character in this movie was Anna Kendrick. She was very cute and acting very professionally. Another good part of the movie that it almost talked about all the problems a cancer patient may face. I mean all the social issues like increasing love, sympathy, people making use of the patient case, betrayal and loyal people. I recommend this movie for you if you like these types of movies. I rated it 10/10 and it does worth it.I really enjoyed the film. You can't make a comedy about cancer, or any other serious illness for that matter, and fail to produce a genuinely funny script. Laughs come often and organically.There are so many ways to do a comedy film about cancer wrong, but very few ways to do it right. 50/50 thankfully manages to find the sweet spot of this risky terrain and succeeds in being a charmingly touching film as well as a wildly hilarious one. It's always nice to be so surprised by a film's quality. I expected good things from 50/50 from the first time I saw a trailer, but the movie itself exceeded my expectations.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
totally awesome!,"First of all, i want to say something about this film. It is patience. For me the main idea of the film is patience. Because he put up with the many problems. The most important one is his disease. Because cancer is so dangerous disease. Patient should be patient and his morale degree should be very high. In this film is really similar to the real life. Because first of all, there is no problem everything was good, but later there are some problems. For instance, the man who is cancer patient is so depressed when he learn his disease. But his friend and his doctor are really make an effort about himself. Thus,the main character of film, is not struggle to go on his life. By the way, i realize that when someone get ill the family or his friend is come up. In this film, when the man get ill his family came up. My idea is, sometimes bad things can be beneficial for us. The best scene in the film is, the man decline his girlfriend when she come to the his house. And she said that everything can be good next times. But the man declined her. Because she break up when she learn his disease. Real love is important.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I don't smoke, I don't drink... I recycle...","I didn't know what to expect from this movie. A true story of a young man dealing with cancer that also had Seth Rogan in the main cast. How would they find the right level of seriousness to touch the audience whilst at the same time making them laugh and actually feel pretty positive about things? Well I'm not quite sure how but the makers of Superbad did a real good job at it.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam, who works in Radio with his best friend, Kyle (Seth Rogan). Once finding out he has cancer we are shown the different types of relationships Adam has in his life. Whether it be with his parents, girlfriend, best friend, doctor or therapist. I won't go into detail about them all but they all differ in some way or another, some bad, some good. The point of this is to show the audience who and what matters, not only in Adam's life but in their own. So whether you have cancer or you don't, you can still improve your life if you want to. Its about spotting the qualities such as the loyalty that is shown in Kyle as well as Adam's dog (a mans true best friend) and reflecting how important that is.Seth Rogan is exactly like he is in most of his films, full of advice and knowledge and always capable of making people laugh. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also similar to his role in 500 Days of Summer, a nice guy with not too much confidence who you cant help feel sorry for. Apart from scenes where they try to pick up girls by using cancer for sympathy votes or the two of them generally being best friends the rest of the comedy is equally spread, it always follows a moment that is more serious which never makes the audience feel too down at any given point during the movie.This film is completely original, it shouldn't work as well as it does but it succeeds more than I could explain. It doesn't hold the the greatest acting I have ever seen but films with comedy in don't really need that. The storyline and atmosphere of the film makes you feel good and it's hilarious at the right times. With the added bonus that it shows marijuana in a positive manor, there's not a whole lot the film could improve on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Excellent Film,"In this film, there are many advice for us. First of all everything was good. But one day a problem occurred. The man who is main character of film, got cancer.

Excellent,"What a good movie. I laughed a bunch of times as well as tearing up a couple times, too. The subject matter is heavy: cancer, and the story looks the problem right in the face without flinching. The characters keep their humor and humanity throughout. This is not a movie that is trying to place blame, correct a rotten system or go for cheap laughs...well maybe it goes for one or two cheap laughs, Seth...it's just showing people dealing with a bad situation the best way they can. The film is really well done, hitting both high notes and low ones. I recommend it highly. Along with his movie ""The Lookout,"" Joseph Gordon-Levitt is building a nice filmography.My only complaint with ""50/50"" is that the peripheral characters behave a little too conveniently. Realistically, there would've been much more turmoil with the ex-girlfriend and father. The movie wasn't overly long, so a bit more depth and friction around those two relationships could have made a good movie even better.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amazing performances are shown The story of the film feels believable and real, basically because it's based on the real experience of normal human in real life. The strength of the movie is that the film is supposed to be sad because of cancer but it is very positively processing cancer and other abandonment of his dear. I think everything in the film is in right amount The film's only real weakness can be found in the girlfriend and mother characters.

"50/50 has Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the lead role, whilst his performance is brilliant it's the screenplay that deserves most praise","50/50 is loosely inspired by Reiser's own experience with cancer, with the character Kyle being based on Seth Rogen himself. The film is directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Will Reiser, the black comedy-drama is also produced by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen and Ben Karlin, there are lots of talented comedians that worked on this film and 50/50 is an extremely well written film that received critical acclaim for good reason. I didn't expect it to be this good, it was seriously incredible.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the main character, Adam Lerner, in what could possibly be among his best acting performances. He's truly terrific in the dramatic part and the comedic part of the performance. The actors who joins him are Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard and Anjelica Huston. Everyone are great. But it's the writing that makes it all work.Going into this film, I thought it would be a comedy not taken itself very seriously but I'm so glad it was serious. With some incredible direction and a script with so much emotion put into it, 50/50 has something for everyone. But there's so much heart in the movie, just the plot ""a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.""

10/10.,"Everyone has their own ideas and notions about movies that tackle the subject of a person with a terminal illness, be it cancer or something else.Most of us tend to avoid them because they can often be too overly dramatic and depressing. 50/50 is a sure break from that mold.Now being called a cancer comedy, I have to say that term is quite appropriate.It's a really funny movie, which does not mean it won't make you cry. The driving force is the actor who plays Adam. (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)Adam is a 27 year old writer of radio programs and is diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. This comes as a shock to Adam, (as it would to anyone) a mild-manner young man who in his own words, doesn't drink or smoke. The subsequent events follow him as he tries to gently break the news to his family and friends. Everyone reacts to it differently as people would in a true to life situation.Kyle (Seth Rogen) is appalled at first but proclaims that young people beat cancer all the time. This is a good role for Seth Rogen who usually only frequents raunchy comedies. Not to say he diverts from what is clearly his strong suit. It acts as comic relief here and it works as the part of Kyle is quite well-rounded.There is a specific reason for this.Adam is based on writer Will Reiser, who was diagnosed with cancer and later recovered. Reiser called Adam an extension of himself.Seth Rogen, who plays Kyle, helped Reiser cope with his disease and convinced him to write a screenplay during their early 20s together.Anjelica Huston who plays the role of Adam's mother (Diane) is magnificent. She reacts as any mother would in such a situation and the little scenes she shares with Adam are very earnest and emotional.You also have Anna Kendrick as the young and inexperienced therapist Katherine (who is a fictional character) and Bryce Dallas Howard as Rachael, the sometimes distant girlfriend. She is an amalgam of various different people in Will Reiser's life.I didn't think any of the actors did a bad job. Everyone was just right, with Joseph Gordon Levitt being the definition of nuance. Still considered a young actor by Hollywood standards, he has come a long way from TV shows and solely independent movies. If 50/50 is any indication, he should age like fine wine.This a great film. Chances are you'll find something of substance, a few life lessons in between the laughs in 50/50.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Genuine,"""50/50"" is about Adam, a very health and safety conscious young man, who is diagnosed with a rare spinal cancer. He struggles with accepting his condition and fighting it.

Seth Rogen does a great job of adding humor in a way that makes sense and is welcomed. ""50/50"" is packed with emotions, from fear and anger to love and laughter, which helps portray the confusing situation that Adam is enduring. It is a heavy film that I wouldn't suggest watching if you're looking for mindless entertainment, but if you're looking for something with substance, ""50/50"" is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Death is part of our life and we should all agree that so 50/50 shows that this situation is nothing to make exaggerate. I was so surprised when i faced with the sadness in the movie.

Very good supporting cast, including a combination of faces that you'll recognize (Anjelica Huston as Adam's mother, Philip Baker Hall as a fellow patient are wonderful) as well as great newcomers like Anna Kendrick. And all of that with a measly $8M budget - it helps that Rogen was on-board, but still a great accomplishment.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good movie, but at times unrealistic","Cancer is a difficult topic, this is a sweet film somewhat on the same lines as Juno, worth watching.A conservative style of film making is good, especially when you want to show violence, pain etc. But when you are dealing with topics like cancer, it could also get a bit misleading or unrealistic. Getting the right balance is tough. People who haven't seen cancer close enough may get it all wrong.Having said that most of the film works quite well, Kendrick is simply great as Katherine (she's also done a fabulous job in 'up in the air') and the magic between Gordon-Levitt & Kendrik comes across beautifully.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great film, not what I expected...","I start by saying that I give the film 8/10, but the score could have been higher if not Seth Rogen was a part of the cast.The film have a deeper emotion that speaks to me, but at the same time makes me laugh. It starts of like most of the comedies I have seen, slow and easy. The characters is given room to be presented and their personalities take form. But then the film takes a turn that I didn't expect. It turns more and more into a drama and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely brilliant through the hole thing. But I'm really confused why the second role have been given to Seth Rogen. He cant act on a deeper level. His expressions are a bit limited. And that drops my score for this film. If Seth Rogen could have been cut out of this film, it would have been soo mush better.But the film holds up and I really liked it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Touching Movie..,"One of the very few movies of 2011 which can be treated as ""complete"" it has every single emotion. A dark comedy about friendship, loyalty and betrayal. We all can relate the story of 50/50 to our own life in different ways. Thank you, all cast and crew members, Mandate pictures for such a beautiful treat. This movie is also one of my favorites I have ever seen, I do not really cry or get bothered by things, this movie had me choking up in four different scenes and the one in the car with his breakdown made me feel awkward which is also rare. I have enjoyed the movie so much especially the actors' performance and the script is just awesome wish we see a lot of these inspirational movies that touch our souls again. It gave such a realistic perspective of the battle against cancer. Moreover, it gave me a cancer for young people preview. it's perfectly directed, the song choice is so good and placed at perfect timings.50/50 was an amazing movie and I loved the acting.

Time for an Oscar Do Over,"In a just universe, no one would get cancer and 50/50 would have been nominated for at least four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Why does it matter? It doesn't; or at least it shouldn't. But Hollywood owes it to the future of the industry to support slightly daring and off-beat films like 50/50 rather than smugly liberal (and covertly racist) movies like The Help or yet another Tom Hanks or Brad Pitt star vehicle.For anyone who has had to deal with cancer themselves or in a loved one (and sadly, that probably means most of us), you owe it to yourself to see this wonderful film. When she heard about the subject matter, my wife refused to see it, having just recently lost her sister to the disease. It took me months to persuade her and she is now so taken by it that she's talked about little else since.I assure you that, despite what you may think, you simply don't know how you're going to react to news like that received by Adam until you actually receive it. Posts on IMDb complain that he didn't cry enough, to which I have just one response: it's a two hour movie that covers a year in his life but the film chooses (very wisely) to focus on the many other ways in which he contended with his diagnosis. That is what makes this film such a joy to watch.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick are so beautifully cast that it is like that were made for these roles. Still in their 20's, at first neither of them - neither the patient nor the ""expert"" - fathoms that the world can present such difficult challenges. They're young, they have good jobs, they have good friends and are going to live forever, aren't they? Neither one has ever experienced deprivation or hardship.I think part of the reason why Hollywood has had a hard time with 50/50 is that it doesn't fit neatly into any of the boxes that the industry machine has created. It was marketed badly and inaccurately, largely, one suspects, on the basis of that fact that Seth Rogen is in it (and he's very good, by the way). It deals with a subject that instinctively makes the audience uncomfortable, and it plays on that discomfort in an original way, without ever exploiting it.An 8.5.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
In terms of value the film is good,"It is seen that, this film is a life story or can be experienced event. When I was watching the film, I was affected by the reality of film. Because, which I think about, one day, I will experience this situation or not. Therefore, when I was watching the film, I was sad little bit. We always hear that, 'he/she broken up girlfriend/boyfriend because he/she was dog sick' and this film showing the truth of that expression. Actually, I am thinking about, if I were a dog sick boy's girlfriend what could I do? But I am sure that I never broken up him, at least he was dog sick or on the ground that his sickness. One, can feel hopeless when inside of the this situation but I think, the most important thing is never give up when feeling that. Because, sickness person is in need of assistance from the other persons. The woman, who is girlfriend's of the sickness man, firstly cheated the man later said that to the man ' I felt very bad and I was hopeless what could I do?' .Simply, I can say –it is only my mind-, she can support him to recover from an illness. But this is only story, and coming the part of end, sickness man and his doctor fall in love each other, the best scene of the film I think, and this is upbeat.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
gülsüm özen,"The film's only real weakness can be found in the girlfriend and mother characters. Howard and Huston give the roles their best efforts, but both of them are stuck with stereotypical and predictable character arcs. We know exactly how each of them will behave from the moment we meet them, and they offer little to the overall experience.50/50 was inspired by Reiser's own experiences with cancer in his mid twenties, and if there's a message to the movie it's that laughter really is the best medicine. Clichéd? Sure, but that doesn't make it any less true. Finding the humor in any situation is an often overlooked key to survival, and while the film never shies away from the pain, suffering, and depression associated with an experience like this, it stays true to its core belief. The people who make you laugh, in good times and bad, are the people you want and need to keep close.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film.. must watch,"This film is extremely moving with a terrific plot and choice of actors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt for example, an actor who I first saw in 3rd Rock from the Sun as Tommy shows great skill in showing emotion in such a demanding role. Seth Rogen is as always a comic genius who brings some comedy to this otherwise quite serious movie, yet he manages not to overdo to it as one might expect of him but still gives a big enough punch to bring out some laughs. However the only snipe I could make at this movie is that Adam can keep his anger in him a bit to longer for an American and may be better to set him as an English as that is how we all act on this side of the pond to matters like these, English Repression. However other than that I don't think I can fault the movie that much at all and so I advise anyone who reads this to watch it immediately.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than a cliff-hanger. A movie that will hang with you for a long time.,"I walked into this movie expecting to be shocked into laughter with all sorts of grotesque black humor. I didn't get what i expected, and i'm glad i didn't.I did laugh. I laughed like i would if i was hanging out with Kyle, getting hammered and chasing skirt, trying desperately not to take life too seriously. Because this is one of those rare movies that make you forget you're watching a movie. I felt like one of the guys, truly disturbed by the tribulations, truly relieved by the few good news. I was spitting insults at Rachael, like i'd been waiting for years to let her know. I wanted to hug Adam's Mother.

I must have some weird eye disease or something.But that's how good this movie is.John Levine has crafted a flawless pearl. His directing is so perfectly impartial, so focused on the characters instead of style, that it allows for the actors to become their parts in such a complete way, you'd be surprised if they were actually different people in real life.A must-see work of art which will leave you staring endlessly at the credits all the way to the last line, directing the rest of the movie in your head, like you were planning to meet them all again tomorrow...",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

First time Adam got depressed. And sink into despair. Many events affected him in a bad way. His girlfriend broke up him because of his illness. My comment in this situation is only lack of love. After days passed, he started to chemotherapy. While he was doing this, Adam met the therapist. Her name is Katherine. At this time, there were Adam's problems with his best friend Kyle.

When you see people having a life threatening sickness and battling it out to prolong their life, it is never easy to mix this with humor but the director cakewalks it.

A moving comedy with tragic background - without being a tragicomedy,"The topic is serious and although cancer at present is not almost 100% lethal as it used to be, it is still unpredictable and often is the mental situation the decisive thing in determining the outcome.I liked the film for the following reasons: -- the screenplay is based on real events; a difficult topic is touched with piety, but realistically -- excellent performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Anjelica Houston and Anna Kendrick (Seth Rogen is too plain comedian for me)I can't imagine how this film is watched by cancer patients or by those whose close ones have/had it...

Smiling all the way,"Four months earlier you begin to watch a trailer about a buddy comedy about cancer with Seth Rogen. The trailer makes you laugh your way into watching the movie four months later. But the movie is not what you expected and thankfully the trailers are deceiving to make you believe that Seth Rogen is going to play a commanding role in a movie dealing with cancer. Seth Rogen holds his place firmly in the movie and brings his style of trashy humor but more often or less restrained than his other comedies. What you do surprisingly get is '50/50' the feel good movie of the year starring Seth Rogen.Adam (Joseph Gordan-Lewitt) is a 27 year old working for a private Radio channel company along with Seth Rogen. Adam has a girlfriend with whom his relationship can be described as platonic at least by Seth Rogen's standards. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a paragon of selfishness and clearly has a hold on naïve Adam. When Adam discovers that he has a cancerous tumor growing in his spine, he tells Rachael she could bail herself out of their relationship. But Rachael surprises him and the audience by sticking with him, taking care of him, helping him confide about his disease with his parents and also getting him a new dog Skeletor.Seth Rogen despises her and hence is more than happy to catch her cheating on Adam with a bearded Hippie. As soon as Adam forces Rachael out of his life, Seth takes over. At each step Seth gives Adam only one advice to get laid and tries to get him laid but more importantly for him getting himself laid using Adam. Adam is shown too kind to embrace the potent of his illness to get him laid frequently.But Adam responds to two old men who he meets during his Hospital visits to undergo treatment. Those two men become his support system helping each other with sweets filled with weed and smoking medicinal marijuana with Seth Rogen dutifully getting high among with the three cancer buddies.The audiences are provided a surprisingly poignant and perfect new relationship Adam slowly and naturally gets involved with his therapist. Anna Kendrick who plays the character of Dr. Katherine McKay surely knows how to use her awkward girlish behavior to manipulate the audience. She may not be the best actress around but knows how to work her way up to win the viewer's favor. Dr. McKay is a 24 year old therapist helping Adam deal with the trauma of his life threatening disease. But her inexperience adds another angle and Adam find himself slowly and naturally falling for her caring approach towards him.The story could not be more straight forward and could be included in the category of Patch Adam. But Seth Rogen runs over the minefield of clichés carefully and we witness a very personal and poetic story told with heartfelt poignancy. '50/50' is told with a floating pace that creates a poetic rhythm to the scenes.The story succeeds in covering all aspects of the patient's pain and trauma while keeping it light hearted. Adam's relationship with his overbearing but affable Mother and dealing with his father's senile amnesia provides memorable moments during the final reel. It is a disease that is hard to be laughed away but Will Reiser's script keeps situation and moments as real as possible and succeeds in keeping the audience smiling all the way through a very happy ending.For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved this movie!,"I loved this movie. It was pretty predictable, yet so got it made me feel. During certain moments in the film i actually cried and it amazes me, I usually never cry at movies.It is more than drama than comedy, and I would have liked a bit more comedy, especially when Seth Rogen starred (which is my absolute favorite actor).The film could have easily been 10/10 from me if there was more comedy and a little more depth in the main role's relationship to his family and friends. But since I really felt afterwards that it had made me both feel good and sad and everything in between. It felt easy to see and I did not have to strain to understand or know the movie so I give it 9/10.Watch this movie, you wont regret it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
the movie is about the a young man who struggle to beat this disease by helping the other people of his around.,"This film which is adopted from the real life is a dram- comedy . This is the most significant side for me. The main actor in the film is a 27 years old man called Adam.He is radio program employee for public. One day he discovers that he is a spinal cancer that is seen rarely. With the help of his protective mother , his best friend Kyle and his young therapist Kyle ,he struggle to beat cancer. These people tries to help out him during the difficult process.Actually as you know this kinds of films are very torturing , every scene is stressful but in here being cancer are not hold like the cancer films.We can see the balance between comedy and dram. The topics; friendships, love and struggle with life with a humorous side. During his chemotherapy , Adam learns how much the life is important and what are the good things that he does not ignore beforehand .Also , the relationships with his girl friend Racheal, his best friend and his mother change while complex.Racheal shows that she is not real life partner actually.As characters, the lovable main character Adam and the other characters were truly choosed for their roles. The actor and actresses are high qualified.The dialogues between characters flow with an comprehensible way.To me ,this film was rare kind in terms of the way of holding the cancer.The humor are placed perfectly.Only be desperate without humor life ,cancer is unbearable.If yo do not want to go to a depressing film movie watch this with a little dramatic but with much funny.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
50/50,"50/50, is a brilliant emotional, comedy with drama film and biography, it is different to the similar typical films usually watched.Throughout the film there was many highs and many lows, I believe the young, new comer director Jonathan Levine captured every historical, heart warming scene with perfection. The cast within the movie was very high profile, Seth Rogen (Pineapple express), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Inception), and two Oscar nominated actresses Anna Kendrick (Up in the air) and Bryce Dallas Howard (the Help).Another decent performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, I believe he captured the role of a newly diagnosed patient with serious cancer brilliantly, I believe Joseph Gordon-Levitt should have had a Oscar nomination, but sadly he never. I believe the chemistry between Rogen and Levitt was perfect, the chatty humour was often carried throughout the film, and the bromance added to it. I believe the actors battled cancer with humour.50/50 has brilliant performances and yet a brilliant movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the hero of Levine's new film, is dealing with a situation that's even more wack: At age 27, he's been diagnosed with an unpronounceable form of spinal cancer that gives him only a 50 percent chance of survival.Why doesn't he have a license? Is he fearful, or just broke?) Adam's hospital visits introduce him to a few sympathetic souls: There's Alan (Philip Baker Hall), a cancer patient in his 70s who generously shares his medical-marijuana-laced macaroons; and Katherine (Anna Kendrick), a nervous young psychology student who offers Adam therapy sessions as part of her thesis project.Levine and the scriptwriter, Will Reiser (who based the story in part on his own experience as a cancer patient), labor mightily to find both the drama and the comedy in Adam's awful plight, with a success rate that's slightly greater than the ratio of the film's title. Scene by scene, 50/50 can be both amusing and moving, with the tightly wound Gordon- Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres, seeming to skitter away at the last minute from both full-body laughter and full-body sobs. ""Did you see Terms of Endearment?"" Adam asks his mother moments before he tells her he has cancer. The line gets a laugh because, presumably, of the distance between that movie's Hollywood vision of a family brought closer by cancer and this movie's rawer, realer version. But the sprawling, occasionally operatic Terms of Endearment felt more honest than this cautious and tidy film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
100% recommended,"""50/50"" is based on the true story of the writer, Will Reiser himself. Maybe because it was a true experience, the emotions throughout the story turned out to be very true. It has a right amount of humour and at the same time some moments to make you teary-eyed. Very cleverly written and directed.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a promising performance. He captured the emotions of the character really well and I can truly relate to him. I think he is starting to deliver some real acting skills and paving his way to stardom :). Seth Rogen just needed to be himself and he was good. The actress I am really starting to take notice is Bryce Dallas Howard (which happens to be Director Ron Howard's daughter). After watching her in ""The Help"" and now this one, I think she is coming to be another promising actress. I actually think she could do better than Anna Kendrick.This movie really helps us reflect about what's really important in our lives. We expect ourselves to live up to 70, 80 years old or even more and eventually die of old age. But the truth is, anything can happen to change our lives, and we really need to find out what is really important in our lives and what is the reason of us living, and waste not any moment we have.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Heartfelt, Hilarious, and Hugely Relatable","""50/50"" completely surprised me-what a perfect blend of heartbreak and humour. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam absolutely nailed it. His performance felt so raw and authentic, especially in those quiet moments when he's processing the weight of his diagnosis. It's not just another cancer movie; it's funny and real without being preachy or overly sentimental. Seth Rogen as Kyle brought the laughs in the best way-he's the kind of friend you'd love and hate at the same time, which made their dynamic so much more believable.I adored Anna Kendrick as Katherine. Watching her character awkwardly navigate being a therapist to Adam was both endearing and frustrating in the best way-she's so earnest that you can't help but root for her. The scene where she gets flustered over boundaries was so relatable and added just the right amount of awkward charm.The humour here is sharp, but it's never insensitive-it's a masterclass in balancing dark comedy with genuine emotion. That said, there were moments when the pacing lagged a bit, especially in the middle. It sometimes felt like we were revisiting the same emotional beats. Still, it's hard to fault a movie that can make me cry laughing one minute and just plain cry the next.One of my favourite parts was when Adam finally breaks down in the car with his mum (Anjelica Huston)-talk about a punch to the gut. Her character was so underrated. I loved how she wasn't just the overbearing mother trope but had real depth, showing the quiet ways parents suffer too.The ending really hit all the right notes. It left me feeling hopeful but not in a cheesy, ""everything's magically fixed"" way. This film gets it-the messy, beautiful, complicated reality of life. I walked away smiling, with a lump in my throat and the urge to call my friends.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
About 50/50,"This movie is one of amazing movies which I watched. Because it combines drama with comedy. This movie is about friendship, love and survival. Its subject is a guy who learned about his cancer diagnosis. I'm impressed from this movie. Because Adam (Joseph Gardon-Levitt) chose beating the cancer, so he didn't back down. When he learned that Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is his girlfriend had been cheating him, he didn't care, and he fell in love again with Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is a young therapist at the cancer center. Kyle (Seth Rogen) who is Adam's best friend supported him, and I have to say that I laughed so much to Kyle at the movie. Relation between Adam and his mother was also told at this movie, and it is one of interesting things to me. I watched the movie without boring, for we can see this situation in our daily lives. I can imagine it, so I can understand Adam's situation, and I can comment about it. By the way, this movie isn't histrionics. Because it tells a real situation with a real viewpoint. Although it tells about cancer, it isn't main point. The main point is that Adam realized new exciting things related with his life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy!,"'50/50': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A cancer film that's actually fifty percent drama and fifty percent comedy. The film deals with the very serious subject matter of a 27 year old who is diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which he has about a fifty percent chance of beating. The movie takes a very honest and brutal look at his struggles to fight the illness as well as taking a lighter look at his best friend's attempts to help him overcome depression through positive thinking and having fun. The best friend is played by Seth Rogen and the movie is in fact based on one of his best friend's, a writing buddy named Will Reiser (who wrote the script), and his actual experiences overcoming cancer. Seth Rogen basically plays himself in the film and Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the Reiser character. The film is directed by Jonathan Levine and Levine does an outstanding job of balancing the depressing drama with light hearted comedy. Something really special results from it.The movie does a very impressive job of balancing several different elements and angles to it's story. The biggest of which is the buddy story involving the two leads (Adam and Kyle). Rogen (Kyle) really shines here by showing how important it is to have a good friend like him in a time like that. There's also a bitter relationship story involving Adam and his self centered morally deprived girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard). Howard shows how important it is to make sure you have a good romantic companion by your side not like her character in a time like that. There's a blooming relationship story between Adam and a possible romantic interest he finds in his psychologist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Kendrick plays her usual type of role here and continues to do an adequate job with it. She of course shows the importance of the possibilities of real love. There's also the friendships Adam forms with other cancer patients at the hospital with him, specifically Mitch (Matt Frewer) and Alan (Philip Baker Hall), which shows how important it is to have people close that know (and can relate to) what you're going through. And there's the relationship Adam has with his overbearing mother (Anjelica Huston) and Alzheimer's stricken father (Serge Houde). They of course show the importance of family. All of these elements and performances are well played out but it's Gordon-Levitt that knocks it out of the park with his Oscar nomination worthy performance.Like all really good movies the film has a lot to offer and there's very little to complain about. Some have shown disgust in the idea of a film that would try to take a comedic slapstick approach to such serious and dreary subject matter but there really isn't any slapstick here. The comedy depicted in the film all feels pretty real and genuine and being that it's based on the lives of the writer and actor I'd say it's probably pretty honest and heartfelt too. There's true passion in this film and I don't think anyone involved thought of it as a joke. I think the best way to deal with any of life's ugliness is to look at the good that comes with it as well. I don't think the dozens of sappy tearjerkers we've seen about cancer in the past have done an adequate job of really dealing with the subject matter. This film actually deals with it and life through all of it's ups and downs. It is an emotional roller coaster and a tearjerker as well. It definitely got to me in a couple places. I think this is the best type of cancer film and I applaud it's courage and originality.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s7ci6l5gkI",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Especially, I like acting of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who is the main character in the film. First message that film tries to give is that if you are sick, especially cancer, try to do anything that you have not done yet instead of waiting for death, so this is the feature that distinguishes this film from other films.

"Part Comedy, Part Tear Jerker, Part Buddy Film That Works on All Levels","A complex ball of emotion that fits snugly into the confused mental state of a fresh cancer diagnosee and his confidants. It's an unusual setting for a comedy, which leads to a few situations where it feels like we should ask permission to laugh, but that plays into the central theme that there's no right or wrong way to deal with something so complicated. It's not wall-to-wall laughs, either, which would give the impression that it's taking the subject too lightly. Seth Rogan plays his typical role excellently, the wise-cracking frat boy facsimile everybody seems to know, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt balances him out with a harsh dose of sarcasm cut with grim reality. It's sneakily effective about investing us in the cast, and by the time the end rolls around they're almost family. A bit formulaic and weepy at times, neither are quite excessive enough to incite accusations of being a closet chick flick, and it's often ready with a firm punchline just when it's needed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Laughter and tears at th same time,"Well, first of all, is not a black comedy. It's more like Terms of Endearment (which is actually mentioned once) meets Superbad. And that's maybe not original, but is still awesome. It is a tear-dropper, but is not gonna kill you. Still, you gotta be prepared and might wanna watch this by yourself if you're ashamed of crying in public.What a great actor Joseph Gordon Lewitt is turning into! All of the cast was perfect, even Bryce Dallas Howard whose work i'm not a fan of, delivers a realistic and bitchy girlfriend. I couldn't imagine other actress playing the mom but A. Houston. Anna Kendrick was decent as well and Seth Rogen was funny as usual, as the best friend who's fat, drunk, stoner and wants to score all the time. However, i'm kinda hoping this is his last part like this, to avoid being typecast. It's about time.Get ready for touching scenes (the one in the car, the books, that mom...) and funny ones too. Not ha-ha funny, but chuckle nerdy funny. In fact, there is ad lib and pop cultural references throughout the movie, but just the right amount. And Pearl Jam fans like myself, will be surprised...Sorry if i don't sound like a hard ass-critic wannabe, but this is one of the best movies of 2011.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very good film indeed,"The problem with this film is that it starts quite badly. The comedy is a little mis-firing and I felt the tone was a bit off. I liked the run up to the main story but it sometimes felt a little forced and just..off.BUT, once the film gets into it's stride it is marvelous. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gets better and better as the film progresses and what starts off as a somewhat awkward performance grows into a rather fine portrayal of a young man dealing with life threatening illness. Anna Kendrick puts in an excellent turn as a bumbling trainee counselor and helps to push the film to a satisfying conclusion. Seth Rogan is...Seth Rogan, as ever and he provides light - if somewhat crude - relief from the subject matter. But he seriously needs to expand his acting repertoire.This is a well made and quite emotional film. I lost both my parents to cancer and could relate to a lot of the scenes and sentiments portrayed. The only thing I still don't get is when portraying cancer patients undergoing chemo why they don't get rid of the eyebrows? Chemo tends to not be selective!Overall a great film that is worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

tragic and perfect film ..,"In this film mentions a man who has cancer, his life and his feelings. Adam is the main character of the film. Adam sees the doctor for results. Then he finds out his illness. He feels in complex emotions due to cancer. Actually this illness changes his life. He comes over all bad things like cheating. Also I do not like such films but this film summarizes the real of life. Because everybody may have cancer owing to genetics or unhealthy situations. Nowadays cancer increasing. Adam played very well his role. The name of the film is meaningful. Because Adam's chance is 50/50. That is to say, this two things are adapted. We see the people's life which fight cancer in this film. While I was watching it, sometimes I feel better, sometimes I feel bad. In terms of the subject of film is nice and varied. Although there is not any action in the film, I like it. Shortly it is a riveting film. Adam's despair is obvious and clear. At the same time, his father is Alzheimer and when he tells them his illness, his mother becomes very upset but his father becomes happy or sad. Film continues slowly but I do not bored it. Some scenes in this film attracts my attention such as cutting his hair and before undergoing surgery. Anyway, if one wants to watch drama, I advise this film. I think, everybody should watch it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A tightrope act pulled off well,"I was not too keen on watching this. Cancer is frightening and I was apprehensive of either a morbid flick or a flippant one. The movie was neither. It did not minimize the physical or emotional damage wrought by the malady and its brutal treatment on the victim. But it also did not wallow in grim despair. Seth Rogen, as the best buddy, supplied the humor that lightened the mood (albeit tad predictable in his obsession with weed and getting laid.) The budding romance with the earnest, well intentioned but somewhat awkward therapist was deftly handled - it fit well with the flow of the movie and never overpowered the main theme - how a young man deals with cancer, its treatment, and the fallout on family and friends.The acting was good, and the script was tight. I was engrossed and moved. Very nice movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So you think you can bear its weight?,"I'm recently passed through a surgery to remove 2 herniated discs (at 21y), what is nothing compared to a cancer, but from this simple thing I could have a bit of an idea about how people who surrounds you can deal with it, and they suck with it. The movies told you that perfectly.Well balanced between comedy and drama, 50/50 shows the fragility of life when you think you're having a problems free one. Everything's OK, you go to work, you laugh with your friends, f**k your girlfriend and then, out of the blue, you have to accept you can die from one of the worst diseases a human being can have. The cancer. The movie makes you think if that happen to you how would you react, ""who would stay at your side?"" ""who would fake you're OK?"" ""who would lie to make you feel comfortable?"". Sometimes who's at your side can't bear the weight like you do.Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) its the 50% drama while Kyle (Seth Rogen) is the other part, fulfilled with black humor jokes, always trying to be the best friend to Adam, and so speak, the only one who can really pass throughout the disease without making Adam go down in tears and self-pity.Ketherine (Anna Kendrick) interprets a young psychiatrist, who has to treat a complicated patient, giving that she just started working at a clinic and has no much idea about what to say to him.The others actors and characters doesn't get much of our attention, except for Alan (Philip Baker Hall), a old men who's being treat from cancer at the same hospital as Adam and will certainly makes you laugh.The soundtrack is almost missed along the movie, and some characters are design to not know how to express themselves, witch leave some scenes with a ""lack of dialog"" and you'll be willing to speak for them.Watch 50/50 trying to put yourself in Adams situation to see how life would look from your point of view.

After 400 reviews I have found a movie that left me almost speechless. An amazing movie that needs to be experienced. I say A.,"""You can't change your situation. The only thing that you can change is how you choose to deal with it."" One day Adam (Gordon-Levitt) says that his back has been hurting and goes to the doctor. When Adam is told that he has cancer, and his odds of recovery are 50/50, his life is tossed into chaos. With help from his best friend Kyle (Rogen) and his new therapist he does what he can to try and beat it. In the last year since I began doing these reviews I have done over 400. In all that time I have found it pretty easy to write something about each one. This one is different. This movie is so emotional, funny and so well done that it actually left me without knowing what to say about it. I feel that anything I say may cheapen it and this is just a movie that needs to be seen. Very few movies have that kind of effect. Equal parts comedy and drama this is one of the best experiences I have had with a movie in awhile. The one comment I can make is that if you liked ""Funny People"" you will love ""50/50"". Overall, a movie that words can't do justice to. Just watch it. I say A.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A young twenty-something deals with getting cancer.,"As someone who had a minor bout with cancer myself, I can identify with some of the story presented here and was really surprised how well this film, about a twenty-something man who finds himself with a rare and potentially fatal type of cancer, presented much of it. My case was nowhere near as severe as Gordon-Levitt's Adam but, I can say the film really nailed the inner turmoil, the mixed thoughts and emotions, the unexpected humor that seems to come out of nowhere and the strange way people approach and talk to you when they find out. Not only is the script insightful but, really balances the heavy drama with the lighter and more touching moments perfectly. The film is never overly melodramatic or sappy, nor is it condescending with it's humor and it also never manipulates the audience but, let's the audience experience the emotions from the story itself. Obviously Director Jonathan Levine had a big part in making this sensitive story work so well but, he is also helped by getting really great performances out of a really great cast. Levitt is near perfect as a man suddenly faced with his mortality at a point in his life where he still has so much he wants to accomplish. Seth Rogen perfectly portrays that one friend who is always there to brighten spirits by adding just the right levity at just the right moments. The friend who loves you enough to make you feel stupid for feeling sorry for yourself and to take it when your inner anger makes you short tempered. Rounding out the cast is legendary Anjelica Huston as his mother, Bryce Dallas Howard as his undeserving girlfriend and Anna Kendrick as his therapist/ love interest. This is one of the best dramas I have seen in a long while and it adds enough humor to keep one from being overwhelmed and to remind us that, like life, there is almost always something to make us smile in even the worst situations.

I was truly touched by the greatness of this movie and its story. It puts one's life into perspective, it makes you appreciate life in general.

50/50 is a very interesting mix of ideas that turns out much better than would be expected,"50/50 was a movie I had heard some great buzz about earlier this year, but due to a busy schedule and a still growing list of things to see I was unable to see it while in theaters. Now that the movie has hit home video I was finally able to catch this low key dramedy starring one of my favorite young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Inception, 500 Days of Summer). The premise of the movie certainly sounds dark and depressing as the movie is essentially about a man as he comes to terms that he will die because of spinal cancer. The premise may be sad, but the writers and director Jonathan Levine decide to try and give this very sad story a comedic spin. Does 50/50 take this clash of genre and story and make it something innovative and interesting, or are comedy and impending death better left separate?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-8y",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautifully Simple! It'll make you Laugh and Cry at the same time!,"I never thought I'd ever get round to writing a movie review but this movie has forced me to. There was something so original and real about this movie that I had to tell the world..... Go watch it...Its great simple film making.... back to the basics - Great Acting, good music and a heck of a screen play. Its amazing how it makes you laugh and cry at the same time. You move with main character, you can feel his emotions and you start seeing the world differently as he does. I felt touched and moved by the movie (and I guess thats what you want when you go to see such a movie), something I've not felt for a long time. It was the same feeling I had after watching ""Remember me"" (don't worry, its not a spoiler, this movie is something else altogether)Frankly, its hard to believe that its from the same director who made ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"" (in case u're wondering, its Jonathan Levine - who seems to really have matured as a director. Well done mate!). Once again, the background score was amazing and the acting was simply brilliant. I've always liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but Seth Rogen outdid himself.

A perfectly balanced film,"'50/50' might be one of the most perfectly balanced films I can ever remember seeing. It's capable of ripping your heart out, making you laugh out loud on multiple occasions and also giving a very clear and important message. It is a ride filled with every emotion in the book and I loved every minute of it.The cast in this movie is terrific. I could literally list every one of them and say how great they are. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is immensely likeable as always and ensures we always care about his fate. Seth Rogan as the comedic relief is perfectly cast. This is some of his funniest work. His character also has a lot more depth than just that too however. Finally Anjelica Huston. She isn't in a whole lot of the movie but she is perfect in every scene she's in.When a movie is dealing with the subject of cancer it's always going to be heavy. We know that going in. '50/50' finds a way of telling the same story we've seen before, but giving a very different take on it. Showing us characters who don't know exactly how to handle a situation basically grinding their way through it as best they can.

Even if he his only in the film as comedy relief. With a topic as tender as this one its pretty tough to get comedy worked into the story but thanks to a very well written script its balanced beautifully. The story itself is very basic but its so well written that it covers itself up nicely. Even if you haven't known someone with cancer this movie will break your heart over and over again.

Slowly inflicts the pain of the disease onto the viewer,"Having four people in my family fatally suffered from cancer, I was hesitant to watch 50/50, but thankfully it clarified some of the pain cancer patients go through. The biggest thing that is repeated throughout the film is no one knows what to say to someone who has cancer. It's the most honest thing featured in the movie because it's the most unanswerable situation you could be caught in. Anna Kendrick makes you smile as you try to hold back the tears, once you get that gulp in your throat. Angelica Houston is the MVP, delivering a fully explained character in a matter of three scenes. Joseph Gordon Levitt approaches the role delicately, which is very satisfying when he finally explodes. 50/50 slowly inflicts the pain of the disease onto the viewer, much like how someone would experience cancer.Rating: 7/10Grade: B+",,Anonymous,Romance

His best friend, played by the always funny Seth Rogen supports him along with his family and try to help him get through this. I think he is a best friend in world.

Definitely not a split decision on 50/50,"50/50 is a comedy about cancer. Yes, now breathe that in for a second. It has Seth Rogen, an actor mostly known for playing a wacky party dude (as he does in this film) and it's supposed to make you laugh. 50/50 is also, by every stretch of my imagination, a masterpiece. It is a film with everything right about it and nothing wrong about. The person with cancer is not Kyle (Rogen), the wacky party dude, but his friend, Adam (Joseph Gordon Levitt), a man who has done nothing in life to provoke cancer, but somehow gets a rare type of it. Levitt puts a lot of charisma into his role, and Rogen is flat out hilarious. Adam soon visits a therapist named Katherine (Anna Kendrick) who is not very experienced in the world of therapy, and the audience questions if she's a good match for him. Now, you may be asking yourself..what's so funny about cancer? The answer is nothing, but the way the characters react to cancer in 50/50 and the way that they learn to cope with it is both laugh out loud funny and touching. 50/50 is incredibly acted as well..everyone puts their all into their roles. 50/50 is not a cringe- inducing mockery of cancer like it could of potentially been, but is instead a comedy that makes my list of the best films of 2011 so far, and it may even be on the top.",,Anonymous,Romance
Chix Chat on Film review: Young man receives a cancer diagnosis.,"Shame on me for expecting a story based on actual events and cancer to be a comedy. After all the film did feature Seth Rogen (Kyle) prominently, he is without a doubt a comedic presence, and he did provide the comic relief for this film. But the film itself was no comedy as was represented by the trailer. I am not a big fan of dramas and no fan at all of cancer, but this film was done very nicely with its handling of the somber subject matter. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) plays an affable young man who just like most everyone else on the planet is going about living his life, has parents with his mother Diane (Angelica Houston)dealing with age related issues, a best friend from childhood Kyle and a steady girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) when he finds out that he has cancer. I have to say that I agreed inaudibly with every mean spirited derogatory word that Kyle used audibly to describe Rachael. Everything said was exactly how she was portrayed so convincingly and the remarkable thing was that she did not seem to realize what a total bee-otch she was. Who gives a person that is potentially dying and needs to be cared for a dog that seems like it is potentially dying and needs to be cared for? Again this film is based on a true story so I think that Rachael wins the prize for Worst Girlfriend Ever! I digress. It turns out that the type of cancer that Adam has comes with a fifty-fifty chance of him surviving. He actually appears to handle the whole situation fairly well, he begins to follow the prescribed treatment plan and encounters others who are dealing with their own illness. Part of the treatment to aid him in dealing with his diagnosis includes sessions with a therapist. The most interesting dynamic was between Adam and Katherine (Anna Kendrick) as she works on developing a therapist-patient relationship we learn as much about her as a person as we have about Adam. The thing that made this film enjoyable was the fact that it was not just about cancer it was a buddy tale. Would that everyone could have a really good friend like Kyle to be there in one of the toughest times of their life, still when the story began to wind down I found myself asking 'what happens next?', which in part is the reason for the amber light.",,Anonymous,Romance

Inspirational film that touches many,"""50/50"" is a beautiful movie because of how many times we see ourselves in Adam's world. Adam is a healthy, average young adult with his life seemingly figured out; he has a best friend Kyle, an attractive girlfriend Rachel, and a steady job in sound. Adam enjoys a balanced life. Although he can never seem to get ahead, he appears content with his position.When Adam is diagnosed for back cancer, he battles the ticking clock for a sense of himself and the meaning of life. 50/50 represents his chances of survival; a scary probability that few have feared before.The focus of the movie shifts between Adam and Kyle's friendship, Adam's personal life with his parents, psychologist Katie, and girlfriend, and Adam's cancer that slowly eats away at his safety and happiness. Many audience members can relate to the characters, who judge themselves heavily on their usefulness to Adam. Every parent who find themselves on the outside of their child's life, looking in, can relate to Adam's mother, who struggles to love her way into her son's life. Meanwhile, best friends watching the movie understand Kyle's feeling of helplessness; the attempt and inability to help their friend. Young adults in the audience can relate to Katie, who struggles with the infancy of her psychology career.50/50 is a beautiful film because viewers see themselves as one or a combination of each of the characters. Seth Rogen writes a beautiful yet funny script with superb scenes representing Adam's feelings and state of life.",,Anonymous,Romance
Chix Chat on Film (Catt) Reviews 50/50,"From the trailer you would think that this film was a comedy about cancer, but you would be seriously wrong. Although there were some very funny lines in the film, this film gets realistic really quick. Being that it is based on a true story, the lead character, Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) very quickly became very endearing. The story emphasizes that although you can follow all the rules, be a nice guy and treat people with respect, you can still get cancer. I really liked Joseph in Inception, but I liked him even more in this film. I think that he captured the essence of the fear that ensues when those dreadful words come roaring out of your doctor's mouth. Once again Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael) is strapped with the mean-girl role. She was not quite as mean as she was in The Help, but if there is one person that you want to hate in this film, it is her. Hopefully she will not be type-cast and can get out and spread her wings a bit. Seth Rogan (Kyle) turns out to be a true friend. He is the type of friend that I hope that I have should the occasion arise. Seth was responsible for adding some light-heartedness to this otherwise dismal film and he did an exceptional job. The rest of the cast also pulled at your heart-strings with everyone having their own challenges in their lives. Diane (Anjelica Huston), Adam's mom was the typical concerned mom who was also dealing with her husband Richard's (Serge Houde) situation. I am not sure if I could ever be as strong as she had to be in this film. I guess you just have to deal with things as things arise and roll with the punches. Katherine (Anna Kendrick) was a pleasant addition to the cast as the sometime bumbling psychologist.This film was just as much about relationships as it was about dealing with cancer. The scriptwriter, Will Reiser was brilliant in understanding just the right things to say at exactly the right time. Hopefully this will get him out of the shadows of his cousin, Paul Reiser. There was not one minute that I felt bored or uninterested, but I do not think that this is a ""must-see"" film, even though it did make me laugh out loud and made me shed more than just a few tears. I am giving this film a very, very bright amber light.",,Anonymous,Romance
a seemingly incongruent mix that works,"Late-twenties, straight-arrow Seattle public journalist has his world rocked when he's diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer. Learning that it's a toss-up between recovery and metastasis, he embarks on a journey of self-examination taking along his bawdy, opportunistic best friend/co-worker, his reticent, artistic girlfriend, his green but straight-talking therapist, and his thoughtful but smothering mother along for the ride. An uncommon, interesting blend of funny and sad, with a believably flawed collection of characters played to a tee by a reputable cast. The dialogue is more vulgar than necessary at times, but still amusing, and the emotional, hard-hitting moments really make up for any of the off-color humor. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
100% Approved,"50 50 2011Inspired by writer Will Reiser's own experience with cancer, 50 50 stars the adorable Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He gives a heart wrenching, as well as warming, performance as Adam Lerner, a 27 year old journalist who is diagnosed with cancer.Alongside Levitt, Seth Rogan gives an almost equally commendable performance through skilfully injecting humour into this sensitive story line. A particularly memorable example of this being when Lerner, worried about his chances of survival, confides in his friend, Kyle (Rogan) that the likelihood of him surviving cancer is 50/50. In response to this, Kyle shakes his head saying ""Oh God, I'm gonna be sick, I'm going to throw up"", his empathy and drama lifting the mood and providing light in this very dark story. This method of mixing a theme as serious as cancer with humour is done very intelligently; the film aptly tip toes along the line between appropriately hilarious and being rallied against.Kyle is a very interesting character in 50 50 in the way that he seems to be, in ways, Adam's alter ego; it appears that Adam keeps burying his feelings about his disease and how the situation is affecting him but Kyle is an outward portrayal of what he is really thinking. An example of this would be the scene in which Lerner shaves his head. He is staring in the mirror holding the clippers and telling himself that it's going to look fine whilst Kyle, in the background of the shot, is shaking his head saying ""No it's not, no it's not. It's going to look weird."" This not only adds humour but provides the audience an insight into Adam's true feelings of the situation.Adam shaving his head (Time 31:41) Moreover, Bryce Dallas Howard plays girlfriend and antagonist Rachael masterfully. The audience is able to not only recognise her as the film's ""baddie"" but also empathise with her and recognise that, despite how immoral her actions are, she believes she is also a victim; this expertly creates a three dimensional character whom we can both hate and understand. However, I cannot ignore that this is also due to a remarkable script writing on Reiser's part. Nevertheless I think that Howard is, without question, deserving of applause for her contribution.A particularly moving scene in 50 50 is one in which Adam is in hospital and about to be wheeled off into the operating theatre and undergo life threatening surgery in order to overcome his cancer. There is an almost overwhelming degree of desperation to live that seeps from the screen and it, despite the cliché hand grasping, works beautifully.Adam being taken to the operating theatre (Time 1:26:36) However, although this film seems initially without fault, after considering 50 50 further I came to realise the very strange way in which doctors are represented. Doctors are presented to the audience very negatively and without an obvious explanation as to why. An example of such negative representations would be the dizzy, unprofessional – in spite of her efforts - and under experienced psychiatrist, Katherine McKay (Anna Kendrick) that has been entrusted with this serious case. Her naïvity and youth exemplified through a reference to Doogie Howser and her confusion as to who/what that is and justification of asking, ""Does he work here?"" McKay progresses in the film to be a seminal character but is awarded such importance through such innocence and not via her skills as a psychiatrist. Another example of such representations would be when character Kyle goes as far as undermining a surgeon when she is telling him, and Lerner's mother, the result of Adam's surgery. In addition to this, the doctor who initially diagnoses Lerner's cancer is cold and distant when delivering the news and treats Adam as if he is a nuisance when he interrupts him making notes on this unique case. This coldness could be interpreted as exaggerating the protagonist's personality as polite and innocent with a juxtaposing character, however it just further reinforces the idea that doctors, or those in the medical industry, do not care.Nevertheless, the fore mentioned scene, in which Lerner is diagnosed, is brilliantly shot. As he receives the news and the word ""cancer"" is uttered the audience hears nothing further than white noise. The screen fills with disjointed close ups and mid shots, illustrating that Adam is no longer concentrating on what the doctor is saying and is deafened by the weight of the word.The film creates what seems to be an insight into an alternative view of the experience of being diagnosed with cancer. It provides us with a 27 year old man who, as well as deserving sympathy, still uses his illness to get girls, uses his friend's pubic hair trimmers to shave his head and, along with the other cancer patients, eats macaroons laced with marijuana when being treated with chemotherapy. 50 50 presents the audience with a cancer sufferer who is uncomfortable with sympathy and wishes people would be honest with him and isn't allowing the disease to become part of his identity or reflect how people interact with him. This alternative view, that alleviates the weight of the topic with wittiness and hilarity, makes 50 50 a refreshingly honest film.More reviews at http://sophiesum.wordpress.com/",,Anonymous,Romance
Well-done,"50/50 was not what I expected it to be. It's not a great film, but it definitely wasn't cloying with sentimentality very much. In fact, there is music, but many times the film's most dramatic moments play out without music, and they also ring true. I do have to say, the film did a great job of balancing the humor and the more serious drama. I wasn't sure how it would do it, but it did it very well. It is not a comedy before a drama, but it isn't a drama first either. Both aspects are handled equal to each other, and sorry for the pun, 50/50.The screenplay is pretty well written, and there are a lot of great scenes in this. The cast only helps it. Bryce Dallas Howard is here yet again playing another unlikable bitch, but I mean she does it very well. But thing is, you want to like her, but ultimately she lets you down. Basically how Levitt felt. Anna Kendrick was sweet, and she captured her character well, despite being similar to her in Up in the Air. Seth Rogen started off annoying me, but I mean, he rises above with a good script (as was evident in Observe and Report). He also becomes very likable. The main reason to see this is for Levitt. This is definitely his best performance so far. In the film most serious scenes, he is fantastic, and he is the one swaying your your emotions.Overall, a very good film, and an example of how to make something memorable from this subject matter and still appeal to the mainstream.",,Anonymous,Romance
Pushes Your Emotions With Ease,"I just saw 50/50 on a whim having seen one trailer (which I will talk down about in a moment) and liking Seth Rogan in pretty much anything I've seen him in. I wasn't prepared to be fighting the movie as it tried to yank tears out of my eye ducts, mostly because of the trailer.Now granted, I kind of dismissed the trailer a bit. Again, I saw Seth Rogan doing his usual funny comments on and coming up with plans that backfire but the gist of the trailer made it seem like two desperate friends come up with a scheme to get women. My guess based on the trailer was that sooner or later, the secret would come out that no one was suffering from cancer. Yeah, thanks a lot, trailer. That's TWICE you've completely misrepresented movies in a span of a month (Drive being the other).So to the actual movie, it centers around a young guy who seems to pride himself on being healthy, doing the right thing (we see him in the opening credits wait for a crosswalk to turn green even while someone else just crosses the street anyway because no cars are coming) due in no small part to an over concerned mother who seems to be overbearing but with good intentions. But even living healthy cannot stop the emergence of a rare cancer in his spine.While the movie was very heartfelt (again, tear-jerking galore from the middle to the end of the movie), it was also very funny. Seth Rogan provided the goof-ball comic relief while Anna Kendrick and Levitt's interactions as first timers on both sides of the psychologist and patient relationship provide at time hilarious interactions as both deal with reality. Angelica Huston was very convincing as the too-much- concerned-with-everything mother who wants very badly to help but keeps offering it in ways Levitt doesn't want.Overall, it was very fun in the scenes where Seth and Joseph dueling with the cancer and insincere girlfriends. One of my favorite scenes involves Seth Rogan's reaction to learning of Levitt's girlfriend's secret and how he lets him know. Very funny stuff.If you're looking for a goof-ball comedy, don't let the trailers fool you. This is more or less on the same lines as movies like Knocked Up, but with much more emphasis on the drama side of things as cancer and death are a lot more serious issues to deal with as a human than being an unexpected parent. In all, a good rounded flick and one to watch and actually take something from when you leave the theater.8/10",,Anonymous,Romance

Worth Your Time. Worth Your Money. A Surprisingly Good Film.,"Nicely scripted, hugely improvised & emotionally investing, the story of 50/50 is actually based on this film's writer, Will Reiser, who penned down the screenplay covering his own struggle with cancer & ends up making a satire out of it without really hurting the sentiments of anyone undergoing through the same diagnosis in their lives.50/50 concerns Adam; a 27-year old guy who learns that he's diagnosed with a rare form of spinal cancer & that his chances of survival is 50%. The plot covers his subsequent struggle to beat the disease but in the process, he is finally able to see who & what are the most important things in his life.Wonderfully directed by Jonathan Levine, the film deals with its sensitive subject in a real mature manner without hiding the pitiful sympathies these diagnosed patients receive from everyone at home or work, most of whom don't even really give a shite about what happens to you & simply pretend to care.Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt & his performance is really good. He carries off his character pretty well & nicely captures the experience of unexpected shock after finding out about the disease, the nervousness & fear of living with it, the change an event like this brings in life and the everyday struggle & frustration that comes along when you know that your days are numbered.Yet, the biggest contribution comes from Seth Rogen in the role of Kyle; Adam's best friend who tries everything to prevent Adam from breaking down, is always there to cheer him up & treats him as if nothing major has happened. The rest of the supporting cast also chip in with fine performances & leaves nothing major to complain.On an overall scale, 50/50 isn't a depressing cinematic experience but an enjoyable one which makes excellent use of humour from start to finish to keep the whole drama a lighthearted affair despite dealing with a serious illness & truly succeeds in accomplishing what it set out to do. Worth your time. Worth your money. Don't miss it.",,Anonymous,Romance
It's not The Hangover with Cancer – it's more.,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : 50/50MINI REVIEW : It's not The Hangover with Cancer – it's more.RATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: ""See it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time"")Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt – ""Third Rock from the Sun"", ""10 Things I hate about you"") works for a public radio station. His girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard – ""The Help"" & daughter to Ron Howard) is a self- absorbed abstract artist. When Adam is diagnosed with spinal cancer, she puts on a show of caring, but is otherwise distracted. Adam's best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen – ""Pinapple Express"", ""Knocked Up"") takes a different view of his buddy's situation – it's babe candy.Adam goes to neophyte psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick – ""Twilight"", ""Scott Pilgrim"") for counseling. She is awkward and inexperienced but earnest in her concern for Adam. Adam is also smothered by his doting mother (Anjelica Huston – ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"") who is caring for his father (Serge Houde). The stage is set and we're off The previews for this movie make it look like ""The Hangover"" but with cancer. But it is more. It's a true-life-inspired story about a young man (Adam) who is facing life-threatening cancer. It's approached with a sense of humor and sensitivity. We meet Adam, who is just getting started in life. He eats right, obeys all the rules (he doesn't even cross against a street light despite there being no traffic), and still receives the devastating news that he could die from cancer. The irony is he never learned to drive because it is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States.Adam is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a very straight manner. We learn that he is a very giving, even forgiving man. Perhaps too much so as he has become a doormat for all the women in his life.His best friend, Kyle, is played by Seth Rogen who is the obvious comic relief. Kyle seems to be an odds maker and when he learns that Adam's chances of Kyle can think of nothing more than getting laid and sees Adam's cancer as a way of improving their odds.Both actors bring an honesty to their roles that is palpable. The film is less about cancer and more about how people respond to responsibility. We see the girlfriend who just goes through the motions. The mother who (already overwhelmed with taking care of her Alzheimer's husband) wants to move in. The best friend who relates to his buddy the only way he knows how – to get laid.For a heartwarming story, told with sympathy and humor, I recommend you ""see it in theaters.""",,Anonymous,Romance
