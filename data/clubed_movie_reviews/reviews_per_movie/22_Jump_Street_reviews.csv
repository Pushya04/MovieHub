On par with the first one!,"It's pretty easy to review this one. If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat. It holds up to the expectations and plays cleverly with 'being aware' of making basically the same movie again. The good thing about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some surprises and good action. I basically laughed from the first minute up to the (awesome!) end credits! If you like that type of comedy, this one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the funniest flick this year so far! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and you can see and feel, how they enjoyed doing this movie. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or professors for that matter). Everyone who's been to college can relate to those stereotypes (e.g. the pseudo intellectuals, the sport jocks, the art students etc.) and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""The Lego Movie"") do a great job spoofing those clichés while at same time debunk the downsides and shallowness of those groups or college life in general.Verdict: Go see it, if you liked the first one. I can't say if it's better, but it certainly holds up. And I liked the first one pretty much. So there you go...",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
As good as I remember.,"I watched this right after 21 jump street. This started off better for me. I was cracking at ""my name is Jeff."" I somehow absolutely forgot about that. I had to pause to stop laughing. I still remembered the slam poetry scene, because it felt pretty accurate lol. That's literally what I hear when someone shows me slam poetry. Weird seeing Wyatt Russell in this after seeing his roles in Monarch tv series and Night swim recently. Funniest bit was the Captains daughter bit. I don't know if I remember correctly but Kevin Hart was also sleeping with ice cube's daughter or something in 'Ride Along' too? This keeps happening to him lol. I think it was written better, still dumb and childish, but better. I loved the open relationship/investigation thing, the movie is filled with relationship metaphors throughout. It teased so many jump street sequels and I was laughing because surely your cover could be blown after so many undercover missions. Anyway I enjoyed this much more than the first, certainly got a lot more laughs out of me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good and Properly Stupid,"All these reviews are bashing the crap out of this movie. 'It's aimless drivel and only for mindless idiots'. Well....Yeah. When I watch a comedy like this that's what I hope for. Sometime you just want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half and watch two familiar ""actors"" play out ridiculous but easy enough to grasp scenarios while they foolishly react. A post-viewing critique is pointless because the directors have no intention of it being able to hold up on creative or any kind of artistic merit. If you want to think about what you're watching, or enjoy good story development, or simply see some great acting then there are plenty of movies like Rashomon, Eraserhead, The Man from Earth, Memories of Murder, Hitchcock films, Miyszaki films, or something like Life Is Beautiful or It's A Wonderful Life(I forget which is which, both great). And there's nothing wrong with a good documentary know and then either. But something good and properly stupid can be just the right thing when you need to take a respite. Not all comedies are going to be a quipping Woody Allen flicks. It's really about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right one for your current mood. In other words this movie is just what it intends to be and just what wanted it to be. Pure and easy entertainment....Now I'm going to get my Audrey Hepburn on and watch My Fair Lady.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Successfully Jumping Back On The Street,"My initial expectations were that '22 Jump Street' would be an over-the- top and cheesy sequel created solely to make money... I was wrong. '22 Jump Street' truly builds on the basis of the first film, further expanding upon the bromantic chemistry between Tatum and Hill creating an even more solid sequel full of good-natured humour and relentless action that made its predecessor such a great film. With Ice Cube having more of an impact this time round, the trio pursue their leads to ensure the villains are brought to justice. The direction duo have pulled off another amazing film to add to their filmography, a truly impressive and hilariously funny film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A worthy sequel,"Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22 Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good exercise for your cheeks,"First of all, big complements to the protagonists. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity.22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. At the other hand, I think this is something that you can easily look past because of how enjoyable the movie is. The requirement of a comedy is to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills it totally. Your cheeks will definitely have a good exercise! ;)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Doing Everything The Same. Only Better.,"Usually remakes aren't very good, with many bombing and being outshone by the original version. But to everyone's surprise 21 Jump Street was a hit, earning 200 million and giving the careers of both Hill and Tatum a big boost to two already big names. Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back.. Well, that's exactly what 22 Jump Street also does, with as much as possible remaining just the same. The difference being that it's honest about it, with the entire film mocking the regular clichés.Even the outline of the plot mocks the regular concept of every sequel. Hill and Tatum are constantly reminded to do everything the exact same as last time at every chance they get to say it. The logic being since it worked last time, it'll work again. Only this time they'll throw more money at it to better ensure success. Because increasing the budget is certain to increase the profit. This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming.It works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel.On top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here. If anything more so here, with their conversations growing more like a married couple and a lot more opportunities to be hilariously over the top.Which is the main reason that 22 Jump Street is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. It's everything that 21 Jump Street was, just bigger and better. With the likes of this, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Lego Movie it's clear that Lord and Miller are quickly becoming 2 of the biggest and best names in comedy using both slapstick and mocking clichés to keep the laughs coming strong. I don't know whether they intend to do any more sequels, but as long as they maintain the consistently funny films that they have so far I can only hope that they make as many jump streets as they can.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bromantic comedy of the year,"Quickie Review:After a successful undercover drug bust operation in high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) get their next big assignment. Now in the sequel 22 Jump Street, as Ice Cube so eloquently put it, these ""two sons of b***hes are going to college."" As the cop duo take on yet another drug ring, they go through multitude of ridiculous yet hilarious situations. In doing so, there are some formulaic traps that the movie does fall into. Despite that, it is just an incredible ride with non-stop laughter and great comedic chemistry between the lead actors. This is a must-see for fans of 21 Jump Street and people who generally like to laugh.Full Review:The original movie, 21 Jump Street, was a surprise hit back in 2012. It was a movie filled with many belly aching moments of laughter. For that reason, of all the comedies of 2014 this sequel may be the most anticipated, at least it was for me. So the question is: does it deliver on the high expectations? And the answer is: oh hell yes it does.There is one absolute in this franchise that no one will dispute, the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. Then when they do go about their shenanigans, numerous twists and turns occur that are fun to watch unfold, to hilarious effect. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity. The combination of the comedic duo and the intelligent humor work flawlessly, making the flick all the more entertaining. As great as the two leads are with their comedic timing, I need to especially mention Ice Cube. I won't spoil anything of course, but there are points in this movie where Ice Cube actually steals the scenes he is in. I'd pay the full movie ticket price just to see that dynamic between Ice Cube and the two leads. It is that good.I do recognize there are some faults with 22 Jump Street. It did stick with the philosophy of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" In that sense, the general story plot is pretty much the same as the original movie. 22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. Still, I think this is something that you can easily look past because of how enjoyable the movie is.The one purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills that requirement consistently throughout the movie. By throughout the movie, I mean even during the credits. Your cheeks will have a good exercise, because mine were in pain with all the laughing. It is well worth your time and money, so don't miss out on this one. If they keep this up I will be there even at 1022 Jump Street.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Giggles from start to finish,"11 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 22 Jump Street. This film was a hoot!!! I only watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend in preparation for the sequel and although I enjoyed it I have to say the sequel was much better. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a great double act and the film provides just the right amount of slapstick humour combined with witty banter and the serious side of undercover police work. Imagine if you will two undercover cops, not the brightest pair, sent back to college to infiltrate the latest drug ring. Whatever you are imagining.....it's in this sequel. Hill and Tatum are tight.....they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution.......Spring Break. A giggle from start to finish and Channing Tatum's not bad to look at either. Stay for the credits!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Weird But One Of The Funniest Films I Have Seen This Year,"The sequel to 21 Jump Street, is by far the funniest film I have seen this year. This was probably due to it being the weirdest film I have seen this year also, as you really couldn't predict what was coming next.22 Jump Street has basically the same concept of 21 Jump Street, where Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing the two main characters get sent to college to investigate yet another drug case. When I heard about the plot and seeing the trailer, I was worried they would ruin the movie as like most comedy films, the only funny bits are in the trailer and the story looked the exact same as the first. However this movie made me laugh from start to finish. The trailer is only a teaser to what really is a great comedy film.If you like the first movie, I would definitely recommend seeing the second as it is on par with 21 Jump Street, or even if I was pushed to make a choice between the two, I would say the second film is funnier than the first.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funniest film of the year (so far!),"Keeping this brief, this is no doubt the funniest film I've seen since the turn of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing ""Ride Along"", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.Expect non-stop entertainment as excellent humour is mixed with an interesting yet simple plot, heartfelt moments and exciting action. My only complaint would be that at times it felt a little recycled from the first film. Though having enjoyed that I wasn't too fussed.More than worth your moneys worth. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then you'd be mad not to see this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Huge disappointment.,"It was exactly what I expected from start to finish. Not something that I was at all interested in. There wasn't any hilarious parts that grabbed my attention. It was as if the took the plot from 21 Jumpstreet, did some role reversal, and threw in some twists to throw you off. I knew exactly who the mastermind was as soon as they were introduced. It's as if you weren't suppose to suspect that it was the one person that didn't have a huge role. The comedy wasn't horrible. But it wasn't anything out of the ordinary either. I'm not a huge Jonah Hill fan. I don't find him funny. He's whiny in every movie he plays in. And he's super annoying. He needs to find another persona to take on in his next film. Just the uttering of his name makes me not want to ever watch another movie he has even the smallest part in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Hits all the right notes, thanks to Hill and Tatum's excellent chemistry","If there's one criticism I have about 22 Jump Street, it's that the movie feels too similar to 21 Jump Street. But is that really a complaint? With 22 Jump Street, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie) have created a massively entertaining ride, with more antics from the characters we love, and better performances all around.This time around, they're going to college. Yeah, yeah, we've heard it before. As Ice Cube says at the end of the first film, in which the two went undercover at a high school, the tables have been turned and they're going to college now. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) must once again go undercover at MC State to bust another drug operation, this time called WHYPHY (work hard? yes. play hard? yes.)What worked with 21 Jump Street works again in 22 Jump Street. The excellent characters of Schmidt and Jenko are once again paired to make a hilarious and charismatic duo. Their personalities clash once more, but in a different way than the first film, and they get into even more crazy shenanigans than before. This includes having a shootout in the university library and busting a Spring Break beach party. 22 Jump Street always keeps you on edge, wondering what will happen next. While the plot is pretty standard and similar to the first film, you'll want to stick around because you love these characters so much. New characters such as Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Mercedes (Jillian Bell) feel right at home within the crazy cast. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is also in rare form, delivering some of the film's best moments.This is a testament to Hill and Tatum, who put so much work into creating these characters. Jenko settles into the football team, and makes friends at a fraternity, while Schmidt performs slam poetry and does many walks of shame. Hill and Tatum are in top form. Their chemistry is better than ever, making 22 Jump Street a hilarious buddy comedy. Try not to laugh when Schmidt does slam poetry to impress a girl, I dare you.What makes 22 Jump Street feel special is its self-referential attitude and countless meta jokes. Police chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) essentially explains why this movie was made within the first 10 minutes, saying ""no one cared about the Jump Street reboot, but you guys got lucky."" It's a funny way to be self-deprecating and hilarious at the same time. It plays to the audience's intelligence, rather than making them feel stupid. Other references are more subtle, like when Schmidt keeps asking about the film's budget. It all plays into a very interesting and unique humor style. While there are plenty of raunchy jokes (right in the crack), the film's best come from its self-referencing.So, now for the all-important question: is 22 Jump Street better than the original? With its meta jokes and its excellent characterization, 22 Jump Street is a rousing success, and matches the original in sheer humor. But the plot feels too similar to the original. While this may be a fault in the film's format, a few more twists would have been appreciated. Still, 22 Jump Street is a hilarious ride, one definitely worth taking.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This is outrageously funny!,"This was a laugh out loud, outrageously funny movie from start to finish and a great time at the movies. The odd couple pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum continues to work really well. I haven't enjoyed a tandem like this since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker from the Rush Hour movies. Tatum continues to surprise as he clearly has a funny side (it's not all Jonah Hill here); comedy and action movies might just be his wheelhouse. Ice Cube and Jillian Bell (Dixie from Eastbound & Down) also provide their share of really funny moments (especially Jillian who has a few gut busting scenes with Jonah near the end).I was worried the shtick would feel stale after 21 Jump Street but I was surprised that it was just as funny as the original (if not better). While it does drag a bit down the stretch, it wasn't unbearable. It's a buddy comedy that does what it's supposed to: make you laugh and *laugh a lot*. If you enjoyed the first one, make sure you catch this hilarious sequel.Was my review not horrible? Great!

A decent sequel,"I was excited to see this sequel after enjoying the original but this sequel didn't live upto the expectations.The story was simple, funny but little bit boring, the screenplay was average (the original one had a strong one), the director did a good job and the performances by the cast members were brilliant, especially their comic timing.All the elements shown in the movie either it be comedy, drama or romance, all were properly blend but the main problem with the movie was it's draggy screenplay which makes this sequel a little bit underwhelming.Overall, even after all the flaws, it was an good entertainer which you can definitely watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious and the funniest movie for the rest of the summer.,"22 jump Street pulls off an amazing balancing act between elements of its predecessor whilst adding many new and better plot twists, characters and jokes.This movie is hilarious and fun and wins us over from the start by making fun of itself as a sequel, but like many of its other ongoing jokes, juices this just enough to get maximum laughs without it becoming annoying.22 jump Street should not only be regarded as one of the rare sequels to better an already good first film, but as a case study for all comedy sequels on how to not just replicate predecessors but truly BUILD on them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

They're not 21 anymore,"This movie is still based on the series 21 Jump Street that went from 1987 to 1991, but this movie knows it is not going to be like the show just like the first movie. I thought 22 Jump Street (2014) was as good as 21 Jump Street (2012) or better than it in some way.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are both still incredibly good in the movie, I still like their characters, and I still liked seeing them have chemistry with each other. They were still very funny, and I thought they also did action scenes well, plus Ice Cube is still very funny when he is talking to Channing Tatum's and Jonah Hill's characters about doing their jobs and telling them they are messing up in their assignment.The movie makes fun of the last movie and Hollywood sequels, more police officer cliches at times, and the main characters age when blending into college even though they should fit in. The action scenes and/or chase scenes were fun, funny, and entertaining to watch especially the third act climax.It has a funny ending with the movie having another message in there about people who are addicted to drugs, but this movie has the funniest end credits scenes I have ever seen that I recommend seeing when you get the chance. 22 Jump Street (2014) was a fun, funny, and entertaining movie that is between being as good as the first or being better than the first, and I think people would enjoy this sequel as much as the first if you liked the first movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just like last time,"After the critical and commercial success of 21 Jump Street here is the inevitable sequel with a bigger budget, bigger sets and more bromance.22 Jump Street is just across the road from 21 Jump Street but this station is more hi tech. The duo of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) go back on the Jump Street program to work for the angry and shouty Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) but this time they go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as 'WHYPHY' that killed a college student photographed buying it on campus.The film makes a lot of references to the plotting of the previous film as if the film is making a statement that sequels tend to be a rehash of the original and not as good. In essence 22 Jump Street is a retread of the first film with this time jokes about how old they look as college students.Still the film is enjoyable enough, the gags still make you laugh, the cast seem to be having fun, there are enough action set pieces that some to be parodying the Fast and Furious films.The end credits scenes is inspired as they go through future sequel ideas including a cameo from another star from the original television series leading to the poster for Generations: Jump Street.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not Outstanding... but still pretty damn funny,"I was looking forward to seeing 22 Jump Street because of the fact that the other comedies of the summer I was looking forward to.... sucked. (Neighbors and Million Ways). This was by far in my opinion not better than the first one. In my opinion I believe that a good comedy movie is a great plot with a lot of laughs and doesn't over do it. 22 Jump Street had a weird plot and was definitely rusty from the start. Ice Cube played a much larger role in this one and I enjoyed it because he adds a lot of humor to the story as well. Jonah and Channing are great as always and provided a lot of laughs on screen. It wasn't outstanding, but so far the best comedy of the summer. I think they should stop after this one though. There was a sign of foreshadowing in the beginning but hopefully that is only a teaser because I think it will ruin what they have going if they make a third one. Know where to draw the line! If you go see it... you're in for a few laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 Jump Street is a funny bromance/meta comedy...but it becomes old quick,"Creating a sequel to a fantasy like How to Train Your Dragon has to be easier then a comedy. I know that a lot of work already goes into an animated movie, but there is one reason why How to Train Your Dragon has the simpler job then something like 21 Jump Street; the element of surprise. A lot of writers assigned to these movies could spend hours on story and character development, which is fine, but their sequel can only work if they bring in something new and unpredictable. Continuing to stay unpredictable in a comedy is tough.Take something like Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's one of the most famous sketch comedies shows of all time, emphasizing heavily on taking scenarios and taking it into a crazy direction. It threw off peoplefor a while. The final season proved that even the randomness can become predictable as we now know that going from point A to point B is not going to happen; it's going to be just as nutty as the early seasons were. Yet while the earlier shows were new, the later seasons resulted in sketches that simply were not as funny as we have picked up on the shows attitude, making it harder to give us something that were not expecting. So let's see if 22 Jump Street found us something new.If you saw the first movie, then you know that it ends with our heroes Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) being told their going to college. And that exactly what they do. Their sent to a college where they go undercover as undergraduates to find a new drug that's hitting the scene called WHYPHY (pronounced the same as WiFi) that already caused the death of another student.Just as in the first movie, they assume the same identities and ask other students for clues and possible drug dealer suspects. The switch up here is that Jenko becomes the big man on campus when he makes friends with a frat house jock named Zook (played by Wyatt Russell) that becomes a prime suspect. Schmidt on the other hand makes friendly with an art major, Maya while dealing with having to work on his own. The boys police captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) occasionally comes in to help and even help fight in the final battle that takes place in Spring Break in Mexico.As I said, this is basically the same movie all over again, so this must be a really bad film right? Not exactly. The joke of the previous movie was that 21 Jump Street ripped off of 1980's cop movies, so 22 Jump Street instead makes fun of itself and movie sequels in general. This may be the most self-referential movie comedy, even more so then satires that know their movies. For the most part, they are really funny, though unlike Blazing Saddles and Scary Movie that seem to be in a better mind frame to keep calling out that it's only a movie, 22 Jump Street is still keen on keeping it in a real world. This causes the meta references to get old really fast and even a touch out of place.So along the meta material, does the movie have the same wit as the first film? I expected 22 Jump Street to be a lot wilder and a lot funnier. A lot of the wit is still there, but I wasn't laughing as much. When I was trying to figure out why, I think it maybe that I realized that neither leads have really learned anything from the first movie except to stay friends. How to Train Your Dragon 2 was not afraid to mature their characters and still keep them funny, so I was hoping Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum would have at least matured a little bit.I'll give this six football helmets out of five. It delivers what it promises, but like our heroes, I wish it had more ambition to go crazier with it's scenario. Let's see them in classes or clubs or something. 22 Jump Street is a passable comedy, but it makes me want to reexamine the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Plain review,"22 Jump Street, sequel of the amazing 21 jump street is an utterly entertaining comedy which is guaranteed to elicit rounds of laughter just like its predecessor. Directed by Phil Lord, this movie subsumes both solid content and good screenplay. The lead pair of Schmidt(J. Hill) and Jenko (C. Tatum) does an excellent job with their chemistry serving as an icing on the cake to a fabulously written script. The two men who are disguised as cops go to a local college to bust a drug distribution network following the orders of 'The Captain'. The story builds on their interactions with the college students, possible suspects and the investigations they carry out. Hill wins the hearts of the audience with the timing of his hilarious dialogs while the mysterious setup of the movie keeps the viewer engaged. An impressive aspect of the movie is that it does an excellent job observing the different aspects of college life which everyone who has attended college can relate to. I would give the movie a perfect rating of 10 on 10 as it is a must see for people who like to laugh !",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Arrested development,"""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" That seems to be the underlying philosophy of '22 Jump Street', a sequel that embraces sticking to the formula to the point of almost becoming meta. Several times throughout the film, characters slyly reference the idea of not over thinking things and just doing what they did last time. That serves '22 Jump Street' well, as it gives people what they want, while still managing to slip in enough new threads to keep things fresh.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have a fantastic chemistry together, complementing one another perfectly while creating one of the best bromances in recent screen history. Along with an expanded role from Ice Cube—who nearly steals the show—the cast lift the material to another level.'22 Jump Street' is a little more uneven than its predecessor, but at its best it surpasses it. With its deft blend of comedy, action and a surprising amount of heart, it's a text book summer popcorn film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The most 'self aware' sequel ever made,"The first film, '21 Jump Street,' was a surprise hit. How do we know? Because the cast of '22 Jump Street' tells us as much in the script. At first I wondered whether I was imagining it, but then I realised it was basically the 'running joke' of the movie that the film-makers were only too aware how lucky they were to get the chance to make a sequel.In fact, the story is exactly the same as the first – two junior cops must infiltrate high school in order to catch the bad guys. This could be considered a 'weak point' in the plot, yet the film happily exploits its own 'failings' on order to draw laughs from the fact that it's basically the same as before.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry as the two leads and their dynamics is what saves the film. I didn't expect to like the first film and was as surprised at how good it was. However, I did think that – despite the good, self-aware gags – it was less funny than its predecessor. That's mainly the middle of the film when it does tend to drag a bit. The first and last third seem to play better when it comes to laughs.If you liked the first film, I'd say you might as well see this one, too. It's not quite as sharp, but there is just enough laughs (apart from the 'self aware' stuff) to warrant your time, although I didn't think it was as good as some critics have been saying. I heard a lot of people saying how it surpassed the original. I wouldn't agree with that, but it is okay, just not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Worthy sequel,"It doesn't happen often, that I think a sequel is at least as good as the original movie. But this kind of even topped the original. It's really great, because it is so self aware. Not only of itself, but in general (talking sequels or its stars, especially Channing Tatum makes fun of himself a lot). You'll either cherish and are delighted by this fact or you don't really care.If you do care and have seen the original (Ice Cube also returning), you will love where this is going. Sometimes it's borderline mental (story-wise), but in the end it all makes ""sense"". Well as much sense as this can make. Obviously this was very successful and another sequel might be on its way (curious to see who's going to cameo in that then) soon. Ideas where this might go? Probably not the ones discussed during the end credits of the movie ... which gives the viewer a lot ""sequel ideas"" to go home with .. or sleep on! ;o)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 Jump Street,"After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jeko when they go deep undercover at a local college.22 Jump Street is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who are coming fresh after the success of The Lego Movie. It's starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, back from the first movie 21 Jump Street. This film makes fun of comedies and action movies; and it does a great job at doing it. 21 Jump Street was a huge surprise, if I'm being honest I thought it would be terrible but instead it was hilarious and very clever. This time they've being able to surprising again with this film and even better. The chemistry between Tatum and Hill is once again excellent, and they handled action sequences better than in the first one. Plus, there are extra scenes to stick around for at the end; and let me tell you that the end credits are actually the funniest thing ever. This film is really effective, totally aware of itself and enjoyable. I laughed. I liked what they did with the character and where their relationship goes. What else could we ask for in a comedy? At the same time it's the exact same film as 21 Jump Street but the fact that they're joking about that and in the know of it makes it more O-K to watch. it's a tie as it feels on the one hand like a proper sequel and on the other hand like a reboot.Overall 22 Jump Street for the most part is better than 21 Jump Street, I loved the chemistry between the stars and there are a lot of great jokes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Not Quite As Good As The First, But Funny Its  Own Right","This film constantly acknowledges the fact that it's a sequel to a movie that was kind of an unexpected success, and it uses that to essentially make the same film again. But that's the joke. The plot is essentially the same as the first one. A lot of the same things occur, but just slightly different. It does work, but I think the only problem is that the first movie does it better. This one works, but I just felt like I enjoyed the first movie better overall, but perhaps that's a matter of opinion.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry here. Both are very funny and the film is quite aware of their chemistry. There's a gag throughout the whole film that is essentially that it treats their relationship as police officers and partners as a real relationship. There's scenes that you would see in a romance film but are played for laughs because they are between Tatum and Hill. These work well because of the chemistry and it's quite funny. As mentioned before, the movie is quite self aware about how it's just a rehash of the first movie, and they make it work. Also an end credits sequence essentially seals the deal with this whole running joke.If I had to give a complaint, it would be that perhaps the very middle part of the film was a little lacking in jokes. Not the entire middle of the movie, but some of it. It opens strong and ends pretty strong, but that middle area just kinda goes along without a whole lot. There's jokes here and there but they are gut bustlingly funny as the rest of the movie. But I would say that specific middle area of the film is only like 15% of the movie, so if that's the amount of the movie that isn't that funny, it's doing pretty good.Overall, I would recommend going to see this if you want some laughs. There's a lot of self aware humour and it made me laugh quite a bit. Though it wasn't quite as good as some critics have been saying. I heard really high praise about this movie and some super high scores, which I don't 100% agree with. It's good, but not completely amazing. It has its flaws. I will say it's super funny and if you want a good comedy movie, you should watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
More fun and games with our crime fighting duo,"You know what you are going to get before you enter the cinema for this film, yet let's be honest its still far better than any in its genre.Our intrepid duo are once again fighting crime in the only way they know how, and as much a it's much I the same you still love it. It's they chemistry between the two that makes this and they satirise that to the hilt.Lot of bawdy humour and childish humour, but it's thankfully no silly costume party. Ice Cube is fun as the chief, and manages to steal the show a few times. A good laugh.If you enjoyed the first then you'll love this too. Unashamedly more of the same, and done just as well.

Starts out okay...,"I had been warned about this film. It did start out okay with self-reflecting jokes about it being the same as the first time and stuff and them looking like narcs in college. But then they go off into these awkward scenes that go on way too long like most American comedies seem to do these days (the Heat etc.). Same can be said about the film itself: Do we really need it to be 112 mins? It could have been easily cut down to 85 or 90 mins. I never liked Jonah Hill but after 'The Wolf of Wall street' he was scoring points. Points he lost completely after this flick! I'm back to hating him again. Tatum plays the dumb guy, but they lay it on way too thick (Cate Blanchet / Carte Blanche joke? Give me a break). A shorter film with a better script and better written comedy would have been a lot more enjoyable. I did laugh at the 'Mercedes' character who keeps insulting Jonah Hill on him looking old. Judging by the credits I would think they didn't plan a sequel but I quickly checked on IMDb and there it is: 23 jump street. Get ready for tons more lame and awkward comedy, ye be warned ;)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I actually liked it,"They are back with a sequel and contrary to every law in cinema there is... The sequel was actually funny! I have seen many movie franchises destroyed by rushed god awful sequels that left you wondering: ""why didn't they stop while they were ahead?"" But this movie is something different. Most of the bad reviews it received were due to people riding their high horses picturing comedy antics of gods themselves and comparing it to this movie. People need to face the facts. Comedy is hard, and you cant be closed minded if you go to watch a comedy. But if you can let yourself enjoy the moment and not try to be sarcastic all the time this movie is for you. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have great chemistry together. The contrast in their looks and personalities provides a good base for the movie and the plot can easily branch out from it.Now there is one problem id like to point out... It might be awkward to watch it in the cinema. The humor of it is specific and the tens jam packed cinema setting is a place where comedy goes to die. So my recommendation is to watch it at home with some friends and a beer/chips combination. Because a relaxed atmosphere is where this type of movie can thrive.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"As naughty as ""21 Jump Street""","Never change the winning formula perhaps the best choice to continue this sequel. ""22 Jump Street"" is pretty much the same movie as it's predecessor. The storyline itself has some similarity from previous installment, if in ""21 Jump Street"" two police officer, Jenko and Schmidt undercover at high school to find drug dealer, while this time they go undercover as college student. Fortunately repetition doesn't always mean bad thing, the film seems taking positive side from ""21 Jump Street"" and gets more upgrade in action sequences, the relationship between Jenko and Schmidt as partner and especially some smart jokes. Couple of jokes are really that funny with added bizarre moment which audiences could never predicted.There are two dynamic duo whose role can't be separated from ""22 Jump Street"". The rising director, Phil Lord-Christopher Miller who was known as the creator of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatball"", ""The Lego Movie"" and of course ""21 Jump Street"" seems comfortable to exploit some material from the first installment they've built also the way they inserted additional scene at end credit is brilliant, while Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill's chemistry keep audiences entertained at the entire scenes in it. Overall ""22 Jump Street"" is a film that despite following the formula from it's predecessor, feels even more fresh and solid. It levels the standard of ""21 Jumps Street"" and watching it, could be a cure to wipe out some stressful feelings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funniest film I've seen in a long time,"It's actually been a long time where I've watched a film and could hardly pause for a breath, especially on my own. The continuity from 21 Jump Street is great, there are a few boring scenes, and some scenes where the humor is terrible, but they are the scenes I saw in the trailer. I've never watched a whole credits roll before, if there's any hidden extras I'll usually watch it on YouTube after. But, the credits were absolutely hilarious, and I lost it completely when I saw Seth Rogen's cameo! I don't think 23 Jump Street will be a thing, but I'd love nothing more than for Channing Tatum to work with Jonah and Seth again, but a bit more than just a cameo like in This Is the End",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great chemistry between duet in entertaining comic script,"I liked it so much that I looked for 21 Jump Street when I finished seeing this.The poster looks like a stupid comedy but I like Jonah Hill after Moneyball and The Wolf of Wall Street. And Channing Tatum looks so cute in Magic Mike that so I went to see this.Well, all I can say is it exceeds my expectation of a Hollywood comedy. After watching three movies featuring Jonah Hill, I can confirm that he is an excellent actor. His acting can probably carry him to a level more than just comedy. In 22 Jump Street, Hill is unbelievable in playing the role of Schmidt, an insecure, jealous, hardworking and loyal teammate. His body movement and voice impersonation is impressive. Even his blinks and murmurs are effective.The story can be calculative, crafted and is tailored-made for Tatum, who plays a curious cop Jenko, factoring in his model physique, Kungfu skills and football expertise. But boy is he hot and surely he makes me wow. Simply dazzling. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is quite strong and they really sparkle when they are together – even though Tatum needs more work on his acting.What distinguishes it from other American comedies is the interesting script which has many layers in addition to the undercover cop duo going to college. There are lots of twists to the script, in addition to the action scenes and comical moments, making the watching experience enjoyable throughout. Even the end credits are interesting to watch. Never a dull moment in this fast-paced action-packed crime comedy touching on homosexuality and brotherhood. Quite a relaxing movie to watch.While I look forward to 23 Jump Street, I am kind of hoping they will change the selling points a little and move away from football and half naked Tatum, etc.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Rise of Vietnamese Jesus,"With a premise surrounding the reoccurring, self-aware joke, ""do the same thing as last time and people will be happy"", ""22 Jump Street"" takes the attractive yet dumb cop (Channing Tatum) and comically weird looking but smart cop (Jonah Hill) and moves them from 21 Jump St. across the street to 22 Jump St.; a new building which is acknowledged (in a very tongue-in-cheek manner) as having a much more expensive look for absolutely no reason. This time their assignment takes them undercover, masquerading as college students, in order to discover the distributor of a new synthetic drug. Basically and purposefully the same premise as the last movie (only this time in college). Sounds hilarious, right?With expectations high, partly because of the creative minds behind it (directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) partly because of the early critical response (some calling it, ""The funniest sequel ever"") and partly because 2012's ""21 Jump Street"" was a box-office success, I admittedly went into my screening ready to laugh. And though the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum still worked, the satirical nature throughout was still pretty smart and well written (as the film pokes fun at big-budget Hollywood sequels, the college experience and split screens) and Ice Cube is given more to do (which is always good) there are a few glaring problems which caused this comedy to be far more flawed than it should have been: 1. Most of the funny parts are in trailers. Even though this is the fault of the marketing team and not the film itself, nobody enjoys paying exorbitant ticket prices to sit through a movie containing jokes they could see for free on TV.2. It's not as funny as ""21 Jump Street"". In the case of movies that are either sequels or hold strong resemblances to other (usually more infamous) films, I try my hardest not to let comparisons influence my final rating. It is my intent to review each film on its own individual merits. But here's the thing: In the case of ""22 Jump Street"", the filmmakers have purposefully designed the jokes in such a way as to almost demand that audiences compare this movie to its predecessor as often as possible. It is in this rare case that my rating must reflect as such. Therefore, ""22 Jump Street"", while funny at times, wasn't nearly funny enough to meet (let alone, exceed) expectations set by ""21 Jump Street"".Side Note: And I didn't even mention the unfortunate Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan jokes, which instantly silenced a crowd that was intent on laughing over every other punch-line.Final Thought: Yes, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie, Cloudy with a Change of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street) deserve the title as two of the hottest comedy directors working, but this is a bit of a misstep in their assent to the top of the genre, simple because it isn't as funny or clever as what we've come to expect from the duo. Luckily, Jonah Hill does save the day more than a few times, as his performance may be the only true standout of this entire film (which is hardly a surprise). He seemed to lead by example, taking firm control of nearly every funny bit with his unique style of physical, self-deprecating and quick witted comedy. Plus, unlike Kevin Hart, Hill can play the same comedic character over and over again and it has yet to become played out or obnoxious. Sothere's that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Self-Awareness and Funny Chemistry Propel This Sequel,"What an awful idea for a movie. Take a subpar 80's teen soap opera, reboot it as a comedy movie, and then give it a SEQUEL?! But with directors Lord and Miller (""Lego Movie"") and writers Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall, 22JS becomes a self-aware meta-comment on the overstuffed sequel. It's not quite as funny or smooth as the outstanding first film, but the trope send ups, engaging mystery, and good-natured humor propel this to its own heights. 22JS picks up right where the first ends, Ice Cube giving the guys their new undercover assignment, infiltrating a new drug ring, this time at college. There are plenty of jabs at this being exactly the same as the first film, which is where the best parts of the humor reside, in the satire of Hollywood money-making. We have send-ups of college comedies, buddy cop comedies, big-budget franchises, and even rom-coms (with plenty of the gay undertones we often see unintentionally in many buddy action movies). Plus, Lord and Miller are in the Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) camp of direction, truly using the tools of cinema to create laughs instead of just making the performers do all the work. The fantastic chemistry of Tatum and Hill is enough to see anything they're in, but when given the kind of subversive, smart, and hilarious material they are here, it's a perfect storm. If you haven't seen the first one, see it. Then rush out to see 22JS. And make sure to stay for what may be the greatest end credits of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
And that's how you recycle a film,"""Do the same thing as last time. Everyone's happy.""After their early success this year with The Lego Movie, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are back in the director's chair for the sequel to their 2012 hit comedy, 21 Jump Street. It is a difficult feat to pull off a comedy sequel considering the fans are expecting the same formula from the original film but at the same time they also want something fresh and unique. There isn't really anything unique about this sequel considering it is basically the same movie as the original with a few exceptions. It continues to bank on the great chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum and that is basically what kept me engaged with this film because most of the jokes were kind of predictable and repetitive. The screenwriters are also having fun with the fact that they know sequels are usually unimaginative and they simply tend to get louder, so they included several self-referential jokes throughout the film. 22 Jump Street is basically a parody of most Hollywood sequels, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that it is better than the original because several of the jokes felt forced and repetitive. I'll give this film credit for the energy and the bromantic chemistry between the leads, but there isn't much more to this sequel. It is better than most comedies that have come out this year, but I don't think it lives up to the freshness of the original film. There are some sharp and witty jokes throughout the film, but there are also many awkward moments where the comedy really doesn't work. 22 Jump Street succeeds because it sticks with the same formula as the original, but I was hoping it would at least feel fresh and inventive. The self-mockery works for a while, but it isn't enough to give it a free pass for it.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are the reason why these comedies have worked so well, and it is hard to find a comedic duo with so much chemistry as these two. The story however is rather weak, and you really don't care much for the plot. The leads are basically the reason why you will have a good time with the comedy, but I wish they could've put a little more effort on the plot. Some of the secondary performances were weak and I really had a problem with Jillian Bell's performance as Mercedes. She brought the film down for me and every time she spoke I felt like the scene was forced on us. Ice Cube has a fantastic scene alongside Jonah Hill which had me rolling on the floor. That scene was hilarious along with the final credit sequences which were also fantastic. I understand why some critics consider this to be funnier than the original, but I still prefer the freshness of 21 Jump Street over this recycled sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Quite possibly the funniest film of the year so far; Lord and Miller's sequel is pure delight.,"""22 Jump Street"" (15) Directed by: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Starring: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare, Ice Cube, Amber Stevens and Nick Offerman.After cracking the case of a lifetime, officers Scmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are back on the streets to investigate a villainous drug smuggler, known only as Ghost (Stormare). The investigation however, proves to be unsuccessful and as their Deputy Chief Hardy (Offerman) puts it ever so bluntly, ""just go back and do the same s**t you did last time. Then everyone's happy"", the pair soon act upon the chief's stern warning, and return to undercover assignments. This time the pair are placed amongst a university, in order to stop a new drug named ""WhyPhy"" (it's pronounced like Wi-Fi), from going viral.It's worth remembering that ""21 Jump Street"" was a film that wasn't expected to perform well in terms of critical and commercial success, however the film exceeded all expectations, proving to become a sure- fire hit, with a relatively small budget of $42 million. Sequels are normally bigger in terms of budget, cast and plot and this is no exception with ""22 Jump Street"", which had a budget of $70 million, proving that with every sequel, the budget increases dramatically, which is also evident in James Bobin's ""Muppets Most Wanted"", released earlier this year.In spite of budget increases, sequels can become however too ambitious for their own good. But thankfully, this isn't the case with ""22 Jump Street"". Instead this is a sequel which continues to deliver quirky and off-beat sensibilities like its predecessor, which is mainly due to the inspired writing of Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman, a trio of screenwriters, who are ambitious in their comedic style. The film's style and script is often reminiscent of ""Scott Pilgrim V.s The World"", (a film which Bacall also helped write, alongside Edgar Wright), which proves the comedic style is one that works extremely well on screen.The direction is also well organised by the duo Lord and Miller, a pair of directors who met in Dartmouth College and proceeded to direct films such as 2009's ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"", ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie, all of which opened to critical acclaim. Having shown their ability for mixing comedy and riotous action, the two use their creative input to once again create a bizarre comedy, which is as zany as the first.If not the funniest script this year, ""22 Jump Street"" is completed in its excellence by the pairing of Hill and Tatum. The two actors, possibly providing the most homo erotic bromance ever seen on screen, undeniably contributing exceptional comic performances, confirming their ability to act in an all manner of roles; Hill was electrifying in ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" and Tatum has reportedly provided a career best performance, in Bennett Miller's ""Foxcatcher"".VerdictQuite possibly the funniest film of the year so far; Lord and Miller's sequel is pure delight, with whip-smart comedy and a bone-achingly funny end credits sequence.

22 Jump Street Review,"You ever watch a sequel to a movie, and the sequel was pretty much the same thing as the original with nothing new to give our money's worth? Well , 22 Jump Street both is and spoofs the idea of that last sentence... and it kills! So we pick up again with Schmidt and Jenko (Hill and Tatum) in the middle of a drug bust. The two blow it, and after being told that maybe they should ""just do what you did last time"" are thrown right back into the same exact situation that they were put into in the original movie 2 years ago. The situation, of course, to go undercover and find who's selling a new drug to the local student body. Only NOW, instead of high school misshaps, we get some college chaos! The thing that I liked most about 22 JS is that it's a fun movie and doesn't take itself seriously, AT ALL! People will say, ""waah but it's the SAME movie!"" and the movie will spit back in your face ""we know stupid"", almost literally in some scenes. Like I said guys, it's more than less the same movie we got back in 2012, so the story gets 0 points for any originality. But the comedy makes this movie feel fresh and always coming at you. That's props to the group of writers behind the script. You get a lot of good gut hurting moments where you're laughing hard, but their are maybe two scenes that had me like ""okay this joke is stale"". The roommate who kept calling Jonah Hill old needed to delete from my sight. Another strong point that makes this a great comedy is the chemistry between the star duo. You just wanna hang out with these two dudes, their both hilarious in their roles. Jonah Hill is funny as always, Channing Tatum is someone I'm getting to like more and more but it's Ice Cube ladies and gentlemen that steals #themothafuckinshow. The dinner buffet scene is GOLD! Or should I say ICE COLD 😉. Again there were a few jokes that got boring after too many blows and the villains in this movie were't as enjoyable as the ones in the first, but this is a really funny comedy action buddy flick.

"Redundant slapstick comedy, unearned laughs, and vacuously written dialogue.","As published by the Morrisons Cove Herald on June 19, 2014.BY RYAN C. SHOWERS""21 Jump Street,"" the satirical reboot of the '80s detective show by the same name, hit theaters in 2012 and gathered a vast profit of $138 million at the Domestic Box Office. Columbia Film Studios have since called upon the original film's key ingredients, Channing Tatum's swooning looks and Jonah Hill's inherently comedic presence, to replicate the success with a sequel. Unfortunately, the newly released film does little beyond the borders of plain stupidity. ""22"" Jump Street"" is the product of redundant slapstick comedy, unearned laughs, and vacuously written dialogue.Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum) return as undercover cops, but instead of chasing culprits around the halls of high school, the partners are transferred to college. Their assignment is to locate the student supplying the drug ""WHYPHY"" to other enrolled scholars. WHYPHY (pronounced like Wifi) is responsible for the death of a student, so Schmidt and Jenko rise to the task of unmasking the drug-selling miscreant. But Jenko becomes the star football player on campus and Schmidt begins a relationship with an attractive art student, so their investigation wilts due to lacking focus. Will their friendship and detective mission surmount Jenko and Schmidt's halted bromance?As part of their introduction to college, Jenko and Schmidt attend a stand-up, impromptu poetry reading. During one student's performance, the main characters stare, unimpressed with the entertainment before them. I could not help but identify with the characters, for this is how I felt while watching ""22 Jump Street."" The fans that this sequel was made for will roar laughing, but film analysts may levitate out of their seats while watching this from feelings of superiority.For a movie that documents the experience of going to college so extensively, ""22 Jump Street"" is not smart enough of a movie to attend any higher education. People investing ten dollars to be entertained will just laugh along with all vapid race humor, homosexual jokes, and feminist mockery, but for those using their brains during the 112 minutes of ""22 Jump Street"" will find the overabundance of offensive dialogue to be insipid.""22 Jump Street"" has no reservations in embracing its self-aware tone and meta jokes. The film is informed of its status in the motion picture hierarchy and quite literally discusses the deigning risks and filmmaking process of constructing a sequel to a comedy reboot. Conversations the studio heads probably had with the creative team behind ""22"" Jump Street"" exist in the screenplay and are acted out on screen – for example: tightening the budget, reinstating the repetitious plot, etc.For all the low-bar tricks they try to pull, the writers generously illustrate the characters in a semi-realistic way. Since ""Moneyball"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" Jonah Hill can now label himself as a ""Two-Time Academy Award Nominee"" and his performance reflects that newfound confidence. Hill is one of the finest, most mature assets of ""22 Jump Street."" On the contrary, Tatum, who has received rave reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival for his serious turn in the unreleased ""Foxcatcher,"" humiliates himself here. He has a blast in his role, but unfortunately does not convince in moments of gushing farce.""22 Jump Street"" makes indelible, evident mistakes, yet most will find it to be imbecilic fun and slimy entertainment. A two-minute sequence of brilliance occurs directly before the credits roll, a scene that cleverly answers the question of possible future sequels. The nifty, comical conclusion earns a few slivers of true respect for the overall product.Rating: 4/10* 1/2 / ****",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very good at what it does,"Well you may think this here is pure Hollywood formulaic comedy onanism that barely holds up a framework to merely work a quick plot, a couple of processed jokes and mix it up in the right convenient format with regards to length/acting/politics etc...And there's certainly a part of that, but this one here is actually well built and worth a watch. The management and resolution of suspense about who the bad guy really is for instance is really good, and it is as everything else in the flick: it doesn't take itself seriously, while still being well crafted.A couple of gags are a bit overcooked, and it isn't laugh out loud funny the whole time, but some moments are well worth the time (""do you like weather ?""), the secondary characters are very good, the action scenes are original and fresh and don't have that feeling of instant boredom as they only start like most action movies over the last decade, it's got very good pace and doesn't feel stretched or stale at any moment. And of course there's a good little moral woven throughout and at the end, and all in all it may beat the first.Good stuff. A deserved 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Damn Funnier Than The First!,"HILARIOUS! 22 Jump Street is one of those rare sequels that improves upon the original.

Awesome Movie...!!!,"This is a cop comedy movie in which two cops, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) assigned to go undercover and bust a drug ring at a high school. The relationship of these two cops is the highlight of the movie and creates several comical and entertaining situations with events constantly testing their relationship.Although the whole movie is entertaining but there are some scenes which I like the most. The scene in which Jenko finds out Maya is Captain's daughter and his friend slept with her is one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Jenko goes hysterical when he figures that and this happens when he's sitting right opposite to the captain. Also the communication between Schmidt and Mayas's roommate during their fist fighting is hilarious. The way of their case solving is what makes this movie awesome.Also there are some emotional scenes in this movie, like when Jenko decides to quit the police force and want to be a football player, then they both realizes that how important they are in each others life.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are great here, and the jokes are very well thought out and it is a movie that is entertaining from start to finish.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Average Sequel,"After watching the first one I had great hopes for the sequel but it wasn't up to my expectations. More action and much less funny than its predecessor. Both actors do a good job again but we feel less alignment. The credits are nice tough, I'd say almost as funny as the movie itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Same Business Mockery,"More than once, the characters keep stating that they're doing the same thing all over again. 22 Jump Street as a movie itself is basically an uninspired clone of the first one, except it's bigger and has higher production, but lazily follows the same storyline and delivers the jokes with an only occasional energy (well, at the first act at least). While it's still funny, it only appears as an entertaining yet forgettable sequel. But there is a punchline and a wise sprinkle of self-awareness behind this. Everything you've first thought about it turns out to be the other way around, therefore it's a smart surprising trick that you will end up smiling.The plot is absolutely no different from the first: the heroes as actual cops messes with a drug business, decides to better off undercover as students to another case, explore around the culture of the generation, friendship gets a loyalty issue, their targets at the first act turns out to be connected with their current mission, goes to a party, finally faced fears, etc. This is not a spoiler, we've already seen this coming. With these same elements coming through, we are immediately assuming ourselves that this won't live up with the quality of its predecessor. It's not only because it's exactly the same, but it also gets a less clever treatment. Example is portraying today's college life doesn't get any much enough clever gags to poke fun of, which is a total contrary to the absurd shift of tolerance in the high school world of the first film. Also their relationship with the students aren't as appealing as the last one, too. The mission however improves with its turns.But eventually, this is definitely in purpose. It satirizes cash-in movie franchises that throws the same knockout repetitively. Hollywood's bribery to people is the budget and celebrities, the end credits sums that up, and the police station's description with the Jump Street program is an obvious allegory of what's going on. While the million dollar compromise is taken as a joke, the comedic value outside the idea never lacks and indeed they are everywhere. But the genuine value that kept things a lot alive is the chemistry between the lead stars, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. The two continue to shine in their buddy comedy figure and it has become the unbreakable core of these movies.The main point of 22 Jump Street is to be a large and mediocre sequel like many others out there, except of course with a strong sense of self-awareness. It's not noticeable if it takes its clichés too seriously, but later then you would start to notice that it is all part of the joke. It's not the most smartest thing you'll ever see in the genre, but it sure is a slick thing to pull off. You will still get some great loud laughs within the story and the growth of the best friend relationship between the main characters remains brilliant as usual. If you think that 22 Jump Street is an inferior redux of the first then you are right, but for some reason you could be also wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Offers plenty of laughs, but ultimately falls victim to the same tropes it pokes fun at.","One of the key things I enjoyed about 21 Jump Street was watching Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill being thrust into situations that allowed them to play completely against type, and much of the film's humor was derived from this idea. The success of the first film ensures that audiences will know what to expect, and 22 Jump Street deftly avoids repeating itself by repeatedly changing gears in an effort to keep the audience guessing.After flubbing a major bust, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) find themselves sent back to the undercover division and tasked with infiltrating a drug ring that led to the death of a prominent local student. Jenko quickly assimilates into the faux college existence, walking onto the football team and rushing the hottest fraternity on campus, while Schmidt struggles to find his footing before making an unexpected ally in art major Maya (Amber Stevens).Some of the best laughs come from the film's self-aware attitude, repeatedly poking fun at sequel tropes before unfortunately falling victim to them. The same ""bromantic comedy"" formula that worked so well in the first film is still effective here, but no longer feels as fresh or as clever. Likewise, Hill and Tatum retain their fantastic comedic chemistry, and they still know how to make us laugh until it hurts, but something about 22 Jump Street never quite falls into place.Much like a Michael Bay sequel, this film is bigger, louder, and more expensive than its predecessor, yet seems to have lost sight of some of the smaller details that made the original so enjoyable. 22 Jump Street is certainly not a bad film - indeed, it's easily the best comedy in theaters right now - but it still doesn't work nearly as well as it should.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Jumped somewhat backwards.""","Sometimes it can become a hassle to trust a sequel and remake when it's promoted to be superior to the original first installment in a series. There's no doubt that this idea was coming soon from afar and avoiding it wouldn't be a doubtful choice to those skeptical if it would succeed or fail. After the surprising success of the first movie, it's come to the attention of all audiences that this sequel truly knows what it is, where it belongs, and why it's not afraid to go beyond all expectations even if it ironically addresses it.But this is where things take a wrongful and distracting turn when it becomes too self-aware and allows itself to be exactly as its original counterpart without straying away too far. To some, this may seem as an intentional gag that can be left excused and acceptable due to the circumstances, but it also shows there's a lack of boldness it had the chance to take advantage of had it fooled us twice as the first time.22 Jump Street did exactly what it wanted and perhaps thought it cleverly jumped the shark - but unfortunately, even if it was brutally honest, it jumped somewhat backwards for not taking its own advice more seriously than portrayed.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sweary bromance comedy,"Hapless cop partners Jenko and Schmidt are sent to college to root out drug suppliers. Shenanigans ensue.I am still not a big fan of Jonah Hill (although I am gradually warming to him as a non-comedic actor), but I am getting to be quite impressed by Channing Tatum. Jump Street 2 confirms that he is very good at comedy. This movie is not going to hold many surprises for anyone who saw the first one. It is quite funny throughout, with a lot of in-jokes, daft dialogue, and movie reference gags sprinkled along the way. It is, of course, quite daft, overflowing with profanity, and it makes the most of the chemistry between Hill and Tatum by turning the bromance between them into one of the plot points. It's not going to win Oscars, but it is an entertaining comedy in the modern tradition.I really liked the closing credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny when it's funny but not as good as the first.,"21 Jump Street was the surprise comedy hit of 2012, even though it was adapted from a show much of its audience hadn't heard of. However, its inevitable sequel 22 Jump Street does not quite recapture the magic. It's still quite solid, there's not much point going too far into the nitpicking, but even on a comedic and storytelling basis it doesn't quite match up to its predecessor. The initial buzz for the film prided itself on its meta self-referencing about the nature of sequels and the film frequently mentions how it's exactly like the first time (it also suffers from a dull late surprise antagonist) and how things are getting expensive. But this wink isn't as well executed as it thinks nor imaginative. Instead, the film is mostly about the bromance of the first film going sour in the obnoxious party background of college. But still, when the film is funny, it's really funny. Jonah Hill is always great and Channing Tatum is getting better but he's not very consistent here. However, coupled with this and the nearly engrossing The Lego Movie, I don't think Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are all they're snuffed up to be. Just yet anyway. Perhaps they should have only had one film on their plate.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"A Little Less Original, A Whole lotta Fun!","Schmidt and Jenko's back and if you thought this is gonna go exactly like that previous reboot, you are oh so right! 21 Jump Street, as I had previously stated, had me in splits, it was one of those movies that genuinely tickled my funny bone. While the 1987 TV show that it was based on was a bit serious and had little humor, the reboot starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made to be screamingly hilarious. Thanks to the directors duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who also bestowed upon us the brilliant Lego Movie this year, 22 Jump Street is on the same page as 21 Jump Street. It is the same 21 Jump Street formula, rinsed and repeated and the directors takes a jab at it every chance they get and that's exactly why it works.After the successful bust of the high school drug circle in 21 Jump Street, Schmidt and Jenko is sent to college this time to investigate another drug case. Its the same thing all over again but it works out well promising truck loads of fun. The directors addresses this as a sequel-sequel to 21 Jump Street and does almost everything that made the original a terrific comedy. Much of the 80s nostalgic moments from the original is missing here instead the role reversal works out again, this time in favor of Jenko. Even the investigation plays out pretty much same with us as the audiences trying to guess and figure out the whodunnit mystery. Familiar faces pop up here and there and we get hooked on thinking they'd be the culprit, without spoiling anything I'd like to add that the movie does the job fairly well. But of course you are not here to watch a perfect thriller, you are here for the same awkward, goofy moments and NSFW fun from the original and you get that served in plenty.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again shines through as the undercover duo and a lot of bromance is to be found here. They still carries on their terrific chemistry from 21 Jump Street and keeps em coming till end. Even Ice Cube gets extended sequences here and a particular scene with him and Hill was particularly uproarious. On the downside though, I'd say Peter Stormare's screen time wasn't up to the mark, the same goes for the female leads which weren't as compelling as 21 Jump Streets'.21 Jump Street was Pure Comic Gold, and 22 Jump Street is no different. While the first cracked me up, 22 Jump Street still managed to crack me up if not as much as the original. The comedy might not be as hard hitting as 21, many of the sequences may not work as much as the original but 22 Jump Street is still hilarious and if you loved 21 Jump Street you'll be right at home with this one. Wait for the credits to roll and I assure you, you wont repent the 5 minutes you've kept your pee in; just make sure you don't laugh too hard.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sequel Mania,"Sequel Mania. The entire film is an inside joke! This is very well done and will keep you stitched with side splitting laughter. The on screen chemistry between Hill and Tatum blends into a smooth picture (pitcher) of tequila margaritas; feels so good going down and then you wonder what happened (in this film) when you wake up in the morning with a 'rufie' hangover. The concept of a ""canned formula"" is taken to extremes, you'll see concerns about filmmaking budget, chase scenes, and special effects {SFX.} A totally new partnership with Tatum and Russell (Zook) takes the jocks into a new Bromance level.

Speaking of fat, ever since ""losing"" all that weight, Jonah Hill appears to be aging faster. He looks forty-five here but they wisely write that into the script.

"Finally, a sequel which is equal","""22 Jump Street"" achieves the highest praise a sequel can get, by being as good a film as the original. It succeeds in a different way: the good-natured action spoofing of the first film becomes the subject of knowing scorn towards sequels in general. It's not essential to watch ""21"" before ""22"", but a huge amount of its metahumour revolves around direct jokes and subtler references to the first film (and the original TV series). The action is in full swing, this time centered around all aspects of college from the manly fraternities to the beatnik art crowd. The (partially improvised) script is still hilarious; Ice Cube's irate police captain plays a bigger role in the proceedings, creating opportunities for many jokes about NWA. Both character development and plot deliberately follow exactly the same arc as before, presumably to poke more fun in the direction of sequels the world over. Technical achievements in this film are not pronounced, although they are uncommon in this genre of film - the music, lighting, editing and cinematography are all standard quality. The charisma of both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, along with their bromance and banter, is the main saving grace of the ""22 Jump Street"".

a solid summer comedy,"A torrid weekend, the best recreation is a cinema getaway in the local multiplex, the options are paltry, having no slightest interest in the fourth TRANSFORMERS juggernaut, I have to choose between two sequels, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 or this one, it is a tough choice, I enjoyed HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010, 8/10) thoroughly, but due to a recent impassivity towards animations, eventually I opt for the latter albeit I have yet watched its predecessor, a Hollywood comedy might be the elixir to quench the summer lethargy.After their debut animation CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (2009), director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller went in for revive the popular 80s undercover policemen series 21 JUMP STREET (1987-1991) on the big screen, and it was a box-office hoot in 2012, two years later, the sequel arrives, the odd pair Hill and Tatum go to college this time!School days are mostly stupid in retrospect, drugs, parties, sports and hormone-driven sex adventures, one must be glad to finally get over with them, thus, understandably the main arc of the story is the à la mode bromance between Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum), conceivably an impending fissure is magnified by Jenko's jock popularity in the fraternity and Schmidt's contrasting nerdy awkwardness. The investigation to unearth the WhyPhy (a new campus- permeating drug) dealer are considerably short-circuited by incessant japes and bro-bonding- or-clashing set pieces which are functionally devised without resorting to the low-end and cringe-worthy lavatorial jokes. A time-tested one is the classic unintentionally sleeping with your boss' daughter and the romance benefit falls upon on Schmidt, he meets the art student Maya (Stevens) and competently justifies ""nerds are the new sexy"", until a raging Ice Cube stereotypically break them up. Meanwhile Jenko has a more conventional male-bonding with fellow football jock Zook (Russell) with an unspecified undertone comes close to a fantasy for more trendy interest, along with many bold gay-related insinuations.It is scintillating to witness a not-over-stagy let-go-and-reunite plot mingles with two partners certainly care for each other where sexuality is irrelevant. The natural bond is authentic, which is the only thing matters. Tatum grandstands in the mandatory action sequences with Hill's rib- tickling unwieldiness, but villains are carelessly characterized, up to the moment when they fall prey to utter triviality and deprive of any sense of being other than their default duty.During the ending-credits, a deluge of mock-sequels pokes fun of industry's franchise over- exploitation, and this year earlier, the Lord-Miller pair has already stunned the world with their money-making bulldozer THE LEGO MOVIE (2014), a new profitable product-line awaits a follow-up, so with two smash golden bowls in their hands, 23 JUMP STREET might come to its fruition behind the usual two-year schedule, or perhaps 22 is also a wonderful number to leave our perky memory unsoiled.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A breath of fresh air in comedy,"About two days ago I was talking to a friend on how most comedies fail these days to deliver anything new to a viewer. They're obvious, the jokes are old and the most reasons to laugh that we get are based on stupidity. Resuming there aren't almost any comedies new in the market that are worth watching. Specially because most of them are romantic comedy which only makes it even more cliché. 21 Jump Street changed this opinion in me and made me believe that there is still hope in this field. Now the 22 version doesn't disappoint!! I love the fact on how they joke with the obvious for people watching. It's like if I watched the movie, pointed out all the clichés and then decided to remake the movie joking about it. It's great because you wouldn't see that coming, like you didn't expect them to joke about the fact that the movie is about the same as 21, so it's like they only had to repeat everything again (like many sequels do..). This is what's mainly refreshing about 22JS. That and the fact that the two main characters play very well together and make a different team from what we are used to.

Thus, the story is ""over the spindle"" and one might get tired - unless your attitude is easy-going.

Can this combination work again?,"I have said time and time again I find it so hard to write a review for comedies, not sure why but it's always something I find difficult to do. Then again you get solid chemistry between the two leads and what's left to write. Only seeing the first film 21 Jump Street not long ago I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it, I actually refused to see it originally because it had turned one of my favourite TV shows of my much younger days into a comedy starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum I can honestly say only the worst things ran through my mind prior to watching it. So if you haven't seen the first film my recommendation would be to see it before seeing this one, a lot of old humour is used in situations like the fact only one year later and they had to move across the road to another abandoned church. There is so much in the film that kept my laugh on, I giggled and believe I even snorted in some scenes but in a film of this caliber would you really want anything less? So this time around now that Jenko and Schmidt have found their true calling once again they are sent to a school this time being a college where they need to discover who is selling the on campus drug whyphy by going undercover and taking up their alter egos a brother combo once again Greg and Morton. Chaos ensues and what turns out to be the easiest crime ever for the duo turns out to be a battle of new friendships and old ones dying out. Throughout the film the laughs just keep coming, perfectly timed humour makes this film work for all the right reasons. Some of the humour was so left of field but it all worked, whether it was stupid fall over and can't get up jokes or poking fun with cameos from another era, it all just worked and really well. I have never been a big Jonah Hill fan but he's up there for me now as well at Tatum not to mention their co-stars that fit like nice slices of pie into the combination.

A new genre Bro-com,"I had seen 22 Jump Street a long time ago, but recently I was in the mood for a good comedy and decided to revisit it.

So, I gave it another go, and wow, what a gem! Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have essentially created a new genre of comedy-a bro-com. It's like a romantic comedy, but instead of romance, it's a bromance taken to hilarious, absurd levels. The relationship between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's characters is at the heart of this, and they nail it with perfect chemistry. I was laughing from start to finish, and I didn't even realize the movie runs almost two hours long because the pacing and humor are so on point.

Proper Sequel Size,"A sequel is only right if it's bigger and better in every way. Comedy sequels are especially difficult to make because they have to be funnier in the first place. And given that the first ""Macho and Nerd"" was also a skillfully prepared action movie and detective story, the tasks before Phil Lord and Chris Miller were large-scale, and they got out of the situation not without proper brilliance.We started by completely copying the script of the first film, changing school to college. By changing everything to suit the relatively new setting, shading old jokes and adding new ones, and rearranging unexpected plot twists, they had a product ready to go. Having persuaded the studio to almost double their budget, they still famously drove through the action scenes and got a homerically funny, masterly staged, brilliantly played and sarcastically smart picture, which instantly erases the impression of all the other non-comedies put on the screen over the past two months.Jonah Hill, who again acted as a screenwriter and producer of the project, burns all the way on the screen, beating both his complexion and the rules of Hollywood sequels, and so many crazy life situations that in the end he storms with laughter. Not far behind is Channing Tatum, again slow and magnificent in this slowness, giving himself entirely to the character and adding his own life experience to it, which is valuable. In the background, she portrays the overly smart and very strange girl Gillian Bell, and Amber Stevens plays her roommate and at the same time the love interest of Hill's hero. At some point, this turbulent mixture in one closed room reaches such a boil that there is nothing to breathe.Pleases with a brief appearance by Dave Franco and a high-speed ride into the Wyatt Russell ensemble, which shows fantastic on-screen chemistry with Tatum.However, the hero Ice Cube attracts the most attention. It's debatable whether he's the most hilarious character in the second film, but it's almost a fact that he elevates every scene he's involved in to an even higher level. Moreover, his role in the sequel is expanded and complicated by many circumstances.These circumstances are almost always terribly funny, but at the same time, Lord and Miller almost never allow themselves to fall below the belt. Except a couple of times. Their humor is varied and hits the audience on several levels at once, so not laughing at all just won't work. They have both irony and sarcasm, and elements of parody and satire. They love the visual jokes created through editing and camerawork as much as the well-crafted, clever dialogue of the characters. Spectators receptive to everything may well have to be carried out of the hall, choking with delight. There is a place there and stupidity, but so well beaten that it is easy to miss it and continue to enjoy the film without any interference.""Macho and Nerd 2 is a comedy that embraces all ages and tastes, but also a witty commentary on the nature of sequels and all sorts of expansions in general.

22 Jump Street,This was unexpected I thought it would of been terrible but actually it was really funny and I got to give credit to Jonah hill for this movie he was funny with Channing Tatum. this movie is a little bit better than the first it had a great story and makes you laugh the whole movie if I were you parents let 13 and up watch this movie because it does got a lot of language but if you saw the first one you would expect to have that much. If you saw the trailer the funniest part of the movie was when Jonah hill was having a fight with a girl. This was well directed written and casted.

Pretty funny,Gotta say that 21 Jump Street was one of the most unexpectedly entertaining movies of the last few years. You always wonder whether unexpected hit comedies are capable of a good follow up. In the case of 22 Jump Street it's good to report that this is the case. The two leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry and are very watchable.This time Shchmidt and Jenko go to college for their undercover operation to track down the murder of a college student which is believed to be drug related. It's pretty funny all the way through with the trip scene being a particular highlight. Very entertaining and looking forward to 23!,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Which luckily I didn't manage to order one. So I saw it in a normal cinema, And it was a wast of money as well. The director did such a lame job with the scripting and the main idea.

Well, here the humor was unevenly scattered throughout but I actually enjoyed it a little more as it went on since I didn't really expect to be blown away this time. I mean, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum seem to be having a good time still and I wasn't in the most discriminating mood this time watching with my movie theatre-working friend.

Doesn't get good until about halfway in...,"22 Jump Street starts off with awkward, try-hard humour. It starts off with ""oh, this is just another 21 Jump Street"" vibe. It leads the viewer to think that this movie is just like the first, and that there will be no surprises.But about halfway through, after you tolerate the bad jokes and the bluntly cut scenes, you start to feel something. Schmidt and Jenko's relationship starts to develop into a full out bromance-bordering-on- gay-married-couple and you start to laugh. The plot develops more, the stunts become better and and everything starts becoming funnier. Maybe the producers put more effort into ending the movie than starting it, but that's how it feels. Whatever it is, by the time the credits roll, you're ready to see 23 Jump Street.In short, this is a funny movie. It will test your patience in the beginning, but it will definitely grow on you.

"Simple, funny and (b)romantic. This is 22 Jump Street","After a job interview interview, I've was quite stressed, I figured that 22 Jump street, a comedy would help relieve some tension. I WAS RIGHT! The movie is about 2 losers that are tremendously effective when put together. When one gets a 100 for its physical test and the other a 100 for some brainy test(I don't know) you'll know what's up.I really liked it. It's simple and straightforward. The jokes where all over the place, the humor was as good as the first movie, maybe even better. Action-wise, first explosion is in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Crime-wise, it's not a film you can take seriously but there is still a solid story in it.So let's talk about the Actors. I think Jonah and Channing, the lead actors are good, but side by side, the synergy, what these guys have is masterful. Jonah plays the awkward brainy sack of potatoes while Channing plays the brainless powerhouse chick-magnet. In all honesty I sometimes did feel Jonah should be 90 percent awkward instead of the 100, He'll always react in the same way, but hey, that's just me. Channing did feel more authentic in its role. He was Funny, cool and cute at sometimes.funniness aside, I also learned something about friendship, that you can't get everything done by yourself and that you should appreciate your friends, that have there own supporting skills ready for you.

A repeat of the reboot.,"22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise. Why does that not matter all that much? Because in this laugh-filled comedy, they actually mock that fact multiple times where they tear down the 4th wall and don't even care. Sure, I felt that they overdid it a bit with this, as well as the exaggerated homosexual innuendos, but the good still far outweighed the bad. Like the last film, the sequences were outrageous but funny and the acting was just dude-bro enough to be spot on for what they were going for. Expanding Ice Cube's role was also a smart idea, as was the casting of the stunning Amber Stevens. It astounds me that she hasn't had more success in her acting career. Overall though, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll like this movie too because 22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise... see what I did there?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
awful to say the least.,"I have never left a review, mainly because of the stupid 10 lines minimum that is required by IMDb. Why can't we say what we want in a few words?? I don,t understand.Here is a movie that's incredible low quality and yet it has a pretty high rating, We can see similar ratings in super good movies, or directors like tarkovski, Hersog, Jim Jarmush or Kurosawa to name a few. So how can it be that a very simple and low quality comedy with a bad script and pretty bad acting get's 7.5 rating? I made the mistake of seeing this movie(not to the end) feeling sure that the 7.5 rating wold guarantee a good comedy. Big mistake. It appears that the only people that rated this movie are people that think this stuff is very good.

"Not as great as the first, but...","The first one was hilarious, but it also benefited from not trying to do as much. This one certainly wants to be bigger, and as a result, it comes off somewhat confused at times. There's also some mediocre moments of comedy. Mostly, though, it works like a charm, and there are some absolutely hilarious moments sprinkled here, many times hitting higher heights than the first. Hill and Tatum are still basically their old selves and it works, even if I enjoyed Tatum in the first more. Ice Cube's act was great in the first, but it gets old really quick here. I wouldn't mind if he was replaced in the third film. Overall, still really good entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Story is Not as Good, But Comedy is There","Sequels sometimes suffer from not being able to live up to the predecessor, in this case, 21 JUMP STREET. Like the title of this review suggests, the story is not as good as the first film, but the comedy is definitely there. This time around, Jonah and Channing go to college to find the supplier of a new drug, WYFY.This film is somewhat of a mirror to the first film, in which Jonah played the popular kid in high school, and Channing was the nerd. This time, Channing is the jock and Jonah is the nerd. They still work under Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), but now at 22 Jump Street (across the street!).One of the funnier moments include a drive through campus in a golf cart style vehicle, chasing/being chased by the drug dealers; recklessly destroying anything and everything, much to the chagrin of Capt.

Constantly hilarious.,"The rebooted 21 Jump Street was an unforeseen smash hit in 2012, cleaning up at the box office as well as garnering universal critical acclaim. Its success was helped considerably by the fact that no one gave it much chance of actually being any good. This sequel on the other hand, has high expectations, and it surprisingly lives up to them. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are back as undercover agents Schmidt and Jenko – this time attempting to infiltrate a college drug ring – and they have lost none of the odd couple bromantic chemistry that has become the lynchpin of this series. Speaking of bromance, directing duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller return to call the shots, adding a zippiness and stylistic flair to the proceedings and further proving – after the original, Cloudy 1 and The Lego Movie – that they are the masters of fun. All 112 minutes of the runtime are packed with jokes: some fall flat, like the drug- tripping sequence, but most hit the mark. The self-referential humour (""We're throwing double the money at this follow-up, as if it's actually going to make it twice as good"") is utterly hilarious, especially as it comes in the most part from Nick 'Ron Swanson' Offerman, and a running gag revolving around a revelation about Captain Dickson's (Ice Cube) daughter, culminating in Tatum's hysterical office crack-up, is fantastic. Even the end credits are a hoot, previewing upcoming franchise outings such as 29 Jump Street: Nurse School and 37 Jump Street: Culinary School, and featuring a string of winking cameos no less. A riotous, tongue- in-cheek comedy that offers nearly two hours of constant amusement and a bunch of belly laughs, all but cementing a third undercover operation in the process.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Above Average: 6.0,"Comedy sequels are unusual beasts: on one hand, they have to be about as funny as their predecessors, enough to justify their existence. But on the other, if the humor strays too far from the original, it gets harder to call it a sequel. Such is the dilemma faced by 22 Jump Street. Seeing its huge box office haul, it's probable that those who wished to see it have done so already. However, for those who haven't, you'll get almost as much enjoyment from watching the first one again. Yes, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are still a great class act, and there are plenty of great comedic moments. But too many of those moments are recycled, and starting to get a bit stale. In this regard, the film is funnier than it perhaps should be, but this is barely enough to keep it afloat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Do the same thing as last time. Everyone's happy""","I don't why this film works but it does. It takes the almost exact premise from the first movie but it also keeps the self-awareness and the same creative duo of directors who are nowadays the biggest stars in comedy business. To me 21 jump street is a modern classic and so I was afraid that the sequel won't be as funny and will be repetitive. But with Phil Lord an Chris Miller on board you can bet that it will be hilarious. They are trying to convince the whole film that this is exactly the same as the first and that you should not expect any surprises but that is their plan all along. The film is filled with surprises and twists and turns. Its range of pop culture references goes from Annie Hall to Benny Hill and some of the jokes are so fast you might miss them at the first viewing. Since the first one was making fun of the Hollywood trend to remake and reboot old films and TV shows, the sequel makes of the necessity of starting a franchise when a film is successful. The end credits make fun of the studio system of franchising anything and they are possibly the best end credits of all time and surely are the funniest. Contrary to all this they are the great ending to the franchise.The bromance between Hill and Tatum is even more prominent than in the first film and you can see that these guys are big friends in real life and are having a good time. Ice Cube get much more screen time as Captain Dickson and once again he is part of the film's funniest scenes. Wyatt Russell as Jenko's doofus friend is amazing and I am looking forward to seeing this guy once again.Phil Lord and Chris Miller stated that their biggest influence was Bad Boys II and that's exactly what this film is. The Bad Boys II of comedy. Bigger budget, bigger action and mu cm more self aware than the first film. But I'm afraid that they milked the idea to the fullest and that the creators know it. 22 Jump Street is'n as fresh as the first one but it is as much innovative and fun as the first.

I found it to be more silly than funny! 4/10,"Review: I know that I'm going to be the only person in the world saying this, but I really didn't find this movie that funny. The jokes were really weak, along with the storyline which wasn't that great either. I liked the chemistry between the two characters but I found it silly and a bit over the top. Basically, these two misfits have to find out who is selling this new drug called WhyPhy, in a college. Tatum's character becomes best friends with a fellow college student who he plays football with, which jeopardises his relationship with Jonah's character. It isn't the greatest storyline and I did lose interest after a while, but the acting from these two accomplished actors keeps the movie going. Personally, I was quite disappointed after all of the hype surrounding the film.Round-Up: I really wasn't that impressed with Channing Tatum's acting when he first came on the scene, but he really has become an household name, especially after starring in Magic Mike and G.I. Joe. I particularly didn't like his dancing movies but now that he has starred in comedy and action roles, he has really become an versatile actor who doesn't take himself as seriously as he did in his earlier years. I've always been a fan of Jonah Hill's work and he really did impress me in the Wolf Of Wall Street. Personally I think that he done a better job than DiCaprio especially knowing that those ridiculous teeth were his idea. Anyway, this film has really gone down well with audiences worldwide but it just wasn't my cup of tea.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $331millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there silly comedies about a couple of officers who enrol into a college to find out who is selling drugs to the students. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Schmidt: ""My partner, he wanna see the product."" Scarface: ""Why ain't he talking?"" Jenko: ""...my name is Jeff!""","22 Jump Street (2014) continues on from its prequel and follows the antics of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as they are sent on a mission to a university (again) to investigate the use of a new recreational drug known as 'WHYPHY' and deduce its distributor.Wasn't the film I had planned for tonight but did it disappoint? Yes and no.Let's start off with the no. All in all, I did like this movie and I did enjoy it. It was a fun ride and just pure vibes. Gotta give a shoutout to Ice Cube for his performance in this, he was hilarious in the somewhat little screentime that he had, he almost stole the show in my opinion. Hill and Tatum were just as satisfactory as you'd expect them to be, they weren't *amazing* but that doesn't mean they were at all shoddy in their acting, they got the job done at the end of the day. Also, in terms of the story, I actually didn't expect *that* particular person to be the 'WHYPHY' distributor so fair play to the writers for that one.Now onto the yes. My biggest problem with this picture, and this might've been obvious to predict (just like the film was), was that it was so cliché. *So* cliché. The movie was very banal and had a lack of distinctiveness compared to other similar comedies. Actually, I say comedy, but whilst I did find this feature funny at the beginning, I barely laughed towards the middle and end, so you'd expect a ""comedy"" to be a little funnier than this. And a final point I'd like to add is on a particular cast member: Peter Stormare, whose performance I really did not like. But then again, I don't blame that totally on him. I mainly blame it on the script, as his lines contained an extreme level of swearing and adult humour which was just entirely abnormal for a middle-aged man, even for a comedy. As a result, his lines felt very forced and unnatural.So that's all I've got to say on that. I might've been a bit harsh with this review, as I did enjoy this more than it appears. I can't compare it to 21 Jump Street (2012) because it's been so long since I watched it that I can't remember enough detail from it, but based on what I do remember, the prequel might be a tad better. But yeah, if you're looking for a ""fun ride"" as I've described it myself, then be sure to check out the Jump Street duology if you haven't already.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

That angle is done to death.Otherwise it's the same. These two guys go to college and solve some drug mystery there.

'22' is infinite notches better than '21'. A sequel that's not just a rehash of the original.,"22 Jump Street, continues with the story of police officers, Schmidt(Jonah Hill) & Jenko(Channing Tatum). After the events of the first film, and a major screw-up by the two buddy cops, Deputy Chief Hardy(Nick Offerman), sends Schmidt & Jenko back to the Jump Street division. They've now moved across the street. Hence, the name. Here, Captain Dickson(Ice Cube) orders the two partners to infiltrate a local college drug ring. This synthetic drug is even more lethal & addictive than the previous drug. The drug is called WhyPhy. Now, it is up to Schmidt & Jenko to infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier & stop the manufacturing of WhyPhy.22 Jump Street is hysterical! There are a number of scenes in the movie that will leave the viewer in splits. Although it's an adult comedy, the jokes are not entirely crude & sexual, which is refreshing. There are many sequences that pay tribute to 21 Jump Street(2012). However, it's not a carbon copy of the 2012 smash hit. The action sequences have been choreographed beautifully & look extremely believable. The highlight of the movie, is the bromance between Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum. Hill & Tatum share a natural chemistry that oozes all over the screen. The fact that they're friends in real life also helps, I guess. I would like to tip my hat to directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller. The directing duo can effortlessly switch from an animated movie about figurines & blocks to an action comedy. Hats off to Lord & Miller for pulling that off. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Schmidt. Hill's character oozes confidence and seems to be in control of what's happening, this time around. Channing Tatum is outstanding as Jenko. Tatum's character has matured, and this aspect has been portrayed by Tatum, effortlessly. Peter Stormare is good as The Ghost. Wyatt Russell is impressive as Zook. Amber Stevens is awesome as Maya. Jillian Bell is effective as Mercedes. Nick Offerman is sarcastically funny as Deputy Chief Hardy. Ice Cube is hysterical & unforgettable as Captain Dickson. Stick around for the opening credits to watch Hollywood being ripped apart in a comical fashion. Preferably watch '21' before you go to see this movie. 22 Jump Street is a must watch. Watch it with that one best friend who'll never let you down, no matter what.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"When it sticks with it's heroes, it's consistently laugh-out-loud funny","""I want you to do exactly what you did last time!"" bawls Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). No-one really expected 21 Jump Street (2012), a re-boot of a long-dead TV show, to be a hit. But it was, and a hit spells sequel in Hollywood. And so returning directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, fresh off the colossal success of The Lego Movie (2014), use 22 Jump Street as a canvas to riff-on the idea of sequels. Actually, to label it as a canvas is not doing it justice - Lord and Miller, two of the wackiest and most inventive directors of our time, stretch it out, beat it with a hammer, and make a strange yet lovable mess out of it.Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) do exactly what their captain says and head to college, going undercover to bust yet another drug ring. The film embraces repetition wholeheartedly, all the with a winning wink to camera, so we have a Vietnamese Jesus (as opposed to Korean), a suspicious teacher, explosive action-movie car chases, homoerotic bonding, an accidental drug intake, and plenty of scantily-clad ladies. It's a formula that has worked once already - the first film was a hoot and Tatum truly excelled - so the director's laugh at their own willingness to bend to demand and their audience's willingness to lap it up, but never in an offensive way. Lord and Miller make sure you're in on the joke.But simply acknowledging the cliché doesn't necessarily mean that it makes for entirely satisfying viewing. The jokes are clever, yes, but it still means that we have to sit through a very similar film as we did the first. This is where Lord and Miller's energy really becomes important, as the visual pizazz and the sheer momentum of the one-liners and zippy editing prove an easy distraction from what could have ultimately been a one-joke movie. In one inspired scene, Schmidt and Jenko trip on Why-Phy (the new drug), with Schmidt having a bummer and Jenko euphoric. They share a split screen, each in their own weird little world, as Schmidt tries to break the barrier into Jenko's more colourful trip. It's a crazy scene, especially for a widespread release, but delivered with such commitment that it proves a ballsy move.It's a shame that the action scenes get in the way, offering plenty of gunshots and explosions but never really rise above the kind of thing we've been given before in the old action movies it's lampooning. Other aspects also don't quite work - Schmidt's relationship with the gorgeous Maya (Amber Stevens) just feels unrealistic, Queen Latifah's appearance as Dickson's wife spawns a few jokes that simply don't work, and the whole thing feels over- long. But when it sticks with it's heroes, the film is consistently laugh-out-loud funny, and Tatum again delivers a performance that will leave many scratching their heads in disbelief at the idea that this is indeed the same person as the pouting, dead-eyed t**t from Step Up (2006).www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Best/Worst Nightmare,"Greetings again from the darkness. In this day of 3 minute trailers that give away the best gags, if one can walk out of a comedy having laughed a few times, it must be deemed a success. Such is the case with this sequel to 21 Jump Street (2012), which was borne from the 1980's TV show of the same name.A couple of years ago, officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) went undercover at a high school to bring down drug dealers. This time, they head to a local college for the same purpose. If that sounds like a re-tread, at least the film acknowledges such. In a scene with Nick Offerman, a few minutes of self-parody are devoted to the mis-givings of re-do's ... even with double the budget! Co-directors (back from the first) make this film the butt of its own joke, and for the most part, that approach works.The best buddy comedies work because of two things: the script and the rapport of the leads. The pairing of Jonah and Tatum works very well, even when we get the predictable split into liberal arts and sports (take a stab which actor gets which assignment). There are a couple of actresses who play vital supporting roles - Amber Stevens as Schmidt's love interest, and Jillian Bell in an offbeat and quite funny take as the nemesis. Oddly enough, Jenko's relationship is a bro-mance on the football team with the QB played by Wyatt Russell (Kurt and Goldie's son). One of the poor decisions was to quadruple the screen time for Ice Cube ... his antics are funny in limited doses. Very limited.There are some terrific ""old man"" jokes, as well as references to Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan ... both who have been in the news for less-than-uplifting reasons lately. Most will find the best sequence to be after the movie ends and before the credits begin.

Funny and entertaining!,"Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are back as there dynamic duo continues. This movie will make you laugh and is a very interesting sequel. Also, this movie has the best credits to a movie ever. I found myself laughing really hard. It begs the question though...Is it better than the first film?In my opinion, no. It isn't better, but at the same time it isn't worse. All in all, if you liked 21 Jump Street this movie won't disappoint.I think any teenager should be able to see this movie.

"22 Jump Street is not as good as its predecessor, but it's ever so close!","This was SO much fun to watch. Screw writing a review, the soundtrack just makes me want to throw a party right now. Seriously downloading that shizz immediately. In this sequel our abysmal police officers are sent to 22 Jump Street (a much better title than 21 Jump Street 2) to go undercover in a college to bust...you guessed it, another drug dealer. This drug is called ""why-phy"" and makes you ultra focussed before sending your mind down one heck of a trippy trip. That scene alone, was just a beauty to behold. Channing Tatum dancing in a rainbow land, adjacent to Jonah Hill listening to hellish rock music. Majestic. That obviously conveys the contrast between them and they do go down a rather formulaic personality clash only for them to regroup to try and save the day! That's my biggest problem with the film, it's far too formulaic and is pretty much a rehash of its predecessor. I get it, don't fix what is not broken but with a bigger budget this was more unfocused. In fact I don't think anyone cared for the actual plot this time. What this did do though, was pull a damn good twist in the middle which I did NOT see coming. One of those moments where I shouted ""Oh. My. God. Nooo no no noooo!"". If you've seen the film, you know what I mean (hint: involves parents visiting the college). The script was self-referential and clearly used this awareness to poke fun out of itself, which was a smart move. The end credits showed that hilariously. Best end credits scene I've seen in a looooong time. Jonah Hill was occasionally good but again, I just don't like him. Channing Tatum was not as consistent with his line delivery, some of them fell flat. The action scenes were well filmed and had some flamboyancy to them which made the experience all the more enjoyable. That's exactly what this is, a damn good enjoyable flick with some hysterical scenes...and a kickass soundtrack which I'm downloading right now. No joke, turning my laptop on now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great comedy for all,"I've always been a pretty huge prick about comedies because I find the current comedies out there are dirty, disgusting, or just stupid. I chose to watch this movie with my boyfriend because we didn't have anything to do one night. After having seen this movie, it was probably one of the best random things we've ever done. Not only was this movie laugh out loud hilarious but it was neither disgusting, dirty or stupid. The movie was hilarious from start to finish. Although there were some parts I thought that were stupid, it was actually quite clever in retrospect. This movie is definitely made for its audience - teenagers and college students. It's not only for guys either. Your girlfriends are sure to have a good laugh during this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

8.5/10,"21 Jump Street is Right up there as one on my three or four favuorite comedies of all time, it had a perfect mix of humor, emotion and themes close to me and ever since I saw it for the first time I have come to love it more and more. Naturally when they announced a sequel with all the creative talent behind and in front of the camera returning I was beyond excited. Did they deliver again? Yes they really did. I am not yet ready to talk about this movie in comparison with its predecessor because I will have to see it a couple more times for that (yet it is so good I already want to go back to the theater and watch it again right now). I will get the one main negative out of the way immediately: it does not have the best cohesive story you could expect; its predecessor was so good because amongst all the ridiculousness and fun there was a very solid, thought-out story up-holding it. Here there is not a very solid story, I mean it is perfectly passable, but it felt kind of rushed in certain parts and it took away from the overall experience. One other very little negative was the green screen at the end: very, very bad, really unacceptable. Now as to the positive the list never ends. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are comedy gold, other than being extremely in control of their direction they add so many brilliant easter eggs and references for fans I'm sure I didn't catch all of them at first viewing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are amazing in this one too, not yet sure if they're better or not from their previous performance. Obviously the highlight from the supporting cast is Ice Cube who is for sure funnier in this one. Now as to the movie itself I cannot speak highly enough of its witty brilliance: it mixes pop culture references, to hilarious self humor, adds even funnier dialogues and physical comedy, has top-notch-entertainment action scenes juxtaposed to college life scenes, even the music choices are perfect and ultimately it is so self aware it manages to feed the fans every single thing they wanted without being repetitive or too pretentious. This sequel is practically everything I wanted it to be and more and I really can't wait to see it again and again and open up with myself the debate on whether 21 or 22 is better. A quick shout out too to the credits: probably the funniest part of the movie with one of the most brilliant cameos I have ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An overall improvement,"'22 Jump Street' is an overall improvement on '21 Jump Street'. However, it kinda levelled out by the end.Its predecessor started slowly but got better as it finished, whereas 22JS does the opposite.

This one has an excellent initial closing credits, one of the funniest I've seen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Trash  with some good elements,Adolescent and puerile. Nothing wrong with that if you are a puerile adolescent. I am not. I am older. But surely a good comedy should appeal to all age groups. This one is dependent on the audience being puerile. Jonah Hill is a very good actor. He should find grown up parts in grown up movies. There were good elements though like the throw away lines of the girl engaged in a gun fight and the young adult-speak in humorous situations. But really? This seemed to entertain those around me in the audience more than I thought was warranted; so there you go it must be me not everybody else. I notice it got a lot of rave reviews on this site so don't let my menopausal negativity get to you. Take no notice of me because you might like it. I am probably wrong and the other reviewers who thought it was good perhaps were right. If you are over 40 don't bother. If you are over 50 definitely don't bother. If you are still older just accept that it is a young person's world and read some Shakespeare. Still I think Jonah Hill is an excellent actor. I would go to see him in anything.,3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good fun,"Less inspired than the first 21 Jump Street for a good chunk of the movie; 22 Jump Street is a a tad bit too long for what it is. This movie begins to shine in the third tier and the final couple of scenes where the action picks up, the jokes are more fun. There it catches again the funny irreverent cliché tone of the first movie and becomes truly enjoyable. The high school setting was better exploited than the college setting of this movie; which is why it's slower to start. Also, while fully assumed by the movie, the repetition from the first movie reinforce the slow start. Overall still OK and a perfect movie to lazy out in front of.

Better than first but still lame!!!!,"2 Jump Street is a 2014 American action comedy film[4] directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, produced by and starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, and written by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman. It is the sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street, based on the television series of the same name.After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) when they go deep undercover at a local college. But when Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team, and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene, they begin to question their partnership. Now they don't have to just crack the case - they have to figure out if they can have a mature relationship.

On par(if not better) than the original; Would Recommend,"Directed by Phil Lord and Chril MillerStarring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube​ Plot Overview: Soon after they stopped the craze of HFS, Schmidt(Jonah Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) go back under cover in College to stop a new drug from killing people.General:Overall: This movie is, first and foremost, hilarious. My main flaw with its predecessor is that the comedy got stale after multiple watches. That is different here. I've watched this movie more than '21 Jump Street' and still laugh continuously throughout. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is great, even if it follows a similar plot thread to the original. The story is, yet again, very similar to the original but the movie embraces that and uses the fact its a sequel as a gag. I appreciate that but it doesn't excuse the fact its still a copy and paste with some uses of 'Find and Replace' for certain characters. Despite this, it's still just as enjoyable(I personally think more) as '21 Jump Street' and fans will most likely still enjoy it.The type of people who will like it will be fans of the more aware comedy and definitely fans of '21 Jump Street'.Would Recommend.Detailed:Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum were good as Schmitd and Jenko respectively and the chemistry they shared didn't feel forced and felt natural. Ice Cube was great as Captain Dickson and gave on of the funniest scenes in the entire film. Peter Stromrae was fine as The Ghost but he was still just a typical mob boss and didn't impress me much. Both Amber Stevens and Jilian Bell were great as Maya and Mercedes respectively, with Mercedes being one of the funnier characters in the film. Wyatt Russel was pretty weak as Zook and, along with Maya, was not a very compelling nor even that humorous character.I adore the entire premise of these movies but I do admit they've exhausted all possible ideas and to continue this franchise but be insulting the previous two films. Again, it was a full rehash of the original which was annoying but it still hits similar notes and retains the charm the original had on its initial watch but continues this throughout.The cinematography was decent for the most part but the editing could be quite choppy at point and it feels like some entire portions of scenes were just cut out.The effects were awful and the green screen was terrible. The actual costume and set design was actually pretty good and distinguished itself from the original.This movie is first and foremost a comedy and in that respect it succeeds. There is also some interesting action, even if it comes of as cheesy and can be a little stupid.The end credits are brilliant and the satire provided with them is absolutely genius and hilarious. The music was fine.Personally, I really enjoy this movie and feel like its more enjoyable than the original.8/10Would Recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Slight, light and bright - a fast paced and instantly forgettable comedy","21 Jump Street was a real surprise hit upon release in 2012, for surely a film spoofing a cult 1980's TV show and starring the seemingly mismatched parring of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was doomed and destined for the mediocre bin and middling box office takings. 21 Jump Street however defied many of the expectations lashed upon it and became not only a hit with critics, but audiences and evidently box office kitty. What made 21 Jump Street such a breakout hit it is fair to say was the low expectation heaped upon it but now with 2 years in the making and a continual rise in popularity for both Hill and Tatum expectations are a lot higher for this particular comedy venture so is it worth the hype? Judging by its box office takings so far you'd be led to believe it's a resounding yes.22 Jump Street is that odd type of film, a film that remains highly enjoyable without ever once threatening to break out into anything highly memorable. Like a stick of fairy floss, the film is sweet while it lasts but once it's finished you'd be hard pressed to remember what was so enjoyable about it in the first place. A major plus for directors Lord and Miller (who have at present an unprecedented hit ratio with their films) is of course the pairing of Hill and Tatum who found such golden chemistry together in the first film and that continues on here. Hill as Schmidt and Tatum as Jenko just feels so right and anytime the two actors are together on screen the film transcends whatever goofy or immature gag it's setting up, but once the two are separated the films quite obvious flaws are made far too evident.While the first film in the series is anything but high class or quality storytelling (and really doesn't need to be) the sequel seems to bask in its own ability to re-tread similar plot points (actually referenced numerous times throughout the film as though it's funny to re-hash) to the first and produce a story that barely allows any character growth and eventually repeats many jokes that worked well in the first due to a feeling of originality which is here blanketed by audience expectation. Lord and Miller certainly keep the pace at a high level but there is no getting over the fact that bar some nice moments from Ice Cube as angry Captain Dickson the films supports and again leads on their own are quite lacklustre. Newcomers to the series including renowned character actor Peter Stormare and Kurt Russell's very own Wyatt Russell remain all sadly forgettable in a bare bones story.With added weight of expectation and with two lead actors who now know their respective characters back to front, 22 Jump Street should've and could've been a whole lot better. The film still has its fair share of charms thanks to the lead duos intact chemistry and Lord and Miller as always show flair when it comes to their direction and there revelling in keeping things stupid can be commended but the film can't hide the fact that what it produces is light, slight and bright entertainment that we'd be hard pressed to care about a couple of weeks from now. A third entry into the series may be pushing this ventures welcome to far.3 inappropriately hidden hand grenades out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Self-awareness only takes this sequel so far,"Very early on in ""22 Jump Street"", the guys are basically told to do the same thing as the last time since that's their best chance for success. While it's nice to see the screenwriters basically admitting that they're following the template of the first movie, it still leaves us with a sequel that's more or less trying to recreate the success of its predecessor. On one hand, using the same framework opens the door to variations but, at the same time, it's hard to avoid a sense of 'been there, done that'. Then again, the entire premise of the series is inherently limited, so there's only so much that you can do with it.After going undercover at a high school in the first movie, the duo take the next logical step and go undercover at a college. Once again trying to infiltrate a drug ring, the story obviously feels similar to the first movie. Where the differences lie is mainly in the interactions between Jenko & Schmidt. This time around, Jenko is the one who fits in better, which ultimately creates friction between the two. In the end, I'm not sure that the story is different enough from the first movie but it should please fans looking for more of the same. Probably the only area where the movie improved upon its predecessor was in the action department.As for the cast, Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill are of course back again and they're just as good together as they were the first time around. Ice Cube & Nick Offerman make welcome return appearances as well. Joining them is the always reliable Peter Stormare as the requisite bad guy along with Jillian Bell, Amber Stevens West & Wyatt Russell. Not a bad group but probably not quite up to the standard of the first movie. There is, however, a nice surprise appearance by Queen Latifah.In terms of production values, the movie can't be faulted. With the original directors returning, the quality didn't dip as is often the case with sequels. In fact, a larger budget enabled them to add more spectacle to the mix and they were able to accomplish this without overshadowing the movie's comedic core.Even though I enjoyed the movie I was nevertheless left with a feeling that it wasn't entirely necessary. I appreciate the self-aware approach to producing a sequel but, in the end, the result was still fairly formulaic and predictable in spite of that. While the excellent end credits sequence just about single-handedly justified the existence of the movie, I'm not sure what it says about a movie when the end credits is the best part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

There are some definite funny parts in this and I did laugh a lot throughout but this one felt a little more flat then the original.,"""We have to stop treating this like it's exactly the same as last time."" After taking down the drug dealers in high school Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are reassigned to college. They are tasked with finding the dealer that is giving drugs to students before the drug goes viral. They go undercover as students in order to find out who is dealing. Soon after starting school girls and friends start to effect the partnership and threaten the case. The biggest problem with sequels is that they try and do the same thing as the original but they change just enough so it's not as good as the original. While that did happen with this one I have to admit that one of the best parts is that they don't try to hide from it. The movie opens in the chiefs office where he explains that because of the success of the first time they teamed up they are doing it again. A very literal reference to the first movie and he goes on to explain that what is going to happen in this one is the exact same thing as the first one.

Follows the same formula as the original and it works,"Right from the first scene, the chemistry between Tatum and Hill is palpable. I wouldn't be surprised if many of their scenes contained a large amount of improvisation, based on how well they work together. The movie makes it no secret that the plan is to follow the same story as the first movie, since they make frequent mention to it in the set up of the plot. Aside from the two co-leads, Ice cube plays a much more prominent role and is great in his larger role. I feel that the movie is about 20 minutes too long, and drags towards the end. As well, some of the age jokes by the roommate across the hall and the bromance jokes do fall a little flat.

The brothers are back.,"Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, masters of having their genre-parody cake and eating it too, have followed up their sly, self-referential franchise reboot ""21 Jump Street"" with an inevitable sequel that is, at least in part, a sly, self-referential commentary on the inevitability of sequels. ""22 Jump Street"" reunites producer-stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum for a second round of poorly disguised undercover antics, swapping high school for college and prom for spring break but otherwise sticking snugly to the prior film's winning formula, mining the resulting doublings and repetitions for maximum absurdist hilarity. Given Hill and Tatum's ever-increasing zeitgeist value, the film should easily outperform its predecessor's $200 million international gross, delivering ""Lego Movie"" directors Lord and Miller their second box office triumph of 2014.In ""Puerto Mexico,"" all roads eventually lead to spring break - a somewhat less extravagant gathering than the one envisioned by Harmony Korine, but it hardly matters, because whenever Hill and Tatum are onscreen together, the film enters a heavenly zone that nothing can breach. Both performers are fantastic physical comedians, and much of ""22 Jump Street"" is built around Laurel-and-Hardy-style juxtapositions of Hill's short, stocky inertia with Tatum's chiseled, gravity-defying grace. Tatum has been too excellent too many times to be considered a revelation, but he appears exceptionally raucous and joyous here, like a cheeky first grader stuck in the body of a linebacker, or possibly a really deft comic actor who only recently realized how funny he can be. Whatever happens with the ""Jump Street"" franchise from here on out, no one should be able to break up this acting duo.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It's an almost non stop barrage of humor that, appropriately, doesn't take itself to seriously.That's right, it's a series of jokes that themselves don't mind being made fun of. For example, the ending montage of incessant Jump Street sequels had me giggling throughout.

"Funny, but not better than the first","22 Jump Street 7/10- I loved 21 Jump Street to say the least, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Needless to say, I had pretty high hopes for 22 Jump Street. I was satisfied with the results, not overly impressed, but satisfied with the sequel. While 22 Jump Street suffers from sequel prone receptiveness, it still delivers on good humor, a well enough thought out plot, and solid chemistry from the lead actors: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.Even though this film says that it is basically doing the same exact stuff in the first one, if you do a joke a second time, it is almost never as funny as the first. The Hangover Part II definitely told everyone that. I get that sending youngish looking cops into a school demands some of the same routine, but I was expecting at the very least a different approach on it. Now, they did do a different approach on some of the routine, but if the director did this for all of it, the movie would have benefited. I also believe that this film lost some of the concepts that made it so hilarious to begin with. The main one being that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are just regular cops, not a couple of James Bonds where every little thing can cause an explosion. They played this well in the first film, but it seems like they forgot about it in the second film. There was other little stuff that bugged me, but that comes with every movie. The only other thing that I would have changed was the ending credits scene, which was funny, but over- extended.I thought the casting for this film was really done well. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have such great chemistry together that it is hard not to laugh when they are together. Ice Cube is an easy pick for an angry captain and plays it very nicely. Most of the returning cast was probably the best actors of the film, but the new members still kept the scenes they were in entertaining. The new gags were probably my favorite part of the film, I do not want to give any of them away, but they nearly had me on the floor laughing.I liked that 22 Jump Street was set on a much bigger stage, the first film had to do the ground work, but I was glad it was taken to a new level. With a new stage came a much broader range of jokes and gags that helped this picture differentiate from the original. It was also a nice change of pace to see Channing Tatum as the one having fun and Jonah Hill as the one who was having a hard time getting through the case (which is what I thought was going to happen in the first film). Football was a nice touch to the storyline, even if it was very hard to believe. The only thing I would have changed about it was to go away from the same cliché of football players being dumb, hard headed jocks. I thought taking Channing Tatum parkour skills to a new level was a nice change of pace. The plot twists kept you on your toes for most of the film and this Jump Street franchise still did well at making fun of the past buddy-cop Hollywood movies.Hands-down funniest movie out right now.

A Roller-coaster Ride of Comedy,"21 Jump Street was a huge surprise of a hit back in 2012, and of course— in this day and age—that means a sequel is on its way. Thankfully, Phil Lord and Chris Miller have returned to the project because it could've otherwise been a total mess. The thing is that Lord and Miller are probably the most ingenuous filmmakers working in the comedy genre right now, always taking the ""meta"" approach to their films as can be seen by this year's earlier release, The Lego Movie, and now this—a rare example of an outstanding sequel.Don't get me wrong; if this was a sequel that simply continued Jonah Hill's and Channing Tatum's relationship in another elaborate but more exciting undercover operation, I would've had a hard time seeing how it'd succeed. However, in this case, everyone is fully aware of the ""cash-grab, unnecessary sequel"" status that's immediately imposed upon the film, and so what do they do? They ride with it. The most famous exemplar in the conversation is the Hangover series, which has been completely lambasted to the point of utter mortification for all those involved. I feel like those two sequels were the butt of the jokes here.In addition, 22 Jump Street goes one step ahead, says ""why not?"" and continually parodies the numerous tropes that plague buddy-cop movies and any kind of genre. The dialogue is consistently witty, poking fun at the sheer superficiality of the college environment instead of adopting the douchiness of other college comedies. Obviously—I would say—the most important element of this film has to be the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, which is frankly organic at this point. Both characters feed off of each other, bringing their own vastly differential personalities and style to the table. That is exactly what makes the best of buddy comedies, and what makes the Jump Street series so charming is the sweet ""brolationship"" between the nerd and jock. Here, it's delivered to amazing comedic effect, sentimentally playing around with their relationship as if it was a romantic one (essentially, the joke is on the idea of ""bros for life"").I've said it once and I'll say it again: I have been really impressed with Channing Tatum as of late. He could've come out be a generic and bland pretty boy who starred in the banal action flicks or simpleminded rom-com's—he has done a fair share of those in the past, yes, but his evolution as an actor is quite evident. Tatum's a very smart individual, choosing to display his absolute versatility and range by taking on various genres (proving his comedy chops in one film, giving dramatic weight in another, and then from time to time, taking the fun action movies). Speaking of, I'm really looking forward to seeing his talent shine again in Foxcatcher later this year.With all that being said, there's one comment to make on this atrocious trend that's been persisting with showing way too much in trailers. This film is immensely guilty of that as well. I still can't believe they had the guts to reveal the true culprit behind the mysterious criminal scheme in the darn trailer. They show a 20-second clip from one of the last scenes in the movie! Whose idea was that, really? The narrative would've been far better if the viewer didn't—you know—expect the twist; I definitely have to discredit this film for that if anything.On another note, even though the likability of Channing Tatum's more hapless and relatable character in the first one transforms into mere obnoxiousness as he joins the frat boys and accepts his persona as the muscular, good-looking jock, the goodhearted nature of the two's dynamic still survives at the end of the day. Once it's been evaluated, 22 Jump Street is certainly one of the most inventive and exceptional comedy sequels out there, continuing the story while making fun of it. Oh, and wait until you see the end credits sequence that fully trashes the whole idea of a (once-fresh) concept repeating itself exactly throughout an entire series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Best comedy of the year.,"22 Jump Street is the latest summer comedy. It features Jonah Hill as Shmit and Channing Tatum as Jenko once again. But not everything is as it seems....no wait it is. 22 Jump Street has an identical plot to 21 Jump Street. Go undercover, find the dealer of a new drug, and take him or her down. Its usually very hard for a sequel to do any better then the original. But 22 Jump Street lives up to and in some ways passes 21 Jump street. Yes, the premise is the same. But it seems like this film had more energy pumped into it. I don't know if it was better acting, directing, or jokes but whatever it was it worked. The film moves along quickly with Jonah and Channing hoisting it up. With out their energetic honest performances this film very well could have flopped. Putting their soul into every joke and scene. It really made for good cinema. And once the film nears the end It gets even better. The jokes fly at 100 miles per hour. They never stop, even through the clunky bits. There are moments in the movie that are wasted or could've been done better. For example, The scenes when the leads get high unexpectedly. This also happens in the first film and its a riot. But here its only used to serve later in the movie. Which is good but it really didn't do anything and wasn't that funny. Its also surprisingly unpredictable. New clues popping up about the investigation left and right. Pointing to different people each time. It's fun to see each shred of evidence actually mean something. And once everything connects and you see the true drug dealer it catches you off guard. Once the this movie hits the credits it even gets better which is always a great thing. Showing fake parodies of future Jump Street movies. It was hilarious. All in all 22 Jump Street is a slight improvement on the first. Yet a lazily written plot holds this film back from greatness. The heart and soul that jonah and channing put in is well worth it on its own. This movie is hilarious and fast paced. Nearly, the perfect summer blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Like it a lot!!!,"It was a pretty good sequel overall.Like the first movie mocked the original TV series (which in itself never took itself too seriously) 22 Jump Street mocks 21 Jump Street and does the same thing with prequels in general, starting with the Title which is explained by the fact that their HQ was moved to the other side of the street. They even have an inside joke that the next sequel will be called 23 jump street (which is located right next to 21 jump Street and is under construction).This is the second Sequel that I saw this year (the 1st being Muppets Most Wanted) that both made fun and warned you of the fact that you are watching a Bad sequel, but the difference is that 22 does it without breaking the forth wall with hilarious innuendos about the fact that the jump street boys, Jenko and Schmidt are going to be doing the same thing they did in the 1st film, and the fact that this was actually a good sequel.Like the ending of 21 stated (which was cleverly cut into the beginning of this film by making the sequel feel like the next episode of a TV show). Tatum and Hill are being sent to college. Like with the high school adventure, the two Undercover Cops are on the look for a drug going around campus and attempt to pass their thirty-something butts off as college aged teenagers, but college is a different world than high school with Jenko getting back some of the coolness he lost being an Undercover teen in High School by getting on the football team, which caused a wedge between the partners when Jenko bonds with one of his teammatesMany of the film's big laughs come from Jonah and Channing (of course), as their partnership reads more like a marriage going through problems during this case. The surprising humorous twist was the additional screen time Ice Cube's character, captain Dickson got in the sequel. That was a good move.A few more character roll overs from the first movie exist as well including catching up with the main-villains from 21. Plus a few high profile cameos including some of the old Jump Street gang from the 80's.Overall this movie flourished by avoiding the cruse of Sequels by not taking the whole thing too seriously.

Horrid,"Really IMDb? 7.4? How how how. Having read some other reviews clear some folks are getting paid to write positive feedback. Some reviews talk about laughing non-stop all the way through - that is simply not possible.This film is a total shocker, and I quite liked the first one. Turned it off after 45 excruciating minutes.Was clear after 10 minutes or so the film was a simple repeat of the first, but with far less humour. This is without doubt the worst film I have seen in the last 5 years, perhaps longer.Assume the actors must have been getting very well paid to want to be associated with this utter dross.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Definitely Not As Good As The First, But Still Holds Strong","Comedies are a genre I'm scarcely impressed by. Unless the humour is highly quirky or the film is deliberately offbeat, I typically don't like them. So from someone like Jonah Hill, (who I had come to expect just mainly sex jokes from after ""Superbad""), I was really surprised to discover he wrote ""21 Jump Street"". Was I impressed that he basically took (what I guess was, at least) one of his favourite shows from when he was a kid and pointlessly slapping the name on a new undercover cop movie? No. But the fact he was smart enough to address that and that he was actually capable of writing clever humour and completely emotionally developed characters, in the end won me to over to end up loving 2011's ""21 Jump Street"" and accepting it as one of my favourite comedy film in the past few years. However the immediate set-up for a sequel really dismayed me because I was worried it would become a classic case of 'rinse and repeat' sequel syndrome. And in that, I was pretty much spot on.So ""22 Jump Street"" takes place only a few months or so after its predecessor in that after being off Jump Street for a while, officers Jenko and Schmidt are re-assigned back to undercover work because they did it so well in their first case. So now they're sent off to college to do the exact same thing as the first film. And the thing that forgives most of the film for this is that the writers were clearly aware of this so they made full well the audience got the message that ""Yes, we know this is the same as the first movie. Don't bash us for it, its part of the joke. Go along with it"". But in that, at the same time, the movie also feels highly rehashed and you can't help but go ""This is the exact same"". I got sick of it towards the end, I just wanted something new. And a movie, especially a sequel should not make me do that.The other thing I want to address in this movie is that surprisingly I still laughed at this movie just as hard, and definitely harder in one scene, as I did in ""21 Jump Street"". The comedy is still there, and it's still just as good. So don't think that because the movie feels rehashed that you're not going to laugh because yes you definitely are, regardless.Now while the first ""Jump Street"" had some fairly recognizable supporting cast members like Dave Franco and Brie Larson, I have to say this movie's supporting cast was way more unknown. I thought I recognized Jonah Hill's new love interest but clearly she just looks like someone else because she has been no one with real screen time from anything I've seen on her filmography. So it seems like they had to use the budget they would have used on some bigger names, and instead used it to keep up with the cost for all the action scenes. It's just wasted potential, to me and that is a big disappointment.The acting itself in the movie is very good. There's only three people to care about this time since there's no real supportive cast. Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and surprisingly Ice Cube. I wasn't a huge fan of him in the first film (or any movie he's ever been in), so I'm surprised how much I enjoyed him this time around. But first off, I have to talk about our main duo. Tatum and Hill are a great duo because they have a chemistry locked down that so many films try to copy. It's funny to me because I would have never though that a G.I. Joe and that kid from ""Superbad"" would one day be hilarious as hell together in an action- comedy, yet here we are. They bounce off each other really well, and I'm certain there's plenty of times where their lines are improv and it's completely seamless. They're great together and I hope they do another series or something after the Jump Street movies because they are so brilliant as a duo.Now Ice Cube was one of the biggest surprises to me in this film because I have never like him as an actor. He played up the angry black captain stereotype in the first film and it did alright for him. But what I realize now is that I didn't care because he just started off angry and never had motive. In this film they give him reason to be the angry black captain and that pushes into hilarity. Now I love his character and would watch a whole movie with him. It's just a good example how character development does add to an audience's enjoyment with a film.The last thing I think I can say is that the action in this movie is bigger than the last one, and overall better. There are more jokes while the fights are happening and it's all actual realistic conversations I've imagined real people would have if they got into that sort of fight, for example. There's one which makes fun of a really old cliché really well and it was one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie, that's all I'm going to say.So in the end, was ""22 Jump Street"" enjoyable? Yes. Was it better than the first? No. Was it a rehash? Definitely. But it did redeem itself a little bit by acknowledging that fact, even the joke got old quick. I'm still going to buy this movie, it's still super entertaining to me. It's best watched with a bunch of friends, like all comedies are. After this I think the inevitable 23 Jump Street could turn out at least good. Let's just hope it'll be more original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Best Comedic Sequel Ever.,"22 Jump Street is that rare comedy sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but gleefully surpasses it. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum double down on their chemistry, delivering a nonstop barrage of laughs through their exaggerated yet endearing dynamic. The film thrives on its self-awareness, leaning into over-the-top absurdity while openly mocking the clichés of sequels.Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller craft a comedy that is both sharp and ridiculous in all the right ways, packing in inventive gags, well-timed physical humor, and a brilliantly over-the-top end credits sequence that takes the meta-jokes to another level. With high-energy action, relentless comedy, and a knowing wink at its own existence, 22 Jump Street is a sequel done right-bigger, funnier, and fully in on the joke.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
fully developed chemistry even better,"Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are going to college. There is a new drug called WhyPhy going around at MC State that killed a girl. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is sending them in to investigate. Schmidt gets to know Maya (Amber Stevens) who knew the victim. They are led to the football players who like Jenko more. The quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell) becomes friends with Jenko and the prime suspect.After establishing the chemistry with the first movie, these two take it to the next level. Their 'session' is gut busting. Tatum is even funnier now. Jonah is the butt of a lot of jokes. Jillian Bell is hilarious with her dead pan humor. The self referential jokes really work. Even the case works. It's a nice step up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 Jump Street,"A majority of the hilarious jokes in 22 JUMP STREET are poking fun at the fact that it is basically a scene-by-scene remake of the first one. And I mean that, this is basically a scene by scene remake of 21 JUMP STREET. And just because the movie can recognize and make fun of itself for it does not make it right. I felt kind of tired knowing every twist and turn it was going to take and the same style of joke accompanying it. But even though I knew they were coming, the jokes didn't cease to ale me die laughing. This is probably the funniest movie of the year so far. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is just amazing, it reminds us what a solid buddy cop movie is. The directer proves himself as knowing how to direct comedy and create great flow between dialogue and set devices.

22 Jump Street possesses a rich sense of humor that will appeal to mainstream audience while also maintaining the adequate level of sophistication,"With wit and self-mockery, 22 Jump Street brings bromance, satirical action scene and a good dose of laughter. It succeeds in avoiding redundancy of a sequel, which the movie itself points out, and brings enjoyable foolhardy yet sufficiently clever humor. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is a great couple, half of the jokes are on their expenses. Plenty of romance analogy delivered in staggeringly serious way, while the rest of it is over-the-top comedy. Script is smart, bordering on improvised banter, and it neatly pokes on popular culture.Commendably, the movie sneers at some of the clichés, even those that it uses. This opens up many opportunities as it practically makes jokes of, and on, itself. Plot follows Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) into a college for the search of another drug. While some scenes might be a bit inflated, it keeps the humor grounded without resorting to forced slapstick. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, with tons of relationship jokes, they boast their acting prowess by keeping straight faces on what must be pretty ungraceful scenes.Screenplay feels fast and tight, scenes don't overstay their welcome as it keeps churning jest at consistent pace. Action sequences are watered down and cynical remarks of those used in stereotypical action flicks. While they may be slightly predictable, the movie keeps these anticipated scenes fresh. Some events are unbelievably cartoon-like, down to the use of visible effect, but it's forgivable considering the movie produces humor literally until the end credit.22 Jump Street possesses a rich sense of humor that will appeal to mainstream audience while also maintaining the adequate level of sophistication. Despite what it quips in the spirit of self-awareness, this sequel is as good, or even better than its predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Isn't It Bromantic?,"""21 Jump Street"" was a pleasant surprise when it was released two years ago. Instead of the lame comedy rip-off of a classic 80s TV series that it was expected to be, it turned out to be a rip-roaring action comedy delight. The comedic chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was sizzling and carried the film through its absurd premise of adult cops undercover as high school students.In this sequel ""22 Jump Street"", Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) were sent undercover to college this time with the mission of uncovering the truth about the death of a coed involved with a new party drug called ""Whyphy"".As the investigation of the case got underway, Jenko meets a kindred spirit in Zook (Wyatt Russell), a frat boy and football jock, who thought and acted exactly like Jenko did. Schmidt hooks up with a pretty art major named Maya (Amber Stevens), but he is majorly distressed that Jenko is getting more and more into fraternity life and football and was steadily drifting away from their partnership.Action peaks in a wild spring break party on the beach where ""Whyphy"" gang threatens to spread the drug big time to more college students. Schimdt and Jenko have to get their acts together in time to prevent that from happening.Again, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum throw all shame to the wind and go all out in going for the laughs. Their chemistry together works as well now as it worked back then. The squirmy scene where Schmidt and Jenko are in session with a shrink is particularly hilarious.Hill acts as he usually acts as the dorky misfit. He really can't go wrong with that face of his. He really has a natural talent for physical comedy. But it was Tatum who steps up more in this sequel as he fearlessly makes fun of his him-bo image. Tatum's athletic skills are also highlighted in many exciting scenes. Ice Cube steals his scenes as their ill-tempered foul- mouthed boss, Captain Dickon. He would figure in what I thought was the most jaw-droppingly awkward and outright LOL scene of the film.The humor of this film is very shallow and can even offensive for some people, but truth to tell, it is really very funny. If you don't mind the mile-a-minute profanity-laden script with heavy sexual or drug- themes, you will be laughing from start to finish with the misfortunes and misadventures of Schmidt and Jenko. The laughs carry on all the way up to the closing credits where they mock their own possible future sequels in a montage that is a must-see in itself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"I say give it a shot, you may be surprised by how much you enjoy it.","This summer hasn't really been the best for movies, but there have been one or two that have risen above the rest in terms of pure entertainment value. One of these such movies was 22 Jump Street, a movie that is a parody of itself, bad sequels and crappy action movies.The plot itself is fairly generic, which is kind of the point of the movie, but the jokes are hilarious and the delivery of them is near on perfect. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are both on top form during this movie, perhaps even better than they were in 21 Jump Street. It was also great to see Ice Cube getting a lot more screen time here as well, time to prove he can still be as bad ass and as funny as ever, in fact, his character in this did remind me a lot of how he played Craig in the Friday sequels.I will say they did re-use a lot of jokes and comedy ""bits"" from the first movie, and I do get that this was intentional and meant to be funny, but some of it just felt kind of crammed in there at times and didn't really match the rest of the movie, I won't say too much on this for fear of spoilers, but I'm sure if you watch the movie or have already seen it, you know what parts I'm talking about.I also feel obliged to point out that some of the secondary characters/actors were not that great, both in writing and execution. To name one group of these characters, I would say the new ""Interns"" at Jump Street, but there are other examples, scattered throughout the film.Aside from these two minor complaints though, I will say, if you are looking for a bit of light-hearted entertainment, and enjoyed the first movie, 21 Jump Street, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as much as I did. I Wouldn't really call it a ""multiple-watches"" movie, but I could see myself watching it again at some point in maybe like a year or so, if I'm bored and want a laugh.So, in closing, I say give it a shot, you may be surprised by how much you enjoy it.8/10Written By Kieron Behan",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""It's...literally... the... same""","And somehow it isn't at the same time. Well, it is. The movie smartly plays with how unnecessary and repetitive this sequel is, and with that, gives us enough meta jokes to enjoy the same kind of trip.In the end though, it's hard to argue this isn't just the same thing over again, and the good thing about that is they put the same effort on it, so it is as good.The difference for me is that while is not as good in the first two acts, while their were the best parts of the original, it gets even more absurd in the final act (which is hard to do, considering how absurd the final act of the original was), making it absolutely insane and funnier still.

"A lot of jokes fell flat, felt overlong, predictable","I really enjoyed 21 Jump Street, but this one just felt off to me. The highlight of the film was at the very beginning, with the Mexican cartel impressions. A lot of the jokes were really dragged out, particularly the end credits scene and the scene were Channing Tatum reacts to the news of who Schmidt had been having sex with. It wasn't really funny to begin with, and then it just dragged on and on. A lot of the jokes were just slapstick crap. I remember 21 jump street felt quite fresh, and I can't tell whether this film has lost that charm or perhaps I've grown up a bit and I wouldn't find the original as funny any more as well. I mean, how funny is it for Ice Cube to throw his food around in a hissy fit. Yeah I get it, the character has anger problems...ha ha ha. A lot of it is just stupid 'look at the man make a funny face' type stuff.Oh, and is anyone else tired of sequels that constantly make reference to the fact that its a sequel? I see it used so often now that its just clichéd and predictable. It was clever 5 or 6 years ago, but I'd like to see sequels that try to stand on their own ground without constant winking reference to the fact that 'its not as good as the first'.All in all, I did laugh a few times, but I was restless in the last hour and couldn't wait for it to end.

7.5 IMDb Ranking Makes Me Question IMDb Rankings,"I'll keep this brief...this movie was awful.

What I got was a lot of reviews that describe ""bro-mance; explosions; sexiness; best film of the year; top comedy of all times"". Seriously?!At least have the audacity to make a fake review that acknowledges this is NOT one of the top comedies of all time. I didn't laugh once, and neither will you. You should be ashamed IMDb, Channing Tatum, and Jonah Hill.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Not as great as 21, but it's not far behind :)","This movie is definitely fun I got the last full show in Ayala today which was at 2:30. Anything after that was Transformers 4, and I wanted to catch this movie before it got removed from the theater. From start to end, you just laugh at this movie. It's the same directors, same writers, and same actors with the same formula. I even loved the references, which felt kind of awkward to laugh at, because I was the only one in my row who understood them e.g. ""I like your new office, Captain. It looks like a cube of ice."" because the captain is played by Ice Cube! Right?? You get it?? It's funny, right?.... moving on... Though I did enjoy 22 Jumpstreet, I still think I love the first one more. The thing with the first one was, it was unexpectedly fresh and definitely memorable, kind of like The Hangover. With the second movie, you get the same story, with just a few elements changed in it (kind of like Hangover II), and it doesn't help that Ron Swanson's character keeps reminding us that this is the SAME movie. Also, one major gripe: The inside jokes comparing the police department to the actual movie were a bit worn out. They did it once in the first movie, and they did it again for this movie, only more times. The only time where I found it really distracting was during action scenes. Instead of worrying about what's happening to the characters, I just laugh at the references they were making about not spending so much on the movie's budget. The excitement is gone because, you get reminded that ""this is just a movie"". Also Schmidt and Jenko ""gay"" scenes were a bit too many in my opinion. I mean, they ARE funny... but they tend to get repetitive. The 2 guys had such great chemistry in the 1st movie. Now, Jonah Hill is the possessive girlfriend type? It just felt like the character was developing backwards. Channing Tatum should stick to comedy. I never cared for his dramatic roles, nor was I really impressed with his action roles in G.I. Joe... maybe because he doesn't really suit me as the smart/leader type. He has that ""jock"" type of look, and his portrayal of not-too-smart action hero cop Jenko was really likable and endearing. Also, Jillian from Workaholics is a terrific comedic actress. If you guys don't watch the show, you should check it out, and not just for Jillian. You people who love Pitch Perfect will recognize Adam Devine who is one of the co-creators of the show. It's good, I swear. Overall, I think that 21 Jumpstreet is better than 22, but 22 isn't far behind. It's a great movie, and you shouldn't miss it 21 Jumpstreet = 8.0/10 22 Jumpstreet = 7.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's still funny the second time around.,"What I liked about 22 Jump Street was that it was confident. The writers knew it was the same movie, and they address it as often as possible. So yes, it's the same movie, don't get all critique about it. But, the jokes are so much better, and they don't rely on dick jokes as much as they did in the first one. There's not a lot of build up to the gags also, what happens, happens, and that's awesome!The chemistry between Jonah and Channing is brilliant. They bounce off each other perfectly and I just can't picture anyone else playing the dynamic duo. Ice Cube, who wasn't in much of the first film, has a lot more screen time here. And his scenes are mainly filled with absolute hilarity! There's one scene in the middle of the movie that involves him, will make you laugh so hard you might tear up a bit.The action sequences were well done, a whole lot more exciting than the first movie, the scale was bigger and the locations were better. It's great movie with lots of laughs and a couple of hearty moments.I would say this is the funniest movie of the year so far and the funniest R movie this year (I didn't enjoy Bad Neighbors as much as 22 Jump Street).8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The worst four hours of the year.,"I could not stand watching this film. It took four hours of my life to get through it as I was so bored, I would pause it to do other things. There was not one laugh. The acting was one bad joke after another. The good reviews for this trash are beyond sane. Do not waste a minute of your life on this garbage. I thought the first version was OK and got through it, even though this kind of film is not my taste at all. It really bothers me when filmmakers, and I do include the actors in this, assume we will indulge them in their silly inside jokes and amateurish bits that get recycled over and over.I don't think that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have much to offer, but sadly this may be them at their best..one bad sight gag after another.

Schmidt & Jenko Crack The Case,"""Schmidt"" & ""Jenko"" Crack The Case: Saw Jump Street Movies at Regal Cinemas tonight! What a hilarious sequel to 21 Jumpstreet! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum really do have great chemistry on the BIG SCREEN and ""Captain Dickson"" played by Ice Cube is also very funny in the movie! The mission this time is to ""crack down"" on drug hustlers pushing ""WhyFy"" to college students after a female student dies from using, so the crime-fighting duo are sent to the campus to investigate who the distributors are.During the movie ""Jenko"" played by Tatum bonds very well with the jocks and joins the college football team while ""Schmidt"" played by Hill finds himself taking their investigation to the art majors and poetry lovers. Here he ends up finding love in ""Maya,"" a student played by the very beautiful and talented Amber Stevens who later becomes his greatest surprise! Both ""Schmidt"" & ""Jenko"" also learn how valuable they are as a team after splitting-up during this crazy investigation.The only distasteful parts of the movie were the Tracy Morgan and Maya Angelou references; being that Angelou recently passed-on and Morgan was involved in a tragic motor-vehicle accident. How ironic, right? There's a really funny surprise at the end too! How many more of these ""Jump Street"" movies will they make? You might want to ask Seth Rogen!

Great sequel with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of charisma to boot,"Is '22 Jump Street' as good as '21 Jump Street'? Quite possibly, which is a big achievement, seeing as the original was one of the better comedies of the last 10 years! This film has just as many laughs - if not more - and does a great job of poking fun at itself and the ludicrousness of most Hollywood sequels.There's a few more car chases, but they're unconventional and quite amusing with the commentary the two leads provide. A fair bit of the humour comes from the fact that their undercover disguise as college-age students (i.e. they should be 18-21), which is totally unbelievable, seeing as Hill is 30 & Tatum is 34. Plenty of referencing the first film and stupidity of repetition in sequels (mostly by Offerman's Chief of Police - ""EVERYTHING is EXACTLY the SAME""!) and even casting the bad guy from 'Bad Boys II' - Peter Stormare - as the villain in this!Pretty good support cast - the Yang Twins are great as the across-the-hall stoners, Stevens is good as the love interest and Ice Cube has more to do in this film, which is a good thing and leads to a few hilarious scenes.Best bit of the film? Probably the many joke sequel posters/trailers they show! Highly entertaining and just plain funny to see how far they can stretch a premise. Quite reminiscent of 'Tropic Thunder', but definitely had the crowd in stitches! I do hope they make a third film, but if not, both 21 & 22 Jump Street will stand as some of the best action/police comedies ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Big, Dumb and Beautiful, It's a True Formula-Drinker","A return to the well for Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in every conceivable way, doggedly following the same formula that brought them success the first time around. Somehow, it's just as good. Maybe it's because there's nothing quite like this elsewhere on the scene, so we're just scratching that blatantly self-aware, cliché-seeking itch once every couple of years and it hasn't yet worn out its welcome. At least, not entirely - the constant winks and nods do begin to grate by the end of the third act - but a heavy dose of loud, fresh, full-body laughs do a fine job of smoothing it all over. Ice Cube, in an expanded role, is especially great, shamelessly stealing scenes like a serial kleptomaniac. Of course it's not to be taken remotely seriously, even in comparison to the original, which is a good thing because the plot is a totally vacant, paper-thin wash.

Superior sequel,"22 Jump Street is the sequel to surprise hit, 21 Jump Street. It is a buddy cop action comedy, like it's predecessor, which again focuses on fumbling cops Schmidt & Jenko(Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum)as they once again go undercover as students to infiltrate a drug ring,this time in college.22 Jump Street is a pleasant surprise as it improves upon the original in many ways: it is funnier and more action-packed and contains even more of Hill's & Tatum's lovable on-screen bromance which made the first one such a success.I went to this movie with my father and he was pleasantly surprised as he had not seen 21 Jump Street before watching this and did not know what to expect, but he laughed at almost every joke in the movie.In short,22 Jump Street is a superior sequel and is worth going to see in a movie theater , especially if you enjoyed 21 Jump Street.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A hilarious sequel to end all sequels,"22 JUMP STREET is one of the most laugh-out-loud comedies I have seen -- and in nearly 50 years on this planet, I have seen plenty.Before writing this review, I skimmed a few of the one- and two-star IMDb reviews posted for this movie, and I gave up on them after a while. Humor is *extremely* subjective, and what I find funny won't necessarily click with someone else (and vice versa); having said that, I have a fairly broad (though hardly all-encompassing) sense of humor, and 22 JUMP STREET worked for me on many levels. I am somewhat surprised that there are so many people that *didn't* like this movie -- and that they are so vehement in their disdain for it -- that I was moved to post my 2¢, because it almost seems like we saw two different movies.The key to enjoying this movie is to appreciate its ""meta-ness"": as has been said in virtually every mainstream media review I have read for this movie, this is a sequel about ""sequels"". There isn't a sequel trope that isn't subverted at some point during this movie (some tropes are skewered multiple times from multiple directions). The filmmakers are in on the absurdity: about the only limitation they gave themselves is that they don't break the fourth wall -- if they did, every scene would begin or end with the actors looking at the camera and winking.Now, if you don't like that kind of movie -- if you just want a movie to be about what you see on screen without thinking about subtext, in-jokes, meta-commentary, etc. -- then I can see why 22 JUMP STREET might not be your cup of tea.(Aside: Speaking of ""in-jokes"" maybe it's because N.W.A.'s first record is 25 years old and maybe it's because I saw the movie in a predominantly white Chicago suburb, but there's a joke involving Ice Cube and ""Straight Outta Compton"" that had me howling, but I was apparently the only person in the theater who got it.)I couldn't stop laughing during 22 JUMP STREET, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray so I can listen to the filmmakers commentary (and maybe find out what joke/trope references I missed).I don't think it's a *perfect* comedy -- those are few and far between -- and if the IMDb system allowed reviewers to give half-votes, I'd probably kick it up to 8.5 votes. But it's very, VERY funny, IMHO, and I highly recommend it.The movie has been out for exactly one month to the day as I write this review (July 13, 2014): the general consensus is that it has underperformed at the box office; however, seeing as it has taken in over a quarter of a BILLION dollars worldwide ($172+ million domestic), it seems to me to have performed just fine, and that it has connected with most of its audience quite well. (Plus, it doesn't have 3-D surcharges inflating its box office take, as do the top 6 grossing movies of 2014.)For what it's worth, I attended this movie with a friend who hadn't seen 21 JUMP STREET, and he thought it was hilarious, too -- so you needn't see the first movie to enjoy ""22"" (though I'd urge you to see the first one so that the jokes which rely on familiarity with it register fully).",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"By far the funniest comedy this summer has to offer, '22 Jump Street' coasts on a delightfully meta attitude and the inimitable chemistry of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill","Before you start accusing '22 Jump Street' of being more of the same, well writers-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller want you to know that they hear your lament. Yes, the duo whose Midas touch has made box- office gold of 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and 'The Lego Movie' are keenly aware of the Hollywood symptom of 'sequelitis', and so they have followed up their sly, self-referential reboot of the 1980s TV series with a follow-up that is even more meta, achieving in the process the rare feat of a sequel that is brasher, angrier and most importantly funnier than the original.To be sure, no one expected the 2012 feature film starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill to become the runaway success that it did; but instead of a straightforward update, its helmers Lord and Miller decided to turn a police procedural of youthful-looking cops going undercover in schools and colleges into a self-mocking romp. With just the right amount of self-awareness and some inventive flourishes, the retooled '21 Jump Street' became both a critical and commercial hit, which of course is the reason why this sequel is seeing the light of day.Tatum and Hill reprise their roles as the pair of bumbling cops Jenko and Schmidt respectively, who after bungling up the arrest of a wanted drug kingpin (Peter Stormare) find themselves assigned to a second stint in college. The address here refers to the location of their headquarters, now situated in a Vietnamese church located right opposite their last rendezvous point in the previous movie whose rundown exteriors are in stark contrast to the fancy modern-day surveillance equipment inside. Hardass Captain Dickson is still their superior, and as Ice Cube growls, ""Nobody gave a s**t about the Jump Street reboot. We've doubled the budget, as if that would double the profit.""Yup, before you start dismissing it as more of the same, their beleaguered deputy chief (Nick Offerman) already warns Jenko and Schmidt - and us - ""I want you to do exactly what you did last time."" You can't therefore fault the screenplay by returning writer Michael Bacall and his new co-writers Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman for placing our unlikely heroes into yet another shady drugs ring, although this time instead of bonding in the midst of their undercover assignment, Jenko and Schmidt find their bromance under pressure - as the fit, athletic and good-looking Jenko starts finding a soulmate in another jock named Zook (Wyatt Russell) on the football team, Schmidt finds himself snubbed and distraught.It's a classic case of the college break-up between our two high-school chums, but it ain't without its surprises. Jenko's distraction isn't some hot chick, but a quarterback whom he seems to share absolute chemistry with - 'bros before lesser bros' according to him; and instead of hooking up with the nerdy crowd in school, Schmidt goes to excruciating poetry slams and finds a tender new relationship with sensitive arts major Maya (Amber Stevens), a relationship that builds to a hilarious turn of events at work. Before long, Jenko suggests to Schmidt that they ""should investigate other people. Sow our cop oats"", or in less geek speak, meaning to go their separate ways.There is no doubt - this is through and through Tatum and Hill's show. As they had demonstrated in the first movie, the pair have a great double-act going, their disparities in physique and intelligence making them perfect complements whether they realise it or not. Sure, Lord and Miller amp up the homoeroticism between them, but there's no denying the goofy, low-key warmth that passes between them whenever they interact with each other. Between the two however, it's likely that you'll fall in love with Tatum, who has never been more puppy-dog lovable - and as an excellent case in point, his blissful thickness can't quite get more amusing than his delivery of a line about Cate Blanchett or 'carte blanche' in actual fact.The rest of the casting is also unexpectedly spot-on. Ice Cube is in fine form as their surly captain, relishing the chance to go over-the- top as things get a little too personal between him and Schmidt. Jillian Bell is splendid as Maya's snitty room-mate, whom Schmidt has the tough luck of waking up to every morning after he sleeps over. And though essentially extended cameos, identical twins Kenny and Keith Lucas are laugh-out-loud hilarious as a a perma-stoned duo who finish each other's sentences. Together with Tatum and Hill, they make pitch-perfect satires of campus favourites, whether jock culture, the walk of shame or even the roommate you wish your date did not have.With so many gags coming at you in record speed, it's little wonder that the plot takes a backseat; nonetheless, Bacall and his co-writers manage to keep the mystery humming with some perfectly executed twists that keep you guessing just where and who the investigation is leading to. The finale is appropriately set in New Mexico, where our leads follow their cohort to for Spring Break, and where Lord and Miller crank up the action for some car chases and explosions in order to justify the bigger budget that this sequel has naturally commanded (hey you can't pretend all of that went to paying the actors!).But the show belongs undeniably to Tatum and Hill for their peerless chemistry, as well as to their characters whose mix of friendship, co- dependency and camaraderie. Their BFF homoerotic routine is unceasingly humorous, and the jokes are as meta as it gets without tipping into caricature. Indeed, this is a sequel even more enjoyable and entertaining than its predecessor, one that boasts more ingenuity, wit and derring-do than you would probably ever expect - after all, which sequel you know dares to burn its franchise boats in sharp satirical fashion by upending loads of serviceable ideas for future Jump Streets?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jump in to this Funny Sequel,"I honestly didn't think this would match up to the original. The original was a funny springtime surprise with an unlikely collaboration, a shallow plot, but some great chemistry among the cast and a lot of funny moments. It does no problem superseding the original in my book. The chemistry is there again. The supporting cast once again does a great job creating the funny moments, although it would have been nice to see Franco and Riggle in more than one scene, even though it is hilarious. The plot leaves a bit to be desired, but the execution, and the ability to not take themselves too seriously throughout the movie makes this one a winner. Also have to give credit to the directors for not just sticking the characters in the exact same predicament. This time Jenko gets a chance to have fun and hang out with the cool kids, and Schmidt is stuck with art and poetry students, meets an interesting girl, and an even more interesting roommate. Dickson (Cube) is also a good addition and the interactions with him create laughs as well. The credits montage is witty and entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious Film From Start to Finish (and beyond),"I think the biggest fear going into 22 Jump Street was that it would be just another sequel. Sequels almost never turn out as good as the original, because at the end of the day it's really just rehashing the same content to make more money. But the great thing about 22 Jump Street is that its fully aware of this 'futility', and openly mocks it.It's near insane how well-written this film is, especially for a comedy film, and it just balances realism with absurdity enough to keep you laughing for the whole time. In fact, there are particular moments in the film which go beyond hilarious; almost a new level of hysterics that you just can't describe. You'll know exactly what moments they are when you watch, and if you're anything like me you'll be left in tears by it. Not tears like Marley and Me, but tears because you'll actually be in pain from laughing too much.I thought Bad Neighbours was the comedy film of the year, but 22 Jump Street makes it look as funny as a Friedberg and Seltzer film (okay, I'm exaggerating). Ice Cube can proudly make his claim to having the funniest moment of the film, but to maintain the magic of such a scene I won't even start to describe it. The rest of the film does not fall short either. Even the end credits alone provide more laughs than 90% of comedy films out there.This film proves to be an exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the original; I believe that 22 is definitely more than 21.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 Jump Street... Amazing!,"I loved this movie so much!

There also are interesting and very well inserted inside jokes and references, for example, the very brief Benny Hill joke was hilarious. If you liked the first part, you will be laughing watching this flick as well.Overall, 9/10 for ""22 Jump Street"", a really funny, good flick - if you enjoyed first, it's safe to see this one as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Now Thats Some Fun!,"The sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street, '22 Jump Street' is a joyride! It crosses above its prequel & turns out to a complete laugh-riot! Also, Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum are in super form!'22 Jump Street' Synopsis: After making their way through high school (twice), big changes are in store for officers Schmidt and Jenko when they go deep undercover at a local college.'22 Jump Street' is funnier & way more crazier than 21 Jump Street. Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel & Rodney Rothman's Screenplay moves on a fast-pace, and the bromance between its protagonists, brings the house down. Also, the sequences involving Capt. Dickson, (A Terrific Ice Cube), are simply hilarious. I just couldn't stop laughing!Phil Lord & Christopher Miller's Direction is good. Cinematography captures the madness aptly. Editing is pretty crisp. Action-Sequences are commendably executed.Performance-Wise: Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum are the life of '22 Jump Street'. Jonah, now A Two Time Academy-Award Nominee, is impeccable, while Tatum, is emerging into a versatile actor. The bromance between the two, is too good!On the whole, '22 Jump Street' is a winner all the way. Go, laugh out loud!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The bromance continues,"Following the critical and commercial success of the action comedy 21 Jump Street a sequel seem very likely and thanks to the direction of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and an intelligent screenplay they have made a film that is on par with the original. 22 Jump Street is a very self-aware film, much like the first, lampooning the idea of sequels repeating the same plots and plot points, making fun of the film's larger budget and the general filmmaking process. The humour and jokes are constant with some fun visual gags and jokes making fun of plot points. This is a film that appreciates the audience's intelligence and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are still as a strong double act and the film focuses on the bromance between the pair. It is a fun smart film and the best R-rated comedy of 2014 so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
genuinely laughing out loud...,"Watched it in theaters and EVERYONE in the place was CRACKING UP! I can't tell you the last time I laughed so genuinely hard... like ugly laughing hard. No question, this one tops the first. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have unreal chemistry on screen, no one could have done better. I was afraid the sequel would be a flop compared to 21 Jump Street but 22 exceeded my expectations. GO SEE IT! Ushers at the theater were watching and dying of laughter too. Throughout the whole movie they reference 21 Jump Street but in a way that makes it feel like an inside joke between you and them. So many ""comedies"" never give you the laugh the way 22 Jump Street does. In my opinion, movies like 22 deserve their own genre because calling it a ""comedy"" doesn't give it justice. I'm absolutely buying this movie and seriously we are considering to go see it again in theaters this weekend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
I thought this one would be just repeating but...,"... I was wrong, in a way. Of course 22 Jump Street has a similar structure to the previous film, but still 22 Jump Street manages to be original and not just repeating the first one. While the situations and some characters are familiar, 22 Jump Street is still enjoyable and worth seeing. That's a lot more than I would've expected.22 Jump street is still as hilarious as the first film. This time a good example of the quality humour in this film was the good trip / bad trip when Schmidt and Jenko are on drugs. I also thought that I had seen the funniest bit - how the relationship between Schmidt and Maya became extremely awkward. But even if I knew how that was going to go, it still was so ridiculous and hilarious, oh my god. 22 Jump Street also had amazing fourth wall breaks, mostly about the budget. Same could go with how much older Schmidt and Jenko look compared to the other students. It's like when you're watching a TV show and all the high schoolers are played by fully grown people.This film is hilarious and so much fun. I thought I'd rate it lower than the first one, but I guess I was wrong about this one - just like the first one. But still, if I'd have to choose one, I'd go with the first one. Something about it just makes it so much more interesting. It's not necessarily funnier or more thrilling, but it's like the first time you see a film and it's so much better than the second time. I guess that applies to this case as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Jenko and Schmidt are at it again,"The guys are at it again, this time they are going to college!21 Jump Street is back in the house, Jenko and Schmidt barely made it through high school unscathed, so this time they are taking on college. The undercover division is under a new name though, rent is expensive and Korean Jesus is popping so the department moves across the road to 22 Jump Street and embraces another Jesus.Otherwise, take 21 Jump Street, ctrl+C, ctrl+V and voila the film 22 Jump Street is here. Do not worry though, this is not your stereotypical second film in a franchise. Actually, that is a blatant lie, and that is what makes this film so much fun. Writers Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman take the stale premise of a sequel and rev it up to an eleven and run with it full force.The story plays up the justifiably cringe worthy potential in the film and mocks it with a meta tone that audiences should recognize and enjoy. 22 Jump Street manages to do all the things a bad sequel accomplishes but it is fresh, funny, original and entertaining. There were plenty of moments where the audience I was viewing the film with literally screamed at the screen from shock and absorption.I watched this film when I was in desperate need to get lost in an entertaining movie where I could laugh. I got far more than I could have bargained for. Ice Cube is utilized to even more hilarious effect and the supporting cast somehow is just as good, if not better. Special commendation to the returning cast members and newbs The Lucas Brothers and Wyatt Russell for being enjoyable22 Jump Street is laugh out loud funny and a delightful comedy that fits the bill. I can not understand how anyone who liked the first film could possibly be disappointed in this wonderful sequel.Read more for FULL reviews of RECENT releases by going to our WEBSITE.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sequel that makes fun of itself...ummm,"22 Jump Street is first and foremost a sequel, something the movie itself will tell you repeatedly. Not a bad thing though as most of the fun comes from there. In this installment of the Jump Street saga, Jenko & Schmidt are now heading to college to take down a drug scheme that lead to the murder of a student. Sound familiar? That's because as they were instructed, our undercover agents are told to do ""it"" exactly like last time. In all seriousness though, we all came here for the comedy and that fact the movie goes for a self-referential approach is the platform for all the crazy stunts and jokes we want to see.Hill and Tatum are once again great in their roles as they share an incredible chemistry on screen and nail their characters. As far as supporting cast goes Ice Cube is once again good in his type of character, particularly in one hilarious scene. Also a shout out to a great Peter Stromae turn, as he explores his comedic side. Overall this movie is a very worthwhile follow up to the original. It's as funny and explosive and it undoubtedly pleases fans. As the movie suggests as well, we can't wait to see what's to come for this building franchise. Let us hope 23 Jump Street is another fun one.Rating: 8,5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious,"Hilarious!!! Seriously funnyhonestly, I read some of the negative reviews of some people and they clearly just don't understand comedy. Looking for in-depth character analysis and plot and blah blah... seriously people!!! This is a just a fun comedy.The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is top notch. They play off each other so well...but I seriously doubt they are acting. I'm pretty confident that they were just out having a massive laugh. The whole film is in on the joke and they invite the viewer to share it.Its funny...very funny. hugely entertaining film that please don't think about plots and characters... just laugh that the guys say and do funny stuffjaws dropped and aghast at people over analyzing a urine extracting film. Can I say that?it is funny - I hadn't seen the first one btw",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
More of the same,"22 Jump Street had few funny moments and a similar storyline to its prequel, but that's about it. With subpar acting, weak plot and somewhat bland comedy, the second instalment has much to improve upon.This film recasts familiar faces with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as costars. As their bromance is tenuous in the new world of college, they begin to undergo changes. Watching this movie was exciting at times and a bore at others. With good scenes scattered seldom among the rest, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I had hoped. The jokes were common and action was numbing.Although this movie has been featured throughout the summer as a hit, it is a miss. Hopefully future instalments will try to be more original.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sequel worth seeing,"This sequel to the surprise mega-hit 21 Jump Street (2012) follows the same winning formula and gets the same winning result. Again smartly relying on the excellent on screen chemistry between stars Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, non-stop broad (OK, borderline vulgar) humor, massive explosions, exciting chase sequences, and knowing winks to the camera, 22 Jump Street will not surprise anyone. But if you liked the first movie, the sequel manages to provide the same level of entertainment without being boring.Be sure to stay for the ending credits for some more laughs regarding some hypothetical sequels.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly good!,"It was actually way better than i expected. The plot is formulaic yes, there is no much room for character development, but the humor and the tone settled were perfect. The bromance totally works, all the gay puns are epic, it makes fun of itself, and most of his jokes worked. They really did.This movie accomplished the aim of being a good buddy cop action comedy after all,but the tone and the humor put it in another level. This will be a classic buddy comedy in the future, who puts people seeing tatum and hill acting like a couple the whole time, and it works all the way. Plus, even though i thought predictable but i understand, the ice cube scene in the lunch is simply epic. I loved every second of it.I really think this was one of the best of 2014. And one of the rare cases where the sequel gets better. I just hope the third chapter will be not much inferior to this. Don't think they will achieve greatness again. I hope I'm wrong. 2",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very pathetic movie!,"I don't know how many ways I can say how bad this movie was. Script was pathetic. Actors were definitely off their marks. Clichés were over used...I think I lost several brain cells while sitting in this movie. I lost a couple hours of my life that I will never get back....DON'T GO!!! The story was absolutely going no where. Who are these people who rated this movie a 5...freaking dip sticks! The scenes did not flow one into the other. Nothing about this movie was even half way entertaining. People around us were leaving with about three fourths of the movie still to go. We decided to stay, but just because we paid the money. Best part of the movie...the end...credit were better than the rest of the movie...why...because it was time to leave!!! Actually, the best part was that we live in Vegas and we went to play the slots and got four aces playing video poker.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Surprisingly Sharp, With Theater & Film In-Jokes","I didn't go in expecting much out of this, but was very pleasantly surprised.The plot itself is pretty simple, the acting seems to be done by a cast that was really enjoying itself (Tatum as a jock really isn't a stretch), most of the bad jokes are at least grin-worthy, and there are a handful of really, really good in-jokes, as well as a lot of poking fun at the idea of sequels.Specifically, there was one theater/storytelling reference used in the early-middle of the movie that struck me as genius. The people I watched the movie with who weren't even superficially familiar with theater/storytelling terms didn't catch it, but for those who do, it's great.By that itself, it has the clichéd ""something for everyone"". Dumb humor, smart humor, and subtle humor - the latter two of which were unexpected.It's got some dumb elements, but it's a comedy, and the handful of scenes that are bad thankfully don't drag. The end drags a bit, but not so much that it's aggravating.Overall worth seeing, and fun... something I did not expect to write about it at all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Great Movie,This Movie was Great. It was just as funny as the first one and is a great comedy to watch with your friends or older family members. It has very mild humor and contains very few obscene clips that could be rated above pg13. 22 jump street is a great comedy to watch when at home and hanging out with friends but I wouldn't suggest watching it with strict parents or younger viewers. This movie like the first one also has a life lesson planted into that without friends by your side it will be very hard to achieve what you want and it also shows that you should forgive and forget..,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
best comedy sequel,"If you enjoyed the first one then you shouldn't have a problem with this one. You actually might find this one more enjoyable. Why; well because it does everything right for a sequel, and like the first movie it even mocks it. This is what I love about these movies, they know what they are, and they acknowledge it. They do this through out the movie.Another thing this movie does great is dialogue. The dialogue between Channing, and Jonah is really good. Most that's do to the twos chemistry on screen. Chemistry is important in these kinds of movies; because without it you wouldn't have a great buddy cop movie. This is why I think the jump street movies are two of the greatest buddy cop movies made.This is a must see for all the fans of the first movie, and stay for the credits, that's probably the greatest part of the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Bring some Ampheta-pep pills!,"This movie is lame. The 21 Jump Street movie made me laugh so much that I decided to see this 22 Jump Street movie because the reviews were good. (four out of five stars, usually.) Well, I did not laugh once during 22 Jump Street. I did giggle once, though. It was actually so lame that I almost feel asleep at one portion of the movie. I guess I should have used some of those ""WhyPhy"" drugs that was brought up in the movie. Save your dollars and don't watch 22 Jump Street or 23 Jump Street  or 31 Jump Street,etc., etc.,.I attended a matinée show and there were a total of 6 people watching the movie.

Actually liked it better than 21 Jump Street,Normally sequels suck. It's hard for moviemakers to capture the original spirit that captivates audiences the first time around.This ain't that type of movie.22 Jump Street does what the original one did and surpasses it in some areas. Not to mention that it continues to poke fun at itself while taking it to extremes in certain areas.Great film for those seeking some adult humor mixed in with action.4/5.

Terrible Terrible Movie - 2hrs I'll Never Get Back!,"Rented this movie with the expectations of it being 'something'.. after seeing the first movie, figured there could be the potential for an equal type movie; witty, strong acting, fast paced, a good story line etc etc.. sadly, not the case.. from the very first moment it was BAD.. had the same appeal as all bad spoof movies; scary movies 1, 2 & 3, others - can't believe these 'serious' big names in Hollywood agreed to such drivel - expected so much more... whats amazing is that it holds this 7 out of 10 rating- how? if it even got to 4 it would be twice its real worth.. sad state we are in when this trash rates that high.. so many people are so easily impressed these days.. must be all the fluoride in the water they are drinking!",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not as good as the first but still an entertaining and smart comedy with some great sequel satire.,"Most of the comedy in '22 Jump Street (2014)' comes from some stellar sequel satirisation, with its incredibly smart meta-textual commentary feeling like it does much more than just 'hang a lantern' on the numerous issues it calls out. Though some of these issues do plague the piece due to its follow-up nature, they're always made a part of the joke and are never truly detrimental. The flick isn't as good as the first (though, it's close) mainly because it is so similar to it and doesn't quite have as strong a handle on its characters or narrative. Still, it's a highly entertaining and amazingly funny flick that will surely keep you smiling throughout. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
An Equal Sequel,"22 Jump Street is the sequel to the action-comedy 21 Jump Street, which came out in 2012. I found it to be a solid sequel, just as hilarious and action-packed as the original. The first film was easily the funniest film I saw in 2012. I was pretty much laughing the entire time and that's also the case with this film.The story involves police officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) once again going under cover as students, this time at a College rather than High School, to find the supplier of a drug known as ""WHYPHY"" (an acronym for ""Work Hard Yes, Play Hard Yes"" and pronounced like ""Wi-Fi""), which has killed another student. During the investigation, Schmidt hooks up with an art student and Jenko befriends a pair of athletic jocks, which puts a strain on their close friendship.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great comedic chemistry, as seen in the previous film, but once again Ice Cube steals the show in every scene he's in. I really wish he'd do more harder comedy films like this, unlike those crappy Are We There Yet? family films. Even Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman, gets a few funny moments this time around.I rate it 8.5/10, the same score as the first film, making it an Equal Sequel. If you loved the original, definitely give this one a watch. But even if you haven't seen it, there's a recap at the beginning of this film to help you fill in the blanks.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A regurgitation of tripe from the 90s,"I've always seen IMDb as the holy grail of reviews; with the exception of the Horror genre, the rating of a movie is usually spot-on. At the time of writing, 22 Jump Street has 7.3 and I don't understand how.21 Jump Street was bearable and had its moments. However, 22 shows no real refinement of the first; in fact all I considered when watching it was the half-baked movies before pioneering comedy originals such as 40 year old virgin and Superbad.The humour was bromidic, overused and almost as silly as some of the dreadful spoofs nowadays. Like most sequels, it seems the script writers have jumped on the success of the first movie; the same gags, plot and situational embarrassment, which begs the question, why make another!?As a side note, Jonah Hill is a rising star with amazing potential, acting in supporting roles such as Wolf of Wall Street which he rightly deserved an Oscar nomination. I get it that comedies are his thing. However, this is not just an all-time-low for Hill in regards to comedies, but an insult to his talent for more auspicious roles.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Comedy That Knows It's Crazy,"I think movies are at their best when they don't try to be anything but what their suppose to be. The Fast and Furious franchise do this by realizing how incredibly crazy the plot is, and embracing it. I think so far the Jump Street franchise has done the same. Because of how much of a surprise 21 Jump Street was, I went into this movie hoping it would at least be entertaining. Comedies always have a tough time with sequels. Usually because of using the same plot over and over again, hence The Hangover franchise. But 22 Jump Street tells us out of the gate that it's the same mission, with the same guys, and likely with the same outcome. I think 22 is superior to the original and in many ways opens the door for future sequels to come.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum not only have tremendous chemistry but the comedic timing for both is unbelievable. Especially for Tatum, who's roots had nothing to do with comedy. They are the perfect buddy cop duo. Ice Cube is also back and this time it's more than just a heightened cameo. He plays a crucial role especially near the end. I have to say the scene at the restaurant and back at 22 Jump Street about mid way through the movie, are two of the funnies scenes in cinema history. I laughed so hard I didn't even hear Tatum when he was running around the building high fiving everybody. Because the movie is basically the same, I think it does run into a few problems.First off it's very predictable, and the character development is taken directly from the first Jump Street. As much as I thought I knew what was coming, most of the funny scenes were not spoiled by trailers. Which is definitely refreshing to hear about a comedy, especially in this day n age.I thought Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell were two great additions to the cast, as they were both funny and in Stevens case, brought the few scenes with real charm to the screen. Overall I think it's better than the first and it's a good example of a sequel that is the same plot as the first, but is able to actually execute. It also has a high re-watch-ability factor much thanks to the duo of Tatum and Hill.+The movie knows it's crazy+Tatum and Hill are a perfect comedic duo+Two Ice Cube scenes+Comedy sequel that's better than the first-Predictable-Not much character development8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious!,"I had the honor of seeing this movie in April at the very first public screening in Orange, CA, with Jonah Hill sitting in my row! This movie is absolutely amazing. I am a huge fan of the first movie, and I was nervous about this movie because I was hoping it would be just as good as the first one, and luckily it was! Channing and Jonah's chemistry is perfect and they are so hilarious together as always. Also, Ice Cube's character had a lot of growth in this movie and I really loved all of his scenes. All of the action sequences were very well filmed and highly entertaining. I especially loved how they emphasize Channing and Jonah's ""bromance"" throughout the movie. Especially with the therapist, I couldn't stop laughing.I also appreciate this movie because I'm a college student and I connect a lot with the characters in this movie. 21 Jump Street came out when I was in high school, which was awesome, and now 22 Jump Street came out while I was in college. It's awesome to sort of grow up with these movies and feel connected to these characters.Overall, it's just as good as the first one, if not better. I highly recommend going to see it. Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Ice Cube did an amazing job!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"if the original was solid, then this is movie diarrhea","This stuff is right up my alley too. But, 22 Jump Street is a shred of the original,.. a terribly written, unfunny mess of a sequel.FOr me it instantly becomes one of the, imo, most-painfully- overrated movies on this sight. This film doesn't deserve to see the light of a 6-point-something rating, let-alone a 7-pt-something... No chemistry between the characters... everything that made me think the original was mindless hilarity, is painfully absent here.Definitely pass on this one. FIne with turning the rehashed idea into a self-aware, template sequel, but the omission of ""laughter"" seals the deal for this piece of junk.I love stupid comedies, I love sex romps, buddy comedies, AND I really enjoyed the first one, but this film is as bland as an unsalted, plain baked potato. The best thing for me to do is forget this was ever made and watch the original a few years down the road.Painful.that would be my one word review if I could have left one.38/100 Will go down as one of the worst of the year without question.

I'm at a loss. Terrible, terrible movie. Expect a slow, but steady decline into 6.5-land, and it doesn't deserve that.To think that this now sits next to ""Anchorman""(7.3),and ""Swingers""(7.4) on the career ratings, is simply dumbfounding... a little disturbing actually.

Fantastic,"The sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street and based on the 1987 television series of the same name, 22 Jump Street is a 2014 American action comedy film produced by and starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, scripted by Michael Bacall and Oren Uziel, from a story by Hill and Bacall, and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. After successfully making their way through high school (twice), Officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are sent to college to find the dealers and supplier of a new drug named ""WHYPHY"".On majority the film's opening act introduces the gloriously self-aware and assured tone of the film, with consistent subtle references to the film's predecessor and the consistency of film sequels generally never living up to the original. Despite this, the initial opening sequence of the film (which has the spectacle but lacks the emotional engagement) does feel oddly jarring in comparison to the rest of the film. Whilst the fast-paced slapstick-filled action sequence certainly establishes initial exhilaration, the ridiculously dangerous set piece stretches the authenticity of a world which priorly felt completely genuine.The performances are uniformly outstanding. Hill and Tatum have remarkable on screen chemistry and regularly showcase their ability to appear both hilarious as a pair or individually. The writing challenges Hill and Tatum to continually switch between physical comedy and substantial character-driven passages – a challenge which both actors manage superbly. All returning cast members from the original are also as well balanced as the two protagonists. Ice Cube's character in particular is much more fleshed out than within the original, and his vast range of facial expressions provide some of the funniest moments of the film.The film appears distinctive and memorable through the director's matchless visual style and inventive cinematography. In particular, the chase sequence in which the two protagonists find themselves racing in a buggy shaped like American-Football Helmet is shot very uniquely and demonstrates that the directors are just as intent on creating a visually striking film as well as making it funny and digestible for its audience.22 Jump Street jokes that a film sequel typically can never live up to the expectations of the original. Ironically this is not the case with the film, as the film's amazing balance between comedy and emotional investment is a breath of fresh air and as such the film manages to even surpass the momentous expectations of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I only laughed because of how bad this movie is and when people in the audience went home HALFWAY THROUGH THE MOVIE. If you have not seen this movie I envy you. Then they have two cringe worthy fight scenes that were THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN. There is almost NO ACTION. The CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE WAS SPOILED IN THE FIRST TRAILER FOR THIS MOVIE WTF!!! And of course this movie treats the audience like morons by explaining every single reference and running gag from the other movie. Channing Tatum is an egotistical unfunny Mary-Sue who never once fails at by his own means while the fat one just fails at everything possible (just like this movie).

The bromance between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are wickedly awesome, the jokes are hilarious and on point. The best part is that they keep a good storyline with all the crazy stuffs going on there. Jonah Hill really rocks it, we know him for an Oscar nominee now, but he's the best at this type of comedy.Channing Tatum also doesn't disappoint,both of them made a great chemistry.This is the only movie that i watch until the end credits since they had a lot of made-up sequels that are really funny.

Improved from the previous,"I honestly don't think that this movie requires any introduction to any of you who are fans of Hollywood comedies. This is the second installment of one of the most successful and talked about comedy 21 Jump Street back in 2012. And this is clearly an improvement to the sequel and seldom have we got to witness a comedy that evolves for better. While the story is almost the same to the previous one just as the movie want it to be the clear new addition is the emotional bond that hilarious lead duo fantastically portray.Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) is back with a new assignment to bust some emerging new drug by going undercover in college. But when Jenko accidentally joins the college football team and meets up new guys to hang out with Schmidt finds himself left out. To make things worse his new found college girlfriend's family becomes hostile.22 Jump Street is filled with belly tickling humor. And they come in most strange place with most strange disguises and sometimes it takes a while to stop laughing. But for any who have seeing the previous movie this is no surprise and it's exactly what they would require. This time the movie goes a bit further and brings in some action comedy to fit the bill along with extended college comedy. Clearly the undercover investigation is bigger and the bad guys too that bring in a grand showdown at the end.

"what else to say that it's funny.  well, it's a funny sequel that may be better than the first!","My first thought as the credits rolled for 22 Jump Street - and of course these are the kind of credits you really have no choice but to sit and watch until they are all done just in case you miss 34 Jump Street or whatever the next one is - was this: it's funny. If I could make it succinct that's my review. The filmmakers practically dare me to write more like, 'hey, we already know this is a money grab with multiple references to appeasing corporate masters while also making constant light of how much goddamn bromance there is here in these buddy cop movies, so, take your best shot!' so... yeah, forget it. It's funny, and the bromance is not something to gloss over as it's one of those have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too things where it's full of genuine sentiment, but at the same time they get to have a 'breaking up/apart' montage that is just perfect comedy. Oh, and seeing how Tatum goes about his undercover college life with his, uh, new bros is also very funny.In short, you should go see it, that's it. Oh, and those twins are very funny, and Ice Cube steals the show in one scene where he reacts to something I never thought I'd see but makes perfect sense: what happens when the Ice Cube of this movie, the hardass detective sees his daughter with one of his, well, underlings?

"Excellent movie, definitely worth your time to check it out.","It's literally non-stop laughter from the beginning. I can safely say out of all the comedies I've seen this year, this one's the only one that made me struggle to contain my laughter throughout the entire duration.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the dynamic duo of comedy and are written to play off each other perfectly. Nick Offerman as a sarcastic, pessimistic police chief also makes for a relatable, laughable experience.The story is where the movie falls short, it feels more like an account of all the wacky antics Schmidt and Jenko embark on during an undercover assignment rather than actually focusing on the task at hand. In other words, it relies too much on funny subplots to make the movie good, the thing is though, it works. Despite the issue stated, the humour makes this movie one of the best I've seen in 2014.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Pulls off the near-impossible feat of being as good as the first,"The mystery of making a great comedy sequel has been solved. The catch? Now that it's been done, it can never be done again.""22 Jump Street"" is on par with its predecessor. What it loses in freshness it makes up for with sheer wit. The first movie was a genre sendup nothing short of genius, and Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill, who whipped up the first film's story, have gone all in on the sequel: no, not bigger and crazier, but more tongue-in-cheek and self-aware.If directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord (""21 Jump Street,"" ""The LEGO Movie,"" ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") hadn't earned carte blanche already, making one of the only good comedy sequels of all time will. This feat is so hard to achieve, it arguably warrants ""22 Jump Street"" a perfect rating. But the reality is that the film is more of the same, it just knows it, and the filmmakers package it exceptionally well.In fact, in the first self-aware scene, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are debriefed by Dep. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) — in and of itself a replica of a scene in the first film — who tells them how their first mission was a big success, and no one expected it, so now the department is throwing more money at them in hopes of a bigger success, and he encourages them to do ""the exact same thing."" This becomes a motif of the movie, so it knowingly replicates itself. By and large this works (both actually and in the meta sense) though there are slow parts in the beginning.Essentially, as promised at the end of the first movie, Schmidt and Jenko have to go undercover at a college to find yet another new synthetic drug. They find it a little more challenging to accomplish than last time, but ultimately they both connect with students who are connected to their only lead: Schmidt falls for an art major (Amber Stevens) while Jenko meets his twin (personality-wise) in Wyatt Russell's character, a quarterback and frat boy.Of course with any comedy sequel, doing ""the exact same thing"" puts the movie at risk for getting stale. ""The Hangover: Part 2"" is a prime example of trotting out the same exact formula and failing miserably. ""22 Jump Street"" counters this problem by laughing at itself a lot and going over the top with the repetitive, familiar scenes, such as whenever Schmidt and Jenko fight with each other and go off on their own. It also stays fresh just by the extent to which it copies stuff from the first movie and does so while winking at the camera.In order for this to really work, however, the foundation still has to be solid and Hill and Tatum provide that effortlessly. Their chemistry maintains interest in the story even though the story has no interest in taking itself seriously. Tatum was a secret weapon the first time around, as no one had seen him do comedy like this, but he still pulls off the meat-headed pretty boy man- child while Hill does his improvisation thing and proves why he's the class of the Judd Apatow prodigies.The supporting cast doesn't add much (Ice Cube is what you'd expect) though Jillian Bell's dry deadpan evokes some Kristen Wiig before she became a star.So why can't this type of comedy sequel be replicated ever again? Not every would-be comedy franchise can just make fun of itself in this meta way and poke fun at sequels in general. And the truth is that doing so was the difference-maker. Without an action scene, for example, in which the main characters are trying to outrun drug dealers in a football helmet golf cart and avoiding hitting stuff because too much wreckage will ""cost the department too much money,"" it's just a dumb chase scene. ""22 Jump Street"" would've surprised and impressed very few people without these twists. And now that the meta card has been played, it's hard to envision a third ""Jump Street"" as good as the first two. You can't just play another and surprise anyone. Perhaps that's why we get a highly amusing credits sequence at the end.How nice, however, to tell that a sequel really tried to be better and conveyed that to the audience. Rather than just throw something together to take advantage of the comedy sequel cash cow, Bacall, Hill, Lord, Miller and the other screenwriters really put some intelligence into making ""22 Jump Street"" and the genre is better for it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

22 Jump Street- A laugh-a-thon,"22 Jump Street (August 2014) A sequel to the movie 21 Jump street, 22 Jump street is a no brainer yet highly entertaining movie. The dynamic duo of unlikely cops Shmidt(Jonah Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) sets the stage ablaze with their rib- tickling antics. Their sizzling chemistry and bromance is the highlight of the movie and creates several comical and amusing situations with events constantly testing their relationship. Shmidt in particular takes the hilariousness of the movie to a whole new level constantly making the audience burst out with laughter with his childishly innocent acts. Script wise the movie is very similar to it's prequel 21 Jump street with the lead pair sent into college as under- cover cops to unravel the drug cartel operating in the college selling the dangerous drug ""Whyphy"". Captain Dickson(Ice Cube) playing the not-so-cop-like Mission chief and the deceivingly innocent Mercedes(Jillian Bell) add to the laugh riot by being involved in a flurry of funny situations right throughout the movie. Kudos to directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller for this amazingly directed comedy during which one just can't stop laughing. Brownie points for the ending credits which give us a glimpse of what to expect from the franchise in the upcoming years and ensures that the movie is entertaining to the very hilt right till the end.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Puerile, unfunny nonsense","I'm afraid I have to trash this movie. I hated it. I'm angry at myself for sitting through the whole thing even though I realised after two minutes that I hated it.The only scene I truly enjoyed was the fight scene between Jillian Bell and Jonah Hill. In my books, Bell was the only truly funny person in this movie.I found the bromance relationships between Schmidt and Jenko, and then between Jenko and Zook, to be forced and unrealistic. In the end the making fun of homoeroticism made me uncomfortable. Look, it's like they're gay! Why is that so funny? It's not. The bantering between them was ridiculous.The relationship between Maya and Schmidt was absurd. The Captain Dickson character didn't work for me at all. I wanted him to stop. I couldn't figure out what that police complex was about. Why was Jenko like some Terminator Spiderman guy? I don't know. So many questions.This is yet another American movie to portray college life like some orgiastic drink-and-drug fest. It's not like that.The students in this movie were too old to be playing their parts. The jokes about Schmidt and Jenko being too old fell flat because of it.It's derisory that this movie currently gets 8 on IMDb.com. It's worth about a 4. I'd bump it up to 5 to acknowledge the scenes with Bell, but then when I think about wasting two hours watching this movie it makes me angry, so I'm lowering that back down to 4. Maybe you have to see the first movie to get this one, but I definitely won't see it now.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A sequel that is greater than the original - quite uncommon,"When I saw that this film was announced, I had the same mixed feelings as I always do when a sequel to a film I really loved is announced. Mixed feelings of excitement (as the original film was excellent) and fear (that the sequel will disappoint). 21 Jump Street I found was an excellent film - very funny and showcased marvellous chemistry between a pair of actors that previously I certainly would have never imagined would fit together in a film. So when 22 Jump Street came out, naturally I experienced these same emotions. It's great that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are reuniting as Officer Schmidt (alias Doug) and Officer Jenko (alias Brad) - but surely the new film couldn't improve on the original?I am delighted to announce that I was completely wrong. 22 Jump Street simply improves the fantastic chemistry between Hill and Tatum. The brilliantly awkward moments the two characters find themselves are somehow even more awkward than the ones experienced in 21 Jump Street, whilst still offering a strong story to boot. In my opinion, the supporting characters in this film were generally stronger and offered more comical lines, so there is less over-emphasis on Hill and Tatum. Sceptics may suggest that the sequel is simply the original film set in a college rather than a high school. This is not the case at all - with just as many twists as the original that shape the plot in unexpected ways, it is just wrong to claim that the films are the same story in a different setting.No film is perfect and 22 Jump Street is no exception, but the problems are few and far between. For example, as is often the case with films of this genre, some of the 'solutions' to problems Schmidt and Jenko arrive at are rather far-fetched, more so than 21 Jump Street. In all honesty though, I can't fault the film for much else, and off the top of my head, I can find no more issues with the film. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, and are worried the sequel will disappoint, don't worry. You will love 22 Jump Street, I guarantee it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It's College Time!,"22 Jump Street is the sequel to the surprise 2012 smash hit, 21 Jump Street. Just like the first film, the sequel is an action-comedy that takes place in college this time. It has a similar feel to the first film, but that is forgiven because this film is so massively entertaining and action-packed. The chemistry between Tatum and Hill is once again outstanding and their witty one-liners are the best. Also stay for the end credits, because even the credits manage to bring some hilarious moments.Phil Lord and Christopher Miller return to the sequel where Jenko and Schmidt are returning to Jump Street, but this time as members of a college. Once in college, their partnership is questioned when Jenko joins the football team and meets a new friend and when Schmidt joins the art department and falls in love. Despite this, they must somehow infiltrate a drug operation being ran on campus.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return to their respective roles and once again impressed me with their amazing chemistry. They are really funny and provided some good action scenes. I also liked the throwback jokes to Tatum's early acting career. Ice Cube as Captain Dickson was just mind-blowing funny. I also liked Jillian Bell as one of the students on campus. Just creepy funny she was.Overall, 22 Jump Street is just as good as the film which made this sequel happen. There is a little nostalgia factor added into the movie, but there is no resisting how awesome this movie is. The movie is just worth it alone of checking out the antics of the main actors. I really hope there is a sequel or thirty of them.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I couldn't believe how idiotic some scenes were and that really ruined whole movie. It was somehow bearable to watch (2-3 really good jokes were funny but it could give so much more) until the final shoot out. I really don't see who would find that funny.All in all, the movie had great potential but is seems to me that makers wanted ""jokes"" to be too ""retarded"" (that is really only word to describe what I saw).

Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill Do Not Infiltrate the Dealer; Find the Supplier,"Honestly, this movie was much funnier than I expected.

There was one moment where two characters met for the first time and they literally were talking about ""meat q-ts"" and I was the only person laughing over their meet cute. That being said, there were some things that could have been done better, and the supplier was slightly predictable.

As good as the first,"There isn't a fourth wall in this movie. It's gone.So 22 Jump Street is the second movie directed by Phil Lord & Chris Miller to come out this year. The other being The LEGO Movie. It's also the sequel to the reboot of 21 Jump Street. Is it as funny as the first?Yes. Yes it is.The characters of this movie are pure gold and you can't help but love every single one of them. That even includes the antagonists because nearly every person in this movie get's funny stuff to say. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum reprise their roles and do it perfectly all over again. Nearly every joke hits perfectly. Especially a scene where Jonah Hill and the antagonist are trying to fight but keep stopping to argue over what they're doing.The movie follows the same story as the first one and shoves it down your throat that it's doing so. Though there is a slight twist as to who the bad guy is. Besides that it follows everything. They get to college, one is having more fun than the other, they argue, they make up, they stop the bad guy.I was kinda skeptic to see this because there were lots of movie coming out that had my attention more than this one but I can say for a fact that I'm very happy I went to see this. I know I'm super late with this review but I had other stuff I wanted to see.There's a scene in this movie where Ice Cube freaks out because of something Jonah Hill did during the mission that had me fighting back tears from laughing so hard. He might make the most fourth wall jokes besides the police chief. All of them are very very funny.A great comedy with two actors that share perfect chemistry.I gave it an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 With a Bullet,"Sometimes, after you've transcended the reality of physical existence; experienced two-faced deception from a companion and witnessed a 500 foot monster lay waste to the western seaboard, you're ready to sit down in front of a balls-out comedy and laugh your a** off. Enter 22 Jump Street, the latest somewhat manic creation directed by the somewhat manic Phil Lord and Chris Miller of 21 J.St., Meatballs and Lego fame. There's no rocket science going on here, but the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum carries the film, delivering belly laughs aplenty. The screenplay by Michael Bacal (Scott Pilgrim, Project X, 21 J.St.), Rodney Rothman (Grudge Match) and Oren Uziel is chock full of side references, adopting a heavily meta approach that is not new, but has never been so blatant or effective (staying through the end credits is essential). The script on its own could not carry this, and the 'waffer-thin' plot verges on insulting, but that is not the point of course, it's all about the gags and Hill & Tatum deliver these with gusto as their relationship is put under the spotlight to hilarious effect. Lord & Miller deliver a pacey, punchy film that is just plain funnier than any other comedy this year. It's perhaps a tad baggy in places and suffers slightly from a couple of gags stretching beyond the punch line (you know, that awkward moment of standing looking at each other for an instant), but this never detracts from the whole, which sweeps logic and structure aside in a glorious typhoon of uproarious laughter.

"For once, the sequel is ACTUALLY better and great as the first!","21 Jump Street was indeed an hilarious reboot of the 80's teen cop drama, it packed more laughs and action in ways you wouldn't expect it! It's latest sequel however goes bigger, funnier and even strives to be better than the first (and that's even rare for sequels in films, most fail or even get a so-so approval).Following their success in busting the high school drug investigation, our lovable but clumsy heroes Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are assigned to another case of drug trafficking but in collage. Thinking its the same case as their first, they attempt to find the source that leads them to the person responsible but even though they are undercover as college students, they find themselves in some hilarious, emotional and even confronting moments in the process!What makes 22JS so much better is the strong comedic chemistry that Hill and Tatum bring together, they aim themselves to keep the humour going with a strong flow and know when it is needed. The directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (returning from 21 Jump Street and even The Lego Movie) give detail to the comedy genre as seen in 21JS, they have a strong way of delivering the film's structure and what it is aiming for. The supporting cast too does give all their best and in particular it's Ice Cube (yep, returning from the first movie) that is given much more screen time and humour throughout, and even leads to deliver 22 Jump Street's most-confronting but hilarious scene of the film (I won't give any detail of it but it's a surprise on how it's delivers).Overall, 22 Jump Street is no failure of an sequel (like The Hangover Part III) and actually proves to be stronger than its first one (which is just as funny to re-watch again and again).

college comedy,"An uplifting, not-too-serious movie about two mediocre police agents being sent back into familiar territory. Though the duo had conquered the drug scene at a prominent high school in the first movie, the next assignment to find a drug supplier and take them out at a college proved to be a lot more challenging.22 Jump Street employs many similar tactics as the first movie, adding in elements such as gratuitous sex references, party scenes, drug happenings, and improvised hilarity. The approach taken by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to maintain a similar formula as the first movie actually rendered pretty successful. The linearity of the plot line, again, followed a similar tone as the first movie. Though the formula was similar, the movie was able to add slight changes to continue the excitement and fun even through there was a repeated story base.Not only did the storyline retain legitimacy from the first movie, but Barry Peterson (Director of Photography), and Keith Brachmann and David Rennie (film editors) did a fabulous job at keeping the action high paced, but congruent with the flow of the story. The makers of 22 Jump Street knew the demographics of their viewers to a very precise account, and catered to it accordingly. From big chested college broads to homo-erotic fraternity gestures, the film crew did their homework. As a college student and fraternity member myself, I can say positively that the crew's work in 22 Jump Street examples the exact stereotypes of college life, while adding in their own unique flair.While the overall flow of the movie has an intensely unrealistic tone, the believability of the characters undertone keeps the interest of the viewers. The relationship between the main duo allows the atmosphere of the sets to get wild and frantic while still keeping some sense of realism. Overall, this movie is a great adventure for those that are looking for something a little more light-hearted, and are willing to go about a movie a little less seriously than most.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Gayest movie since Brokeback. Laughs are few and far between.,"While this movie did make me laugh a couple of times, it really wasn't that great. I have to say that 21 Jump Street was way better.

There were many scenes in this movie where no one was laughing except a few 13ish year old girls... that's bad. To have an entire theater not laughing during parts that are supposed to be funny is not a good sign. A few people actually walked out of the movie and never came back... I've never actually seen that happen before.I'm not saying the movie was terrible, or even bad for that matter but it was definitely not very good.

This has got me laughing my pants off!,"Before I went to go and watch this movie; I will be honest - I was a bit hesitant. I wasn't sure if it could live up to it's first film (21 Jump Street). Especially when it comes to comedic movies, it's hard to surpass the first result. However, the powerful duo (Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum) pulled it through. These two were meant to be put together for such films. They made it happen, along with the other side characters such as, Ice Cube, his daughter in the movie, etc. The acting was pretty great. Yes, it's no movie that requires much thinking or one that will leave you speechless at the end, and such. However, it's a touching & funny film that had (and still will have) the whole crowd laughing crazily. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, from the very start of the movie, hooked the audience by their antics and hilarious disputes/conversations. The side characters acting skills were just as amazing - they, too, have you laughing your pants off. The setting was pretty cool, and the soundtrack (although too mainstream for me), did add to the adrenaline the viewers felt throughout the film. It was entertainment, and a party at the same time.

Self-aware comedy in the last place you'd expect.,"Going into this movie, I was pretty skeptical of a sequel's ability to repeat 21 Jump Street's formula - relatively straightforward, slapstick, often crude humor - and come up with something that still entertains. The weaker segments of this movie are indeed the ones where the writers attempt to do exactly this. Some of the film's final act feels rather humorless compared to prior sequences because it draws most of its humor from the already well-developed joke that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are mismatched.This is a shame because the rest of the film is brilliant in balancing a varied palette of humor, ranging from well-executed slapstick in the vein of 21 Jump Street, hilarious performances from the entire cast (particularly Ice Cube, whose menacing glare never gets old), and the film's strongest selling point: self-referential humor. A number of scenes or plot devices are of deliberately low quality, which Hill and Tatum point out in apparently clumsy dialogue that lampoons the haste of many studios to rush out sequels. The police force's upper ranks, likewise, become stand-ins for the producers of the film itself as their concerns over a scarce budget and audiences' desire for continuity in sequels directly affect the assignments of the main characters. Another notable running joke is the relationship between Tatum and Hill's characters, whose ups and downs mimic that of a romantic partnership in very deliberate ways. Though this joke threatens to grow old, the film plays off it in a variety of entertaining ways, parodying famous romances (one reference to Annie Hall was perhaps my favorite moment) and stretching it with increasingly complex analogies that keep the trope fresh.22 Jump Street does best when it doesn't try to be 21 Jump Street, which is fortunately quite often - its relentless mockery of sequels explicitly distances itself from its predecessor. Admittedly, it cannot at times resist using the same devices and style of humor as 21 Jump Street, but it does so as part of an unexpectedly wide arsenal of jokes that ensures that nothing bores the audience.

""22 Jump Street"" mostly just ignores its plot (which is...better?) and mixes it up a little. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are also way better in this sequel. In the original there wasn't much chemistry and they didn't exactly play off each other well. Here they're clearly improvising more and they basically make the scenes go whichever way they please.

In several parts of the movie the ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"" can easily kill each other, but of course there is some cheesy action sequence where everyone manages to somehow live. One of many examples would be the time where they non-nonchalantly blow their cover and try to get into a fist fight with armed men, which seems horribly stupid and unrealistic since they are supposed to be trained undercover cops.This is an over-hyped cookie cutter comedy with a few interesting twists, but sadly falls short and ends up being more of the typically forgettable formulaic Hollywood bullshit.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not as funny as the original movie but it still delivers the laughs.,"'22 JUMP STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again team up for this buddy cop sequel, to the 2012 hit '21 JUMP STREET' (loosely based on the 80s TV show of the same name). It was once again written by Hill and Michael Bacall, this time along with Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller returned to direct the movie; they've gained a lot more celebrity status since directing the first one, for directing and co-writing 'THE LEGO MOVIE' (released earlier this year). I don't think this installment is as consistently funny (or as well made) as the original but it still has a ton of great laughs.The sequel has Officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) now going undercover as college students (as opposed to high school ones, like in the first movie) to catch the drug supplier of a new deadly drug called 'WHYPHY'. Also unlike the first movie Jenko is now the popular student, once again (and becomes really good at football), and Schmidt is a picked on nerd, once again. Jenko also makes friends with a jock named Zook (Wyatt Russell) while Schmidt starts to develop a romantic relationship with an art student named Mercedes (Jillian Bell). The two grow further and further apart while also blowing their case. Ice Cube, Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco also reprise their roles from the first movie.The film is of course, once again, all about Schmidt and Jenko's relationship and how it's jeopardized by their new fake identities (returning to school life). Hill (like his buddy Seth Rogen) is a master at these exaggerated male (friend) relationship movies. The story is pretty predictable, and it is kind of just a rehash of the original movie, but there's still a lot of great jokes and Hill and Tatum have beautiful chemistry together (once again). People, that are looking forward to seeing a movie like this, should know to expect a male bonding (spoof) commentary with lots of silly jokes (mostly gay or 'not gay' ones). It's not as funny as the original movie but it still delivers the laughs; they're just a little more hit-and-miss this time. More hit than miss though (once again).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2f4dnLXvGI",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Lord and Miller Strike Comedy Gold,"What a pleasant surprise this is and a joy! 21 Jump Street was also an unexpected treat, because truth be told it did not look as though it had enough comedic potential for a feature length film. The director duo, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, have proved themselves worthy of comedies for the younger generation with The Lego Movie which was released this year as well. Yet for the adolescents their footing comes much more naturally.22 Jump Street takes place after the events of 21; Jenko and Schmidt have successfully brought down the destruction of the drug HFS at a high school. They saved the damsel in distress (Brie Larson) who added warmth and fire to the film. Then proceeded to stop Mr Walters and Eric from getting out of the drug charges; they now share a cell together – much to Eric's annoyance. This provides an exceptional end credits scene, so be sure not to leave until the curtains are closed.In 22, Jenko and Schmidt are enrolled into college by Captain Dickson, played with laugh-a-second gags by Ice Cube. They yet again have to stop a drug known as the street name WHYPHS (the unabbreviated version is hilarious), which when spoken sounds similar to Wi-Fi. So in terms of the plot and structure there is little difference to this film and its predecessor. It has the same bromance theme – helped tremendously by Schmidt and Jenko's chemistry and likability; which shine here. There are car chases and numerous action scenes; this is more of a buddy-cop film than the first, but I'm not complaining. We also get another romance between Schmidt and Maya (Amber Stevens). This sadly, feels out of place and taped in at the last minute, only to serve as conflict towards Schmidt and Jenko's appreciation for each other. It begs comparison between Molly and Schmidt in the previous film and the romance here feels forced and under-developed.What it comes down to is that this is more of the same – if you liked the first, you'll enjoy this more and if you didn't then you will dislike it. But, you probably already know if this film is for you, however if you are unsure I implore you to watch it. Overall, the film is funnier, alas this sometimes comes at the expense of the film's heart – something had to give. The jokes come thick and fast, at several points I had to hold on to my belly in fear that I might just die from laughing. Ice Cube gets a supporting role this time, rather than the almost cameo appearance he had in 21. This is definitely the film's strongest point and it utilises it to the max. He gets the broadest laughs and I can only hope he has even more screen time in the inevitable 23 Jump Street.Yet, one of the greatest elements about this film is how knowing and self-aware it all is. It is as if the directors are winking at the audience, and this does not come across as cheesy, which it could easily have done if not handled with care. There are nods at other franchises, gags about clichés (""the girl always gets kidnapped"") which are turned on its head. Jokes about how this will not be as good or as fun as last time. Yet, for all the times that the film says it won't be as awesome as the last, this is not the case and I am all the more happy for it.If you thought that Lord and Miller might have lost their touch after delving into kiddie fare, then rest assured this instalment is as great as if not funnier and better than the last. This is one of the best comedies in years, I am sure it will stand the test of time like Shaun of the Dead will. It has the potential to be as outrageously hilarious as Pegg and Frost's Cornetto trilogy. This outing proves that the director duo is more than up to the challenge.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious and Action-Packed,"""22 Jump Street"" is a delightful sequel that manages to outshine its predecessor in both humor and action. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film reunites the dynamic duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, who once again portray undercover cops Schmidt and Jenko. This time, they head to college to crack another case, and the result is a brilliant mix of comedy, clever writing, and high-octane scenes. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is electric, leading to laugh-out-loud moments and memorable one-liners. The film not only delivers on the expected comedic antics but also explores themes of friendship and identity, making it more than just a typical buddy cop movie. With its self-referential style and a ton of chase sequences, ""22 Jump Street"" keeps you entertained from start to finish.

Even worse than Pineapple Express,"I got about 30 minutes into this and was all but throwing the remote at the TV in sheer exasperation at the ridiculous, but never funny, story line. OK, so we have the same two idiots in the same situation doing the same stupid stuff and ha ha ha. Seriously, if your idea of funny is watching two guys shouting 'I'M ON DRUGS!!!' then you're either a moron or you've never done drugs because that's really not how people behave. The bormance between the two of them is handled so poorly that it borders of homophobia too. This is an ugly film made by people with no sense of humour or subtlety. It might appeal to emotionally stunted 14 year olds, but if you want to see a buddy flick about a pair of screw-ups, go buy a Cheech and Chong movie.I mentioned the dreadful Pineapple Express because this piece of crap uses the same 'It's not funny, but if we shout the lines then it becomes funny' trick and it fails and fails badly.I sat through this purely because I try to be honest about any movie I've reviewed instead of giving up and assuming it's garbage on the strength of the first bit, but I was in pain by the end of this and I really, really hope that the threat of another movie in the shape of 23 Jump Street never materialises.One of the very worst films I've ever watched.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Just as Fun as the Original,"22 Jump Street series is a nice addition to the Jump Street universe, a self aware sequel that moves the Narcs onto the horrors of University. Although not as realistic or as entertaining as the first movie's setting (though Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill did not remotely resemble even 22 year olds in high school) it was more funny and the college setting was more extravagant in a self aware way so much that the Korean Church police headquarters becomes better and Ice Cube says that it is due to a higher budget. The action wasn't as fun as the first film but in terms of the ending man the helicopter ride the Mexican setting everything was pitch perfect there was even a certain car that is worth seeing.

A Worthy Sequel to the 1st Surprise Comedy Hit,"I'll keep this simple from the start: if you enjoyed 21 JUMP STREET (the 2012 movie, not the TV show it was based on), then there's a good chance you'll find enough to enjoy about 22 JUMP STREET to make a viewing worth your while. There isn't a whole lot different between the two movies. The meta-humor is refocused on the fact that this is a sequel and the ""bromance"" has evolved to the next level but, otherwise, these movies are nearly the same beats. Some would find problems with this (because it's not the most creative way to handle a sequel) and normally I would agree but what can I say? I bought into it. I had fun. At the end of 21 JUMP STREET, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) promised the next case would send Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) to college. After a failed undercover case to remind us that these two aren't ready for real-world criminal justice, the pair are dropped into college to engage in literally the same premise as the first film. The two of them resume of their previous identities as the McQuaid brothers and are enrolled in college to locate the dealers and find the suppliers of the campus' latest drug craze, WhyPhy. The question is: having never had the chance to experience college for themselves, can Jenko and Schmidt maintain their cover and solve the case without going too deep and losing themselves in a world of fraternities and parties?I'm finding it hard to comment on 22 JUMP STREET without just copying/pasting everything I thought about the first movie. It's one of the main gags scattered throughout the film (the concept of essentially doing the same thing all over again to placate the audience) but, whereas I thought the movie would deviate a bit from the normal formula, it instead follows right along with what it promised. A lot of the story beats are pretty much identical to Jenko and Schmidt's adventure in high school with a few updates. The partners find themselves at odds (again) and drawn to different cliques of school life (again). This time, it's a little easier to accept as Jenko blends into the jock crowd as a star football player and Schmidt finds acceptance in the liberal arts crowd. The bromance between the two reaches new levels as the movie brings them to the point where they contemplate whether they're right for each other. Should they ""break up""? Cue the drama. Still, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are a talented duo and they know how to handle it, bringing out the inherent funny while Tatum and Hill's natural buddy chemistry makes it all work perfectly. There's no denying that these two are a perfect team and Tatum continues to display comedic chops he doesn't often get to utilize. As basic as the story is, it's these two that continue to make the Jump Street movies so much fun to watch. Two movies in, and I'm not tired of them yet.Whereas most of the movie recycles heavily from the first film, it doesn't forget to inject some new blood into the movie. Ice Cube's role as Captain Dickson, head of the Jump Street department, is expanded and I love it. Peter Stormare has a minor role as a black market dealer known as ""the Ghost"" and doesn't get much to do but the behind- the-scenes footage shows how much fun he was having fun on set. The movie's breakout performance comes from Jillian Bell as Mercedes, the roommate to Schmidt's new ""girlfriend"". Bell has a talent for improv comedy that allows her to not only keep pace with Hill in their scenes together but even surpass him for most of them. She's great and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her. As good as Bell is, the movie is lacking a villain as fun as Rob Riggle from 21 JUMP STREET as Mr. Walters. The best part of this sequel is a scene where Jenko and Schmidt go to prison for a Hannibal Lector homage where they interview Mr. Walters (now missing his manhood and embracing his newwomanhood) for clues on where to find their culprit. Despite its flaws, 22 JUMP STREET is a worthwhile sequel to the original surprise comedy hit. It maintains the same level of fun, the gags are just as unrelenting, and most of the jokes land. I reiterate: if you enjoyed the first 21 JUMP STREET (as I did), then this movie is a no-brainer and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It was not hard to know in advance what was going to happen, almost scene by scene.So if you want some good laughs, rent the DVD. It is worth it. Alone, with someone else, sober, drunk, doesn't matter. There is at least one scene in which you'll feel like you're going to get sick from so much laughing.

I won't go so far as claim there are dramatic moments, but it is realistic and sweet even though it's silly.As the end of the first movie promised, undercover agents Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill go to college for their next assignment. Sent to find the dealer of a new on-campus intense drug ""WhyPhy,"" they soon split off in different directions. Tatum joins a fraternity and the football team, and Hill falls for a beautiful art major (Amber Stevens West) he meets at a poetry slam. Taking different paths takes a toll on their friendship, and the bickering ""couple"" makes us laugh during every minute.

It might help if you are familiar with some pop culture, as the movie is filled to bursting with quick little Easter eggs and references that are 'blink and miss it' types.It also revels in taking movie cliches and flipping them on their head for yuks, like a ""fight"" scene where Jonah Hill's character Schmidt is intensely uncomfortable when one of the villains repeatedly believes the fight is about to degenerate into a sexy Mr. and Mrs. Smith battle-to-bedroom make out session or when Channing Tatum's Jenko drops his Q-Tip into another guy's meat sandwich and they gleefully declare that they are sharing a ""meat-qute,"" a term for the scene in romantic comedies when the couple to be first meet each other in a cute and humorous way.The movie never takes itself seriously, constantly making fun of itself, the previous movie, or other works the cast have been in; the last ten minutes of run time are devoted to absurd ideas for the next few hundred incarnations of the series, all but slamming the door on the idea of making any more while still managing to be suspiciously reminiscent of other series that didn't know when to quit.I was never a fan of the original show, so I watched '21 Jump Street' reluctantly only to be pleasantly surprised at how fresh they managed to make the idea feel.

"Someone get the man some water. He's black, he's been through a lot!","The first film is this reboot of the 1980s television show 21 Jump Street was a downright awful film in my opinion. The jokes were completely over the top with male genital jokes. The end of 21 Jump Street made that film even worse. Now moving onto 22 Jump Street. I went into the film thinking it would be as bad as the first film, yet I was surprised that they dialed down the useless comedy, and thus made a better overall film. This is my review of 22 Jump Street.The story for these films are fairly basic. Two friends and co-workers Schmidt(Johan Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) have to infiltrate a high school, in this film a college, to find the suppliers of dangerous drugs. So in this sequel nothing really changes in that regard. The jokes are also turned down a notch in this film, which is a plus in my book because the previous film went overboard on male genital jokes. The jokes in this film are mostly generic and not funny, but I did find myself laughing at times, and much more compared to the first film. The film mostly moves by fairly quickly at that. With a run-time of one hour and forty five minutes(without credits) I never found myself looking down at my watch.The directing of the film wasn't anything special. The bigger action scenes are clearly CG, and aren't very good CG at that. However I can't really blame them as this is a comedy, and comedies tend to spend less than your average action film. The directors bring in a good core of actors, and while Tatum and Hill are generic with their jokes, they work very well together, and it plays well on the screen. Since the script wasn't anything to write home about I can't really blame the directors that much, but overall the film was generic all over, but thankfully they did fix a lot of the problems from the first film.Overall, this frankly is just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedies. The jokes are mainly stale, but a lot of the viewers in my age group love these films for some reason and flock to the theater to see it. If you are like that then this is an instant watch for you. If you agree with my opinions in this review, then this is a rental watch at best.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
22 Jump Street Review,"22 Jump Street, a sequel to 2012's 21 Jump Street, which was a remake of the 1981 television drama 21 Jump Street, so it's safe to say that this idea has been around the track a few times. In this episode, we find Jenko and Schmidt immediately following where we left them in 2012, to recreate the exact same story we saw two years ago with minor details tweaked here and there. In a nutshell this movie is funny, it's a mockery, it's laughing at its own stupidity, and absolutely nothing more comes from it. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return to star as the leads. Both do an excellent job, as it is clear that they now know for sure what kind of movie they are making: a movie thriving off of stupidity, and they grasp that well. Hill has his classic awkward character he often plays that is thoroughly entertaining, feeding off of a script written to match this dork of a character. As good a job as Hill does, I was honestly entertained more by Tatum's performance. The more solemn character who says just the right thing at just the right, or wrong, time is always a delight, and Tatum executes this marvelously. The two leads were great and without their willingness to do whatever it was they did during filming, this movie could have easily been horrible. In the main supporting role we find Ice Cube, who frankly pained me every time I would see him appear on screen. His character was so incredibly forced, and whether or not this was intentional, it was surely not pleasurable. Also co-starring are Jillian Bell, who was very entertaining with the short on screen time she was given, Amber Stevens, Wyatt Russell, Peter Stormare, and briefly Nick Offerman, with that identical character seen in every film of his which never fails to spark some laughter. Returning to the director's chairs are Phillip Lord and Christopher Miller, directing a script penned by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, Rodney Rothman, and star Jonah Hill. I believe the charm of this movie was a result of the latter four's work. When sitting down to write the screenplay, it is clear that the writers were well aware of the fact that they were doing a sequel to a remake of a five season, 102 episode TV show. The best part is, they grasped that. As opposed to trying to escape the fast current of making a formula sequel, they chose to hop right in and race to the front, and then mock themselves for it. Directly throwing in lines such as ""keep it like the first time"" or ""it worked the first time, so let's do the same thing"" right into the dialogue of the film. That's what this movie is all about. Sure it has characters and a storyline, but more than anything the filmmakers are taking a look at the profession they work in and what has become the easy money in that field, and then ridiculing it. The funny thing is, in doing so, they made the easy money too. I didn't particularly like this movie; I felt it went on too long and there was zero closure at the end of the film, but that doesn't really matter. This is a movie made to be stupid, and it was, and I laughed. I give 22 Jump Street a 7.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Its such a front for a gay movie seen in quite a while, quite a romancer.","Even though the movie tries to front as some kind of low rated under cover cops, its actually about two gay men having some relation issues when another man comes in between, a real 'bro'. But don't worry like all romantic movies deep love prevails...how about these quotes:""Hey, listen there's a grenade in my shorts. Can you reach it? What's that, its my dick, why is it hard? I have so much adrenaline right now"" or ""Dude, I miss you so much, man. I miss you, too."" OK, there is of course nothing wrong with it being a gay movie, but the very feeling you get when you expect it to just be another college movie, is about the same as you talking casually to some guy on a party to after a while realizing the person is actually hitting on you. It will be a very awkward experience unless you are on the same page...",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Come for the witty banter! Stay for the post-credits!,"Yes! 22 Jump Street is even better than the original movie. Or the TV show, for that matter. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have terrific chemistry, perhaps the best in comic cop movies since some guys named Gibson and Glover (over and over) were roaming the streets of LA. The laughs come fast and furious and are generally not of a PG nature, although apparently that was of no concern to the family of four behind me in the theater.Officers Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) are now enrolled in college, trying to nail down the source of a new designer drug (again) that's overtaking the campus. They remain in their high-school guises from the first film, mismatched brothers. Their handler, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), is sort of glad to see the boys again, since their previous success resulted in a huge budget increase. Which he exploits to the hilt. (I wonder if he ever did get that shark tank.)Anyway, Jenko and Schmidt try to find out where the new drug WHYPHY (""Work hard - why? Play hard - why?) is coming from. Their only lead is a photo of one student buying it from another, with one of the students later winding up dead. Jenko pals around with the jocks, which include possible suspects Zook (Wyatt Russell, Kurt's son) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), while Schmidt falls into the boho scene, meeting cute with Maya (Amber Stevens), to whom he develops a kind of liking.For those of us who thought that the title sounded pretty lame, well, it's better than ""21 Jump Street 2,"" right? And of course, this film being as self-aware as a film can be, there's a reason - Jump Street HQ is now located across the street from the old place, since the Koreans wanted their church back. Makes sense.Much of the plot does indeed follow that of the first film, but as Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) tells them, the boys should handle this case the same way they handled the high-school one. It's what the brass wants! But the taking-down-the-bad-guys plot is only window dressing for the real problem, the conflict between the partners as they discover that they've become more different than they were in ""high school."" Is it possible that they'll need to go their separate ways in order to finish this case? Will this be the last case? Well, no, that's not likely. But the first one is possible. Remember, in 21 Jump Street, somehow Schmidt was the cool guy and Jenko was the schlub who had to hang out with the AV guys (who, naturally saved the day). This time, not so much - Jenko is a BMOC, what with the being strong and apparently immune to alcohol and such. Schmidt is now the one with some doubts about their partnership, and that's the real story behind the story. He can't follow in Jenko's path, or even walk alongside him, because people like the jocks don't want him around. And suddenly Jenko sees his partner as a hindrance, someone preventing him from his true calling - football player.Much mirth is made of the similarities between the duo's partnership and a full-blown emotional relationship. At one point they even visit a psych professor (well, it's to get info about a patient who had taken WHYPHY, but still) and wind up revealing more of their feelings than they may have intended.It's hard to imagine better casting for the roles of Jenko and Schmidt. Tatum and Hill appear to have been working together for decades, honing an act to impeccable heights, so good is their banter. But the fun doesn't stop with them - Ice Cube is a terror as a father and a cop, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco happily reprise their roles from 21 Jump Street (the movie), there's another cameo of a veteran of the ""old"" TV show, and both Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell (playing Maya's roommate) are killer good. Also on hand is the usually oily Peter Stormare as, surprise, the bad guy.For whatever reason, I'm much more inclined to laugh out loud at a movie while at home than when I'm at the theater, but I couldn't stop laughing (or giggling, possibly when Jenko and Schmidt inadvertently take some of the designer drug). The movie was that funny. 22 Jump Street is definitely as good as the first, and for my money it's a step up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The best movie,"The dialogue is witty, irreverent, and consistently funny. The film masterfully satirizes college life, pop culture, and even the very concept of sequels. While primarily a comedy, the film explores themes of friendship, identity, and growing up, adding a surprising layer of emotional resonance. The film occasionally relies on predictable tropes.22 jump street is a hilarious and surprisingly poignant comedy that succeeds as both a standalone film and a worthy sequel.

Their personalities clash once more, but in a different way than the first film, and they get into even more crazy shenanigans than before. This includes having a shootout in the university library and busting a Spring Break beach party. 22 Jump Street always keeps you on edge, wondering what will happen next.This is a must see for all the fans of the first movie.

Hilarious Action-Packed Sequel,"""22 Jump Street"" proves to be just as funny as the first film and continues its strong friendship/bromance between the talented Jonah ill and Channing Tatum's characters. We get to see some new fun characters as well as a lot of the old cast (though the love interest from the previous film is never mentioned again) whether through continued contributing roles or through fun cameos. Despite the film's similarities to the first film, they do comically point that out throughout the film (especially during the ending credits).

"Too long, too little substance","There are a lot of week spots here, sadly. It's clear that ""22 Jump Street"" doesn't take itself seriously, but that doesn't make it funny.It's hard doing good a comedy. It takes good writing, timing and spot-on dialogue, none of which is present here. The film would have benefited from a shorter running time, and should perhaps have ended after the first arrestment. There's simply not enough material for the running time it has. Hill and Tatum have a few nice moments, but it's not enough and their chemistry is not very strong.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very nice,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film.Sequel to the first chapter of the two most messed up infiltrated policemen of all the police forces which manages to maintain the tenor of the first film and I consider it even better in some ways as it is also quite more laughable than the first chapter while also making fun of itself a lot. In terms of plot we are exactly like the first film and it's not that it differs greatly, but some things are added that would have made the first film better so much so that this seems more like an adjustment to the first film than a second chapter as it is almost the same but better .",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""Ya know what's not lame? Safety!""","22 Jump Street (2014)-Just like it's predecessor, this film is full of high octane comedy and action. It's tongue in cheek, full of innuendo (In your end oh!) and I love the way they break the fourth wall without even having to nod to the camera. They rip it out of themselves brilliantly.In some ways it's almost the same script used again, but they seem to get away with it, because of how it's done. The repetition of certain aspects and jokes from ""21"" adds to the hilarity too.I didn't like Wyatt Russell's (Or as my Nephew calls him ""Craptain America) character. I'm not really a fan of him as an actor and he just grinds a bit here and Mercedes is a bit annoying towards the end and not for the more obvious reasons, but everyone else is superb, especially my boy Channing (Swoon).The only reason it doesn't score higher is because it is a sequel. Some of the jokes wouldn't work so well if you don't know the first film, they'd still be good, just not brilliant. And there's still no nudity from Mr Tatum.What I absolutely do love about this film is the piece just before the end credits. I nearly wet myself with laughter at some of what they did.It's a shame that 23 Jump Street and all the other numbers never came after this one, I think the chemistry between the team, whether the writers or the actors must be fantastic to get these results.889.96/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Many scenes are too long which agfects the comedy.. It surprised me that this the same writers, it feels like a rushed sequel just for the money. Also the soundtrack is annoying but this would have been acceptable if the movie had been more funnier.

De Ja Two,"22 Jump Street is a return to Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill's Jenko and Schmidt, two polar opposite cops who, after finishing their drug bust in the high school, have been assigned a new (exactly the same) assignment in college.Before you think ""why has he rated this movie 8/10 if it's just a simple rehash of the first movie?"", I must tell you that this movie makes itself known from the start. Characters such as Ice Cube's captain and the police chief act as borderline fourth walls, doing everything but saying this movie is exactly the same as the first. But this makes it all the funnier, with new and old gags mixing together to form what some may call a parody of the original movie.The jokes in 22 Jump Street are still exceptional, being rude and crude but never offensive, even when they delve into racial stereotypes. Tatum and Hill again reprise their stellar chemistry, along with Ice Cube delivering another angry and hilarious performance.Take my word for it, you will enjoy this movie even if it is more of the same, because the ""same"" was already brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

When Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team and Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art-major scene, both men begin to question their partnership. Not only do they have to crack the case, but now the two overgrown adolescents must learn how to behave like adults is good. Overall, I recommend it. Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Lame sequel,"To begin, I have to say that I didn't expect much from the first movie in this series, 21 Jump Street, but was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. When I saw that this movie had a such a high rating here on IMDb (8.4 when I first looked up this movie), I asked myself 'is it possible that a sequel turned out to be as good as its predecessor?' Well, it turns out that no, not in this case, and I was very confused by how this movie got such a high rating.I think just about everything about this movie is lame, forced or a cliché. The dialog is cringe-worthy and the story is unoriginal, essentially just trying to capitalize on the success of the first movie. I give this movie a 3, which is the number of things I found funny in it. One of those was the closing credits, which I did enjoy very much. Another was the expression on Ice Cube's face after the discovery of a certain situation. A couple of other scenes made me smile, but that's about it.My recommendation is that if you do watch this, just skip to the end credits.

"Self-Aware, Satirical, And Exactly the Same","Schmidt and Jenko are back to fulfil the promise at the end of the first movie; that they'd next be going to college. It turns out this meant online courses in order to intercept smuggling codes, but it's not long until the promise of watching Schmidt and Jenko navigate actual college is met. They're on the case of another new drug running rampant across the campus called WHYPHY; Work Hard? Yes. Play Hard? Yes. (probably the cleverest name for a drug I've ever heard), which has already claimed the life of a young student. Their bromance is tested, they get wrapped up in frat initiations and extracurricular activities, and experience every facet of college living, before the final showdown during spring break.22 Jump Street is a sequel that knows it's a sequel, and takes every opportunity to let you know that it knows. A large portion of the humour revolves around this self-awareness, pointing out how everything's going to be exactly the same as the first time, or jokingly teasing a third movie (and beyond). But there are other packets of humour around as well, including the return of digging into them over their age, likening their professional partnership to a romantic coupling, and of course a wealth of references and homages to other slices of pop culture, including Tatum's role in White House Down, Hill's role as a surrogate Seth Rogan in Superbad, Benny Hill, NWA and Ice Cube's career, Batman's choice of transportation etc etc. Clear comedy highlights for me included Channing Tatum's complete dedication to Jenko's penny drop moment in the office, the end credits full of posters and teasers for fake sequels, and the awkward kiss fight between Schmidt and Mercedes. In all three cases, the skits go on for just as long as they need to, pushing the boundaries of what might be considered too long, but remaining funny enough throughout that you only crave more once they finish.And honestly that's there really is to say about this movie. It's nose-snortingly laugh-out-loud hilarious from beginning to end. It's remarkably clever and self-aware, and never outstays its welcome. It even shows some flashes of cinematic brilliance such as the tripping scene, but of course it's a shallow movie that's just fine for how shallow it is. There's a joke or a reference every minute so it's easy to miss a bunch just through sheer laughter. I give it a solid 8/10, especially for a comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

In the very beginning, they make it very clear that they know they're making the same movie again. This makes for much needed self awareness and for a funny joke. Since this movie follows the formula of it's predecessor, it is very predictable, granted, but it is also filled with plenty of hilarious scenes, which is my main requirement for a comedy.

Plot seems a bit stretched and for unfunny lines we will shout them because that makes it funny. I except films and the actions of the actors will not be a mirror of real life as they would be even more boring as films but this seems to an absurd concept, I am from England so don't have a full knowledge of the American education system but sending what appears to be two blokes in their 30's back to school to be undercover police just does not work and then so fat small one copping off with a fit college girl is even more odd.

You'd better be ready to jump again,"As in the original 21 Jump Street, the social conscience and relevant topics aspect of the television series are left out again. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill after really messing up a big drug bust are back at the Jump Street program which has now moved across the street to 22 Jump Street. Their captain Ice Cube has decided the best thing for them is a trip back to college where there is a major drug problem with some new designer product.The bonds however look like they're going to fray as they gravitate to different crowds. Tatum looks like he's going to join the Animal House crowd as he gravitates to a fraternity where the stuff is known to be used. He bonds with a pair that look they could be John Belushi's brethren with Wyatt Russell and Jimmy Tatro.Who'd have thunk it with Channing Tatum in the film that Jonah Hill would get the girl. Hill gets himself involved with a literary crowd, some poetry slammers and Amber Hill. Of all the young women in the world how did he wind up nailing his captain's daughter?The comedy is straight out of Animal House and there's certain enough action to satisfy those of the movie-going public who prefer that.

waste of time,"I kept fast forwarding until at least the half way point before it stopped being too stupid or boring. The rest of if was sophomoric at best. The gratuitous swearing by the Captain was indicative of the rather juvenile scripting. It'll be tough to write ten lines of text without getting down to the movie's level of vapid spew or sleep inducing text. I realize this is not an Oscar level piece of film, but they could have at least done a better job of it. This makes Mall Cop and Furry Vengeance look like a Masterpiece Theater offering. The basic story line of mismatched partners doing undercover work to catch the bad guys is a well proved armature to hang your script on.

A poor and lazy replica of the first one,"In the movie the characters made a point to state that: ""it's the same case"", and it truly was the same formula, but much, much worse.How many times is an actor going to use the plot of a movie to pair himself with attractive younger women? Jonah Hill using his influence to prey on young women was a huge reason this movie was awful.In the first movie it passed, I even found it romantic with a properly developed story, but this time? Straight jumping in the bed with the most atractive possible young woman around? After 30 seconds of trying, when he is not attractive nor charismatic. Don't get me wrong, the underdog side of it was the thing I liked the most about the first movie, just a nerdy guy with good intentions landing the hot chick, this wasn't it.Sure, the outcome was funny, kinda... one of the very few funny moments in the movie, but come on, Jonah Hill was on his Harvey Weinstein stuff.The whole movie is a mess, throwing childish jokes around desperately hoping for one of them to land, and they rarely did.Got nothing against comedies, even ridiculous, childish ones, my poor rating is not about that, the movie simply isn't good, in fact, it's terrible.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Cheap, boringly shot, bad as a stand-alone film and a sequel.","This film is cheap in so many ways. I review based on quality of film rather than personal enjoyment (though there may be some bias) I will say, this is one film I really did not enjoy watching however. I will list some bellow:1) It likes to reference itself way too much. Once or twice is tolerable, yet I'm not sure what it's going for here. The first movie is somewhat slapstick satire of high schools. This one is satire of itself? There is one stage we're they run through some statues and was like ""why so expensive?"" I don't mind this when done right, but it clashes so much with the plot. Either go all out, or don't at all. I also found the ""posters"" at the credits cringy and and a bit pretentious. It felt like ""oh you can't criticise us because the whole movie is a dumb joke"" when it's just dumb.2) The plot is terrible. It just goes back to what it was critiquing in the first. I hated the collage aspect as it was used so poorly. I'm not saying characters have to be realistic, but they seem so Hollywood fake opposed to the first film, where they seem more exaggerated. I realise I am referring to the first film often, but I think it's more to compare standard. The film's plot is terrible as a stand-alone as well. Also this film goes off the idea that it is a sequel.3) Shots are basic and boring as well as hahaha. There is nothing new or interesting here, it's trying to poke fun at cliche gags and stunts done in Hollywood by replicating them? It doesn't make sense. They seemed like things I have seen millions of times, done in a boring way. Not interesting shots etc.4)Characters are boring. They also seem to have changed (main characters) for the worse. They seem cheaper and more average protagonists characters with basic conflict levels. The side characters are completely forgettable. Humidor is subjective, but this film was barren of ""jokes"" for what I could tell.5)Its the same worse version of the first film with switched roles if you are wondering.I have it 2 stars for the formula being done to a basic standard. It has a few ok scenes that I quickly forgot about. You can watch this movie, it is terrible, but it's unlikely you will self combust within the first 30 minutes. Tbh I'm being generous with this film, I'd rather just not be with the 1 star reviews as they tend to be emotionally influenced.I do not recommend this film. The first film (21 jump street) is ok and I recommend it for some cheap laughs. (I don't see that as a bad thing btw)",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Mediocre at best; not even close the incredible laugh-out-loud madness that was the first part.,"A really terrible sequel compared to the first part. It's just likable in a mediocre sort of way. It tries way too hard to show that it's not trying that hard to be unique or different from the first one, which feels really lame. Most of the jokes seem too silly or repeated. The only memorable scene is where Channing Tatum couldn't stop laughing after he finds out that Jonah Hill is sleeping around with their Captain's daughter. Even the weird and mouthy character who's Maya's roommate was interesting and funny. Other than that, the movie seemed like a bore, and not even close the incredible laugh-out-loud madness that was the first part. The end credits were somewhat amusing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Better than the first, but that's it","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have been called transgressive directors, who bring movies in Hollywood format and at the same time spread an anti-capitalist message in a subliminal way. That might be said of The Lego Movie for example, but even in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs it is possible - with some imagination - to find this ""hidden message"". I, on the contrary, tend to agree with John Podhoretz, a conservative and republican journalist for The Weekly Standard who dismissed all the liberal (in the American way) and anti-capitalist interpretations of The Lego Movie and said they all fell into a marketing trap. 'Cause in the end it is the Lego Group who profit and the anti-capitalist who pays and spreads the word of the so-called subversive message, which makes other anti-capitalists pay. So that's why I, as an anarchist and anti-capitalist, won't pay to see movies of the Lord-Miller duo. I download them and rate them poorly. So suck it. In any case, while The Lego Movie was an enjoyable film, it's harder to enjoy the cynical tone and often easy humor of the Jump Street reboots. Although I must admit I did enjoy 22 Jump Street a bit more than the first one. There were some truly humorous moments which appeal to the liberal (again, in the American way) in me. But as with a lot of movies that aim at teenagers and twenty-somethings, it just fell short in so many ways that finally the short-lived moment of entertainment ended as soon as the credits rolled over the screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Copy and Paste.,Exact same as first movie same story same everything. Really unfunny and one dimensional lame characters. Movie lacks any real humor or any depth or substance.

The Vidiot Reviews...,"22 Jump StreetWhen assigning an undercover NARC to go to college, it's best if it's not a dog from the K-9 unit.Fortunately, the agents allocated in this comedy are bipedal.After failing to takedown drug czar The Ghost (Peter Stormare), Officers Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are busted back down to the Jump Street.There, their Captain (Ice Cube) tasks them with taking down the supplier of a new drug killing college students.While Jenko feels at home investigating the quarterback, an ostracized Schmidt finds solace in an art student (Amber Stevens).With a low laugh point average, this obligatory follow-up to 21 Jump Street revels in its self- awareness to the point of annoyance.Not nearly as clever or comedic as the original, 22 Jump Street becomes the asinine sequel it was trying to send-up.Incidentally, undercover cops are usually the student's bad mouthing campus security all the time.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
You will enjoy it if you liked the first one.,"21 Jump Street offered many laughs from its dynamic duo of Chaning Tatum and Jonah Hill. While it wasn't anything monumental still was great fun to watch. Now if you didn't feel the same regarding it then I advise you stay away from 22 Jump Street as its nothing more than a rehash of the plot with similar comic situations. Despite that directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who gave the wondrous Lego Movie this year) keep us engaged by making the things look very less serious and investing more in the bromantic relation between Schmidt and Jenko established in the first film.Now if you remember what Ice Cube said at the end of 21JS that "" you'll going to college "". Well that's the setting, our undercover cop- buddies need to crack down drug suppliers and dealers in a college now. The way the events unravel is almost same as the first one, still it's not boring as there are some constant gags put in every now and then. Romance again here doesn't fit nicely but there is a very surprising comic twist moment involving Jonah and Ice Cube which was really amusing. I found Ice Cube much more funny in this one. New characters are introduced but they are as interesting as Walters, Eric or Molly of first one, while the earlier two appear for brief amount of time in jail Molly is completely erased. Again the duo of Schmidt and Jenko are the standout. Even if they undergo similar situations where they have their differences for some time but at the end realize they are best buddies. There is also a cameo during the credits but its not as amazing as the one in first film.Overall 22JS is pretty much entertaining but most its credit goes to the nice story established in the 21JS. Also the climax is unnecessarily dragged and quite cliché, I wished they at least come up with an unpredictable ending. The beach and spring break setting for finale doesn't match up to the stylish prom-night entry of 21JS. The credits are more hilarious and fun showing us different mock sequels of Jump Streets, do not miss them. Considering most of the positives of the film are derived from the first one and also since the first one had much better third act I will rate this slightly below the first film. Comedy wise both are enjoyable at the same level, so if you had a good time with the 21 then don't miss 22.RATING: [2.5/5]",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fun enough disposable entertainment,"Like its predecessor, 22 Jump Street is a lightweight and instantly forgettable film that manages to get enough chuckles throughout. This very self aware sequel is less than slapdash in its plotting, it's barely a functional narrative. It's mostly episodic situations that our two leads find themselves in when these two undercover buffoons go to college. This meta cash grab of a sequel is definitely lazy in the filmmaking department, but the picture is held up and watchable from the chemistry of Hill and Tatum. Tatum is especially committed to this ridiculous material and he actually has a great knack for comedy. 22 Jump Street is mindless, the plot is always secondary to the jokes and it lands just enough laughs to be worth killing some time watching it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Funny at times but it's only OK,"I can't say that I was disappointed in ""22 Jump Street"". I wasn't really a fan of the first movie so I wasn't expecting much. This movie has a likable cast (for the most part) and quite a few laughs. It's just that the writing was pretty weak. The story is a totally retread on the original movie. There were a lot of missed opportunities in this movie. ""22 Jump Street"" is an okay watch but I don't think I'll be paying it another visit. Dishonorable mention: an unfunny cameo by Rob Riggle and Dave Franco.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A simple and loud copy of #1 and they even admit it.,"You don't need to be a fan of the original series, but it does help to enjoy the movie. Part 1 succeeded in being different enough and still respecting the source material. Not saying it was a good movie, but still enjoyable.Now part 2 is not much different, yet it is. At the end of part 1 and the beginning of part 2 they even admit that this is going to be the same movie. But instead of adding something that might make this movie somehow original, they decided to make a movie built out of jokes that seem incoherent. Jokes work for 10 minutes, but they get old in this movie very soon. What doesn't help either is that they repeat the ""relation-joke"" over and over, without adding real characters or development.Personally it felt as if they didn't really write this movie, but just crammed the leftovers of part 1. Leftover; that is exactly what this movie is. The only relief are the bad guys and some comedic guest parts, because the others seem to have given up halfway this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A terrible sequel to a great movie,"22 jump street
2014
Director: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller

Cast: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare, Ice Cube and Amber Stevens West
Plot: The Team of Schmidt and Jenko are sent to a college to deal with an outbreak of a new drug. 
Review: I really didn't like this movie because everything I enjoyed from the first movie was exploited. There is a lot of unneeded gross out humor also. The direction and screenplay are horrible. The casting and acting are horrible also. I feel so sorry for Peter Stormare because he is wasted as the secondary villain. All in all I would give this zero out of a possible five stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A good sequel..,Solid story that was pretty similiar to the last movie with some reused elements but nontheless and it was thrilling and enjoyable. The music and sound choices are surprisngly good for a comedy movie movie. Good acting and dialouge. And the choreography was smooth and the effects were nice.Overall an enjoyable movie though it felt like the prequel but with more budget and a wider set of characters. Maybe to waste my time if I wanna rewatch it.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Somewhat better than I anticipated,"Generally I am far from being a big fan of modern day youth-oriented comedies, so when I sat down to watch the first ""Jump Street"" movie, I was filled with dread. To my surprise, I didn't find it so bad - it had a good amount of humorous moments that made me laugh. Despite this, I was not looking forward to this sequel, seeing how Hollywood sequels are almost always greatly inferior to the originals. But once again, I was surprised. This sequel does have some really funny moments, the best being those that poke fun of ""sequelitus"" and various movie clichés. I really got the feeling the writers were laughing out loud when writing this script, because they seemed to admit how silly this movie was. The humor isn't perfect - there is definitely an over abundance of it tied with foul language and R- rated content, which seemed to suggest the writers at times were desperate for laughs and to be ""edgy"". There is also not quite enough plot, as well as a few plot points that are not made clear. And at 111 minutes, the movie does run too long. Despite these problems, I will say this: If you liked the first movie, chances are you'll like this sequel.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A good laugh bit not memorable,"This film tells the story of two policemen going undercover in a college to investigate a drug ring.""22 Jump Street"" is a silly comedy that one cannot take seriously. The dialog is so bad that it makes my eyes roll many times! Jonah Hill's character is so stupid and incompetent, contrasting with his partner played by Tatum. Even so, Hill's character has a good side, particularly in the scene where he did stand up poems and the counselling scene when he is witty and tolerant respectively.This film provides a laugh here and there, but it will not be a memorable movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
