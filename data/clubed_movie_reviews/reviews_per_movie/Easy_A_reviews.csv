A very easy film to like,"What drew me to this film were the cast, on paper this was a great cast capable of great performances. And that's exactly the case watching Easy A. While there is nothing groundbreaking and while the cast drew me in initially the concept was a kind that was kind of interesting but could've gone either way.That said, Easy A is lushly filmed with the cinematography and colour palette simply lovely. There is also a sparkling score, a good well-paced story, strong direction and a likable assortment of characters.The two components of Easy A that really worked were the script and the cast. The script is not only fresh, but very funny too. In the cast also, I don't think there was a single cast member I didn't like, the first time in a film in a good while that's happened.Emma Stone is truly charming and a breath of fresh air, while Amanda Byrnes with her witty humour is a hoot. Stanley Tucci gives one of his better performances in recent years and Patricia Clarkson is equally delightful. Thomas Haden Church is also hilarious, and it was really nice to see Malcolm McDowell again.Overall, a funny and charming film and easy to like. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Excellent Tribute to John Hughes,"Just saw this with my daughter who is 13. She has just recently seen all the John Hughes 80's movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, etc.) and said it felt just like one of them. I couldn't agree more - great direction and just a hint of a wacky feel to it. Realistic, fun and interesting *normal* parents that don't take the world too seriously and want to be there for their kid.The only parts that didn't hold up was a couple of logistical things (like a girl that good looking not having any guys following her around, and having a best friend who is such a ditz). All in all though the plot stuck together, was edgy in a few ways, and thoroughly entertaining. I'd put it on the shelf right next to the John Hughes films, and that is a distinguished place indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very funny comedy with slightly skewed morals,"It's always nice to see a comedy that doesn't meander around the same stupid gags insulting my intelligence time and time again. I was very happy to see a different kind of teen comedy that was much more sophisticated than the films it branches from and even parodies in many creative ways. Easy A is about a typical high school girl named Olive (Emma Stone). Olive has never been popular and has never really been noticed by anyone, and I don't see why considering Emma Stone is absolutely beautiful but that's beside the point. Anyway, Olive, without thinking things through, starts a little white lie about losing her virginity. This lie spreads to the rumor mill and spreads throughout the whole school ridiculously fast, which is one of the bigger themes of this movie that focuses on a lot of the necessary flaws of high school, one of the most incessantly emotional periods of our lives. Obviously, the rumor quickly gets out of hand and Olive's reputation as the school slut grows. Instead of backing down here, Olive exploits the rumor mill for her own social and financial gain, as guys pay her to pretend to have sex with her. The themes and criticisms of high school life in this film are valid, but thankfully they aren't overbearing and the entire movie becomes a laugh out loud blast.First off, the dialouge of Easy A is surprisingly great for a film set around these kinds of teenage archetypes. It is much more intelligent sophisticated than the typical pandering you hear coming out of the mouths of teenagers. It adds a whole new level of respect to the film that keeps it very lively and fresh. But the dialouge isn't cocky, thankfully, and I never got the sense the writer was trying boast his wide vocabulary. He went a totally different route, and used it to the advantage of more characterization. Olive is much smarter than her peers and her language reflects that. There are plenty of other characters in the film that obviously don't come close to her sophisticated insight into the world and are the true bimbos and airheads. Their dialouge is much more typical of a teenager, and it reflects a very distinct level of characterization that had hilarious results. Needless to say I felt much smarter watching this film than some of the other crap I've subjected myself to in recent years.Easy A also has a great variety of characters. Olive is already a very fun character who leads the story perfectly, keeping it interesting all the way through. But then there are other characters like Amanda Bynes as Marianne, the Christian nut job of the school. It's obvious to see where a person who boasts about premarital sex versus a religious zealot is leading, and these two characters are hilarious to watch interact with all their snappy and quick witted dialouge. The male roles are arguably the weakest of the film, but its not as big of a deal when the whole story primarily focuses on the social interactions between high school girls. Gossip is obviously a huge part of the story. But apart from the younger cast the older cast also fall into some hilarious roles. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci play Olive's parents and there isn't a moment with these two on screen that you aren't laughing your head off. This duo plays off each other so well and it makes for some of the most hysterical scenes of the whole film. Then there are other great adults in the film like Thomas Haden Church as the fast talking and sarcastic English teacher who you can't help but love. Malcolm McDowell even cameos as the school's principal and has a couple of short but funny scenes. Overall you couldn't ask for a more fitting and entertaining cast.Overall, Easy A doesn't provide anything groundbreaking or revolutionary to the comedy genre, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air that keeps my hopes alive for the comedy genre in this age where there are so many god awful comedies being released. Easy A isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The story sort of becomes a mess towards the end and it seems to be going off on a lot of random tangents. And then it is all resolved rather simplistically for how all over the place it was. I also have to say that the moral compass of all these characters, especially Olive, is pretty out of wack. Some of the decisions are a little strange and seem ridiculous at times, but I guess it only reflects the naivety of a teenager, and how much we still have to learn. But overall you can't complain too much when you are delivered an overall satisfying and hilarious experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Modern day Scarlett Letter as gossip gets out of hand at Ojai High School.,"June 2 2010 - saw advanced preview of ""Easy A"" tonight. Emma Stone plays sarcasm great in this one, and supporting cast works well with her. Emma also narrates heavily throughout, and though not rolling on the floor funny, this has the feel of a John Hughes film (even makes reference to him in a longing way). Thomas Haden Church is funny as the only teacher we really meet, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are well cast as the understanding and 60's hippy mentality parents. The crowd I saw it with laughed frequently, and there are a lot of ""I've been there"" or ""I've seen that"" moments that you can relate to from your own high school. The writing is a little bit above the age - that is to say, you'd be surprised to hear the advanced dialog coming from today's teenagers, but this movie worked for me and those with me. Makes for a fun night at the movies. Scheduled for release Sept 17 2010.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Inexactitude of High School,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is an obvious (and proud of it) homage to the great teen films of John Hughes. It is updated for this generation of teens - replete with FaceBook, texting and webcam. While this one may not have the fully realized characters of the Hughes films, it actually takes things a step further in its commentary on many topics: family life, parenting, religious zealotry, rumor-mongering and the public education system.Writer Bert V. Royal's script delivers an intellectual and comedic look into high school life ... told through the eyes of the smart, ""invisible"" girl. Just a brief overview will be offered here so as not to take away from the multiple layers.Emma Stone (""Zombieland"", ""The House Bunny"") delivers a star-making performance as Olive. Forced into a faux-confession by her best friend, Olive experiences the efficiencies of digital gossip spreading as word leaks regarding the apparent loss of her ""V card"". Even though this one is based in Ojai, California, it's nice to know that high school promiscuity is still met with a certain stigma. Here that stigma is compared to Hawthorne's expert novel, The Scarlet Letter.This sets into action a series of unforeseen events. The school's religious nuts, led by Amanda Bynes, take Olive's situation as a personal affront and spend a great deal of effort trying to punish her for her sins. At the same time, the geeks and dweebs view Olive as their savior and proceed to take advantage of the opportunity.While she is presented as a very sharp-witted, well-grounded teenager, Olive experiences the enormous power of a reputation. All of this is balanced out by her extraordinary relationship with her free-spirited, yet wise parents played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci.I can't possibly do justice to the script or the numerous topics broached, but I will say that it's a welcome new approach to teen movies. The usual schlock sex is replaced by sharp quips and real pressures. Do note that the dialogue is filled with much harsh language that wouldn't be welcome in an environment other than a high school campus. Further support work is offered by Penn Badgley as the good guy, Thomas Haden Church as a new world cool teacher, Malcolm McDowell as an old school principal and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor (in a role that gives me permission to feel the disgust I usually feel when she is on screen).Don't be scared off thinking this is another lousy teen flick. It is instead an insightful comedy that plays well for adults and teens. While you may not agree with all of the social observations, I believe you will agree the film is presented in a most entertaining and insightful manner.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Solid teen rom-com even if it's a bit flawed,"Easy A is another in a long line of high school rom-coms that feature actors who are much too old for high school. It is one of those things that you have to suspend your disbelief on from the get-go, and I was almost able to do that. My only stumbling block was Emma Stone who looks exactly the same as she does now, so trying to see her as a teenager was tough. Another thing that I struggled with in this film was the frustrating portrayal of Christians. As a Christian myself, I can admit that these types of judgmental jerks exist, but sometimes it feels like that's all we see of evangelicals in film. Aside from that small clique, though, I do wonder if promiscuity is seen as such a negative among teenagers nowadays. Somehow I feel like this entire movie would be a non-story if it were to occur in the modern day. The film is almost built like a period piece set in my childhood years, or like it should be taking place in a highly conservative southern state, as homosexuality is also presented as a huge shame factor. I think all of these things are less of an issue, particularly in a California high school in the 2010s.However, if you let all the nitpicky flaws go, and just accept the movie for what it is, I found Easy A to be a rather charming and cute little film. The story draws a lot of inspiration from The Scarlet Letter, and does a great job of talking about that in the film. They aren't trying to hide what they are doing, instead it is a major plot point that the students are reading that book. I liked the acting performances, in particular all the adults in the film. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci stood out in a great way, because they play non-traditional parents that kept making me laugh. The story has a number of humorous moments, but I was always looking forward to when those two would return for extra comedy. And in addition to the jokes, Easy A has all the other things you'd expect from a teen rom-com. They have a romantic arc (even if it is a tad under-developed,) some high drama moments, and even a moral to the story. I'll also admit that, despite the fact that these movies always seem so rote to me, I was genuinely surprised a couple times with this one. Easy A might not be one of the greatest movies in its genre, but it's a solid film that I would watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A is Easy to Love....,"Lately the genre of teen comedies skew to the ribald and the are more sex romps than tell stories and introduce characters that you can not only root for but like. ""Easy A"" is a welcomed throwback to earlier teen comedies: risqué, but heartfelt.In Emma Stone you have a Molly Ringwald for a new generation: relate-able, sexy, funny, sarcastic and lovely shines as Olive, a girl who leads her best friend (Aly Michalka) to believe she wasn't a virgin. The rumor spreads about her fabled loose ways and spurs different reactions from the school population: Brandon (Dan Byrd) wants to use it to his advantage, Marianne (Amanda Bynes) the school's self-appointed religious leader wants to shame Olive and Olive decides to run with it for her own gains.There are many pluses with this film: A cast of young actors who are true actors who can convey the humor and uphold the tone of the film; a truly funny, vibrant script by Bert V. Royal in which not only the teens get to be smart and fully fleshed out characters but the adults (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's wry and whimsical parents are a joy; and Thomas Haden Church whose character is a new spin on the ""hip teacher"".) as well.With Stone as the lead and the only face in the promotional poster people may think this is a ""chick flick"" but this film is for anyone who just likes a good film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Pleasantly Surprised,"I attended a free preview of this movie and without having done any research on the movie and just based on a short synopsis, had pretty low expectations walking into the cinema. It's always great coming out of a cinema being pleasantly surprised by an enjoyable movie and that's exactly what happened! I've always been a fan of fast witty dialogue and this movie definitely delivers! Virtually every character in the movie whether minor or major seems to have something funny to say, and while there wasn't a lot of ROFL moments, there were quite a few LOL's throughout the movie! To me, it's one of those movies perfect for a Friday night to unwind from work without having to use too many brain cells (but enough so that you don't walk out of there thinking you'd wasted your time and intellect!) - it's one of those movies that i'll definitely be purchasing on DVD when it comes out!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun, hip and goofy modern comedy and '80s comedy homage","Through much of the beginning of ""Easy A,"" you have to find all the '80s teen comedy homages fishy. Maybe director Will Gluck and Burt V. Royal are trying to dress up a classic Hughesian formula with modern banter and social media references. Then, somewhere near the halfway point, comes the admission. Olive, played by up-and-comer Emma Stone, confesses she wants her life to have a ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""Breakfast Club"" or ""Say Anything"" moment. Ah, and suddenly this is homage territory -- much better. Like the rest of this hip, fun and surprisingly touching comedy, any time ""Easy A"" wanders down the path of cliché, a killer line or great scene nullifies it.It all begins and ends with Stone, who can do a little bit of everything, which ought to ensure her a long career. She can do typical teen comedy lead autopilot/earn our sympathy, she can command the improvisation-like tangential dry humor that has defined the comedies of the last five or so years and she can be the sensitive, fragile Molly Ringwald type. Nothing feels forced or unnatural in her performance. She seems to be having fun and milking to goofy nature of Royal's script.More importantly, the reason ""Easy A"" is so good is because it never stops being about Olive's story. A high school nobody, Olive lets her best friend (Alyson Michalka) pressure her into lying about losing her virginity. The simple lie gets overheard by the super-Christian Miss Everybody (Amanda Bynes) and suddenly everyone sees Olive differently, or sees her period. After deciding to embrace the attention as school slut (the story reaches here a bit), Olive then starts to pretend to have sex with guys in need of a reputation boost, which consequently sullies her own.The only real problem with ""Easy A"" is that there's no good reason to believe Stone was this unattractive nobody given her actual attractiveness and the friends she has -- and we're supposed to believe that suddenly everyone is interested in her because she lost her virginity. Gluck tries to spin this into a positive by making it almost comical how everyone is staring at her or waiting in a perfect line for her to come down the hall, but it's the one scratch in this gem -- take it or leave it. The script and humor and situations that arise eventually more than make up for this road bump.Gluck's filmmaking is hip and common of modern comedy while the writing is clever and spontaneous. For no logical reason, a scene when Olive's gay friend Brandon (the one she helps first) comes over, Stone and Patricia Clarkson, who plays her mother, do this quick exchange of pretending they're in the Old South and a boy has come over and asked for her. Though completely random and a bit forced, they actually work well at making the characters seem more organic, which is the challenge of most comedies, especially those made today.Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as the parents are the comic relief. When was the last time parents in a teen comedy were genuine comic relief? They walk a fine line between wacko and genuinely caring and loving parents, but it totally works. Two more originally funny parents haven't existed on film before. Characters such as the aforementioned best friend Rhiannon and Bynes' are more by-the-book as far as being teen comedy stencils, but like every other small flaw with the film, they're covered up by all the multi-dimesional and more interesting ones. Worthy of mention are school faculty members played by Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm MacDowell.Most intriguing of all is how the film actually succeeds at finding moments of genuine drama. A few well-thought-out and creative plot twists introduce an intelligence seemingly foreign to these kinds of comedies. The key once again comes from staying focused on Olive's story. The film is structured as a retelling with narration from Olive, so it's told in a reflective manner, which ultimately keeps it from veering off course. It's about Olive wrestling with this lie and her feelings about how she wants to be perceived, along with her understandable pity for the boys who request her ""services."" High school's rough and reputation seems to be everything. Some elements of the high-school experience in ""Easy A"" might be way off, but that's dead on.Although it lacks the intangible innocence of the numerous '80s comedies it references, ""Easy A"" has a unique and lively spirit of its own and is the best teen comedy (at least featuring a female, finally!) in years. More importantly, it shows that the modern teenage sense of humor and good storytelling don't have to be mutually exclusive.~Steven C",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"great argument, great cast, great movie","I think this is one of the best movies of the decade. Emma Stone is awesome and such a great actress. The story is impressive and super truthful to American's high school current reality. The Story: Olive Penderghast is a normal high school student just trying to ""blend in the crowd"". At some part, she says she lost her virginity to a boy in community college and everyone starts to call her a ""dirty skank"". Then, she starts dressing like one and pretending to have sex for money. This girl just wants to find true love but anybody would ask her out. The movie ends in a high note with a precious lesson: don't worry about what the others say about you. Just live your life.

Easy... B+,"Easy A is a fun little movie about a girl's trip through the high school rumor mill. It's funny, it's well acted, it's filled with... A bunch of people playing high schoolers that are a little too old to actually fit the part.And that's what holds it back, because the message is important and the performances are solid and the humor did work for me... But.For everything that works there are little things that take away from it. Some of these ""kids"" act the part, sure they're playing dialed up archetypes, but amidst them are also Rhodes Scholars, the most unrealistically awesome, scene stealing parents and the kind of teachers we all wish we had.So while a good chunk of this wants to live in reality, there's a significant enough portion that wants to live in a fantasy land and the two just don't merge into a perfect harmony.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Star of the future Stone shines in very funny comedy,"Emma Stone stars as Olive, a lonely heart who lies about losing her virginity to her best friend and soon rumour spreads she is a slut. Initially mortified Olive parades around the school as a slut, wearing an 'A' on her clothing but soon she ends up in trouble.Described as ""the best teen comedy since Mean Girls"" this is a must see because quite simply, it is. The comedy variety of clever performances, physical humour and beautiful word play make a combination of knockabout comedy a treat for anyone over 15 years of age that will entertain you for a glorious hour and a half.Emma Stone in her first major leading role excels as a typical but not yet typical teenager going through life's friendship and educational battles, and thankfully with a difference. Olive narrates via an internet blog about how everything came about and her life and school reputation changed. Through some original narrative design and comic brightness audiences are easily engaged into the world of its heroine.Stone's performance is indescribably funny. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing and making us laugh at the same time has made her a star for the future. One scene where she pretends to have it on in a bedroom is very funny and whilst marketed as a comedy, the inevitable drama sequences show Stone as a rock.Stone steals the film but thanks to the experience of Stanley Tucci and Thomas Haden Church we have an array of comic genius. Tucci has never been funnier.The plot boasts some great twists and turns whilst marketing some great songs on its soundtrack. The way it separates itself from the normal comedy, by diversifying itself through visual aids such as the live web blog or plot differentiations makes it one out watch over and over again.A couple of drawbacks include the fact Lisa Kudrow cannot shake the Phoebe tag and the ending is slightly predictable.These minor things aside this is a knockabout comedy with a great lead performance that is certainly worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More gossip than Gossip Girl and it's better!,"Thank you Emma Stone for helping this movie become the enjoyable romp it is. Mostly sarcastic, but always cutting in it's portrayal of whats right and whats wrong. Don't be fooled, this is no 'Mean Girls', nor is it a chick flick, it's a tale of a faux tramp who gains hallway cred for her gay best-friend. Everyone believes Olive (Emma Stone) is now a harlot with a one track mind seeking trim any way she can get it. Spiralling out of control after she helps with others to provide false sexual endeavors, the film frequently references 'The Scarlet Letter'. To say much more will give away more than I am prepared to. With Stanley Tucci in the cast as Olive's hipster ex hippie Father & Thomas Hayden Church as an obscure teacher, it's a must see. Truth envy ensures right to the final credit. Give Emma a rookie Oscar!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A : A Laugh Out Loud Film,"Emma Stone delivers a stellar performance as character Olive Penderghast. An average high school student who jumps from the bottom of the social ladder to the top overnight, when there's word that she slept with some guy from a community college. Emma Stone's acting in combination with a raw, comedic script, take the common high school gossip mill onto a whole new level and the big screen.A bubbly, fun energy is brought to the set by Emma Stone as she assumes her role's new found identity as Ojai High School's biggest slut. Emma's blunt comedy and mannerisms give the students of Ojai a run for their money. With a faux sex scene, made up make-out sessions, etc. and the support of amazing co actors Aly Michalka (the pushy best friend), Amanda Bynes (the annoying ultra-Christian), and Dan Byrd (the gay friend who just wants to fit in), the laughs will just keep coming. A There's just one little catchthe rumors were started with one small lie from Olive herself!To compliment Emma Stone and Company's acting is a fresh, edgy script, giving Easy A a raw, comedic vibe. To add to this fresh façade, director Will Gluk (Also director of 'Friends with Benefits') guides this film as a narrated internet cast, showing the lie come apart one chapter at a time. Going back and forth between the story and Emma introducing/commentating on the 'chapters' adds a neat element to this film. An example of which is the second chapter titled, ""The Accelerated Velocity of Terminological Inexactitude"", in which the rumor spreads at lightning fast speeds. Another aspect of the script that makes it so amusing, is the parallel made between Olive's life and her studies. While this whole rumor ordeal is happening, Olive's English class is reading 'The Scarlet Letter'. For those of you who don't know, this novel is about a woman who is accused of committing adultery and is made to have a scarlet letter sewn to her clothing. The script is uniquely written in that Olive (Emma Stone) begins dressing like the slut everyone presumes her to be, including a big scarlet 'A' sewn to each of her outfits.Easy A is a humorous production of a high school rumor gone wrong. A laugh after laugh film with Emma Stone leading off an energetic performance and a supporting script to boot, there's just not much that can go wrong. I makes you wonder thoughjust how much truth is there behind the stories floating around your everyday life?",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A tries too hard to be liked,"Easy is a pretty simple straight forward story with an odd message. The plot is rather awkward and weird but for the most parts is plays out. Right from the start the film reeks a bit of desperation, as if it's trying too hard to be liked, much like many of its characters. Olive's feature-length confession, a 4th-wall breaking running monologue, is an awkward device that never seems sincere, while the turns the plot takes, particularly one involving a counsellor and a student, are simply too much to swallow. The film goes downhill in my opinion, from the part where it gets more religious. The scene with Olive going to church. It seemed like that was meant for the original R rating of the film.The characters try hard to be liked but many of them I just don't ended up liking, in particular Olive, her parents (they too hard to be funny), Brandon, and the teacher- Mr. Griffith. Though I did like Amanda Bynes character- she should have been in it more (the best scenes involved her). Easy A is rather shallow and disgusting for a PG-13 film. In my opinion, I think the film would have been better had they kept the film being rated R. The jokes would have been better with a few more swearing and probably more sexual content. The message is obscured by mayhem here as Easy A's moral roots are undercut by its attempts to be one of the cinematic crowd. It just doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm not in the target audience but the film still could had been better. I also felt like they could have added an extra 20 minutes to develop the supporting characters (Rihannon, Marianne, Brandon). Things just felt unfinished and unanswered.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A fun and enjoyable comedy,"This film tells how a school girl uses rumours to advance her cool factor, but her publicity stunt spirals out of control.I thought ""Easy A"" was about easily getting A grades, but that is far from what it actually is. The school girl in question bows to social pressure, pretends to be promiscuous in order to be cool, and to help some disadvantaged schoolmates along the way. How she helps Brendan in the bedroom is so hilarious, I laughed hard! In just a few days, her world is turned upside down, she feels differently about herself and everyone else feels differently about her as well. For a comedy, Olive's emotional roller coaster is portrayed convincingly. I also liked her open minded and supportive parents, although they have minor roles in the film, they provide a safe haven for her to grow up and become independent.""Easy A"" is a fun teenage school comedy with a great moral story. It even tells how social pressure makes us do regrettable things. It's easy for people to relate to the story, and that's a big contributing factor to ""Easy A"" being a fun and enjoyable comedy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not Bad...,"I didn't really expect much, but the movie is actually quite enjoyable. I was pleasantly surprised.At least the story is somewhat original.But I couldn't help thinking that Emma Stone was not the one to play the lead. It would've been perfect for AMANDA BYNES!Emma Stone did a great job, though. Her acting was surprisingly good. But she was wrong for the role. She is pretty, charming, likable. So how on earth would someone like her be an outcast?Amanda Bynes, on the other hand, could have pulled it off easily. She is not as one-dimensional as Emma Stone; she can do both - geeky and preppy. I really think the movie would've been much better if Olive was portrayed by Amanda Bynes.But anyway... a decent chick-flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The Thinking-Person's ""Mean Girls""","A few years ago, the movie ""Mean Girls"" redefined ""high school experience"" movies. With ""Easy A"", the ""bubblegum"" style of ""Mean Girls"" is replaced with a bit more of a sophisticated style.For a basic plot summary, ""Easy A"" focuses on high school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), who inadvertently starts a rumor that she slept with a fellow student. When the rumor spreads like wildfire and Olive realizes she cannot contain it, she decides to just go with it and see what happens.When it comes right down to it, ""Easy A"" strikes a nice balance between ridiculous & cute. At some points you'll just be laughing at Olive's crazy antics, while at other times you might just actually care about her character (a rare feat in a primarily comedic effort).Also, it must be mentioned here that Emma Stone's performance as Olive carries this entire movie. Stone can play sexy, sweet, and everything in between, and her range is on full display in this flick. She is a joy to watch and redeems a plot that gets a bit thin after about the first hour.Overall, ""Easy A"" is a fun movie if you are interested in high school fare. It tries to be witty, snarky, cute, & even a bit preachy all wrapped up in a single package and, while perhaps not accomplishing any one of those things totally, the combination is enough to warrant a viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A poignant and witty comedy,"Olive is your average high school girl that just wants to make it through unscathed. In an attempt to avoid an unsavory experience with her bestie's parents (nudists) she makes up a story about a date with a college kid. One thing leads to another and Rhiannon elicits a false story from Olive about how she lost her virginity to the fake kid on the fake date. Things spiral out from there and Olive begins having fake sex with boys in her school to help their image. Olive ends up fully embracing the theme of the Scarlet Letter, dresses quite trashy and in the end losses all of her friends. Not straying too far from her though is Todd, a classmate that has loved Olive pretty much his entire life.I love Emma Stone and would watch anything in which she stars. She definitely shines here. This movie, though presented as a comedy, does show the perils of judging others. Great job done by all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A great comedy with the potential to be more. Though it lacks some connections plot-wise, Emma Stones extraordinary performance makes up for all its tiny faults","Easy A stars Emma Stone as she takes on the role of a very different type of High School student who, despite the image she acquires throughout the movie, endures her tribulations with astounding indifference. If Emma Stones character wouldn't have carried with her that perpetual gleefulness, the movie might have just moved in a completely different direction. Though the movie was undeniably a comedy, I could not help but ponder over the dark undertones that loomed in the background of all the comedy.Olive is an outsider, as we quickly pick up when she spends her weekend chanting ''A Pocket full of Sunshine'' alone in her room. For some, this may well be the most funny part of of the movie; for me, it was sort of depressing. To me, it emphasizes her lack of a social life, and it is how I felt when I first saw the part. I understand this is far from how most others perceive this part of the movie, but anyways...Olive is also incredibly intelligent, and her snappy and witty retorts stay with her all throughout the movie. She leads a distanced life but appears to be a contended, courageous and confident girl with little social angst. Her relationship with her laid back parents (who were, by the way, one of the funniest proponents of the movie) is open and genuine. With a sudden lie to her best friend, Olive's life transforms from being an overlooked girl (which appears a little strange judging by her look, but im digressing...)into a whirlwind of exaggerated rumors,boosting her image into someone of a more than, to phrase it nicely, liberal sense of promiscuity.The movie itself was great. Don't get me wrong, it did contain many funny moments and was distinctly comical. However, I myself saw potential in the movie to be meaningful, and for a movie to be meaningful, it requires realism. I hardly think the scenario presented in Easy A resembles real life. Characters were, at least mostly, very stereotypical and flat. OK, maybe not all of them. Anyways, I hope you get my point. As far as Olive goes, I had just one critique, which is once again digressing from the comedic theme of the movie. I couldn't quite grasp how lightly she took her mortifying daily life. (Potential Spoiler!) How did she just suddenly become a beauty goddess brushing off guys with a sort or royal indifference when it wasn't even clear if she had ever kissed a guy before. An innate confidence, maybe? Just a few things to consider from my point of view, none of which really interfered with the comedic scheme of the movie.So, let's talk of the comedic value of the movie. Honestly, I didn't have awfully many ''laugh-out loud'' moments. Probably (and here we go again ) because of the dark undertones whose probability of being explored by the writers I failed to discard throughout the entire movie. I think that if I would re-watch the movie with a more comedy-oriented mindset it would indeed be funny, but its first impression on me was undeniably thought-provoking. Taking aside all of the stereotypical clichés, I really think this movie has something to say.Feel free to disagree with me. Maybe I'll re-watch the movie and jump to a different conclusion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A,10/10 - nothing but good things to say about this movie and Emma Stone crushed it,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stone scores.,"Teen comedy Easy A stars Emma Stone as high-school nobody Olive, who finds herself the centre of attention after a little white lie about losing her virginity becomes hot school gossip. Rather than admit the truth and return to obscurity, Olive capitalises on her new-found fame, even going so far as to make some money out of the situation by charging desperate dorks to say that they have scored with her.Instead of going for the easy option -- crass low-brow comedy -- Easy A opts for a more sophisticated and good-natured approach, and while this means that real belly-laughs are in short supply, it makes for an appealing movie overall, both amusing and heartfelt, helped no end by a very likeable central turn from Stone. Other solid performances come from Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favourite teacher Mr. Griffith, Amanda Bynes as moralising Jesus freak Marianne, Aly Michalka as Olive's bestie Rhiannon, and Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's caring and supportive parents.Easy A directly references a handful of '80s teen classics that were clearly the inspiration for writer Bert V. Royal, who matches these in terms of tone and characterisation. This film could sit quite nicely nestled amongst time-honoured favourites such as Pretty In Pink, Say Anything, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Super Unbelievable,"I know, suspend your disbelief when it comes to movies. I can do that with a lot of movies. However, the thing that makes highschool slice of life movies good is them being relatable and believable. This movie, not the least bit believable. Maybe it's just the highschool that I went to, but the ""Jesus freaks"" were largely underground because militant atheism was the ""cool thing,"" and all the gay kids were ""out and proud,"" and even when there were rumors about kids having sex no one really cared (some laughs maybe if it was a weird paring, but otherwise uninteresting). And here's the thing, I was in highschool when this movie came out. 2010 was my junior year, my friend's honors English class watched this as part of their Scarlett Letter unit in 2011 when the DVD was out. I was the target audience, and it fails to speak to me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good movie. 80s nostalgia for grownups, more than teen comedy. Gratuitous Christian bashing detracted.","Enjoyed this flick. Go 80s!1) I like Emma Stone, an intelligent, articulate and charismatic actress. 2) Made me think a little of Mean Girls in structure, though Mean Girls had sharper comedy, though Emma's better than LL in this kind of role, and Easy A was definitely more... sincere. 3) Family interaction was very enjoyable if a little unbelievable. 4) Premise was not believable in 2010 high school, that a girl claiming to sleep with somebody, would generate a stir. Maybe in the 80s. 5) Actors and actresses, I agree, were more like community college age than high school, and that was at times jarring. 6) Thomas Hayden Church was fun.7) The Christian bashing was gratuitous... I can understand making a joke or two about Christians promoting abstinence, but the non-funny caricatures of over-emotional Jesus promoting, emotionally stunted Christian club went on and on and on. I don't know when it became ""open season"" to thoroughly bash a religious group like that, but it was over the top and unnecessary. Unlike the rest of the characters in the movie, the Christians are NOT actual fleshed out characters, despite the amount of screen time. They are tacked on, like the writer just had a personal agenda.Despite the Christian baiting, which I pretty much tuned out halfway through the movie, and definitely marred it unnecessarily, I enjoyed the rest of it, and give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Unbelievable and not very funny, but Emma Stone is so terrific it almost works","This was hailed by some as being a cut above the average high school comedy. Its star, Emma Stone, starred in what is perhaps my favorite high school movie, Superbad. This one may be better than the average high school comedy, but it's not especially great, either. I obviously wasn't a girl in high school, and it's been over a decade since I've been there, but the events in this movie just don't come close to my actual high school experience. If you don't know the story, it's about a girl, Stone, who invents a sexual partner, and immediately becomes known as a slut around the school. Then she starts to pretend to be stupping a bunch of losers so they become more popular. When I went to school, any girl who looked like Emma Stone or the other gals in this movie, you'd kind of assume they were having sex (Hell, any girl who dressed like these girls, even before Stone embraces her inner slut, would probably be sent home to change, and my high school was pretty dang liberal). It might make guys like me upset because we could never have them, and it might make the ugly girls jealous, but would it ever have been as big a deal as it is in this movie? Not much of it seemed believable to me. It's worst offense, though, is that it just isn't all that funny. There are a few good laughs, but otherwise, it's kind of dull. Yet I didn't come close to hating it. Emma Stone, for one thing, is exceptional. Even when the writing is poor, she sells it. She's just got some wonderful comic timing, and her eyes are wonderfully expressive. I also absolutely love Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her goofy parents. I really wish they had gotten more time. Instead, they spend a lot of time on a really bizarre and underdeveloped subplot involving her teacher (Thomas Hayden Church), who is married to the school guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow).",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny,"First off, Emma Stone is pretty delightful. I'm not normally a huge Emma Stone fan. I like her when she is good and don't when she isn't so great. She's not an actress that 'sells' a movie for me but this is definitely one of her better performances. Partly, I think this is due to just how good she is with comedy. Just like in ""La La Land,"" her humor is used to great effect to endear you to her, despite the fact that, in this film, she is going to take a pretty dark turn.This is of course helped by outstanding casting for her parents Stanley Tucci (""The Lovely Bones,"" 2009) and Patricia Clarkson (""The Green Mile,"" 1999). Both of them play pretty woke parents who seem more like pals with Olive than parents with a heavy heaping of sarcastic wry humor.I suppose that's my first negative with this film though. The sarcastic approach to everything does wear thin after a while and isn't helped much when everything turns out ok and we get a more earnest heartfelt piece of Olive and her folks. There is certainly a bit of that teen angsty attitude of 'anyone-who-cares-about-things-too-deeply-is-dumb.' It's funny at times but as hopefully people eventually grow to understand that the world is more complicated than that, so the humor and fun becomes trying at a certain point. (And yes I know that's part of the point of the film. I just don't think that excuses a comedy from losing its funninessAnother failing of the film, and this is a nitpick, is the way that the internet and technology is portrayed in the movie. It's just so unrealistic and feels like it was written and designed by middle aged people who happened to see on the news that some kids are really getting into that internet video thingy. I get that there was some lag when it came to figuring out how to portray online life in the aughts but this was made in 2010, not 1999. It's barely any better than the portrayal of the internet in ""Mission Impossible.""So, I saved the worst for last and it is probably particular to me and other Christians but the way that religious people are portrayed in this film is simply offensive.""Easy A"" is basically a movie about a girl who is straightlaced but through a well intentioned lie, develops a reputation for being a ""slut."" This brings her popularity with guys but she loses a lot of her old girl friends and becomes the target of a clique of religious 'do gooders' who make fun of her, pray for her, and basically, become her most vocal haters.As a Christian, I have never met a single Christian who acts the way these ones do. This is coming from a guy who likes the movie ""Saved."" in that film, Mandy Moore leads a similar group of Christian concerned crusaders but she isn't the only Christian in that film. There are plenty of others who aren't so cruel.Why does this film feel the need to build a straw-woman out of Amanda Bynes (""Hairspray,"" 2007) who can't act to save a fictional soul, and then take her down like the mockery of Christianity that she is? There are plenty of other people who don't like Olive's apparently promiscuous activity that aren't burdened by being wholly unlikable in every way.I know there are Christians out there who can be real jerks but that doesn't excuse this portrayal in a media landscape that frequently uses Christians as their villains. It would be like showing a Muslim in this movie and having him running around yelling ""Allahu Ahkbar"" and threatening to kill all the americans at the school. Sure there are bad examples out there but to single them out unnecessarily and constantly put a real bad taste in my mouth.That didn't stop me from having fun with this movie, though. I think anyone there are a lot of people who would like this movie a lot for its humor and heart. Also its pretty rare to see a teen comedy that discusses sex so heavily and openly but isn't so raunchy that it has to be Rated R. It's certainly still too rough for some audiences but, for many, this movie will hit that sweet spot of being highly enjoyable and entertaining without doing too much to turn of weaker kneed viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Not a Chick Flick,"I have just seen this film on one of the UK's BBC channels. I had never heard of it, and only knew of Emma Stone through ' La La Land ' which bored me to tears. But what a fantastic performance she gives here playing a student in a very non-progressive school. For anyone who thinks this is just another chick flick think again. With a great deal of humour and genuine wit it shows a school which literally brainwashes its pupils into the most extreme conformist ideals. Homophobia is rampant, and any young woman who strays from the straight and narrow is cruelly abused and punished. The sexual hypocrisy of all this is made clear and made with a lot of welcoming laughter. Stone is branded as a ' bad ' woman and after studying Nathaniel Hawthorne's ' The Scarlet Letter ' she literally wears a scarlet A of her own, just like Hester in the novel. No spoilers but her eyes are widely opened to the people around her, and in turn she made me laugh and cry at the situations surrounding her. The cast is uniformly good and the direction perfect. But to return to Emma Stone; it is certainly one of the finest performances and in my opinion, she should have received an Oscar for it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
After La La Land,"After watching La La Land, I kind of fell in love with Emma Stone's performance (not Emma Stone... Well, maybe Emma too).

"A medley of great acting by Emma , good screenplay and teen comedy tropes","There are many things that seem out of place in the movie - Emma's more nuanced personality not matching that of a straight A student in a teen comedy , one dimensional bible toting characters almost depicted as caricatures and a weird relationship between a mature teacher and student stand out. However Emma manages to fill these holes really well and you empathize to the tricky situations she finds herself in. The screenplay despite being constrained by the tropes of the genre is consistently entertaining and manages to integrate elements of the 'the scarlet letter' story really well. While you can fully shake the dissonance between the nuanced and slapstick elements of the movie it provides enough moments to remain more memorable than the run of mill teen comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Contrived and unconvincing,"Easy A has received so many positive reviews I was astonished at how bad it was. From the beginning it was difficult to suspend disbelief that a 17-year-old girl would stand out from the crowd for losing her virginity. And how much more difficult to suspend disbelief when the actress playing the character is 22.It would have been worth the effort if the writing shone, but aside from some clever quips it was painful. The characters behaved in unbelievable ways. The movie has been compared to the works of John Hughes, but Molly Ringwald made a much more convincing outsider than Emma Stone. Stone is very charming and eye-catching, but is miscast for the part if we are to believe this attractive intelligent self-confident and funny woman is an invisible wall-flower who can only gain attention by pretending promiscuity.Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci and Malcolm MacDowell were a pleasure to watch, as usual, but they were peripheral to the action of the film.With the praise it has received I was expecting a Juno or a Clueless, but this film had less to say than American Pie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly charming with a great sense of heart,"I'm a sucker for high school comedies, and when I saw that ""Easy A"" was leaving Netflix, I just had to give it a watch. Starring Emma Stone as student Olive, a girl who earns herself quite the promiscuous reputation from a little white lie, ""Easy A"" is a lighthearted and charming teen comedy that has a great sense of heart, and never stops being fun to watch.This movie made me laugh, which is a good sign for any self-proclaimed comedy. While not necessarily an uproarious laugh-fest, there are still many funny lines here, especially from Stanley Tucci, who plays Olive's father. Emma Stone also has great comedic timing, and is utterly watchable in the role of a confused high school girl who is all at one relishing in her newfound attention and dreading the new way that people look at her - that is to say, as simply a sex object.As you may imagine, the premise of the film leads itself to many hilarious encounters, but also many situations that will pull at your heart strings. People come to Olive with Home Depot and Auto Zone gift cards, hoping to receive her blessing in saying that they were engaged in some sort of sexual encounter. Not agreeing to participate in these lies for the monetary gain, but instead because of feelings of pity for the people asking, ""Easy A"" sets Olive up as a genuinely kind-hearted soul who only wishes to help others, albeit in an unorthodox manner. It was really fun watching Olive's transformation into a shy girl who flew under the radar to a brazenly confident person who peacocked for attention. However, the film also shows the toll these lies are taking on Olive's life and relationships with others, which was an interesting exploration, and one that added more emotional resonance to the plot. That said, the movie as a whole never condones or condemns overt sexuality, which I appreciated, especially for a film that focuses on the idea of sexuality and promiscuity so heavily.There's also a lot of emotion here, as the movie deals with Olive's yearning for a true, love-based relationship, namely with Penn Badgley from ""You"" fame. Penn is really charming in the role, and him and Emma have adorable chemistry, and you won't be able to help but hope that fate brings them together. Emma performs really well alongside every character in this movie, however, and there really isn't one weak-link among the cast. Additionally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the really great visual style at play here that adds to the fast-paced, fun, and poppy feel of the film, complete with montages and catchy music. Like I said, this is a very easy, fun watch, but one that doesn't skimp on depth in story and character.""Easy A"" is a must-see for any high-school movie lover. It's not the funniest comedy out there, but it has so much heart to it that you're sure to find something to like.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My Review,"An intelligent teen comedy along the same lines as Mean Girls, this is all about a good girl turned bad... except she's not actually turned bad, this is just everyone's perception of her.The razor-sharp dialogue combined with the performances make the film work very well, and it's easy to see why Emma Stone has moved into the 'A' list after this was released.It was also interesting to contrast all the parallels between this and 'The Scarlet Letter', along with the references to other classic 80's teen movies... an echelon that Easy A might just be joining one day. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Maybe not quite an A. But a solid B+,"High school is a weird time in a person's life. And it's about to get a whole lot weirder for Olive Penderghast. Olive is a nice, if rather anonymous, girl. She's not popular. She's not unpopular. She's just there, pretty much invisible. Then, in the interest of shutting up her somewhat annoying best friend, Olive makes up a story about having lost her virginity to some college guy. Unfortunately this phony confession is overheard by Marianne, leader of the pack among the school's group of young religious zealots. Marianne spreads the word all over the school. Olive isn't anonymous anymore. Everybody all of a sudden is very interested in her. She uses her newfound notoriety to help out her gay friend Brandon, pretending to sleep with him so he will be accepted by his peers. This works for Brandon, but not so much for Olive, furthering her reputation as a dirty slut. At this point Olive decides to go all-in, fully embracing her new image as the school's resident tramp. And this makes for a pretty fun movie.Easy A is an homage to all those teen comedies of the 1980s we know so well. This movie may not be quite as good as those other movies it pays tribute to. But it's certainly good enough to provide some solid entertainment. The best thing this movie has going for it is Emma Stone who is absolutely fabulous in the role of Olive. Olive is a smart, charming, witty, endearing girl and Stone brings all of that out wonderfully. It's a star-making performance. The movie doesn't have very many huge laughs but it has its amusing comic moments and Stone nails each and every one of those moments. What the movie may lack in big laughs it makes up for with smarts. It's a very well thought-out movie, scripted with a structure that really works in delivering the story in the best possible way. It's a very simple story but the way it is laid out makes it work well. And while Stone is clearly the star, and weighted with carrying the film on her shoulders, the supporting cast adds a great deal to the proceedings as well. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci are terrific in playing Olive's exceedingly quirky parents. Thomas Haden Church plays one of Olive's teachers in a way that makes it very easy to see why he is Olive's favorite. And all of the younger performers fall comfortably into their roles as well with Amanda Bynes making a particularly good impression in the important role of God-loving Marianne, a great antagonist for Olive.This movie takes Olive on quite a strange trip. Once she starts down the path of fake whoring there's the sense she may not quite understand what she's getting herself into. Things could get rather messy. But you always believe she'll be resourceful enough to extricate herself from whatever messes she may create. And you'll definitely be rooting for her to do so. Olive is a character who is very easy to love, full credit to Stone for making that so. Olive's smart and very charming. And so is the movie. Yes, it could stand to be a touch funnier. But there are enough laughs here to satisfy. Easy A definitely makes the grade.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hilarious movie that is just fun to watch,"But there is nothing special about it when one would take off Emma Stone from the cast.The story isn't very clever at all, the characters sometimes implausible and basically it is a predictable movie. So why bother watching it? Because it is just fun nevertheless! The protagonist's, namely Olive, character is outstanding and she is one of the most impressing female roles I've ever seen. She's cute, smart, mouthy without being a jerk and has an awesome sense of humour. And if you've seen Emma Stone in many interviews, like I do, some could assume she's not really ""acting"" but being more likely herself. So the acting itself might not be excellent but she has all my sympathy and I could listen to her all day. Olive's personality fascinates and Emma's deep voice is a blessing for one's ears.While theme and many characters are exaggerated there are just few real slap-stick moments and a lot of its humour arise from the dialogues. It is not one of those big Oscar awardee but it is a real classic you can watch every once in a while. It just never gets old and Emma Stone is able to fascinate you once more even after watching it the 8th time.If you love Emma Stone or you can just easily enjoy a movie without a tremendous story-arc or character development this movie was made for you!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Easy AThanks to social networking, students no longer have to abandon their stereotypes when they graduate.And while high school gossips, bullies and class clowns can thrive on the Internet, only those labeled ""easy"" can flourish in both worlds.After she pretends to have sex with a homosexual student to help him appear straight, a smart-mouthed student, Olive (Emma Stone), finds her own life mimicking the Puritan allegory that she's studying in school.Labeled a sinner by the class Christian (Amanda Bynes), Olive decides to roll with her new branding – until it effects those closest to her.A wry comedy starring a self-assured teen from the 'burbs, Easy A is derivative of every John Hughes movie, which it references ad nauseam.

Charmingly witty,"I came across this movie on a best comedies of given year list and was at first very doubtful that a teeny romantic-comedy would be to my liking. But after reading strong reviews here on IMDb, especially from people aged twenty or more who faced the same predicament and recommended it strongly for all ages, I gave it a shot. And I was richly rewarded.The movie was not the hit-the-theaters once a month romantic comedy, that pretty much warms up the same ingredients every time anew - actually, it was only a comedy with a little romance involved. It was really refreshing to see a character (Olive) not mulling over her faith and passively reach some point of salvation at the end, but actively taking on her problems.Easy A rest on two pillows - an incredibly good Emma Stone, and the enormously smart and witty dialogs. There hardly is one line of dialog I don't listen to with a little smile on my face. So praise to the writers.Emma Stone single handedly carries this movie, with her seemingly effortless unburdened acting. This is not to say that the rest of the cast wasn't great, but even if it hadn't been, it would still have made a good movie. But the other good actors here did there work well, and gave Stone the space she needed. I especially enjoyed the family scenes and the interaction with the religious fanatics - also nice to see Fred Armisen have a little role.The script itself is quite original and develops naturally and evenly paced. Not a single dull moment in there. Some developments might be a bit of a stretch, but it never feels contrived. But the best point about the script is, once again, the dialogs. I wish more screenwriters would appreciate the language as part of the artwork and not only as means of developing a story or the quest for a punchline. The only point that felt awkward was her adopted brother, who someone just hung loosely in there without having anything to say or do really. Guess he was there to portray the family some more and get two funny jokes about him being adopted in there.This one is really a gem in between your scheme A romantic and stoner comedies.(By the way, the movie she goes to see in the international cinema actually is Scarlett Letter in German).",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The Ratings Suckered Me Into Watching This Clichéd Teen School-Romcom,"I suppose that the joke's on us as a film that mocks Ferris Bueller and pretentiously name-drops Sylvia Plath is itself a total cliche of an American public school romcomdrama. The thin story is OK and the acting good and I really like that a character also narrates but the screenplay and dialogue are ridiculous.
The characters, especially Olive's family, are unbelievably witty and sarcastic. The elderly teacher is so ""hip"" that he has all the kids eating out of his hand. The (all white?) kids are all robot airheads. 50 of them, at a pool-party, stop and crouch in total spellbound silence outside a door to listen to a couple having sex because that is so totally unheard-of and amazing.
For me, the only believable characters are the, wonderfully acted, horrible counsellor and the bigoted principal. The only joke that made me laugh was the ironic ""Huck""

She is perhaps the best young star right now of her age. The rest of the cast is amazing as well. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are hilarious as her off-beat parents, and Lisa Kudrow is great as well in her limited performance. All in all, there is no reason to miss this film. It is rewatchable, entertaining, funny, and best of all, intelligent. Have I mentioned how great Stone is here?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pleasantly surprised,"Emma Stone shines in this 2010 dramedy, more on the comedy side.The movie went for real life pattern as to how rumors spread in school/ generally in a place. However the kind of thing Emma's character was rumored off it was a surprising to see their weren't any dangerous implications. Certain aspects( characters) are very bad like Bynes was supposed to be that irritating character but we didn't see her grow or Kudrow's character is not held accountable and we basically have to think on our own.Emma stone was stellar in this movie. She was amazing from start to finish. Though she felt like a little bit older to play a 17 year old. She however brings the aspect alienation and the craving for recognition beautifully. Certain scenes show us that she can show us the reason why we love Emma stone. Her way of depicting a certain emotion is phenomenal. It also helps that most of the dialogues are very good.Would have liked if all the other characters weren't wasted liked that.However I RECOMMEND it to every Emma Stone fan. Anyone who feels the need for recognition (positive/negative).Thanks for reading. See you later ✌",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good Actors AttemptingTo Overcome a Substandard Script,"1 March 2011. Reminiscent of the teen classic Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) in attitude, character, and voice-over, this teen comedy adds creative credit design with a little of a cinematic side trips of 500 Days of Summer (2009). But in this version, the audience gets to see how a Ferris might have been created from the lie of an Emma Stone. The script, however, seems to desperately focus on getting its laughs from exaggerated opposites (school mascot) and other over the top attempts for laughs that seem to break from the more fascinating authentic fantasy (as if more makes for is better). In some ways, it would have been intriguing if this movie had tried for serious teen drama instead in capturing the teen audience instead of skirting around the issue using comedy and exaggerating humor, almost making light of a real bullying issue.By 12 minutes into the movie the one-liners are coming quick and fast, almost at an nauseating, unbelievable pace. Even the public school principal (Malcolm McDowell) is given dialogue most stuffily unreal and almost like a throwback to the 50s. The use of the word ""t"" later is also overdone and the word ""twit"" doesn't seem to even be a problem. What is even more scary, though, is the possibility that the dialogue, at least for the student might actually resonant with the audience (presumably of roughly the same chronologically the same age) may truly think and speak constantly this way in high school (it's been that long) in which case this movie might be more in tune and better than I can give it credit for). Could it be? Hopefully not. An even more challenging and pertinent question is whether the movie industry creates the culture of teen dialogue or only reflects it. Is the dialogue and speech being depicted in this movie portraying what teens really get into or is it getting teens into the depicted, really ""bad"" language and speech patterns? ""A boy in the room"" parent scene continues the overly, exaggerated, and over the top, unreal dialogue that supposedly captures and identifies with the younger generation but that really diminishes the more serious and believable aspects of this movie focusing on some real teen issues, taking the easy way out of having to develop a script that is finely nuanced with both appealing humor and drama. Shortly afterwards, in one of the movie's strongest scenes that starts out pretty lame, but then Brandon's plea becomes a rather emotionally captivating speech that connects to the real human condition, even though the somewhat forced, script device of using lies continues to teeter on unbelievability.The fakeness of this movie is increased by the obviously impossible swimming pool scene in a house and teen partiers that could only be achieve in a larger, more urban/suburb upperclass venue of a movie, not the small town depicted in this movie. The bed room scene is also riddled with clichés and overtly ridiculous phases almost pandering to the audience, descending almost to raunchy humor. A more sophisticated sex scene that has nice undertones of humor occurs in THE COOLER with William C. Macy and Maria Bello having a loud romp.Towards the middle of the movie, the more serious elements of the teen condition come into better clarity, balancing the more ridiculous performances to date as our prima dona becomes more aware of others than herself. The accompanying scenes though really maintain, though with less frantic effort, the pace of tolerable humor while only briefly skirting the ridiculous. tapping into a contemporary John Hughe's wannabee.The counselor scene while perhaps intellectually revealing also is very suspect for its portrayal of guidance counselors especially just the immediately proceeding scene its very clear that the counselor was informed of that was really going on, just adding inconsistency the weaknesses of the script. Even when there's a great opportunity such as the post-counselor scene to really rise above the fluffy, pretentious pseudo-teen humor, the script-writer blows it and misses a truly bonding, relational, meaningful moment of opposite-contentious-bonding in a human way.Past the midway point, the real conflict and sexual lies that create real tension finally come out and make for a much more revealing, valuable, and worthwhile, meaningful movie experience. Then with our heroine's real date, there is a severe underdevelopment of her date's character to this point so that the inter-character dynamics of almost every other similar movie genre is missing.Unfortunately for the tone of this movie, the big dramatic moment is so disrupting to the overall movie's background mood that it's too radical a departure from unreal fantasy to harsh, dramatic movie drama. While the movie seems to settle down, the movie never really gets to go to the depth and intensity that the social issue that the movie raises because the movie never really takes its subject seriously enough but only uses it as a vehicle to appear sophisticated and ""cool."" What is remarkable about this movie is that it's not exactly obvious that the problem with this movie is the actors. It's remarkable perhaps is that this is a movie about a script that really doesn't do justice to the great actors in the movie, because despite the script, there is a sincere effort to make the best of it and sometimes it shows through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Easy A is the Most Smartest Teen movie I've ever Seen...Its Xtremly Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box. Emma Stone Rocked it!","EASY A – CATCH IT ( A ) Easy A is undoubtedly the best teen movie I've seen in recent times. It's extremely Witty, Clever, sharp & Out of the Box, which regenerate the whole new teenage world for us. Just imagine the teenage life we have seen in Clueless, 10things I hate about you and Mean Girls. Easy A is certainly a major step ahead in the life of vivacious and nowadays teenager's life. Besides the intelligent and brilliant cast, what makes Easy A more effective is its dialogues and storyline. Emma Stone proved that she was meant to do this role; she is witty, charming, funny and incredibly sweet. Emma Stone certainly stole the show and with help of some incredible young and some veterans supporting cast, she rocked it! In the end the musical dance number was a simply sexy & incredible. Penn Badgley is sweet & such a pleasant actor to see on screen. Amanda Bynes did a fine job. Aly Michalka was great, she was so blunt and outspoken, loved it. Dan Bryd is a great comedian, In Cougar Town and now in the movie he proved that this kid can make you laugh Big time. Cam Gigandet is Hot as Always. Now let talks about some veterans supporting cast in t he movie, I think it's the first time such big actors have works have worked in a teenage movie, where they have few scenes. Bravo for Will Gluck for convincing them to do the movie. Stanley Tucci & Patricia Clarkson, Wow Hands down they were great together. I think everyone would love to have parents like that, I wish they make a movie with these characters again some time, they were simply amazing. Lisa Kudrow is funny & mean. Thomas Hayden Church did a good job. Overall Easy A one of the best and intelligent movies of 2010, leave the teenage genre it's for everyone. Enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma is wonderful ... funny script too ...,"... but pretty much everyone in California is portrayed as a dimwit, from Emma's parents to all others in this movie (with the possible exception of her teacher). Pretty much all students are dimwits too, except for the one student Emma falls for.

The Problem with Telling Lies,"Although ""Rhiannon"" (Aly Michalka) is her best friend, a high school student by the name of ""Olive"" (Emma Stone) cannot stand the thought of going with her on a camping trip with Rhiannon's parents. So unable to think of any other excuse, Olive concocts a story about having a date with a college guy for that very weekend. Naturally, being a close friend, when Rhiannon returns she demands that Olive tell her everything about her date. This leads Olive to invent yet another story about losing her virginity in order to make it seem more appealing. This then creates a new problem as their conversation is overheard in the female restroom by a sanctimonious gossip named ""Marianne"" (Amanda Bynes) who then proceeds to tell everybody in the school. As a result, Olive quickly gets a reputation for being a promiscuous tramp which subsequently intrigues all of the guys-but infuriates all of the girls. Naturally, hormones being what they are, things take on a life of their own from that point on. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute comedy which started off reasonably well but then slowed down a bit before the end. Even so, I thought Emma Stone put in a pretty good performance overall and for that reason I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amusing yet not quite satisfactory (B- at best),"Easy A is probably a proud moment for Emma Stone. As far as I understand, this is her first staring role, and it gives her a chance to stretch her comedic legs. Though not terrific, she does her job. The movie as a whole does not, I'm afraid to say.The mind that though up Easy A is arguably clever, but the mind (or minds) which transfered it to the screen are not as much so. This high school comedy is burdened by a poor screenplay, and a lack of consistent humour. It starts off strong but the middle section is overlong, and tedious, and the ending is rushed and not nearly as clever as was probably intended. Easy A makes you smile, and sometimes makes you laugh, but you come away from it somewhat unsatisfied.In an attempt to avoid looking like a generic teen comedy, Easy A frequently winks at itself. It acknowledges its source material; Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter. Self-reflexive though it may be in parts, this movie still feels fairly derivative. The key is always in the details. One of the more annoying clichés in this genre (also seen here) is the utter incredibility of the adult characters. Easy A is quite mean spirited towards all the parents and teachers in the movie, and it doesn't really add to the comedic value. Stanley Tucci gets a few good one liners, but his delivery is lame. The same is true of Thomas Haden Church, Malcolm Mcdowell, and a few others.Easy A, is a movie that could use a reworking. It's cute, but it's not quite funny enough to recommend as a comedy. It may work more effectively as a date movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Bold teen sexy comedy with peculiar trappings,"How much you enjoy and buy into this comedy depends on your willingness to run with Emma Stone's edgy, verbally agile Olive, a 17-year-old high school girl frustrated with her anonymity until she finds the gossip mill as an escape from it. While her character is not wholly unrealistic, her dialogue occasionally reminded me of Juno Temple, a peculiar mashup of female personality that strained credibility on account of bizarre quips and far-fetched zingers. You know you're watching a Hollywood film when a teenager is talking like an educated adult in their 30s or 40s. Fortunately, her character doesn't quite lapse into this because of Stone's superior acting chops and a performance with more dimensions.The film is at its best when it makes humorous but sincere references to great historical literary works like The Scarlet Letter and Huckleberry Finn. There is also a strong array of comedic supporting performances, the best coming from Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's loving but slightly harried parents. Thomas Haden Church is a good presence in this film as her favorite teacher. And Amanda Bynes, in one of her last high-profile performances, is quite funny as the loathesome class president and arch-rival of Olive's. While not your typical teen sex comedy, this one can be quite charming and is good fun. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Begs for John Hughes, literally","In Easy A, Emma Stone plays Olive, a teenager flying under the social radar. All of this changes when she uses a little tiny white lie to get out of hanging with her BFF's creepy naturist parents. The falsehood spreads like a wildfire evolving from hanging out with a college student to sleeping with him. Olive chooses to embrace the lie and soon she is the talk of the schoolyard as every guy wants leech off her infamy, offering gift certificates in exchange for the implication that they ""did it"". Of course it won't come as a surprise that eventually Olive changes her mind and has to scramble to save her good name.Like many of these teen comedies, the lead is wise beyond her years but still susceptible to making youthful mistakes. Like Juno this movie's protagonist is ready to give out a witty comeback and use words that exceed the average vocabulary. I wouldn't call this realistic, and the actions, or rather overreactions, of supporting characters puts Easy A in familiar territory. Fortunately some of the jokes are brilliant. One that will stay with me for a long time to come illustrates Olive's growing fondness for a song that plays when she opens a greeting card sent to her from her grandmother. Through the use of montage an entire weekend eclipses and Olive goes from despising the tune to singing it in the shower.There are some stereotypes that get their usual Hollywood poking. I already mentioned how the nudist parents are weird, but on the other end of the spectrum is the controlling ""Jesus freak"" Marianne (Amanda Bynes) that provides the predictable conflict that works its way into the second act. Would it have been nice for someone to be religious without being a hypocrite or bigoted? Sure.Olive spends a lot of time on her own and it wasn't until late in the game that I realized how Todd (Penn Badgley) is being setup as her love interest, and no one should see this coming as his appearances are widely spaced and his impact minimal. If Easy A is supposed to be quirky, original, and/or thought provoking then it's counterintuitive to fall back on the social norm with such a lifeless relationship. Olive is a likable character and this movie didn't feel like it needed her to be thrown into a guy's arms in order to find happiness. And the way it is executed is so peculiar. So much time is dedicated to building Olive's promiscuous persona that nice guy Todd logically shouldn't be interested, in fact it's borderline insulting to think that the average teenage male is looking for the kind of girl who has been physical with everyone he knows. I've been out of high school for a little less than ten years, could things have changed that much?I'm a little disappointed in the way Easy A concludes. It's a wrapping up that calls upon nostalgia, and in the movie business that means reminding the audience of what movie(s) you want them to consider as an equal. Connecting Easy A to a number of '80s teenage love stories doesn't require a roll call. By mentioning The Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller's Day Off by name is arrogant while the inclusion of an amalgamation '80s ending is downright lazy. It's a sour note to play out a tune that started high and sweet.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Movie With Charm That's Actually Pretty Funny,"I saw this movie years ago, I decided to come back around to it for fun. I found it pretty enjoyable, It's a pretty good chick click.

The narration isn't overbearing, and although the story is pretty one dimensional I give them props for taking a twist on the classic school slut idea.

The smartest high school teen comedy I've ever seen.,"There's a rare comedy zone that exists above pratfalls & cheap gags, above situational laughs, somewhere near satire but not quite that obvious. It's a peculiar zone, sort of like the classic ""Edward Scissorhands"" where the filmmakers are clearly showing you an exaggerated reality, but not so exaggerated that you lose touch with its relevance. And through this wacky prism we see our own lives with a hilarious spin if the actors can pull off the right deadpan delivery. Very few movies hit this zone, movies like ""Catch-22"" (1970), ""Dr Strangelove"" (1964), ""Joe Vs. the Volcano"" (1990) or ""Punch Drunk Love"" (2002). And here, I'm happy to announce in the most unlikely genre (high school teen comedy) we have a great addition to the list: ""Easy A"".If I lost you with my opening paragraph don't worry, all I'm saying is that this movie is really funny. Emma Stone plays ""Olive Pendergast"", a 17-year old girl at a California high school who, after years of being a faceless nobody, suddenly gets thrust into the spotlight when strange rumors of her sexual promiscuity spread like wildfire. The ""Easy A"" in the title is a reference to the parallel story of ""The Scarlet Letter"", the 1850 novel about a woman accused of adultery and forced to wear a demeaning ""A"" for her sins. But here we see a cool, modern take on the situation with Olive proudly and spitefully wearing her penance in front of the entire school of her accusers.And that's what makes this such a fun & hilarious flick. It's that, the whole time, Olive is almost like the puppetmaster and controller of the crazy events that happen as things quickly escalate. Emma Stone is perfect for the role with her sarcastic wit and deadpan apathy even though her life is rapidly going into the trash can. Thus the chain of events becomes like what I described in the opening paragraph: an exaggerated reality delivered with deadpan precision. If you've ever seen a Bill Murray flick (""Groundhog Day""), that's how Emma's character comes across.Throw into the mix some really witty zingers, some hilariously bizarre characters and a healthy buffet of references to classic 80s teen comedies (movie buffs, you can make a game of trying to catch them all), and you've got a great experience. The whole presentation is like a 80s John Hughes film on steroids. John Hughes would populate his high schools with instantly recognizable archetypes (the jock, the nerd, etc), and here we have the same approach but way off the deep end. Instead of being antagonized by the jocks, Emma's character must match wits with the Jesus freaks who sit around with a guitar singing bad religious diddies (another parallel with the antagonists in ""The Scarlet Letter"").From beginning to end, ""Easy A"" is very well written, clever, poignant and just plain hilarious. And on top of it all, it delivers a powerful message that every teen, as well as most adults, should remember regarding how to navigate this crazy judgmental society we live in. As you're watching this, you realize that the microcosm of high school applies to our entire civilization. Whatever age you are, definitely give this flick a go.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cool,"Emma Stone surely is a versatile actress when it comes to facial expressions and changing in accent.Movie was cool with some good cinematography, music score ( songs which were picked in this movie were cool) .",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"F'in ""A""","The more I thought about ""Easy A"", the less I liked it. This is a shame, because while there's plenty to like about it, there's just as much to dislike. The movie is inspired by ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which I'll admit, I never got around to studying in my A.P. English class. But I know the book is about adultery, which the movie has very little to do with. True, there is some adultery in the movie. But whenever the term is thrown around in the movie, it doesn't mean what the filmmakers seem to think it means. ""Adultery"", for the record, is when a married person sleeps with someone other than his or her spouse. Olive Penderghast, as played by Emma Stone, never sleeps with a married person. In fact, she never sleeps with anyone at all.Instead, the plot starts when Olive invents a fictional boyfriend to get out of going camping with her best friend (Aly Michalka, currently starring on The CW's ""Hellcats"") and her bizarre parents. Soon, the rumor mill starts churning, and extra-virgin Olive gets a reputation as the kind of girl who ""puts out."" Moral of the story: gossip is bad. But it doesn't end there. Olive's goals as a protagonist are unclear. Confusingly, she alternates each scene between trying to dispel the rumor and trying to fuel it. You see, no one paid attention to poor Olive when they thought she was a virgin. Because she's too smart. Or nerdy. Or something. Never mind that guys everywhere would be tripping over themselves noticing her because she looks exactly like Emma Stone. Of course, the cliché of the beautiful nerd who everyone ignores has been used in countless movies before. But at least they usually put a pair of glasses on her and give her a funny hairdo until her ""transformation."" In ""Easy A"", gorgeous Emma Stone always looks like gorgeous Emma Stone.Of course, it could easily have been a plot point that guys won't talk to Olive because she chooses to be a virgin. But again the character waffles between being a virgin because she's ""not that kind of girl"" and just being a virgin because guys won't talk to her. Anyway, the movie is framed as a web-cast in which Olive bares her soul to her entire high school. Because we're expected to believe that high schoolers spend their free time watching their classmates' web-casts. Or that two hours of confession will convince them of anything other than Olive's desperation for attention.Leading Olive's persecution is Marianne (Amanda Bynes), the head of the high school's Bible study. Because in the ""Easy A"" universe, Christians are the scum of society. Nazis in any given movie set during WWII are portrayed more sympathetically than Christians are here. Amanda Bynes' character spews out ignorance and hatred while her cohorts nod and strum praise music with vacant expressions. True, there are people in real life that fit the stereotype, but the film makes no attempt to balance them out with at least one character who dares to stand up to Marianne, or to utter a word of disagreement with her, or even to possess a real personality. They just act as Marianne's brainwashed followers, while their preacher ogles high school students doing web-casts in his spare time. They're nothing more than cartoon villains.Not that any of the other characters are any more realistic or any less cartoony, but at least they have solid performances behind them. Michalka's character is filled with fun energy, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson steal the shows as Olive's wacky parents, Thomas Haden Church gets some good lines as Olive's favorite teacher, and Malcolm McDowell is criminally underused as the school principal. But it makes sense that Amanda Bynes chose to retire after filming ""Easy A."" I've never really thought of her as a bad actress. But here she plays against type, and it results in the worst performance of both Bynes' career and this movie. It's hard to tell whether she's playing Marianne as completely insincere and phony or if it's just terrible acting, but either way she succeeds in giving her character less than a single dimension.Another problem with the movie becomes apparent within the first few minutes. The pitch for the movie was ""The Scarlet Letter"" in a modern day high school by way of 1980's John Hughes teen comedies. The movie won't quit reminding the audience of this. While some self-awareness is always good, calling out that something's cliché as it happens doesn't make it any less cliché. By the time Haden Church's character mentions that he doesn't want to be like the cliché hip teacher his students see in all of the movies, you get the idea of how it would have felt if the cast of ""Alien"" had spent the entire movie discussing how their scenario was just like Jaws . . . but in outer space. While there are some clever lines, most of the time, the dialog's too ""clever"" for its own good.Emma Stone deserves her turn as a leading lady. Unfortunately, her charm isn't enough to carry the film. I enjoyed her more in her supporting turn as the last surviving hottie of a zombie apocalypse in ""Zombieland."" If the movie were cut down to its most promising moments, a scene where Stone belts along to a Natasha Bedingfield song (already viewable a dozen places online), a similar scene where she gets a full song and dance number towards the end, and any scene showcasing the family dynamics between Stone, Tucci, and Clarkson, it would have been a more enjoyable film, and it would have been rid of about an hour and ten minutes of uncomfortable dialogue.

Easy B,"Marianne: There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency. Olive Penderghast: Tom Cruise?In Easy A, innocent Olive (Emma Stone) foolishly brags to have lost her ""V Card,"" starting a rumor at Southern California's Ojai Valley High School that spins out of control. At some point she becomes the Hester Prynne of the experienced girls, a reference to their currently reading Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter and a testament to the scourging of the ultra-Christians.Lest this seem a bit heavy for 17 year-old teens, the dialogue by playwright and screenplay specialist Bert V. Royal is witty, but not all the time, and timely if a bit over the top. Juno it is not, missing that comedy's acidity, sophistication, and gifted star, Ellen Page. However, the fetchingly-lisped Stone is still better than most young actresses out there playing young, romantic, and comedic.Royal's script has plenty of room for commentary on homophobia and adultery as well as the formula for a wholesome, liberal family life evidenced by Olive's parents, played to happy, flower-children harmony by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. That couple should win a special award for playing the understanding, caring parents we all hoped to be or have, but weren't/didn't. They are marvelous.The thematic weight in this rom-com is with acceptance and truth, notwithstanding the obvious commentary about social communicating best exemplified by Facebook. In fact the entire film is framed by Olive narrating to her website about the rise and fall of her rumor.Easy A, its title ingeniously playing on Hawthorne, should have taken the rich Hawthorne subject more seriously, for there is plenty of comedic material and life-learning going on with the nineteenth century genius's stories.""She had wandered, without rule or guidance, into a moral wilderness.

Smart but a bit smart for its own good.,"It's refreshing to see a teen movie that is actually for teenagers and is not diluted to appeal to young girls. Just like how it was in the eighties- and eighties films are referenced quite a bit in Easy A.The title is clever, witty, and has a bit of attitude. However, Easy A does not entirely live up to the promise of its title. It's an intelligent off-beat film for the most part but the director and writer keep congratulating themselves on their wit and quirkiness so often that the film begins to grate. There's also an unpleasant snarky tone to the whole proceedings. Olive (Emma Stone), our slutty protagonist who is not really a slut, is frequently bitchy to pretty much every other character, except her 'favourite teacher'(it's not a euphemism but the film would be much funnier if it was). She has a massive superiority complex, using every excuse to show off her wit and pretentious intellect. Apparently this film is supposed to be indicative of our generation, and it is, in the sense that everybody is self-obsessed. Despite the protagonist being sour, Emma Stone brings a bit of attitude to the film and perhaps indicates that Olive is just as self-absorbed as everybody else.The film's premise has parallels with 19th century American classic The Scarlet Letter, in which a woman is persecuted and forced to wear an A as a symbol of her adultery, whilst the man is not punished at all. However the filmmakers seem to have got confused about what adultery means, as they keep saying that Olive is an adulterer whereas her actual sin is supposed sluttiness. The film's attempt to convey the religious themes of the novel does not really pay off. I'm not religious at all but I found the obsession with attacking religious zealots rather sour and a distraction from a promising, albeit implausible, comic premise.So, school report for this film: intelligent, but a big attitude problem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Didn't like it.,"This movie annoyed me too many times to continue watching it. The few parts where the Christian girl tried to annoy Lindsay Lohan's character by repeatedly jamming her pencil in the sharpener and clicking the stapler irritated me to the point of wanting to jump through the screen and strangle her. The movie was a puffed-up joke in many ways. Lindsay Lohan's parents were cute at first, but quickly became too lewd and weird for my tastes.This film is basically about what can happen when you tell a few lies; one thing builds from another, and events spiral out of control. It was clearly geared towards young women, so I'm not sure why I watched it. There were some ditzy-girl moments; the Renee Zelweger type that I don't ever expect to understand since I don't have a vagina. To sum it up, if you are a guy, the chances you won't like this movie are pretty good. If you are an older guy, you might be more prone to find it amusing, even tolerable, especially if you watch it with a significant other or family.

Someone like Anna Faris might have been more watchable.Speaking about facial features, what on earth happened to Amanda Bynes? Did she have plastic surgery at her age? Still she is quite hilarious. This is watchable and enjoyable overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A: EASILY one of the best coming of age movies ever,"Easy A is a 2010 comedy movie staring Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, and Amanda Bynes and is about a clean-cut high school student relies on the school's rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing. But you probably knew that, so why is it any good? Well its extremely funny! Honestly, there were at least 5 scenes in this movie that had me crying with laughter, but maybe that's just me. The film has actually likable characters, even the antagonist, Marianne, to an extent. The main character, Olive, does things that, sure, WE probably wouldn't, but the steps leading to that decision feel realistic. And Olive's parents, played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci, are extremely enjoyable to watch. Lastly, The film is made really well. Sure, it's not like Driver or Birdman, but for what it was trying to accomplish, being a modern day John Hughes movie, it does a really good job. To summarize, Easy A is a fantastic and funny movie I can't recommend enough",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"This is an Easy ""B""","*** out of (****)Easy A, advertised as another paint-by-numbers, textbook high school drama extravaganza with little redemption and originality and where style tops substance. Emma Stone as the lead looked very unconvincing as she hasn't been the lead in any of her films and no one could replace Lindsay Lohan in the iconic ""Mean Girls"". After seeing this film get critically acclaimed and praised, I ventured off to see it on a late Friday night. To my surprise, Easy A is one of those rare high school flicks that is just so effective and is heavily devoid of clichés, predictability, and dry characters. Pretty much every other high school flick has been pretty subpar, with the exception of ""Mean Girls"". While Easy A is certainly not one of the best films of the year, it's worth the hefty admission. With so many soulless and energy drained flicks that are only worth a fraction of what you spend on a movie ticket, Easy A is worth all your ten bucks.Easy A, which bares some resemblance to the notorious ""The Scarlet Letter"", the film even heavily references it, revolves around Olive who feels invisible to everyone at high school. Olive talks to her friend in the bathroom about a guy Olive ""dated"" and her friend thinks that Olive lost her virginity to the guy. To compromise with her friend, Olive decides to lie about losing her V-card, although, Olive's past Christian fanatic friend overhears them in the bathroom and Olive's lie is inevitably being spread. After this mishap, Olive's homosexual friend asks Olive to moan and make suggestive sounds in a room, where everyone hears, so that people think they have sex, which they don't. Olive agrees to it and now all the nerdy, outcast guys are asking Olive to do the same favor, and rather than neglect it, she milks the attention she's getting. What she doesn't know, is that acting promiscuous can give some guys the wrong idea.First off, a majority of ""Easy A"" works because of its script. There is so much wit, references, and dry-pan humor, that this script is probably one of the freshest scripts of the year. Most typical high school films have a mediocre script which heavily references pop culture and expects the audience to play along. ""Easy A"" has a few more brain cells and rather takes the road less traveled by. Furthermore, the characters in this movie are very likable and fulfill their duties. Emma Stone's performance is so charismatic and fulfilling, if Lohan were to retire a potential ""Mean Girls"" sequel, the audience would have no complaints about Stone filling in. Actually, in some ways, Stone tops Lohan's delivery. Moreover, the pacing is also highly effective. Scenes go by pretty briskly, without the film feeling too short either. Additionally, the cinematography is pretty much eye candy. This film looks very vibrant and the colors jump off of the screen. It's definitely the epitome of a high school flick.While ""Easy A"" soars, there are a few problems. Firstly, the middle kind of sags and almost brings the charismatic outing down. The audience is introduced to a more serious tone and this hurts the film's harmless atmosphere and feels awfully depressing. Furthermore, while the film is pretty much devoid of predictability, the resolution is highly predictable, which is passable considering the rest of the film is pretty unique. Lastly, I found that some of the jokes were hit and miss. For a comedy, the jokes didn't pack that much of a punch, but then again, it takes a lot for me to laugh. However, that's acceptable because the humor doesn't resort to cheap gags or schoolyard puns, instead it relies on witty delivery.Don't let the director credits fool you. This film may have been directed by the same man that gave us the mediocrity ""Fired Up"", but Gluck has vastly improved. ""Easy A"" is a wholly effective comedy because it relies on an enthralling script, solid character development, and a smooth pace. All the elements of a well-made film are here and for once in a blue moon, you can seal your brains on. Has there been a film that looks ""copy-and-paste"" but turns out to be the complete opposite and is worth every cent you spend? ""Easy A"" is a pretty good example of that. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overrated,"This movie is highly overrated, I found it unwatchable, it tried to be Juno, but the story, writing and characters are so poor that it's not even close. I guess I have hard time believing a teenager could be the smartest person in the room all the time. I know teenagers, most of them don't have a clue. As for Emma stone being cast as a misfit, big mistake. Her parents come across as cartoon characters, totally unbelievable in my eyes. Stanley tucci is unbearable as her dad. Has all the typical Hollywood stereotypes, the hypocritical Jesus freaks, the misunderstood gay kid in the closet, and the slut that's really all talk.

A Pleasant Surprise!,"I didn't know anything about this movie, good or bad reviews etc, when we went to go see it and sometimes that's the best way to go see a movie. I didn't think the trailer I saw for it looked that great so I had very low expectations walking into the theatre to see it. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, never saw the star of this movie Emma Stone in anything before but she was good - not great but definite potential in her for acting. The movie is good for what it is as an enjoyable, time wasting way to hang out with your friends and maybe have a couple of laughs. I don't think you need to catch it on the big screen but it's definitely worth a watch on DVD or if you catch it on TV or pay per view sometime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A Makes the Grade,"Olive (Emma Stone) acknowledges she's a fairly typical high school student with fairly typical high school student problems. She has angst. She feels alone. But one day, when she tells her friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) what she wants to hear, she ends up adding a reputation to her list of issues.The reputation bizarrely combines with Olive's compassion for her friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), and the next thing you know, her reputation has grown beyond control. What's a girl to do? Well, in Olive's case, she decides to grab onto the reputation along with everything it means, and ride it for all it's worth.Olive's favorite teacher, Mr. Griffth (Thomas Haden Church) knows something's going on, but he doesn't know what. Mrs. Griffith (Lisa Kudrow), the guidance counselor at the school where her husband teaches, knows something's going on, but what she knows isn't actually what it is. Crusading Christian Marianne (Amanda Bynes) thinks she knows something, but doesn't really want to know anything. Olive's parents, Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson) and Dill (Stanley Tucci) are entirely understanding of something they don't know they don't understand at all. And Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley)? Olive would just as soon he didn't know or understand anything at all!Easy A sounds like a fairly simplistic premise and to some extent it is. But the script is clever in ways that raise it above the basic idea, and what could be a confusing mess is actually presented with a winning combination of clarity, humor, and feeling. Much of the cohesiveness of the movie as a whole can be credited to some very skillful edits. And I loved the literary references which, far from stuffy, were actually funny and all too appropriate additions.It doesn't hurt that the acting is, in most cases, stellar. Emma Stone is perfectly cast as Olive. For all her occasional drama, I would have liked her when I was in high school and, considering that I hated everybody when I was in high school, that's saying something! I wanted to slap Amanda Bynes, and that means she did a superb job bringing Marianne to life. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci were a pure delight to watch every time they were on screen. I also really enjoyed seeing Malcolm McDowell in a small role as the school principal.BOTTOM LINE: Easy A wasn't as funny as I thought and hoped it would be, but it was somehow more moving than I'd imagined. There are laughs, but there are also tears and a few scenes where your own high school years will likely creep up on you and give a little extra kick to the happy or sad of the moment. The teens in the theatre, though, seemed to be entirely wrapped up in the immediacy of the film, and laughed more than I did. Of course, their high school memories are yet to be made...POLITICAL NOTES: None.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Easy A is rated PG for ""mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality, language and some drug material."" Because of those elements, I can't recommend Easy A for young children. Older teens, though (16 or so and up), will likely really enjoy the movie, and if you've got a sense of humor about high school, you will, too.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Title: Easy A (2010) - A Refreshing Take on High School Comedy,"Easy A, directed by Will Gluck and released in 2010, is a refreshing comedy that cleverly intertwines classic literature with contemporary high school drama. The film stars Emma Stone as Olive Penderghast, a witty and intelligent high school student whose life takes a wild turn when a harmless white lie about her weekend activities spirals out of control.The movie draws inspiration from Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" and cleverly adapts its themes of reputation, judgment, and societal norms to the modern high school setting. Olive's decision to fabricate a story about losing her virginity sets off a chain reaction of events that challenges her morality, friendships, and her own perception of herself.Emma Stone delivers a standout performance as Olive, perfectly capturing her sarcastic wit and vulnerability. She carries the film with charisma and depth, making Olive a relatable and endearing protagonist. The supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Amanda Bynes, and Penn Badgley, adds layers of humor and heart to the story.One of the film's strengths lies in its sharp and witty dialogue, filled with pop culture references and clever one-liners that keep the audience engaged throughout. The script not only entertains but also offers insightful commentary on the double standards and hypocrisies present in high school and society at large.Despite its comedic tone, Easy A also tackles serious themes such as slut-shaming, peer pressure, and the importance of staying true to oneself. It subverts stereotypes and empowers its characters to challenge the status quo, ultimately delivering a positive and uplifting message about self-acceptance and integrity.Visually, the film is vibrant and stylish, with a soundtrack that complements the story's energy and tone. The use of narration and creative editing techniques further enhance the film's playful and dynamic atmosphere.Overall, Easy A is a delightful blend of comedy, romance, and coming-of-age themes that resonates with audiences of all ages. With its clever writing, strong performances, and timeless message, it remains a standout in the genre of high school comedies. Whether you're a fan of classic literature or simply enjoy a good laugh, Easy A is a must-watch film that continues to entertain and inspire.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Olive Penderghast pretends to have lost her virginity and then must deal with the consequences,"Very, very funny!

A play on the Scarlet Letter and in the same category as Mean Girls, Easy A is a lot of fun.A great cast with familiar faces all around- Some lovely comedy cameos from Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson and Lisa Kudrow add to Easy A's charm, while the younger characters of Amanda Bynes, Cam Gigandet and Penn Badgely compliment Emma Stone's performances in one of the wittiest teen movies in the last few years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A - 3.5 Stars,"A lot of people are talking about a girl named Olive Penderghast. This is because they think she lost her virginity while still at high school. Olive knows this rumor is not true because she (unintentionally) started it. She never wanted to cause the entire student body of East Ojai to create a false image of her, but now that it has happened, how will Olive handle it?""Easy A"" is a comedy about reputation, gossip, and the benefits and consequences of popularity. This is common in most teen flicks, but Easy A takes it on with much wit, humor, and a heroine that is very much lovable. Olive Penderghast seems to be the type of friend that everyone needs; one who is conscious of people and is ready to adapt. She is a smart and pleasant person, but the rumor at school has caused the students to think otherwise. It is at home where her reputation remains undamaged.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/easy/",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Something Different - Something Better.,"Easy A is so different to the usual teen comedies in a really good way, mainly because the story is so original. Highlights were definitely Emma Stone, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. Emma Stone is truly the next it girl. It's mainly her nuanced, perfectly-timed and well-thought-out acting that makes Olive endearing, and not just one of those girls in a teen movie that goes all-out-klutzy and is forgettable because she's just like all the others. This is partly due to how her character was written, so kudos to Bert V. Royal for churning out someone different.I also LOVED the John Hughes and 80s teen movies references. It really shows how different this film is because of how aware and respectful it is towards the truly great teen movies of the 80s. It doesn't forget where it comes from, or what inspired it, and go off on a tangent of clichés and inane characters. It has themes that can be universally applied to anyone and not just restricted to high school, which makes it mean more in real life, and proves it's not just another teen comedy advertising sex, nudity and getting drunk. It has what most movies of this genre don't even care to think about - true heart. And when you have that, everything else - good acting, writing and direction - can form naturally around it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Uneasy A,"'Easy A' may be a tad overrated but it is at least a tad better than the usual sex-loaded teen flicks released these days. What I liked about it is that it actually attempts to tell a story and skillfully references to classics like 'The Scarlet Letter' and those wonderful John Hughes films. In a way, it's like a modern day 'Scarlet Letter' but with much more comedy. Emma Stone brilliantly carries the part of the typical teenager who suddenly finds herself stuck in her own web of lies. She's definitely growing as an actress (something the likes of Lindsey Lohan couldn't achieve despite being in movies her whole life). Stone is terrifically supported by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci (as Olive's parents with the hippie-free-love mentality) who provide some of the best laugh-out-loud moments of the film. Thomas Haden Church stands out as the good-intentioned teacher and Lisa Kudrow is superb in a surprise role. 'Easy A' may not be a classic but it's entertaining, with some hilarious moments nonetheless. Not too bad for a one-time watch.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Another unrealistic teen movie.,"I just recently watched this movie and, just like I had suspected, it was like every other teen movie out: predictable. From the beginning of the movie one could pretty much tell what was going to happen next. Aside from the plot, I felt the movie was very unrealistic. In high school when one loses their virginity it doesn't spread like wildfire like it did in the movie and not everyone makes such a big deal out of it. Let's be honest, a good number of kids, at least in my high school, were not virgins. Also, most people are not as judgmental as they are in the movie about having sex. Overall, Emma Stone did a wonderful job playing the role of Olive and the movie was decent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma Stone was the only one that stood out,"This is kinda like ""Mean Girls"" and will remind you of ""Mean Girls"" with a bit of a different premise. The main girl is actually likable for the most part in this one. I never found Emma Stone attractive although a their are probably a lot of guys and maybe girls that has a crush on her. Her character Olive really did stand out a lot in this movie, which could be a negative cause all the other characters just didn't have some great dialogue like she did. She just seemed to confident and too snappy. Which made the other characters just seem like side character that is just there so Olive can show off her witty dialogue. I enjoyed a lot of movies that Emma Stone was featured in and I liked this movie and her character as well. But what appears to be a smart teen comedy doesn't really have much of a message when it all comes down to it...Some but not much. It mainly revolves around promiscuity and the importance of it for some people in order to build their reputation. With rumors and gossiping going on as well, and STD playing big part in the story as well. The movie portray the Bible group as the villains in this one, lead by Amanda Bynes. I don't know what happened to Amanda but her face looked super bloated in this which was odd cause the rest of her body is skinny. Which made me wonder if they made her look like that on purpose or if she just has a fat face now. The movie offers few funny situations and some fun yet witty dialogue mainly from Olive(Emma Stone) with her remarks constantly and all, while the other characters just seem like cardboard. Which I think is the main flaw, just about every character is the same from beginning to end, even Olive so there really isn't anything to cheer for or anything. In another words no character development and hardly and win or losses. This film isn't a ""chick flick"" but for anyone that likes a good comedy.7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the funniest-smartest chick flicks.,"By all means the movie could work alone just by Emma Stone's hyper-charisma and excelling appeal as the lead role, but thankfully, Easy A is a comedy that knows exactly what it is, what it tries to say and the means to achieve it, in such fancy and hilarious way, benefit by the presence of a great casting, all suited for a small but subtle indie flick that, good enough, transcends the barriers of a casual average chick flick in order to become universally enjoyable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A lot better than expected!... I'll even go so far as to say I liked it!... a bit...,"As some of you may know, I'm not big on comedies. It may be because I have a peculiar sense of humour, but, for the most part, what Hollywood thinks is funny is usually antipodean to my opinion (bet you're looking up what 'antipodean' means now). I'll still keep trying them out form time to time though you never know, there just might be someone out there in 'La La land' on the same wavelength as me! And so we come to 'Easy A'; a teen comedy (not encouraging so far), all about a girl of (alleged) easy virtue (still not encouraging, but hey, I've come this far). Well, despite many misgivings, I must say it wasn't half as bad as I thought it might be (& that's high praise from me! for a comedy). Now, since I've been accused of giving too much away in my plot summaries, I will just give you the very briefest outline of what it's about (you'll probably get more from the trailer than I usually give away but, (sigh), if I'm getting complaints I guess I'd better pare it down a tad or 12).Olive Penderghast is at high school and she lies to her friend, Rhiannon, about sleeping with a boy (for reasons I won't go into). As they do, rumours spread like wildfire, and before she knows it, Olive finds herself with an unwanted reputation. The question is what is she going to do about it?... So there you go, the new and improved 'outline' Hope you liked it and I didn't spoil the entire movie for you If I did then you have my profound apologies.I said earlier that I didn't find this film too bad, well, I might even go so far as to say I actually enjoyed parts of it quite a bit! I thought Patricia Clarkson as Rosemary (Olive's mother) and Stanley Tucci as Dill (her dad) provided a great comic foil for her character. Her favourite teacher, Mr Griffith, played by Thomas Haden Church, and his wife, played by Lisa Kudrow, also added another dimension to the piece. Of course, it was Emma Stone, as Olive, that held the whole thing together, and I thought she put in an excellent performance. Honourable mentions go to; Malcolm McDowell as Principal Gibbons, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd, Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Dan Byrd as Brandon and Aly Michalka as Rhiannon.A witty script with some great dialogue made a welcome change from many recent (so called) comedy efforts I've seen spewed out of 'tinsel town' in recent years. It also has a pretty good soundtrack with some tunes even I recognised! There is a minor problem with it though The way Olive chooses to deal with her problem is dragged on a bit too long and after a while it gets a bit monotonous. Fortunately it picks up though and it got saved from a lower score by a rather cool ending (sorry no clues). Over all, although not perfect, I found this a witty, pretty well written and entertaining comedy Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10.IMDb Score: 7.1/10 (based on 61,651 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 86/100 (based on 174 reviews counted at the time of going to press).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A gets an A+ from me!,"Easy A is an original actually laugh out loud comedy which delivers on so many levels, not only is it quick witted and funny but it is also heart warming.The relationship and dialog between characters is my favourite part of this movie, especially between the families. Easy A is definitely not another-teen-movie where a geeky female teenager falls in love with some hot guy and then through some twists and turns they end up together. Instead this film focuses on how funny high school drama is, without giving to much away, its original humour and sarcastic.Fans of films like Mean Girls and John Tucker will enjoy this film and lovers of female comedy / sarcasm will also.Great film, lots of great lines and laugh out loud funny. Definitely worth a watch: D My new favourite film. Strongly recommend this!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful entertainment,"I really loved the movie. Usually the comedy/romance movies my wife picks are boring so I didn't really have high expectations for this one either. Was I surprised.The plot - while it stretches plausibility a bit (but don't nearly all great stories do that?) - is wonderful. It takes the topic of fast paced rumor mongering and twists it into an entertaining story. The movie is clearly quite cheerful so naturally from that follows that the plot is quite predictable. However, even if you can guess what probably will happen next, the events are portrayed with such skill in acting and tempo of witty speech that they are still wonderful to witness.Comedies are often bad because good comedy is hard to pull off. Fart jokes are for children etc. etc. The comedy in this movie is golden and pulled off with style. It's based on the question: what kind of situations might happen when you don't want to act like your peers expect or pressure you to? Technical details. The music score was good. Not epic like in some massive artistic films, but light, playful and rock-ish. Perfect match for this kind of movie with a rocking female heroine. Filming locations generic enough so that you can imagine them in your own hometown. Camera work was solid too.All-in-all, I can very warmly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a modern comedy with a not-so-subtle romantic component. Also, it probably helps if you are under 35 of age (as the events transpire in high-school and I feel it would be a bit silly to watch a movie about school life when you can't really remember what your own school life was like). The movie left me with a very happy and silly feeling inside.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Completely Unrealistic,"Easy A seems as though it has been written by a bunch of old farts or people from a small town that have a very closed-minded outlook on the teenage years and highschool. It is annoying to watch this movie as a teenager and no way relate to it, and it is completely misleading to adults. The plot was very absurd in itself and pretty uninteresting other than a few unexpected twists that were completely random and had no foreshadowing or evidence to go with them. Overall, the writing was just poor. It was funny at many parts, though, and the character development of Emma Stone's character was somewhat good. It is not worth going see at the movies or renting, but it may entertain you if you're bored. Props to Emma Stone, though, for giving this movie something.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An Overdue Female Perspective In The Teen Genre,"""Easy A"" centers on rule-abiding teenager Olive (Emma Stone) becoming the subject of rampant sexual rumors at her high school. When false word gets out that Olive slept with a college guy, her classmates start thinking of her in a different light. Rather than refute the rumors, Olive buys into them. In homage to ""The Scarlet Letter,"" she pins a red A to her chest and starts charging guys for permission to say they had sex with her.At first, I was skeptical of ""Easy A."" While Emma Stone's character is deeply likable off the bat, the cast is way too old to convincingly portray high schoolers. This has nothing to do with the actors performances (all of which are wonderful), but with Emma Stone along with co-stars Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, and Aly Michalka all being clearly in their twenties while playing ~17 year olds.Moreover, like many teen movies, ""Easy A"" offers a rather shallow image of high school. As much as Hollywood would like us to believe the contrary, it is only a small group of high schoolers who are so toxically gossipy or cliquey. Usually, by the time teenagers reach the fifteen through eighteen age range, they have outgrown such excessive pettiness and are more socially conscious. While the speaking characters in ""Easy A"" demonstrate the intelligence and budding maturity of adolescents, the high school backdrop is still wrongfully depicted as a jungle, where rumors are accepted at face value, a social hierarchy rules one's happiness, and sex is a gold standard of success.These were some of my initial criticisms for ""Easy A,"" but once again, they are unfortunate tropes that almost every teen movie complies with. Therefore, I managed to get over them rather quickly and appreciate ""Easy A"" for its original contributions to the genre.Olive is a kind of teen protagonist that I have not seen before. Teen movies usually focus on the male perspective and egregiously objectify their female characters. In ""Easy A"" we not only see how wrong these patriarchal conventions are from a female perspective, but also see some female redemption, as Olive harnesses those very conventions to her advantage.In the end, she also witnesses the detriments of those conventions. Even when she is at the helm of the rumors, she cannot control what people think about her. This realization leads to an important message that all teen movies should heed - that a young woman's sex life is nobody's business but her own (ditto for a young man's sex life... or an old man's... or an old woman's... really anybody's).Although it took some time to see in the beginning, ""Easy A"" is a novel take on the teen movie. It is poignant and funny, and although it might overplay how much teenagers actually treat sex like a rare currency, it at least offers something constructive about that noxious dynamic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Shark Tank,"Emma Stone (""Superbad"", ""Zombieland"") helps reinvent the classic 80s teen movie revolution with her Golden Globe nominated portrayal of Olive in the Critic's Choice nominated Best Comedy ""Easy A"". Director John Hughes's films (""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"") had a big influence on this film. Will Gluck (""Fired Up"") directed the film creating a modern comedy version of Hester Prynne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" that rightfully takes place in a high school setting. Emma Stone's character Olive is just another normal teenaged girl trying to live through high school. She is really close to and open with her parents Dill (Stanley Tucci) and Rosemary (Patricia Clarkson). Her best friend is a blonde bombshell that is way more popular than her and her best guy friend, Brandon, is gay. Olive narrates the story while breaking it up into different parts and making a video. Her narration begins when Rhiannon asks Olive to go camping with her and her family for the weekend Olive lies to her saying that she has a hot date with a college guy that weekend to avoid going with Rhi and her eccentric parents. In actuality Olive just has a relaxing normal weekend at her house. However, on Monday when Rhi asks her about her weekend while in the bathroom, Olive says that she had sex with the guy. Their conversation is overheard by the die-hard Christian of the school Marianne (Amanda Bynes) who spreads the rumor throughout the school. Within the hour Olive was no longer just another student, she was known as the slut of the school. Why did she do it? The story begins to parallel The Scarlett Letter as they are reading it in her favorite teacher MR. Griffith's class. Olive begins doing favors for guys saying that she has slept with them to increase their public image. This ultimately leads her to wear an A on her wardrobe to represent adulterer just like in ""The Scarlett Letter"".""Easy A"" is all about Emma Stone. She has always been a very good actress and has stood out in all of the films she has been in (""Superbad"", ""The House Bunny"", ""Zombieland""), but they didn't allow her to be a star until now. This is her first leading role as an actress and she nailed it, rightfully deserving her present award nominations. She has shown that she is going to be a force to be reckoned with in years to come. She helps the film stay original and get back to the roots of the 80s teen movie revolution also adding to the film a lot. The incorporation of the famous fist pump scene from ""The Breakfast Club"" and the song ""Don't You, Forget About Me"" helps create the echos of the rebirth of the 80s in the film. And oh yeah Stanley Tucci is amazing. Enough said.Unlike the 80s teenage revolution films like ""The Breakfast Club"", the ending of ""Easy A"" is very predictable. The film itself is actually kind of original, but most things in the film can be seen coming. Also, Amanda Bynes did not seem like the best casting choice for the film. She has her hair bleached blonde for her die-hard Christian role of Marriane that just does not look very good on her. Her acting is also very fake and bad at times. She has to cry in a couple of scenes and it could not have been less believable.Rated one of the best comedies of the year ""Easy A"" shows how stupid high school really was. People felt like they had to become someone that they weren't because of the stupid teenage social hierarchy. Emma Stone shows us how her character Olive tried to break the system, but high school is a shark tank and they will eat you alive. Wait for DVD if you are going to see the film and go rent or buy ""The Breakfast Club"" now!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The movie is for anyone who just likes a good and well-written comedy movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A for Sarcasm,"I thought this film was absolutely hilarious. And I'm not just saying that because it has literary ties and 80s movies references sprinkled throughout.Olive has a bad reputation, but it's not really true. She's trying to do the right thing, and like everything else, it's spun out of control. Instead of trying to be honest with people about her actions, Olive chooses to roll with her new image and go all Hester Prynne on High School. She looses sight of why she said what she did to start with and actually believes what people say about her.The best thing about this film is the excellent sarcastic nature and dialogue that it possesses. Olive is played by Emma Stone who has like the best attitude and sense of humor ever. If Olive were real everyone would want to be her best friend, rather than ostracize her. Her humor comes honestly, because her parents are like the coolest people ever. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are absolutely amazing as Olive's parents. Though the ""bad guy"" is really just Olive's reputation and rumor, Amanda Bynes plays the good Christian girl to perfection. Sometimes irony is the best form of comedy.I like it. So you will like it. I promise. Unless you don't enjoy laughing or fun films which show the hypocrisy of our society. Then you won't like it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Adoarable Movie,"The film that made Emma Stone a star. It was too hard to resist her charms in this update of The Scarlet Letter. I wonder if they've started showing this in high schools across the country to get kids into that novel. The supporting cast is great, too, with people like Lisa Kudrow, Thomas Hayden Church, Stanley Tucci, and Patricia Clarkson. It's also such a shame about what happened to Amanda Bynes.

"""Let's not and say we did""","A clean-cut high school student relies on the school's rumor mill to advance her social and financial standing.Occasionally, I might settle down for a little romantic-comedy. If only, my state of mind if joyously in a different place. From the liking of the trailer, I somehow sat down and had some sort of 'expectation.' And what I got was more than what I wanted... Emma Stone, known for her beauty and pretty good acting skills has outdone herself. She plays her character as in all her films; vulnerable and intellectually smart. But the twist is, she uses a rumor to gain respect and some sort of reputation. So she isn't the most popular girl... The film has some great humor. I suspected some meh humor that'll wear away but Easy A's humor will really get inside you. It's smart but not too smart. It's dumb but not too dumb. Some scenes will give you warmheartedness and joyous fun, and some are forgettable... The film also packs in a great message for us. At the end, the film gets a lot more smarter and sends the message for our minds to consume. Not only, it gives us some well- being for the future... At times, the film still has flaws; as any film will. Some are forgettable and seem to be purposeful but some will just hit you in the head, make you forget exactly what you were watching. Not to be alarmed though, these flaws don't knock the score down too much... Easy A is surprisingly a surprise. It combines everything I wanted, but didn't expect. So if your expecting something, get ready to receive. The movie surprise me with it's charm. If you don't expect ANYTHING, it's either a love it or hate it. I personally loved it but see people bashing on it. And if your not into these type of films, your out of luck. Maybe you will find something in it, but it is doubtful.

"Brilliant, Funny High School Romcom That Takes The Genre For A Contemporary Spin","I'm very fond of this film; a high school romantic comedy, one of the best of its kind, and very much one of the best of the subset of romcoms that are reworkings of classic texts. In this case, it's The Scarlet Letter that gets the treatment.The emerging Emma Stone in the lead is brilliant; but what really makes this is the brilliant cast, fine actors in small roles everywhere you look. Of course, no one speaks as the characters do in this film - but of course, that's not the point. There are so many good gags, I keep losing count; my favourite ones being the almost throwaway jokes around the lead's kitchen table as the scene fades into the next one, taking the viewer delightfully by surprise.It also takes many of the classic, often problematic, tropes of classic high school romcoms, and cleverly subverts them. Emma Stone's Olive is a woman discovering she can take control of her life; and the cost to her, and others, as she tries to conform to type along the way. Rewatching this in 2019, this starts to look like it was, even then, somewhat ahead of its time; it's a delightful, engaging but quietly powerful unpacking of the damage toxic masculinity has on women (and men). Well worth watching, and rewatching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Emma Stone shines in a Very Unique Performance,","Easy A is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It may be considered a teen comedy, but I think anyone beyond the age of fifteen would certainly enjoy it, it hearkens back to the days of John Hughes films, as we follow one character who narrates the story that only revolves around roughly only a week of their life, movies like these aren't made anymore and it was a very refreshing ninety minutes. Though Olive is of course the main character, I felt like every other character was very underdeveloped, we really only knew two things about every other person (i.e., her name is Rosemary, she's Olives mom), I certainly would have liked to see more character from Olives parents and her friend Rhiannon, who was probably the weakest part of the film as we were never made entirely sure how close they were as friends and she is practically written out of the film early on. This isn't a visually stunning film or one with an extremely interesting storyline, it all revolves around the portrayal of one particular character, and I think for that matter, Emma Stone hits it out of the park, she is both hilarious and very natural as Olive, it seemed like a very challenging role as she had to hold the entire movie together, but she did so with pure charisma, and I felt like there was a lot of her in that character. Though it may be forgetful, Easy A is still a fun and easy ninety minutes that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.A pupil lies to a friend about losing her virginity, but the rumour mill spreads this around school, earning her unwanted notoriety.Best Performance: Emma Stones Worst Performance: Aly Michalka",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hated it!,"I wonder how big a protest would have been lodged if the character Amanda Bynes plays had been, say, a Muslim threatening to cut off Emma Stone's character's head, or saying she should be stoned for her adulteries? Would this movie have been condemned as anti-Muslim? I'm pretty sure it would have. But apparently, it's okay to portray Evangelical Christians as screaming, hypocritical fanatics. (I was just waiting for Ms. Byne's character to whip out a Westboro Baptist Church placard that said, ""God Hates Fags"").If it isn't P.C. to lump all Muslims into the category of crazed Jihadists, why is it okay to play Evangelicals as one-dimensional,cardboard buffoons? Obviously there are Christians like that (just as some Muslims believe in violent Jihad), but why doesn't anyone in the film community get upset about portraying Christians in such a negative light as in this film? I just love Hollywood's consistency about being ""tolerant"" and ""inclusive"" when it comes to people's beliefs.The other reason I hate this movie is because I sincerely doubt any girl would let her reputation be besmirched as often and as flippantly as Emma Stone's character does. Girls I knew in school would have been mortified beyond words, not flagrantly encourage it.And it wasn't funny, either.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
..a better than average rom-com.. including a break out performance,"Have only seen her in a couple films, both rom-com's.. and in both those productions you can see just how good this kid is. She's 22 in this movie easily playing a high school-er, and with her looks and ability she could as easily go the other way. Once you've seen her on screen you know you'll be following her future career for a very long time, she is going to be doing some very entertaining stuff. There are lots of very attractive actors, she just adds something else that's exceptionally special... and oh that voice and alluring laughter! As young as she is, you can see by the number of films on her resume she is in high demand, just hope she does not burn out. As for this movie, it was well done and entertaining for its genre.. and Aly Michalka is surely an added bonus. PS...

The pitfalls of high school,"Easy A was one of the big comedy hits of 2010, a film with a low budget that made a healthy profit and earn a lot of critical acclaim. It was also a film that helped confirm Emma Stone's raising star and let Will Gluck wash away the nasty film Fired Up from our collective consciousness.Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is a 17-year-old high school that is invisible in her high school in Ojai, California. Her life changes when a rumour spreads like wildfire that she lost her virginity and many forms of the tale emerge. Her gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her if she pretends to have sex with him so that would end all the bullying he suffers. Soon Olive embraces her new identity as the school slut and turns it into a parody and gets paid to pretend she sleep or committed other acts to people who need to enhance their reputations. But soon everything starts to spiral out of control, including being the target of fundamental Christians led by Marianne (Amanda Bynes).The big positive of Easy A is Emma Stone is a natural comedian, delivering her lines with expert timing and just seemed so natural and real in the role. She is a character is wise beyond her years and is a very smart and self confession character, willing to take on the rumours head-on. Will Gluck has a moment of directional flashes with slowing how the rumours spread around the school. Bert V. Royal also does deliver a witty script with good lines throughout.My big problem with Easy A is a lot of the characters felt like over-the-top characterchures what they are meant to be. We got a fundamentalist Christian that runs her sect like a cult, who dresses in stereotypical female preppy way who thinks everything that does not stay in line to her narrow world view then it is a sin and that everything was God's will: if the character was Jewish or Muslim it would be considered highly offensive. I cannot picture a character like that being liked or popular or influential in any way and if anything would have been told shut or simply ignored by most of the students. As well this is a film set in California, where even Republicans tend to be are socially fairly liberal. It would have made more sense to set Easy A in a more typically Republican/Socially Conservative state like in the Bible Belt or in the Mid-West. Olive's parents are actually very annoying with their banner and interaction and it really did not feel like a real parent-daughter relationship. They just seem too causal about what was going on with their daughter.Emma Stone is meant to be playing a character that is an outsider, a character who is ignore by the majority of her peers. Stone is a glorious, striking red hair, how could boys not interested in her? She would easily be a popular girl and in any reality Olive would have lots of friends, whether she was a cheerleader or a alternative click. This clique system that is shown in films does really exist and it would be a much more mixed picture of friends. Plus the rumour that spreads and mutates is that a 17-year-old girl looses her virginity to an older man, woo: like that has never happened before. If it turned out the girl was only 14 then I think her year/grade would be talk or if the girl had a more down to earth look and a quiet personality. A character like Olive in reality would not care, she would just carry on with does would not worry about what people think about her because she knows the truth.I believe that the double standard the film show is true, that if a boy has sex in high school he is a stud, become popular but if a girl has sex she is a slag, someone who become a source of notoriety. But most of the time boys lie and big themselves up.Stone also uses the word 'twat' and I was annoyed because I though if they use the word at least pronounce it properly. And I question why is Malcolm MacDowell in this and why does the school have a English principal? Were there no American/Canadian actors available or even an actor that could do an American accent? Overall Easy A is a decent film, it does have good dialogue and it funny, but it is not the great comic masterpiece some critics seem to think it is. It is a fantasy world, not a real picture of what high school life is like.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Poking out moral value flaws with this comedy,"The story nicely lines itself, and even identifies itself with the book character Hester Prynne as a straight up comparative, which is a very nice touch. It grounds the story to an anchored perspective. It gives nice start and twists to the book's story. The things that happened really exposes how the western, particularly American, youngster moral value has been severely distorted and even reversed. Yet this movie remains very fun entertainment because the comedy is very enjoyable and laughable. Typically this movie is one of those comedies where a lie gets added with more and more lies until it reaches the boiling point and exploded. But the comedy is indeed very entertaining that it set this movie apart. The acting overall is very good.

Not an ordinary teen chick flick,"The movie deals with the well-rehearsed topic of trying to fit in. Of course, the key message of the movie is that one's personal life is not supposed to be a competitive field. However, the way it deals with the key topic makes this film special.I personally like that the lead character is someone that a lot of people can relate to, as opposed to being either a super-popular cheerleader or an ultra-dorky outsider.The acting is good, although some characters are blown out of proportions. However, this is a usual flaw of teen movies and certainly not a major issue in this particular case.The only downside, albeit slight, is that the movie does not really abound in comic scenes. This makes it somewhat forgettable, as a film either offers an intellectual challenge or stirs up emotions (sorrow or joy, either way) in order to be memorable. That is the sole reason why I give it a 9 as opposed to a clean 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pretty charming,"This is the kind of movie that you forget about a week after you watch it, but it's pretty charming. Emma Stone is great here as Olive, a character who's easy to root for.

If there's a weak link I think it's Lisa Kudrow's character, who has some questionable moments. I like that it is about 90 minutes and doesn't overstay its welcome.

Impressed by this film,"Yesterday after watching La La Land (for the 3rd time in my case) with some of my friends in the afternoon, I decided to look for some of old performances of Emma Stone, which in the end led me to this movie. So I fired up my TV along with Netflix, and I settled for a Friday midnight movie session, and here are my little thoughts: First, Emma Stone's performance is indescribably funny. Alright, honestly its Emma Stone's performance and her cuteness 😍 that made me really enjoy watching this film. From singing alone in her bedroom to strutting around in revealing clothing, her hilarious expressions, her comedic timing and the way she articulates her lines, makes this ""a worth 2 hours of your life"" film. Other than that, I liked the narratives, the humor, the minor plot twists, the location of the film on the nice little town of Ojai, and last and not least the movie soundtrack selection is Superb 👌 In the end this movie is pretty much what you'd expect from a teen comedy film, as the film covers the issues that is known to concern a typical teenager. Conclusion: I thought it would be a boring movie, like a lot of some teen comedies I watched in the past, but I'm actually impressed and i liked it a lot. For those who didn't watched this movie, give it a try.I give it a Solid 7 out of 10PS: And for those wondering what road is in the movie credits, here's the address: Fordyce Rd, Ojai",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A,"Easy A, I was in for a fun little highschool comedy after the few recent movies I watched and this delivered more than I expected with some really fun and creative dialog writing. Combined with some great acting and you've got a perfectly fun movie.Directing, if anything it's a pretty looking movie with most shots being at the golden hour, some fun little creative bits here and there. The pacing is great and it flies by as it should.Writing, mostly dialog writing. It's refreshing to have a smart script here and dialog you actually want to listen to in a comedy of this style, as it's not the usual hur-dur but it actually have clever comebacks and smart jokes. The parent, oh wow, the jokes for the parent just hit it for me. The dad is incredibly funny and the delivery of the lines was just perfect. There's so many little ''throw away'' lines that jus click for me and made it really enjoyable. The writing especially makes our main character stand out from the bunch being a bit more geeky than ordinary. Which helped a lot for the story.Acting and characters. Stone is fantastic, I have to admit I really have not seen a lot from here and it's bound to change because she shows quite the range and just ongoing charisma in this that is unmistakably infectious. Side characters just as good and do their part, special shout out to Tucci though, and Armisen was a fun surprise to see, always owns his roles. Church was fun to see too but his storyline was a bit meh and I don't think he did much with the character either.Music, lots of it, almost never any downtime. Helps with the pace, but does veer into the territory of ''cheating'' and disconnects you a little from some more intimate moments or smaller moments. That said, it's a lovably nostalgic score that I've grown to like more and more. Power of nostalgia I guess.Story, typical highs and lows, nothing groundbreaking. Romance is a bit forced but okay in the end.Fun entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Emma Stone's Unveiling! She Was Amazing!,"While Easy A won't necessarily blow anyone away with its shallow storyline, its performances particularly Emma Stone's, & novel approach to teen comedies makes it worthwhile. In this 2010 hidden gem, writer Bert Royal redefines the sex-crazed teens genre, through its winning mature central character and premise, that's more self-aware than what is usually allowed by pictures of the same comedic flavor. This fresh, thoughtful approach of course, thrives on Emma Stone's career defining portrayal. Here, the newfound star delivers both charm and sass in the most praiseworthy & natural means, that it is a breeze to cheer for her character's resolve. She was basically irresistible, capturing audiences whether through her monologues or on-point comedic timing. Happily, Stone's fantastic portrayal is met head on by Easy A's SUPERB supporting cast, headlined by Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson & Amanda Bynes whose resurfacing, was an absolute welcome surprise. The personas of these notables adds layers of entertaining personalities as Stone's unconventional quirky parents & over-the-top religious nemesis. This ushers enjoyable interactions & banters, another one of Easy A's amusing feats.Carried by an endlessly charismatic Emma Stone & a strong supporting cast that takes advantage of a clever, witty script & a narrative that is equal parts atypical, ridiculous & winningly grown-up, it is easy to understand why Easy A was dubbed as the comedy of the year.

"A comedy film American teenager, but with two crucial differences to its operation: Emma Stone and a great screenplay, filled with many good references","""Easy A"" is the film that definitely revealed to the world one of the best young actresses of recent decades: Emma Stone. The actress had appeared in equity in some TV series and Algus other good comedy movies like ""Superbad (2007)"", ""The House Bunny (2008)"", ""Paper Man (2009)"", ""Zombieland (2009)"", but with ""Easy A"", Emma won once its deserved prominence seen indicated as the best actress in a film comedy musical for this work and winning the MTV Movie Awards for best comedic performance, and other indications. The character Olive was made for her. Anyone who has seen Emma realizes that giving interviews wit, the way you talk, the irony of Olive very own personality Emma, who is naturally funny without forcing at any time. Her talent is amazing for drama (as we see in The Help (2011), for comedy as in ""Easy A"". The biggest revelation of the last few years and with undeniable merits. Not to speak staggering in its beauty and charisma. Difficult even was to believe that a girl as beautiful and with that intelligence and sense of humor go unnoticed at school as shown in the film. Emma is the soul of the film and can watch the movie on the original audio because everything is so much funnier, especially the lines of Olive.Movie film debut of screenwriter Bert V. Royal and only the second film from director Will Gluck, who had only the curriculum Fired Up! (2009) the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) who is an invisible girl in his school, the typical girl which has its presence known by anyone except her friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). For she did not have to leave with parents Rhiannon on a weekend camping, she minds having a date with a boy. On Monday following Rhiannon asks how was the date, and to keep the story, says that Olive lost her virginity to him, but everything is heard by Marianne Bryant (Amanda Bynes), one conservative and religious extremist, spreading rumors the college and soon the unknown Olive becomes the center of attention. The situation changes the way people look at Olive, which makes her feel divided: while we feel bad for looking at it through a lie, she likes to finally get the attention of people. With that her new found fame, she identifies with the main character of the novel The Scarlet Letter and ends up helping more people off from school to be more views, pretending you had sex with them for money. The situation enhances even more when she accepted the proposal made by Brandon (Dan Byrd), her gay friend, that pretend to have sex during a school party where all are present. Thus, Brandon stops being chased, and Olive takes the time to figure slut school. Only she could not imagine the consequences would reach far his fame.It is interesting to see how the character Olive deconstructs all social relations, making them ever more banal and less true. The comedy is based on a typical American scene - a school with all possible types of adolescents and people - and inserts all possible stereotypes of the genre, and totally distort. Everyone their act with a specific motivation. We have a protagonist who was never noticed and it begins to receive the attention of all, we have the extreme religious acts that by their beliefs, the friend who happens to be jealous of the fame of his friend, etc.Of course, we know that it is all based on a lie, but is it so objectionable Olive so the decision to carry on the story? Even she can help other kids in school, their situation only increases their bad reputation. Does the decision to Olive, though it may be of help, it should be carried forward? Besides the willingness to help, Olive goes also to act as revenge. Revenge for her best friend that does not have the supported his new popularity. Revenge of the extremist religious college who spend their miserable lives. The protagonist has no control of his actions to see if this hatred filled, so that embodies adulterous protagonist of the book you are reading in class. The provocation only increases the desire to continue with this character. And when the lie becomes dangerous and reputation collapses? When the school counselor, played by Lisa Kudrow, asks Olive assume their DST, the film reaches the crucial point that shows the degree reached the lies told by the girl.The film also shows a report on bullying in schools, the lack of interest of directors towards students and homosexuality and how it is still seen by intolerant people. Finally, we have a teen comedy with an edge over the others in the genre: it has a great and original screenplay. Since the creation of the lie, the course with ""snowball effect"" and all its consequences in the life of Olive and all that surround it, until the conclusion of the story in a very creative, realistic and plausible. It is a comedy that makes you laugh at times and you keep a smile on his face all the time. Great direction of Will Gluck, good supporting cast with Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Amanda Bynes, Penn Badgley, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson.The soundtrack to Brad Segal is also used very competent and only helps to maintain the pace of the plot, and the songs used are all current pop references very successful, as ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" by Natasha Bedingfield, ""Bad Reputation ""by The Dollyrots,""Good Life"" by OneRepublic, among others.It is a comedy film American teenager, but with two crucial differences to its operation: it has a good script (including inserting multiple citations '80s movies like Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club, and literary works, specifically "" The Scarlet Letter ""author Nathaniel Hawthorne) and interpretation of Emma Stone as its differentials.

a trip down memory lane,"The movie's most endearing quality is the homage paid to Eighties movies, that moment when it all comes together as Olive dreams about being in her own John Hughes movie. Yes, I have fond memories of SAY ANYTHING's seminal boombox scene and CAN'T BUY ME LOVE in its entirety, and it was great to see them referenced. And people, that song, that haunting melody, I still get the shivers, all together now, Don't You Forget About Me...Emma Stone is kind of EveryGirl in this movie, obviously adding to her appeal, obviously the new Lindsey Lohan of that time. And this movie has a strong MEAN GIRLS vibe. Must say, Amanda Bynes was pushing it, playing too young. Just checked, seems to have been her last movie. (not that that's what I wanted, I was just criticizing) Kudos to Stanley Tucci and the wonderful Patricia Clarkson and Stevie, the most popular on-screen dog with me besides Buck of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN. Not forgetting Thomas Hayden Church and Lisa Kudrow, although I have a hard time watching her here. The younger male cast doesn't exactly do it for me, that dude who played Brandon soon irritated me, and the other one, Penn Badgley or something like that, doesn't do much better. Ally Michalka good performance, and that girl who played Nina superfine and all too convincing in the part. Come on, Cam Gigandet as a wuss? Well, by some stretch of the imagination only.Best line: Principal Malcolm McDowell's ""if I keep the girls off the pole and the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.""It's a total chick flick. I would not recommend it to guys at all. Me myself I go where the pretty actresses hang out and I gave Emma Stone a shot as (laugh uncontrollably now), in pics, she reminded me of Melinda Clarke in THE O.C. and NIKITA (okay, you can text Emma Stone that) but turns out not-so-much in the movie. But this is a chick flick with not even one inkling of aspiring to appeal to guys. Okay, I take that back, there's the burlesque leggy lingerie dance scene towards the end, but by then, most guys would have left the room. For this is a total, total chick flick that the vast majority of girls can relate to, but guys would think it's all just a silly storm in a teacup. That's if they hadn't run screaming out of the room at the mention of chlamydia... Like I said, chick flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Quality teen comedy,"Easy A is not your average trashy teen comedy. It recalls memories of Mean Girls and even a few hints of the less impressive Saved!. It has a magnificent cast and witty dialogue that makes it quite enjoyable to watch.Easy A is about a girl who lies about losing her virginity only for the gossip to spread around the school. Instead of correcting the rumours she goes along with them and in the process helps out a few outcasts by ""fake rocking their worlds"". The only problem is the gossip gets out of hand and starts causing unexpected damage.The references to the Scarlet Letter are an interesting addition to the story and Olive (Emma Stone) plays out a modern day version of the story quite well.The dialogue is not what you would expect from a typical teenager today especially teens used to talking in texting lingo. The humour is sarcastic and extremely witty and I loved every minute of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It won't change your life,"This isn't an in-depth account of school life, reputation and bullying. It lacks characterisation of actors who are significant to the plot. We are required to accept that the stunning Emma Stone is something of a wall-flower. All in all, there are a number of ways in which this film could be criticised.On the other hand, the script is delicious, with surprises, laugh out loud moments, good acting and clever build ups to denouements. It's a fun way to spend 90 minutes or so. It is well worth watching.Cleverly, the script is not patronising. Stone is meant to be clever - it's part of the plot - and the dumb ones, while in the majority, are confused. As one would expect. As you can see, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a little film, but it is a little gem. I've rated it 7. If it could give it 7.5, I would have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Loses a lot of steam in the second half,"I'm conflicted about Easy A. The story is interesting, but the plot is uneven. It loses a lot of steam in the second half.

Also, for a movie that portrays a strong ""don't judge"" message, it sure judges Christianity pretty harshly.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I thought the humour wasn't lame. It was truly funny. I enjoyed the movie pretty much. Can't see any reason why you can't do the same.I gotta tell you, I love Emma Stone.

"Shows that the teen comedy still has life in it, with a star-making turn by Emma Stone","Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is a confident and highly intelligent girl that is doing well at school until she lies to her best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) to get out of a camping trip. Rhiannon presses her for details and Olive ends up telling her that she and her made-up boyfriend had sex. They are overheard by the school religious freak Marianna (Amanda Byrnes), who spreads the gossip around like wildfire. Olive is then approached by her old friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), a boy who is being bullied because he is gay. He asks her if she will pretend to have sex with him in order to convince others that he is straight, to which she reluctantly agrees. Soon Olive is making money from desperate boys wanting to be known for having sex with her, at the cost of her reputation.It's rare that teen comedies actually get the formula right, especially in the last ten years or so. There was a boom back in the late 1990's, started by the hugely successful American Pie (1999), which lasted a good ten years and is still a successful marketplace. If Easy A shares any similarities to any of the teen comedies of recent years, then it's the Tina Fey-scripted Mean Girls (2004), which was a smart and very funny story of high school rivalry and bitchiness. Yet Easy A shares it's true roots with a different era of teen films - the 1980's. Director Will Gluck's favourite film is Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), and the love and homages are plain to see. Olive even fantasises about her life being like a John Hughes movie.Like Mean Girls, the screenplay is fantastic, and has a talent in Emma Stone to chew on the lines (I'll get to her later). Not only is the script very smart and funny, it's also venomous. Scriptwriter Bert V. Royal has created a highly intelligent character in Olive that can spit back an insult as good as anybody. When studying The Scarlet Letter (of which the film is obviously based on) in English class, one of the religious freaks who is disgusted by the rumours states her disapproval for the lead character in the book, before turning to Olive and saying 'perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe, you abominable tramp,' to which Olive replies 'maybe you should get a wardrobe, you abominable t**t!'. Shocking, vicious, and very funny.But the film's masterstroke is Emma Stone. While it's hard to believe that she blends into the background (as she describes at the beginning of the film - I mean, come on, she's gorgeous), she gives a performance full of swagger and confidence. Husky-voiced and super-smart, she gives Olive - who in somebody else's hands might quickly become unsympathetic or annoying - a likability and vulnerability that makes her wholly endearing. Her talent was always obvious from her supporting roles in Superbad (2007) and Zombieland (2009), but this will surely catapult her to wholly deserved stardom.If there's complaints to be made about the film, then some of the clever-clever quips and the interactions with her rather annoying parents (played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) can be cloying, and the film does rather run out of steam near to the end. But the film remains enjoyable, charming and genuinely funny. And it's a strong reminder that the teen comedy still has life in it, given a decent script and a bit of heart.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Modern Day Scarlet Letter A,"I have only a few words for this movie.It is very realistic yet funny. The rumors and gossips can destroy one's life. These should never be practiced. Lies will always hurt people in so many ways.The protagonist is unbelievably beautiful. I do not know why she was saying those words in the beginning of the movie that no one notices her! I think the director should have cast a little less beautiful person in this character. It is impossible not to notice her. The moment I saw her in this movie, after so many years I was telling myself that Oh why this girl is so beautiful!!!! Really! the protagonist should have been played by someone else of lesser beauty.And the half naked male characters should think of personal hygiene a bit more.But overall story is very strong. It translates the modern day ostracism and the life of a woman who is victimized by it. The society is so damn unforgiving when it comes to girls and boys like this. It is unbelievable. It shows how teenage people are abusing technology and destroying social life of someone even without understanding it. If western world is infected with this virus called gossip at such an epidemic level then the society really is doomed. There is no helping it. The movie is the best remedy and eye opener for anyone who loves gossiping.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a really real movie,"The movie follows an adolescent girl in high school, as she takes on everyone at the school. Rumours and lies get out and eventually it comes back to her, and hard. we see the main character 'Olive' played by the cute and talented 'Emma Stone' go through this faze and we join along for all the ups and downs that she faces.The story of this movie is well written and easy to understand what is happening, there is not too much going on like you would expect with a movie based on lots of rumours. The casting is very well done and all the actors played there rolls exceptionally well making them feel real. it was like watching a movie that is believable and would happen in reality and not some made up story. It did a good job of showing how greedy some guys get and what they will do to get what they want. The characters dialogue is well scripted and well delivered in terms of the timing of comebacks and rhymes.My favorite characters would be the parents of Olive played by 'Patricia Clarkson' and 'Stanley Tucci'. in what little screen time they had, you could tell that they are funny and chilled back parents by the way that they presented themselves.The camera work was nice. I loved the long speed shot that was shown twice in the movie. it looked cool and was a creative way of showing the passing of rumours from one person to the next. I also enjoyed the opening and ending credits, the way that it was 3D tracked to the shots was cool and different.Overall it is not an amazing movie but worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not your typical teenage comedy,"I watched Easy A a few years ago and I got the impression it was simply a teenage comedy that wasn't really very good, but Emma Stone just made it ten times better, illuminating the whole film with her pretty, charming face. This is something a lot of people think, giving the comments here. It's wrong.The film is good. A few days ago, after watching 'Magic in the Moonlight', I decided to see some more of Stone, and of course I thought of 'Easy A'. Watched it again and now that I pay more attention I discovered this movie itself is really nice and well- written, a film that goes beyond the typical, silly comedy targeting teenagers. Actors are excellent, script is good and dialogues are actually funny. On top of that, of course there's this brilliant, witty, pretty, intelligent Emma Stone. She is in fact capable of making a bad script/movie look good, but it's just not needed - it's already funny and entertaining and well-written.Actually, I remember it had a lower score here on IMDb than it has now. I'm glad more people watched and re-thinked it and this was fixed. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
For Teenage Audiences...But Still Funny,"Emma Stone delivers a hilarious performance as the sarcastic and lovable Olive, who pretends to lose her virginity to a school mate, Brandon, in order to help his reputation and dupe people into thinking he's not really homosexual.As far as the comedy goes, it's very teenager-in-high-school based. It's also very family orientated based comedy. Amanda Bynes plays a over-the-top Christian who helps start a rumor about Olive and is basically the film's antagonist.I found the comedy very endearing and not at all raunchy. It's mostly a clean comedy but there's actually quite a bit of romance in the film, surprisingly. The jokes came quick and at random, but very easy to understand. It's relatable to anyone who's attended or is attending high school. It's even easier to relate to when Olive begins to get some flak for the rumors being spread. I have been in her position of having a rumor spread about me.It's got a feel of an ensemble cast, regardless of the fact that Bynes and Stone are advertised as the main attractions. I feel that without all the subsequent characters that the movie wouldn't have had such a great progression and development. As the film progresses, the characters all develop very well and easily paced.I only found one really tiny problem with the movie. I felt the plot was a little bit tame and the 2 film paced a little too slow. I realize it's hard to write this type of movie and be original. I just felt that the movie moves very slow and a lot of the time, I kept wondering why I was still interested...or if I even was still interested. After about the first 30 minutes, the movie is no longer engaging.I still found it to be a decently entertaining movie and it's a funny teen romance movie. It's a good date movie, for sure. It's a fun movie for teens and maybe some adults. It's target audience is definitely for high school-ers.

"Stereotypical, bigoted pseudo-comedy","What can one expect of a film, which is supposed to be a comedy, that resorts to situations like:1)A promiscuous school counselor, 2) A chlamydia-infected Christian teenager, 3) A closeted gay, 4) ""Modern"" parents: the mother was a self-confessed slut, the father an ex-gay (sic). 5) An overly fanatical Christian girl, 6) A not-so-trusty pastor, 7)A ""disgusting"" fat boy, 8) etc.Well, first of all, this type of movie shows that those Hollywood geniuses are big cowards. They only have the guts to attack certain groups of people, e.g. Christians. Funny thing is that they do not have the guts to ridicule other religions. I wonder what would happen if they portrayed Muslims or black evangelicals like they portray white Christians in films.OK, I know movies do not represent real situations and it is OK to exaggerate. But do everything needs to be about sex? All the time? Can't they think about anything that does not involve sex? Can't they come up with a funny situation that does not involve some sort of toilette humor or sex?Is it OK to be a ""deviant""? That what these movies show all the time.Not even Mark Twain is left alone. They always put forward this idea that for one to be happy one needs to have some sort of ""peculiar"" sexual behavior, like the pseudo-liberal post-modern parents of the main character.Without Emma Stone (the only positive in this film) Easy A would have flunked catastrophically , because of her it deserved a D-...",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The story is about a girl names Olive who is a nobody at school, and gets the taste of rumors around school first hand. The movie got a PG-13 rating, which was okay for what it was, but the movie was definitely border line R. I would recommend this movie to a high school student. An adult? Not exactly.

"A re-imagination of The Scarlet Letter, with a modern twist or two.","""That's the beauty of being a girl in high school. People hear you had sex once, and bam, you're a bimbo.""I wouldn't quite put Easy A on the level of Superbad or Mean Girls, but it's a better than average teen comedy that comes at the typical high school tropes from a slightly different angle, and feels fresh, as a result.The movie works so well because of Emma Stone's performance as Olive, a  wickedly smart and kind-hearted high school girl whose white lies and attempt to do a good deed to help friend avoid bullying, ends up giving her quite the slutty reputation, thanks to the school rumor mill and a group of absurdly over-the-top group of religious students. Olive decides to (pretend to) embrace her newfound status as the school's most notorious fallen woman, but the gossip eventually gets way out of her control, and unfortunate consequences result.Stone had already proved in Superbad, Zombieland, and The House Bunny that she has a gift for playing the funny hot chick (though in this movie she's initially not very popular with the high school guys...yeah, right), and she has great on-screen chemistry with Amanda Bynes, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Aly Michalka, and the rest of her co- stars. This is a great cast all-around. No complaints in that area.Even when some of the jokes don't amuse as much as they could have (don't get me wrong, there are plenty of times that you'll be rolling with laughter), Emma Stone is so likable and has such great screen presence that I never lost interest.

Slowly Becomes Interesting,"Easy A is not a good movie. The first half is incredibly boring and uninteresting, while the second half is the exact opposite of that. And this does not make a good experience.The writing is mostly bad, most of the jokes didn't land for me, there was only one or maybe two occasions when I laughed out loud. The writer's view of the world is too simple: Christians are evil jerks and they are extremely dogmatic, people with old way of thinking are dumb and liberals are awesome and fun. These are too basic stereotypes, in other words: a false representation of the world we live in. Maybe I didn't really enjoy this movie, because I need the characters to be layered and not just stereotypical representations of their race, religion etc.The directing, cinematography was average. The only thing I liked throughout the whole movie is the acting. It was generally good. Nothing extraordinary, but that's not always necessary.All in all, this movie is a fun watch at the end of the day, but the first half is very boring.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and Sweet!,"Easy A is a very funny and touching movie that pays homage to the John Hughes teen movies of the 1980's.

This is one of the reasons I love this film. I can relate to this film back from my days in high school.This film is about a girl who has no reputation and no one notices her. But that changes when sexual rumors spread about her. Now, she decides take her newfound popularity to her advantage.This is the film that made Emma Stone a star. She was a great scene stealer in both Zombieland and Superbad, but she comes into her own here. I also loved the parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson. They are hilarious and lovable but dim-witted. I also give credit to Amanda Bynes and her religious cult. That was pretty funny.Overall, this is a hilarious but relatable teen comedy. I bet no one would have thought that the critics would love this and do quite well at the box office. I was one of the doubters but now I'm a believer.

Easy A is Easily an A!,"In a world where the teenage-high school film genre is a worn out and tired formula, 'Easy A' shines by offering something new. It's funny, smart, witty, and never settles for the cliché. 'Easy A' is easily an A!Emma Stone stars in her breakout role as the film's main character, Olive Penderghast. Olive, is apparently a ""nobody"" at East Ojai High School, and her best and only friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), is obnoxiously foul-mouthed. At the start of the film Rhiannon invites Olive to her family's camping trip for the weekend. Olive lies and says she has plans that weekend, going on a date with a guy. Lying is the central aspect of 'Easy A.'After the weekend, in which Olive did nothing but stay upstairs and listen nonstop to a song she hates (Pocketful of Sunshine), Rhiannon insistently asks for details about her ""date."" Olive ends up lying and saying she lost her virginity over the weekend. However, a problem quickly arises when the school's extremely religious Christian classmate, Marianne (Amanda Bynes), overhears Olive admitting she lost her virginity. Soon enough the entire school learns of Olive's lost virginity. Olive may have been ""invisible"" before, but now all the attention's on her.Olive hasn't told anyone the truth yet, but when she's in detention (for calling a fellow Christian extremist a bad, bad word) she ends up revealing the truth to a fellow detention-mate, Brandon, who is gay and gets bullied for it every day. When Brandon asks Olive to fake having sex with him, she initially rejects his proposal. However, the nice and helpful girl that she is, Olive agrees to the plan to help end Brandon's bullying. The two enact their plan at a party, where there are sure to be many witnesses, and soon enough everyone believes and falls for the plan. Days later, more and more guys, mostly the ""nerdy"" or ""loser"" types, pay Olive to pretend they did a variety of things with her in order to raise their high school social-status. Olive is now opened for business.See, Olive's problem isn't that she's a pathological liar or anything. Olive just wants to help people who are down in the dumps. She downgrades her reputation to improve others'. Throughout all this trampy and trashy mess, we still like Olive because Emma Stone's portrayal of her is charming and confident. Emma Stone has also starred in 'Superbad' and 'Zombieland.' I've only seen 'Zombieland,' but she was great in that, too.'Easy A' boasts a strong ensemble cast that includes a variety of hilariously memorable characters. Olive's parents are some of the many highlights in the film, hilariously portrayed by Stanley Tucci (The Lovely Bones) and Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island). Olive's parents are the parents that every teenager wished they had. They're carefree, yet at the same time supportive and trustful of their children. Olive's favorite and likable teacher, Mr. Griffith, is portrayed by Thomas Haden Church (George of the Jungle, Spider-Man 3, Imagine That), and his wife is memorably portrayed by Lisa Kudrow (Friends). Kudrow may seem like just another funny character thrown into the mix, but she's actually more important to the film as it goes on.The film may have one big conflict, which is Olive's lies and downgrading reputation, but this one conflict soon causes many more problems for her. She loses old friends and new friends. Many guys have payed Olive to pretend to do many things with her, but not one guy has asked her out on a real date, and she wonders why. Another problem arises that concerns Marianne's also extremely Christian boyfriend (Cam Gigandet), and it's a pretty shocking one and will surely catch you off- guard.'Easy A' is never clichéd, not even with it's romantic side. There's a guy (portrayed by Penn Badgley from The Stepfather) Olive has had a crush on for years, and there's a part in the film where they seem to be closer and their relationship seems to escalate. How come, of all the guys at her school, the one boy Olive likes doesn't believe all the rumors? The guy's reasoning and explanation for this is a good one, and it makes sense because it ties into something Olive indistinctly mentioned to us early on in the film.Six years ago we were given 'Mean Girls', which offered something new to the teenage-high school-comedy genre. 'Mean Girls' was hilarious and clever, and 'Easy A' is pretty much in the same league as it. This is the first film I've seen by director Will Gluck, who also directed 2009′s 'Fired Up!'. Gluck's next film, 'Friends with Benefits,' is to be released next year, and once again features Emma Stone and Patricia Clarkson, as well as Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis (That 70′s Show), and Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, Seven Pounds).PS: 'Mean Girls' is one of the most quotable films ever. 'Easy A' is probably just as funny, and also has some quotable lines, though not as much as 'Mean Girls.'PSS: 'Easy A' features cameos that include: Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), Lalaine (Lizzie McGuire), and Fred Armisen (Saturday Night Live).PSSS: If you don't believe me that 'Easy A' is an amazing comedy film, or with my friends, here's some extra commentary: Justin Timberlake – ""Wanna see a movie that's great??? Go see Easy A tonight!!! E. Stone rocks in it. 'Nuff said"" Taylor Swift – ""Just saw Easy A. Easily, definitely, absolutely my new favorite movie.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good 1....,"'Easy A' is a good flick, in fact it's amongst the better films to come out of Hollywood this year. Director Will Gluck, succeeds by making an ideal teen flick, which has potential to gain a cult following in the coming time.

Her journey is filled of lies, entertainment and liveliness.If there is an glitch in the film, is it's culmination. Mediocre and truly been-there-done-that, done with it stuff. The Screenplay which is so innovative and interesting, suddenly takes a summer-salt, which in turn spoils the climax. Writer Bert V. Royal, could've truly worked on it. Nonetheless, his writing is spot-on. Will Gluck's direction is good.Emma Stone is the life of 'Easy A'. She delivers exactly or more than the Screenplays demand, and as mentioned, is fantastic throughout. She truly deserves some awards for her performance in here. Among other performers, the ever likable Stanley Tucci, delivers wonderfully.On the whole, though not a A+ plus, a well-done 'check this out' flick.

A great premise but the writing really disappoints...,"Although the film begins with some great opening credits and had a great idea for a plot, the rest of the film really, really disappoints due to bad (VERY bad) writing. So, they took a very good idea and made the least of it.The idea of a high school girl PRETENDING to be a slut isn't a bad idea. And her then helping a gay kid by pretending to sleep with him to stop the other kids from picking on him was great. But, the characters in this film are at best cartoony--walking stereotypes who lack believability. They don't act or talk like any teenagers--at least not on this planet. Take, for instance, Amanda Bynes. She plays the most one-dimensional religious zealot--and ALL her Christian friends and family are all bigoted hypocritical jerks. Olive Oyl from the Popeye cartoons has more depth than these characters! As far as the rest of the characters go, they all seem to try too hard, speak hipster lingo too often and just seem like bad fan fiction. Todd is JUST a plot device--not a person. And, on top of all that, the main character is too smart and glib to be real--and difficult to like and she often behaves inexplicably.The bottom line is despite a HUGE ad campaign to sell this film (often a sure sign that a Hollywood films sucks) and a clever idea, they do nothing with the premise and the film is a bore. And, I might add, the film isn't great for teens either as it's rather crude, smarmy and might just make them stupider. Dumb and unbelievable when it COULD have made some sort of positive statement.Oh, and the ""Knock on Wood"" number near the end might just be one of the dumbest I've seen in ages.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stone and Gluck make it work; this is the year's best comedy and the best teen film since the '80s.,"We've all been through high-school before. We've all faced this - angst, fitting in, etc. It becomes too worrying and too much discussed about in today's society that high-school angst has become somewhat of a cliché in modern media, be it books, music, and movies - due to the ever increasing number of teenagers reading/listening/watching these high- school stuff - they can relate to it.Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" may very well be a great teen comedy - perhaps the best since John Hughes' teen classics from the '80s (that this film does so proudly pay homage to and reference as well), and with an injection of intelligence to boot. This is a rare comedy that not only makes you care and connect with the characters, it ironically defines the ""status quo"" and the rumor mill of high school and plays it for genuine laughs, and not just cheap stabs at it.From a witty and razor-sharp script by Bert V. Royal (that manages to satirize every teen cliché past and present from dating to Facebook), director Will Gluck manages to balance perfect comedy timing, whip-smart dialogue and the actor's charming performances without overusing or overplaying the joke to the extent of gross exaggeration. Here, a little lie by ""unknown"" Olive that is mis-understandingly heard by other people and thus places her in the rumor mill of her high school, where her lie is spread like wildfire. Rather than trying to get rid of the rumor at first, Olive comes up with a strategy to get herself known to school and then bravely capitalizes and even expands the rumor to become the ""harlot"" of the school, so to speak. She even refers herself sometime to the main character Hester from the novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" to which this film is also largely influenced by, but done in a comedic way (the film also takes numerous jabs at the so- called disastrous Demi Moore/Gary Oldman film hilariously).This is where teenage angst and the whole nine yards comes in and it's pretty true. If you don't have sex, you're a nobody. If you do have sex and you're a female, that automatically qualifies you as ""impure"", so to speak, by other people of the same age and slightly older. Royal also plays the rumor mill like a toy and he gleefully but not grossly exaggerates the spread of rumors like wildfire. Gluck uses this and with some light and fleet-footed direction he lively brings this the characters and story to a medium that can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of the suitable PG-13 rating, so as long as they're not strictly and overtly Christian, which this film also brilliantly satirizes very well. Yes, it is hilarious and smart, but at times it can become dramatic - and justifiably so - especially at the second half of the movie. You really feel for the character Olive that you wouldn't mind the comedic timing being off a bit. And there are a few clichés, but they are both played straight and cleverly referenced, well-woven together by Gluck that one wouldn't mind seeing there.Emma Stone is a charming, adorable and talented young actress with perfect comedy timing and here she puts her charm, looks and wit to terrific use. She fits the lead role Olive perfectly like a glove and you are firmly placed at her side and will be rooting for her character. If there is any indication that Stone will become a big name in the future than this film certainly proves it. The other actors are also great thank's to Gluck's direction - Amanda Bynes as the too-super Christian Marianne is terrific and she handles a very satirical part very well. I especially enjoyed Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci's performances as Olive's parents - they are not only 100% supportive of their children, but they are also carefree, extremely like-able AND reasonable, something not too commonly seen in many teen movies. Maybe it's due to their hippie-like personalities. I can't say, I like 'em. Penn Badgley, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Cam Gigandet, Aly Michalka and some brief appearances by Malcolm McDowell and Lisa Kudrow round up the solid supporting ensemble, but it is Stone's show here and she picks it up and runs with it all the way to the finish line.More than a teen movie with heart - Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" is everything a teen flick should be - fun, sassy and lively. At the same time, ""Easy A"" accomplishes other feats quite unusual for teen films - it is an intelligent social satire that isn't just on the high school ""status quo"" and ""rumor mill"" (lest we forget extreme Christian followers like Marianne), it is both a satire and a tribute to John Hughes and his teen films of the '80s as well as ""The Scarlet Letter"", and a star- making role from the ever-promising and witty Emma Stone. It is easily the best modern teen comedy (perhaps of the decade?) that I have seen in a while and the best comedy of 2010.The crew-members and cast may be different and John Hughes may be gone but his spirit and influence is ever-present in this film and he lives on here.Overall rating: 76/100",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Awesome movie,"This was an excellent and fun flick. I definitely recommend seeing this with your pals, with your sister or boyfriend (the first two more though, this is more of a teen chick-flick than anything else). The ONLY thing that this could've done better is the ending, it felt kinda rushed for me. Still, it's a good one.Emma Stone did FANTASTIC in this, I think if another actress had played her, this movie wouldn't have done half as well. She has a ton of potential to be in films like this AND (hopefully, since she'll be starring in the new Spiderman) serious ones.The rest of the cast did well, although I would've liked it if Cam and Penn switched their characters, but that's just me :p Overall, an excellent feel-good Saturday night-y movie to see with your friends. Provided a lot of laughs and wasn't ridiculously cheesy, which is more than I can say for a lot of other teen flicks out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy-going teen film for young adults,"Overall 'Easy A' is a good film. Its not great but it holds for being a movie centered around the Mid-to-Late 2000's. Some jokes seemed pushed but overall things were funny even though you could predict what they would say.Topics like teen angst, social clout, sex, and virginity are often overused but this film keeps them fresh. Olive, the lead character, actually undergoes growth even though other characters are just automatically given solutions and become better people. Also Olive's parents were probably the funniest characters.Good film, not great. But overall most enjoyable for young adults who are able to relate to the topics mentioned.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I liked this film,"This is a rather interesting highschool film. There are very few interesting American films about highschool, though the Japanese made superb films such as Whisper of the Heart, about highschool life. This is certainly not remotely as good as that drama masterpiece, though it shouldn't be compared to it. However, it is certainly one of the best of its genre: the ""American Teen Movie"" genre.The interactions between the characters look remarkably realistic, considering that it is a film operating under the traditional rules of Hollywood film-making. Not as realistic as some other films, though, such as the aforementioned Whisper of the Heart, but still remarkably realistic.I would highly recommend this for someone who likes to remember how highschool life was. Though it is far from being a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Comedy and Emma Stone is the best,"I love this movie solely for the amazing comedy in it. The jokes don't feel too in your face and Olive's sarcastic personality is done perfecting by Emma Stone. She embodies the character so well and has that badass attitude that doesn't feel fake at all. Olive is put into the completely embarrassing scenario of everyone finding out that you lost your virginity, but she has that specific personality that can just make the story so funny. Even if she's technically still a virgin, the whole school believes that she's not. That specific scenario with the characters and cast is probably what makes the film so good. It doesn't even try to be serious, and I feel like it was saved by the amazing performances that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, in this film did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Decent Morden high school movie,"Yes I know this movie is like 5 years but a lot of older movies have newer reviews so why not. The movie follows a high school student Olive (Emma Stone) a she uses the rumor mill to advance her high school life but soon things aren't good as they seem.Now the movie isn't laugh out loud funny or really goofy like most movies of it's kind but there is some jokes and scenes that will have you laughing on the floor though. But also most it's kind, it's got a really good story to it that keeps you watching and a even a lesson learned in the end. Now there's some typical high school movie clichés here in there but that's to be expected because of the movies theme and tone. The performances are great everyone did their best especially Emma Stone she's outstanding in the role as Olive. The soundtrack is there's a lot catchy tunes in there you could say even a cover Joan Jett's Bad Reputation. So it's worth checking out if you're into high school movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Easy A"" gets an A for Awesome! Emma Stone is absolutely terrific!","Olive (Emma Stone) is your typical high school outcast. She is smart, sarcastic, and smarter than your average student, which is why she is invisible in high school. One Friday, Olive's best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) asks her to come away for a weekend with her and her parents. Olive respectfully declines because she states she has a date with a college freshman named George over the weekend. This isn't true mind you but just a little white lie because Olive finds Rhiannon's parents a little odd. When Monday rolls around, Rhiannon asks Olive about her date and keeps on asking her if she ""did it"" over the weekend. This is where the fun begins as Olive decides to tell yet another little white lie that turns her world upside down. Lots of laughs, fun, and 80 movie references ensue...If John Hughes were still alive today, he would be happy to see someone create a feel good teenage comedy that really lives up to all of his 80s classics. That was my first thought when I walked out of the theater after seeing ""Easy A"" over this past weekend. The movie, which from the trailer I always wanted to see but was worried about. Teen comedies today are a dime a dozen and most of them are so bland and boring that they are usually forgettable the moment you leave the theater. ""Easy A"" is truly a breathe of fresh air when it comes to teenage comedies mainly because of its story and even more importantly its cast.First off, the storyline in this film is fresh and fun. Some will say that this film is loosely based on ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, which it can be seen as to be fair. ""Easy A"" uses ""The Scarlet Letter"" as a joke within the film because Olive is reading the novel in her class and is apparently acting out the role of Hester Prynne, who is the main character in the novel. Anyway if the story of an outcast faking losing her virginity in order to get noticed isn't funny enough, you take that plot and go a step further, which makes it even funnier. By the middle of the film, Olive has said to have slept with at least half of the school. This, of course, is wildly untrue but at the same time just reminds the audience of how silly and jaded high school really is and was. The story while silly and fun really says a lot about how a lot of people are selfish for their own personal gain and are also more worried about how others view them rather than how they view themselves.Besides the storyline, the main reason this film works so well is because of Emma Stone, who proves here she has what it takes to hold a film. Emma Stone has always been a favorite of mine but this is the first time she has had a lead role. Stone is probably best known for her role in ""Zombieland,"" which she was good in but in ""Easy A"" she is just terrific. Stone isn't the typical Hollywood ""hottie"" because lets be honest she looks like your average girl. That's what makes Emma Stone so right for this role because its believable. Stone comes off as intelligent, sarcastic, and as someone who truly wants to be seen as something else. She is a natural in this role. I personally think Stone is a beautiful woman, not because of her body but because she carries herself with such an attractive personality and doesn't try to force sexiness upon the audience. She is just naturally a beautiful woman. I think in a few years from now, Stone will be looked upon as one of the best actresses in Hollywood. She really has a lot of talent and I can't wait to see her in future projects.As for the rest of the cast, they are all noteworthy as well. Patrica Clarkson and Stanley Tucci are just hilarious as Olive's parents. The playful yet loving relationship they had with Olive was refreshing and was much different than the completely controlling parents displayed in most teenage comedies. Both Clarkson and Tucci are terrific dramatic actors and it was nice seeing both of these talented actors play a silly and fun role for a change. Amanda Bynes plays Marianne, who is a religious nut job in the film. Her role in this film reminded me a lot of Mandy Moore's role in the film, ""Saved!"" I felt Bynes did a good job with the role but the entire time I kept wanting to see Mandy Moore play that role. I don't know why I guess when it comes to a crazy religious nut job Mandy Moore's face has been implanted in my brain. Thomas Haden Church is a nice addition to the cast. He plays his normal sarcastic guy role but in this film he actually isn't a douche-bag like he is in most of the other roles he plays. Even Lisa Kudrow, who I haven't seen in a film in years, does a good job with her small role.In the end, ""Easy A"" is probably one of the better films of 2010 and that came as a complete surprise to me. Sure its not an Oscar worthy piece of film-making but it's a very funny and enjoyable film from start to finish. This is the second film from director Will Gluck, who really may have some staying power in Hollywood and has really won me over with this film. As I said above, Stone is perfectly cast in the film and holds the film together like a pro. She is the reason to watch the film. Add on the funny and uniquely told story and you have yourself a fun filled little movie that makes you happy as pie when you leave the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Charming!,"The best way to describe Easy A is calling it a wiseass high school retelling of The Scarlet Letter. That can also be a temperature gauge for someone to tell ahead of time if it'll be there thing, or not. I enjoyed it a lot, thanks to a funny as hell Emma Stone who doesn't leave out the vulnerability peeking through her guise as strong young woman. It's a little more relaxed in the content department than some of the bawdier stuff that she got her start in, but still contains sufficient amounts of raunch to please the comedy hounds. Stone also has a veritable army of seasoned pros backing her up, an element which helps her, however she's quite capable of carrying a film and does so as well. She plays Olive, a spitfire high school girl who finds herself in a funny yet unfortunate situation after her dunce of a friend starts a wildfire sexual rumor about her. Soon the whole school is talking about it, and she takes action in a bizarre move to fight fire with fire...of a certain kind. She boldly takes up the mantle of the school harlot, forever changing things in her quiet serengetti of suburban youth. It all spins wildly out of control, a common characteristic of adolescence, with poor Olive stuck right in the middle of the debacle, which sucks for her but is too funny not to enjoy. Stanley Tucci (""The Bucket List"") and Patricia Clarkson are darlings as her parents, Thomas Haden Church scores points as a deliberately hip and sympathetic literature teacher, and Lisa Kudrow that old flamingo, has fun as a dour guidance counselor. There's also work from Amanda Bynes as an unhinged religious nut, the perpetually wooden Cam Gigandet, Penn Badgley and a brief cameo from Malcolm McDowell as the world's most cynical high school principal. As a riff on The Scarlett letter it keeps theme alive, and as a teen comedy with a gaggle of adults trying to keep up with the youngsters, it's a charmer. Stone holds the proceedings together very well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the Best Movies Ever!,"I LOVED this movie! I usually don't watch these types of movies, but I'm so glad I watched this one! Emma Stone is an amazing young actress who is going places.

Like Amanda Bynes is another great actress whom I wanted to mention. I saw her in ""Sydney White"" and this character is so different from the one she's playing now. Amazing job!!! The plot and the directing is amazing. Hopefully I will see more movies with the same cast and director soon.The songs used in this movie were out of this world good.

Easy A,"This high school comedy was a dark house last year and earned more than 80 million dollars in the box office in North America alone. It stars the new girlfriend of Spiderman Emma Stone as a modern THE SCARLET LETTER tale happened in high school without any vulgar slapstick which frequently reoccur in the recent comedies worked as set pieces. The tug-war between rumors and reputations is always tricky not only to teenagers.The film has a star-studded supporting cast, including Oscar nominees Thomas, Patricia and Stanley, as well as Lisa Kudrow, who surprisingly had a slightly repugnant role. Patricia and Stanley as the liberal parents does manifest a great affecting love and rapport with their children (the quirky respond to the adaption question), which is the most precious achievement of the film, deserves a standing ovation.Emma Stone is adorable in her first leading role, which earned her an Golden Globe nomination this year, her hoarse voice does distinguish her from other cheesy hot chicks and her personal temperament is perfect for her character, like it is emphasized in the film, the film reminds us of 80's teenage films made by the late John Hughes, time flies, nostalgia becomes the new trend, for example, the unrecognizable Amanda Bynes, I miss SHE'S THE MAN (2005) even though she is only 24 now.It is a big comfort to see a fresh teenage comedy focused on a high school girl instead of the popular nerdy geeks, and I do foresee a brighter future for Ms. Emma Stone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The plot is not believable at all, the script is encumbered with dialog that often makes the actors sound scripted, and the acting is extremely sub par overall.This movie has no sense of its own identity.

A John Hughes homage and a lot of overacting,"I really don't know what all the fuzz is about except for Emma Stone delivering solid acting.The story is far fetched about a high school student who is rumored to be a slut and she decides to go along with her new reputation. The director tries to mimic the feel of the earlier John Hughes movies, even bringing an homage to it by including extracts of The Breakfast Club and Ferris Buellers Day Off, but in the end delivers a rather hysterical take on high school. Except for Emma Stone as the lead, nearly all actors overact annoyingly.Easy A desperately tries to deliver a high school comedy with some more depth, but in the end gives you a headache. Who likes this kind of movies, should watch the original rather than this poor copy; check out 'The Breakfast Club' or 'Ferris Buellers Day Off'... both far superior to this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun, Especially If You Like John Hughes","Easy A is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"", but is an homage to the teen films of John Hughes. Director Will Gluck even uses clips from some of those films.Emma Stone plays Olive, the Hester Prynne of Ojai North High School. She is blessed with a script that gives her character intelligence and insight, combined with a mastery of pop culture references. The result is an extremely funny lampoon of various institutions and social conventions.Though Olive is the victim of social mores and social media, this comedy keeps things light, thanks to the prodigious charm of Ms. Stone. I might have to watch this film repeatedly to pick up all the references to other films and memes.Among the other great performances is Patricia Clarkson's portrayal of Olive's mother. She lends a quirkiness that feels genuine and is not demeaning to an older generation.If John Hughes can't grace us with more of his films, this is a welcome addition to the genre.(This review is approved by Abe Froman.

"A really fun comedy, with a great screenplay full of strong references of comedies of 80's, with a talented cast, with a remarkable work of Emma Stone","""Easy A"" is the film that definitely revealed to the world one of the best young actresses of recent decades: Emma Stone. The actress had appeared in equity in some TV series and Algus other good comedy movies like Superbad (2007), The House Bunny (2008), Paper Man (2009) Zombieland (2009), but with ""Easy A"", Emma won once its deserved prominence being indicated as the best actress in a film comedy-musical for this work and winning the MTV Movie Awards for best comedic performance, and other indications. The character Olive was made for her. Anyone who has seen Emma realizes that giving interviews wit, the way you talk, the irony of Olive very own personality Emma, who is naturally funny without forcing at any time. She is the biggest revelation of the last few years and with undeniable merits. Not to speak staggering in its beauty and charisma. Difficult even was to believe that a girl as beautiful and with that intelligence and sense of humor go unnoticed at school as shown in the film. Emma is the soul of the film and can watch the movie on the original audio because everything is so much funnier, especially the lines of Olive.Movie film debut of screenwriter Bert V. Royal and only the second film from director Will Gluck, who had only the curriculum Fired Up (2009) the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) who is an invisible girl in his school, the typical girl which has its presence known by anyone except her friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka). For she did not have to leave with parents Rhiannon on a weekend camping, she minds having a date with a boy. On Monday following Rhiannon asks how was the date, and to keep the story, says that Olive lost her virginity to him, but everything is heard by Marianne Bryant (Amanda Bynes), one conservative and religious extremist, spreading rumors the college and soon the unknown Olive becomes the center of attention.The situation changes the way people look at Olive, which makes her feel divided: while we feel bad for looking at it through a lie, she likes to finally get the attention of people. With that her new found fame, she identifies with the main character of the novel The Scarlet Letter and ends up helping more people off from school to be more views, pretending you had sex with them for money. The situation enhances even more when she accepted the proposal made by Brandon (Dan Byrd), her gay friend, that pretend to have sex during a school party where all are present. Thus, Brandon stops being chased, and Olive takes the time to figure slut school. Only she could not imagine the consequences would reach far his fame.It is interesting to see how the character Olive deconstruct all social relations, making them ever more banal and less true. The comedy is based on a typical American scene - a school with all possible types of adolescents and people - and inserts all possible stereotypes of the genre, and totally distort. Everyone their act with a specific motivation. We have a protagonist who was never noticed and it begins to receive the attention of all, we have the extreme religious acts that by their beliefs, the friend who happens to be jealous of the fame of his friend, etc. Of course, we know that it is all based on a lie, but is it so objectionable Olive so the decision to carry on the story?Even she can help other kids in school, their situation only increases their bad reputation. Does the decision to Olive, though it may be of help, it should be carried forward? Besides the willingness to help, Olive goes also to act as revenge. Revenge for her best friend that does not have the supported his new popularity. Revenge of the extremist religious college who spend their miserable lives. The protagonist has no control of his actions to see if this hatred filled, so that embodies adulterous protagonist of the book you are reading in class. The provocation only increases the desire to continue with this character. And when the lie becomes dangerous and reputation collapses? When the school counselor, played by Lisa Kudrow, asks Olive assume their DST, the film reaches the crucial point that shows the degree reached the lies told by the girl.The film also shows a report on bullying in schools, the lack of interest of directors towards students and homosexuality and how it is still seen by intolerant people. Finally, we have a teen comedy with an edge over the others in the genre: it has a great and original screenplay. Since the creation of the lie, the course with ""snowball effect"" and all its consequences in the life of Olive and all that surround it, until the conclusion of the story in a very creative, realistic and plausible. It is a comedy that makes you laugh at times and you keep a smile on his face all the time. Great direction of Will Gluck, good supporting cast with Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Amanda Bynes, Penn Badgley, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson.The soundtrack to Brad Segal is also used very competent and only helps to maintain the pace of the plot, and the songs used are all current pop references very successful, as ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" by Natasha Bedingfield, ""Bad Reputation"" by The Dollyrots, ""Good Life"" by One Republic, among others.It is a comedy film American teenager, but with two crucial differences to its operation: it has a good script (including inserting multiple citations 80s movies like Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club, and literary works, specifically ""The Scarlet Letter"" by author Nathaniel Hawthorne) and interpretation of Emma Stone as its differentials.Despite having a sexual theme present throughout the film, is not handled by ordinary director who changed the entire focus more on the consequences experienced by the protagonist because of lies told and passed up scenes more appealing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A (2010) - A Modern Take on The Scarlet Letter,"Released in 2010, *Easy A* directed by Will Gluck, is a witty and contemporary adaptation inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic novel, *The Scarlet Letter*.

The film deftly explores the consequences of social stigma and the perception of one's image in the era of social media, making it extremely relevant in the context of today's society.The supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, and Amanda Bynes, deliver stellar performances, enhancing the film's comedic and emotional elements.

It's not by any means a cinematic creation of importance - some good performances and a witty intelligent script but not much in terms of craftsmanship - but it's solid entertainment and it may be an effective generation-bridge between parents who were teenagers in the 80's and their own teenage children, one that's not nearly as embarrassing for inter-generation watch as most recent teenage rom-coms are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I am going to think of this movie's target audience, chiefly mildly interesting and intelligent girls in their mid teens to early thirties. This movie got some pretty warm reviews from both people on IMDb and critics. I didn't like it, I could see how this movie could have been good but just not to me. The parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are the best part of the movie. They are the kind of parents I hope to be someday. They are warm, funny, and have an open honest relationship with their kids. The relationship between Thomas Hayden Church and his wife played by Lisa Kudrow is interesting and complex. I even appreciate the multiple homages to John Hughes and other 80's movies that are similar to this one. Overall though I just didn't say wow. But that brings us back to the target audience. Look if you are a female in the age range listed above (and even outside of this range( you will probably like this movie regardless of personal possibly esoteric movie standards. If you are someone enthralled by 80's teen movies you might get a kick out of this. If you like barely legal hot chicks and dudes playing high school kids you might satisfy your personal fetish. However, If you watch only weird indy flicks or a lot of action/thriller movies, you will either hate it or be like me and say ""my life isn't better or worse for having seen this and I didn't try to commit ritual suicide during it, so ehhhhhhhhhh; but really mean eh (which is not as good as ehhhhhhhh.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy popcorn,"I watched this movie because I like Emma Stone and Amanda Bynes. They are pretty good in this film.

Fun Movie with a Delicate Message,"I grew up in the 80s so I appreciate the homages to several of those teen angst films mentioned in the movie. Its easy to like this film as the actors and plot are easy to digest while also no taking the situations too lightly.Emma Stone is excellent as Olive, a high school girl who lies about having sex to avoid hanging out with her friend for the weekend. She then helps a gay friend pretend he had sex with her to hide his sexuality. Once word gets out that she helped him, other outcast boys start requesting her ""services"". Soon, the rumors swirl and she becomes a modern day Hester Prynne from the Crucible. The lies keep compounding and she is helpless to stop the snowball.A great supporting cast includes Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Aly Michalka, Stanley Tucci, Fred Armisen, Penn Badgley and Dan Byrd.While its mostly a comedy, there are some dark themes explored about what children will do to be popular as well as how adults aren't the best role models...even when its their job. I liked how straight the movie was about her predicament as it didn't judge her or glorify her. The move came out 13 years ago (2010), but is just as prescient in this era of teenagers killing themselves due to cyber bullying.Its a sensitive topic, but was handled really well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

surviving high school,"Olive (emma stone) is trying to survive high school. She agrees to let people think she has had sex with an older guy . But as expected, now she has to deal with what others think about that ""truth"". When brandon (dan byrd) comes up with a plan to help them both, she has to evaluate. How will it affect her life? Which rumors are true? And does it matter if they are true or not? People make their own judgements and decisions about others, based on their own beliefs and values. Very teen angst-y. Porky's. Fast times at ridgemont high. Some weirdness forty minutes in, when olive goes to school wearing an ""a"" on her dress, like hawthornes's hester prynne. A couple references to john hughes' films. Some great familiar faces in this... hayden church (wings!), penn badgley (gossip girl), stanley tucci (various fun, quirky films). Lisa kudrow (friends). It's fun. It ain't no shakespeare, but it has some funny lines now and then. Directed by will gluck. Written by bert royal.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"The idea of ""being awesome"" is the start of all problems...","This is a story about the clicheic ""I need to be awesome to be liked"" dogma which has spread in almost any teenager since ever. Why we need that to be liked? Why we need to do outrageous or non-conventional things in order for the average Joe to like us? Is it a right thing or a bad thing? Well, I guess the answer for that is in anyone's personal beliefs and since we're not debaters here we're not gonna comment on the subject.The movie dissects the issue pretty good by mixing up humor with personal situations and frustrations that mostly any teenager has at one point. There are exceptions but the rule is out-there. Olive (Emma Stone) is a virgin college teen which realizes that with one ""little"" lie she could change her college life. That ""little"" lie though covers a deep personal problem and she decides to go out on a rampage by pretending to having intimate relationships with mostly all guys that have personality-issues in her college. Along this journey of lies she gets both ""praised"" and ""cursed"". In time she finds herself in between admitting her true nature, her true character or cover all up and just let it go. It all gets a big mess-up when she finds out that being a ""tramp"" is not the solution to be liked. The story pretty much evolves around this subject and it's entertaining by not being that clicheic. It's a fresh movie but all-around it has it's lacks in storytelling and pacing because at one point it just loses it's charm.Emma Stone was a very good choice for this movie. I'm usually not into her movies but she managed to bring life to her character and made it interesting. She also physically looks perfect for the role because it would have been such a bad/clicheic choice if they had chosen a hottie or some ""Ugly Betty"". I also enjoyed Stanley Tucci who portrays Olive's father. He may not appear more than 10 minutes together in the whole movie but I just like that guy as an actor. The one which I'm not happy to being cast is Thomas Haden Church because besides not being a fan of him, he was just bad in this.Technically, the movie was edited pretty well, no random shots or random ""intermissions"" between the movie's chapters although there was no ingenuity. The music used is forgettable, nothing like in the case of 500 Days of Summer but it still manages to induce a ""cool"" college atmosphere. This is not a general college movie, it's really entertaining, covers a good amount of college-personal issues, and it's really good directed. I recommend this flick to anyone who's into these kind of movies and I guarantee they will have a great time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The movie is there to entertain you.Same can be said about Emma Stones character, though the ""entertainment"" she is offering is of another kind. But then again, maybe she is not offering anything. And of course you could argue about her actions. But not everything has to make sense to be funny and enjoyed. There is really good acting going on and the movie dares to go places.

Suckered by promising trailer :(,"I wanted to like this movie. It was a good concept, but it just failed for me. Without spoiling any storyline, here's just some stuff I could not get past: 1) When a movie starts with a character narration, that's just bad writing. Lazy. SHOW us, don't TELL us. That's Creative Writing 101, high school level. And the narration just never stopped. It was like listening to an audio book.2) Everyone was just so overly quirky and funny. The main character, of course. But also her teachers, her parents especially, her friends and her enemies. All of them talked at an inhumanly fast and witty speed - like Robin Williams in the 1980s. It could be cute for a minute, or even for a whole scene, but the entire movie was just unbelievable.3) While I'm accustomed to 20-something actors playing high school students, in this case, I was really distracted by the actors' obvious ages. For the first 15 minutes of the movie I thought they were in community college. Once I realized it was high school, I couldn't ignore how old they all looked.4) Good storyline parts were abandoned. Sad face :( I won't ruin which parts.It was a good idea for a story. Nearly there, had potential. But just flopped for anyone over 16 years of age.

Emma Stone is extremely charming as Olive, a girl rumored to be the biggest slut in the school & Amanda Bynes is hysterical in her condemnation of Olive, as the leader of an extremist ""Jesus freak"" after school club.

Disappointed,"What a disappointment that movie was in its mean-spirited depiction of Christians.The makers of Easy-A exhibited virtually all of the negative qualities they criticize Christians of possessing: narrow-minded view of anyone not subscribing to their perspective, hateful treatment of those they consider ""beneath"" them, and blatant hypocrisy in their so-called message of tolerance. Quite pathetic how these bigoted filmmakers relish in ""preaching to the choir"" in their simplistic portrayal of a group they know is actually quite tolerate of their intolerance. Can you imagine the backlash if they had revealed their prejudices toward any other group, whether it be religious, ethnic or otherwise?Of course I realize that there are overly judgmental Christians, who give their faith a bad name. However, the vast majority are just trying to live a decent life, raise their kids right, and help the needy with charitable work and contributions. I'm pretty sure the Christian charities have done a lot more good than bad. Can't say the same for those who cashed in on the cheap-shot film Easy-A.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Nutshell Review: Easy A,"Here Emma Stone fits like hand in glove as Olive, one of the many unknowns in her high school, who is neither brainy nor nerdy nor pretty enough to be noticed, going about her own business with nary anyone giving two hoots about, except perhaps for best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka from Bandslam). One thing she learns though is how rumours get spread around like wildfire, and having seen the effects of how her little lie about a weekend one night stand, get to make its ugly rounds around campus. Soon she helps a gay acquaintance who's not ready to get out of the closet yet by pretending to have an orgasmic session during a party, and the rest, as they say, is history as she gains notoriety, and overnight becomes THE girl in school, and a go-to person for the down and the trodden to seek help with affirming their studly status, for a price of course.So what price that of a simple, harmless lie, if only to assist others in need to find their self- worth and self-esteem back amongst their peers, even at the expense of being labelled as a skank or a whore? The story grapples with this dilemma in a comical fashion, but when you think about it, is one's reputation easily traded for money and gifts, or is it something to be protected against baseless accusations, or what if one is responsible for purporting these rumours in the first place for acting the part, like what Olive does with her wardrobe and attitude transformation, especially when one is basking in the limelight and the grabbing all the attention, than to be ignored and unnoticed. And who says what will happen if you repeat a lie enough times so much so that they become the ""truth""?The main driver that made this movie the fun romp it is, is the rapid fire wordplay in the dialogues. It's just been too long that a film came by to provide that witty, and cheeky even, conversational pieces between characters, and Stone, together with her parents played by Stanely Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who chew up all the limited scenes they're in with their charisma, provide plenty of that in their dysfunctional family of sorts, though I must admit it's a pretty novel, risky and unconventional way to bring up the kids, but if the rapport is as what's seen in the film, I'd say why not.Director Will Gluck also crafted the film in a unique fashion, with multiple narrative ideas running, each introducing a different dilemma for our heroine, splitting them up into logical chapters before wrapping everything up neatly, and I mean that in a nice way, and not the convenient cop out, though one can always fall back on the inevitable cliché especially on the romantic subplot where it dwells on not realizing that true love has always been there waiting from the start. And not to forget with most chick flicks, the relationships with the best friend forever type, and the archetypical enemy who just cannot stand the sight of the other.Bert V. Royal's story also seemed to have an axe to grind with the hypocritical religious zealots, and while they play out for most of the laugh out loud comedic moments in the film (as we identify their traits amongst some folks all of us definitely have our brushes with), you can't help but feel that some may feel slighted by the portrayal, or even that of a particular group who get passed off as cheap misers in the film. I think comedies probably have a leeway where on one hand pokes fun, but on the other raises some serious thoughts about what's actually happening right under our nostrils. And not to forget his homage to the 80s romantic comedies that will hit a nostalgic spot for film fans who grew up in that era.Supporting Emma Stone is a slate of recognizable stars who make the most and best use of their limited screen time. Leading the charge is Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favourite teacher in school, who stays fairly non-judgemental and thinks Olive's rebellious ways is but a phase to outgrow. Lisa Kudrow plays his wife and councillor in the school who has a dirty secret that her mister is unaware of, and though introduced late in the film, is quite instrumental in providing that catalyst for a conclusion. Kudrow still hasn't lost her comedic timing yet. Malcolm McDowell shows up as the no nonsense principal of the public school, and his sarcasm is quite top notch.But Easy A also demonstrates the fickleness of the Hollywood starlet system, and how you're popular one day, and quite forgotten the next. We haven't seen Amanda Bynes for quite a while, and she stars here not as the protagonist as one may think she would, but as the antagonistic fiend of Olive's who is quite misguided in her faith, hypocritical in thinking she can, heaven willing, change Olive and smack her back on the right path of righteousness. However, as all sinners can attest to, her mouth is also quick to hurl insults. Not a favourite character of mine, and definitely very negative, but hey, kudos to Bynes for taking up a character against type and trying to expand the range of roles she can handle. Ana quite well at that too.For the excellent casting, story and that dialogue that's music to the ears, this is one chick flick that I enjoyed enough to shortlist into my favourites for this year. Highly recommended stuff, even if you're a guy and wondering whether such chicks do exist to lend a hand or two. For a price of course. Highly recommended! And I'm not telling you a lie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I am definitely a HUGE fan,"Perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen in this whole year. Well OK, I'm not what we call a movies addict, but I know what I'm talking about.At the beginning, I just wanted to fill in some spare time I just couldn't find a better choice than watching Easy A.This is basically the story of a teenager whose life turned up-side down due to a little lie. Her life began to follow the same pattern of ""the scarlet letter"" plot.This makes a very interesting story and the actors are just awesome. Emma Stone really showed her true potential in this movie, switching between completely different attitudes (From regular to sad, passing through slut). The result is outstanding and the crew is does a hell out of a job.To make it short, I think this is a lovely movie that worths a night of yours in the movies. I totally recommend it.

"I give it an E for ""effort""","Not that the makers of this film were swinging for the fences but unfortunately they miss almost all the time. Not that many jokes land here.The problem with scripts like these where everybody says something clever and witty is that all the characters tend to have the same ""voice"".They come off smarmy in return, especially the parents seem like they aren't human at all. The machine-gun-tempo of the dialogue is quite exhausting after a while and it only tries to hide the weakness of the writing. It also messes with the timing of jokes when the characters keep babbling incessantly.Similar like the Carrie remake, Emma Stone looks also way too good to be a social pariah. On top of that her character is so quick-witted, sarcastic and smart that there isn't any room for weaknesses. It's evident that this movie was intended to be a love letter to John Hughes films, but whereas Hughes characters were quirky they always had a darkness and vulnerabilty underneath them. Every character is so over the top here, that it's hard to buy the few moments of sincerity this movie is trying to muster. In the end Olive doesn't really grow, she's the same clever girl she was at the beginning. And the guy she is ends up with is as a complete cypher similar like her best friend.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"""Easy A"" gets an ""A"" for effort...","(John Hughes would be proud with ""Easy A."") Oh, boy, where to start with this movie, hmm? Well, for one, Will Gluck's ""Easy A"" provided me with a brief respite from the day-to-day insanity that is my life. The last movie I saw in theaters was ""Predators"" and that was back in July; that's three months of not having to pay the inflated ticket price of $8.75 to see a movie. But my self-imposed moratorium on not going to the movies was well-worth the wait with ""Easy A."" The script shines in delivering a fast-paced, laugh-a-minute screenplay with a story vaguely paralleling ""The Scarlet Letter"" by Nathaniel Hawthorne (which I never read in high school); Olive Pendergast (Emma Stone, the husky-voiced redhead from ""Superbad"" and ""Zombieland"" whose career has just been made with this film) is a social nobody at her shiny, pristine Southern California high school. But that changes when a little lie to get out of spending time with her best friend's weird family somehow explodes into a huge, school-wide rumor about how she allegedly lost her virginity to some made-up college hunk. A la Hester Prynne in ""The Scarlet Letter,"" Olive becomes the talk of her high school rumor mill, with boys approaching her left and right to help them with their reputations around campus. So she decides to embrace her newfound infamy (complete with a telltale ""A"" pinned on the shoulder of her new wardrobe), much to the chagrin of the high school queen bee (Amanda Bynes, fresh out of her retirement) and the mascot of the basketball team (Penn Badgley), with whom Olive shares an unusual romantic past with. And we all know how one lie leads to an even bigger lie and how that bigger lie leads to an even bigger lie and so on and so forth. ""Easy A"" is a brilliantly acted teen comedy with nods aplenty to the work of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (1987) with Patrick Dempsey, and Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"" (1989). Stone is a star; she's not just a pretty face. She's spunky with an incredibly razor-sharp wit, and a heart to boot, even as she must face the music and try to put the wrong things right in her chaotic life and improve her high school reputation before it's too late. She's intelligent, easy on the eyes, and proves with this movie that she has a bright future ahead of her in the movies. ""Easy A"" is an easy movie to like. In a wasteland of instantly forgettable and stupid teen movies, ""Easy A"" is one teen flick you can pay $8.75 to see in the theater, and not kick yourself for doing so in the morning...10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A delicious, clever comedy.","When I first saw the trailer of Easy A, I wasn't particularly intrigued. It looked like just another high school teenage comedy. But then I decided to watch it anyway (mostly because I wanted to know what all the fuss was about), and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise! Coincidentally, I had just seen Emma Stone for the first time two days ago, when I watched Zombieland, and I thought to myself, ""Hey this girl seems kind of cool"". But that still wasn't an answer as to why right now I can't read a single magazine without seeing her face somewhere. After seeing Easy A, I finally know. This girl is FUN. She has a great talent for comedy of the driest, most sarcastic kind and a perfect sense of timing. And you've got to love that husky voice.Easy A is about a girl, Olive, who's a straight A-student with a flawless reputation, until she tells a little white lie to her best friend about how she supposedly lost her virginity to a guy that doesn't even exist. However, things go awry when this little anecdote spreads like wildfire and all of a sudden she has a reputation of being a hussy. (This plot line demands some suspension of disbelief, because it's obviously very hard to believe that any group of high school students would be shocked at the thought of one of their peers *having sex*, but whatever.) Of course, like with any rumour, it changes constantly depending on who you talk to. So before Olive knows what hit her, everybody in school thinks she slept with every guy around. Now here's the twist: once it becomes clear that she can use this newfound reputation to her advantage, she does so to the fullest. Simply put: unpopular guys pay her to PRETEND she had sex with them. Obviously, at some point things get out of hand and she has to find a way to fix it all again.This concept could have been really stupid, if it wasn't for the great screenplay. It is a tribute to classic 80's teenage films including, of course, John Hughes, and it also features some great references to The Scarlet Letter and Sylvia Plath. The dialogue is quick and witty, and the characters are all really typical people without being cliché stereotypes. Stanley Tucci is a delight as Olive's dad, bringing the same kind of dry-as-a-bone humour to the table as his on-screen daughter. Patricia Clarkson is a wonderful actress, and as it turns out, a really funny one as well. All the actors are perfectly cast.One of the funniest elements in Easy A is a group of Christian students, the 'Jesus freaks'. The leader of this little group is a girl called Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes. She just can't stop preaching to Olive about her 'indecent behaviour' and the dialogue between the two provides some of the funniest moments throughout the film. Here's a small foretaste; Marianne: ""There's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency."" Olive: ""Tom Cruise?""Overall, this is mostly a 'chuckle' comedy rather than a 'rolling over the floor laughing' comedy, though it has some really good LOL moments. And the 'chuckles' are widespread.I would definitely recommend watching Easy A if you're in the mood for a witty, intelligent comedy about a smart, sassy girl who takes control of her own life and everybody who thinks they have a right to think badly about her.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Everyone here is perfectly cast as they fit into their stereotypical roles with ease. The highlights are Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as the nicest parents in cinema.At the ideal run time of around 90 minutes, you'd hope for breezy and snappy direction and that's exactly what director Will Gluck brings with some fun creative flourishes.

If the purpose of the movie was to make the viewer feel sympathy for her, it simply was not a reasonable goal in my eyes.

Easily  A  Delight!,"Easy A:Is a teenage comedy about one girl's high school experiences. Directed by William Gluck it's a tale of rumours and reputations. Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), is a bright student who unfortunately has higher social standing with teachers than with her fellow students. Also with regards to her appeal to the opposite sex, in her words ""If Google Earth was a guy, he couldn't find me even if I was dressed up as a ten story building"".In the opening scene we meet her best friend Rhiannon'Rhi' Abernathy (the exuberant Aly Michalka) who after hearing a little lie from Olive about her having a guy over for the weekend wants Olive to admit she lost her virginity with him and will not take no for an answer. Olive gives in and says yes only to stop Rhi from nagging. Unfortunately this is overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes), a sanctimonious religious student who spreads the story like wildfire. However the overnight notoriety gained, is completed absorbed by Olive who previously went unnoticed by others and now that all eyes are on her, decides to use the school's gossip grapevine to advance her social standing, taking on the new'experienced, predatory' image with supreme confidence and comedic authority.Once Olive becomes an established name in school, she inadvertently takes on a type of heroism with the ability to help the schools various 'outsiders' become 'some bodies'. Through ""intimate"" association with our promiscuous lead the outsiders become 'cool', improving reputations and putting them on the schools social map!In Easy A the beautiful Emma Stone takes the lead; stepping out from her Superbad tag and leaving it in the shadows, becoming the centre of attention and deservedly so. There is no doubt that she has a bright future ahead as she plays lead role with consummate ease and intelligence, reminiscent of an early Lindsey Lohan. Upon viewing her credentials in Superbad, Paperman, Zombieland and now Easy A, its seems Ms Stone possess all the innate characteristics and acting ability that -given the right roles- will surely see her enter the next young Hollywood elite alongside Ellen Page, Kirsten Stuart, Carey Mulligan, her Superbad co-stars and not down the road of a later Ms Lohan.The notable element to Easy A is simply the writing (debut by Bert. V. Reynolds). Its witty, sharp and gives each characters a good standard of vocabulary, not opting for the modern day spoken word that you hear in schools such as slang & text-isms i.e. 'lol's & Omg's' which is highly refreshing to watch and just shows that teenage comedy can still have attitude when given a decent use of English language.Another shining light or should I say lights in this film is the two parents of Olive- Dill and Rosemary (played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) there chemistry is strong, providing weird but wonderful performances with quirky personalities much like the 'Meet The Fockers' parents but rather toned down versions to meet with the needs of its target audience. Despite this, when its there scene, you'll be sure to laugh and I think they definitely warranted more screen time then they received. The supporting cast all do well with; Thomas Haden Church as the Head Teacher, distracted Guidance Counsellor (Lisa Kudrow), and long time crush (Penn Badgley) all adding their distinctive elements.Nearly all comedies have far-fetched stories its what makes them funny and this is no different (a state school where apparently losing ones virginity is condemned which leads to counselling etc) so certain aspects like this cant be deemed negative points as others have suggested. Granted, the film doesn't quite take you to the heights of a 'Juno' and hasn't achieved the success of 'Mean Girls' (this film is better) but Easy A is easily a; smart, fun and enjoyable movie...

A good movie with trouble in the details,"There's a good movie lurking within Easy A, I can say that with great certainty. A film aiming to make Emma Stone the new Molly Ringwald, it succeeds in a few departments. Emma Stone shines, and the movie offers a few instances of great dramatic intrigue. However, one sin it commits brings it down greatly: it does not manage to be consistently funny.Emma Stone stars Olive Penderghast, a small town high school student who manages to top the gossip chain by creating rumours of her promiscuity. Using it to help the woeful male losers pretend they got action, Olive bathes in both gift cards and infamy. However, once the consequences of her actions become apparent, the spotlight is suddenly less bright.The plot definitely has some dramatic high points, above all relating to the teacher/guidance counsellor married couple played by Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow, a story that perhaps would have been better served as the main plot line rather than a sub plot. Olive being solicited for the real deal is also a dramatic high point. Many of the supporting actors not brought in for comedic relief absolutely sell these moments and make them by far the most memorable parts of the film.Emma Stone is an incredibly charismatic lead and is well positioned to be the teen queen of the generation. It is a testament to her performance that she is incredibly watchable even while given a terribly wish-washy character, who until the end flip-flops between regretful and infamy-loving at an alarming rate. While some of her one-liners are decently amusing, some stand out as particularly horrible, notably the Tom Cruise line from the trailer (how was that line considered good enough to make the promotional material?).Two major parts of the plot and cast fail miserably though. While a male romantic interest was necessary, Penn Badgely as Todd seems to be something out of a particularly bad John Hughes movie. This is made ten times worse when the film pokes fun at those very same John Hughes movies. Perhaps if the male lead was less of a underwear model, the overall theme of the film would be less muddied.Also failing epically is Amanda Bynes as the hyper-Catholic Marianne, whose circle ostracizes Olive. Her acting is consistently hammed up and her groups actions and interactions seem far too cartoonish in contrast to the films real dramatic tension. The movie also seems perhaps a little too gung-ho on an anti-religion slant, using religion as a shortcut to indicate people just not minding their own business.The general kookiness of some of the characters is also somewhat offputting. Olive introduces her best friends parents as very strange people, seemingly only to keep us from noticing how very strange her own parents are. They are clearly portrayed as loving, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson clearly have fun, but they aren't as funny or important as they should be.In all, the film has many issues, but a great film does lie beneath them. Even with those issues, the movie could have been forgiven if it was at least funny. While it has some great moments and will surely be a star-making vehicle for Stone, Easy A doesn't quite make the grade (worst pun ever, I'm aware).",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great movie, great John Hughes Montage.","If you like movies that both have great acting, a great plot, a moral message, yet funny as heck. Then you must watch Easy A.Having recently seen Emma Stone, in Amazing Spiderman, I wanted to see her in another movie.This movie seem's shallow but has deepness, in terms of dealing with the cost of rumors and gossip, how they can appear useful in the short term, but there is always a painful price to pay.Emma Stone play's a very giving, original, extremely witty, high scbool girl. Great acting, seem's so natural, as if this was her real self not an act.She just seem's to be a natural.But the other's in the cast Aly Michalka, loved her in BandSlam, was awesome too.

"""Easy A"" a difficult watch...","""Easy A"" a difficult watch...Would you pay someone to lie for you? What if you were a really fat guy who eats mars bar shirtless poolside (I didn't make that up, it's in the movie) and you could pay a really hot girl (Emma Stone) to say that she kissed you, would you do it? What about if you were the girl, Olive, would you take the money and lie? That's the situation that Olive finds herself in after an false rumour of her losing her virginity is spread around the entire school. But instead of denying the gossip, Olive buys into it by donning slutty outfits and accepting discount cards and cash from boys in return for lies about sexual exploits they've shared. When STD's, adultery and a shot at actually losing her virginity to a guy she likes pops up, Olive needs more than money and lies to rescue her..Okay that last sentence really killed all the good work that I'd put into the opening of the review, I suppose it's because I've just watched the whole 92 minutes of ""Easy A"" and I'm feeling anything but inspired or happy, two things I'd like to feel after watching a comedy/romance. Maybe I'm asking too much of a teen movie? It just lacked any sort of believability or depth. You'd be right in thinking believability and depth are hardly two strong characteristics you'd associate with the romantic-comedy genre, but it's what make classics last, think Breakfast at Tiffany's, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Love Actually and Bridget Jones. Why? Because these qualities make you relate to the characters: you cry when they cry; if the protagonist finds love, you also believe you can find love etc And I'm afraid, the films allusion to The Scarlet Letter (a 1850's novel about an adulterous woman) is a poor attempt at giving the film depth.It's unfortunate really, because the cast is alright (Lisa Kudrow, Stanley Lucci), the age old topic of lying never gets old and the power of gossip in the playgrounds is especially relevant today with social networking sites like face book adding whole new dimensions to how messages are spread and the new ways kids are bullying each other. The character of Olive, a girl who ignores what other people say about her and has a refreshingly deep voice, could also be a strong role model for young women, but even with Stone's fairly natural acting ability, she is let down by the average and unimaginative script that tries too hard to be cool and comes off as being dated.But if you want to see for yourself, and you make it to the end, you'll be rewarded with a snippet of music from Australia's 'Angus and Julia Stone'.

Emma Stone shines in this hilarious familiar but original high school comedy,"I gave this film a chance because I had heard good things from a lot of people and when I saw that Emma Stone had got a leading role in a comedy I had to give it a try; She was brilliant in House Bunny and Superbad.Emma Stone doesn't let down in this quick witted and quirky comedy with the same feel as most John Hughes films (With a lot of references too) As much as it seems like it is just another high school comedy, it isn't, its script, acting and storyline make it stand out from the rest.The directing isn't anything special but the title sequences are cleverly done.A lot of the actors impress in this film, other then Emma Stone, some of the smaller supporting characters have the funniest lines. Emma Stone's parents in the film are played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, who are both outstanding and hilarious as her quirky caring parents who I wish I could have. Lisa Kudrow finally impresses with her performance as the unusual school psychiatrist.The rest of the cast don't really stand out from the rest but do a good enough job.Emma Stone should have won the Oscar for best performance in a comedy, the delivery on her lines are perfect and you can just tell she has the same persona in everyday life.Verdict: If you like comedies about teenagers and their dilemmas in high school, but want to see something a little big different and original with some real big laughs, then this is the film for you.Please visit my website for more reviews http://nobleking.tumblr.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What Could Have Been,"One of the more disappointing flicks in memory. I was so psyched to see it and delighted it was on Netflix instant watch. What began with so much potential including a decent cast (and charming, witty parents) was undermined at every turn with by its relentless attack on Christianity. At one point it even took a shot at capitalism for good measure. I am a Christian and normally don't mind a little mockery of certain aspects of it. I remember being annoyed in college by the ""slimy"" bible thumpers on campus pushing their beliefs on others. I even stopped going to churches when they either engaged in cultish like behavior or the priest spoke down to the congregation. I did this because – despite what Hollywood tells you - there are good churches and decent Christian folk out there. Despite all this about a third in the story was picking up steam and found a nice little groove. Then about 2/3 in the appearance of Patricia Kudrow was like a death nail for me. What a deplorable character with her barrage of GD this and that. She added nothing to the film and really sank any hope the material had with her tirade. Too bad too since I was just starting to really like the family (Tucci and Clarkson were terrific). Plus Church was effective as well particularly when he exclaimed to Stone, ""We all know you read the book."" It was refreshing for a teacher to acknowledge when a student stands out in a positive way. Then the negativity set in and the attacks intensified to dominate the final third and suck the life out of the entire film. Dan Humphrey couldn't even save this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Learning with Easy A,"""Easy A"" stands out as a teen comedy that goes beyond expectations by exploring relevant social issues in a smart and fun way. The plot revolves around a high school student who finds herself at the center of a rumored scandal that quickly spirals out of control. The film not only offers moments of humor and romance, but also sheds light on how information can be distorted and amplified in the age of social media and gossip. The protagonist navigates the consequences of her new reputation in a way that is both realistic and reflective, without losing the light and humorous tone that characterizes the production. For viewers looking for a teen comedy with emotional depth and social relevance, ""Easy A"" delivers a cinematic experience that is both entertaining and enlightening.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stones shines in the smartest teen comedy in a long time,"In her first (and long overdue) truly lead role, the delectable Emma Stone stars here as Olive, an unnoticed and unpopular high school girl who realises she can find the attention she seeks (not to mention better her financial standing) through lies and a clever manipulation of the school's rumour mill.Upon hearing the basic plot, you might feel an uneasy suspicion creeping in that the underlying construct here – unpopular teen achieves popularity through some drastic change in their lifestyle, and gets one over on the popular kids who used to give her a hard time – might sound like one we've seen one too many times before (and usually not done very well), but leave any preconceived notions about what you think you might be in for at the door; as this film aims to subvert the modes of the teen drama at every turn and does it incredibly well.Burt V. Royal's script is astute and clever. The dialogue is fresh and humorous, in a Juno-like manner, only outstripping Juno's achievements by far; a great many scenes are brilliantly funny, creating a wonderful and fun overall tone for the piece.The film is current to the degree that it factors technology into the plot in a manner that makes it vitally integral to the story; Olive delivers her confession to everyone by uploading a video of it onto the internet – a nod to the YouTube generation. And facebook is of course dealt with too, with Olive's very likable teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) reiterating facebook sceptics' main complaint with the social network: that status updates are boring, not to mention the fact that it can be used as a method of surveillance and tab keeping for anyone who endeavours to document their every action on there.Why Stone hasn't shot to stardom long before now is one of the great mysteries of Hollywood. Her gorgeous looks, sexily husky voice and excellent comic timing has always marked her out as a unique force in the business, and her versatility and talent as an actress has been proved before now (perhaps best with her wonderful turn in Paper Man in 2009), but the role of Olive proves the perfect vehicle for Stone to showcase her skills, assuring her star status now, if it was ever in question before. Stanley Tucci is another actor who also shines here, as Olive's unbearably cool and sharply witty father.The speed at which the school's rumour mill works and travels is wonderfully represented through some excellent camera work, as quite lengthy shots zoom at high speed through the school's grounds, pausing regularly to observe various people as they first hear the rumours about Olive's promiscuity.The film deals with its delicate concept well – Stone herself has stated she has at times been concerned about the possibility that the film might glamorise promiscuity among younger girls, but the film manages to retain a sturdy moral foothold in the background of proceedings, which it also smartly uses to end on.The absurdity of religious fanaticism is also touched upon, with Amanda Bynes' character Marianne's Christian group running a domineering and imposing presence within Olive's school. Olive intelligently disregards the group's nonsense, but also turns to religion later in the film when she is desperate to absolve her conscience.The literary basis here is used to great effect beyond Olive's story paralleling that of Hawthorne's The Scarlett Letter, through one neatly later reverted back to Huckleberry Finn joke.We are even treated to a little 80s nostalgia being thrown into the mix here, as Olive bemoans the loss of chivalry in modern day courtship (who doesn't want John Cusack holding up a boom box for them outside their window?) by reminiscing over love scenes in 80s movies.This is by far the best teen comedy to come out of Hollywood in ages, and will hopefully be praised for its qualities and inventiveness for a long time to come, as well as gain Stone the true recognition that she deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Humbling Bow to the Chick-Flick Humor,"This was a Saturday evening I dreaded. The previous weekend, my wife and younger daughter accompanied me to one of the few action movies that came out this year. The obvious understanding was that I would go with them to a movie of their choosing. At first, this did not seem so bad, since my daughter is not drawn to chick flickstoo often. Well as the reimbursement weekend rolled around, I was pretty confident my daughter would select a movie with some tasteful blood and guts. To my dismay, both my wife and daughter said the flick they had opted for was, 'Easy ""A""'. I am not sure if my initial reaction was complete fear or utter disgustwhatever it wasit was visible. I kicked, screamed and cried all the way to our seat. To break the pre-movie monotony, my daughter and I counted men entering the theater6 to 10 with about 500 womena little voice echoed in my mind, 'this is the mother of all chick flicks.' This is too long of an introbut I truly enjoyed the movie. It was funny and the acting was excellent. Of course this does not mean I will jump at the next opportunity to see a chick flickbut I may not go with as much kicking and screaming.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Way better than I thought it would be.,"This film is well written and well acted. Ms Stone puts in a fine performance and just about everyone else really gives their best, particularly Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church and Lisa Kudrow. Also thank you Amanda Bynes for rethinking your decision to retire from acting!One reviewer said that the characters were not fully fleshed out but I find myself disagreeing. The writer and director got a lot out of some characters that sometimes had only a minute or so screen time. Some of them we learned a lot about their private anguish or history or relationships in only a few lines. Solid writing.Others have said it, but what the hell I will too...this film is a loving tribute to the '80's teen films of John Hughes including many of the implausibilities. It's a comedy that actually veers into some fairly sophisticated satire at a few points, plausibility isn't the issue here. Like the Hughes films, it isn't about what teens would actually do or say, but what we *wish* they would or what we wish we would have in our own high school days.One thing. What John Hughes did in his films was work with real teen aged actors whereas Mr. Gluck has chosen to return to the old cliché of having actors in their 20's play high schoolers and that is a mistake. The kids in the Hughes films *look* young and vulnerable and the viewers are reminded of that. When older actors are used something is lost, that's all I'm saying.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma Stone's Easy A is one of the smartest teen comedies I've seen this year,"I had gone into watching Emma Stone's Easy A with some expectations of a smart teen comedy about reputations and the stereotypes of characterizations that one expects when those kinds of things arise but I got a lot more with the mostly smart dialogue that references everything from the Demi Moore version of The Scarlet Letter to the '80s teen hit films like those of John Hughes (Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Cameron Crowe (Say Anything...), and Patrick Dempsey (Can't Buy Me Love). There's a few more but I'll just say that I was just overjoyed at both the funny and touching moments that permeated the whole thing and loved not only the performances of Ms. Stone but also Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as her parents, Amanda Bynes as her religious-nut enemy, Thomas Haden Church as her favorite teacher, and Lisa Kudrow as a not-always normal guidance counselor, among others.

The Ghost of John Hughes,"John Hughes may have passed away, but the torch has been passed to Will Gluck, who takes one of the first intelligent teen movie scripts that I've seen in more than a decade and knocks out a home run film with performances by a top-notch cast headed by Emma Stone, who finds new ground as a female lead, and great supporting performances by Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci Lisa Kudrow and the rest of the cast.The title may make it seem like a sleazy Superbad for teen girls, but the film is a modern teen riff on The Scarlett Letter (""A"") the Hawthorne novel about Hester Prynne, who is unfairly shunned by her community for a perceived tryst with a married man.Stone's character,Olive, tells her best friend a small white lie, only to have it blossom into a rep about her being a slut that gets her attention that she's secretly craved from the rest of school, even if it is negative attention.When the lie magnifies to epic and ridiculous proportions, the question that the film seeks to answer is how Olive can put that genie back into the bottle, and will she ever be the same? Bert V. Royal knocks out a script that is old-school witty and charming and intentionally dredges up homages to Hughes classics like ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" and ""Say Anything"" A totally enjoyable movie for teens and adults alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I highly recommend the movie . it is very funny. All the theater was laughing in almost every scene. the soundtrack was also pretty cool.

"7.3 Rating?? Really?? Raters must be young, 5 at best","I give this movie a five, and this is generous for this really weak movie. I point out Sixteen Candles is rated a 7, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is rated 7.2. Can anyone seriously say Easy A is a better movie? Breakfast Club, which this movie pays homage to, is a 7.9, so only slightly better? Give me a break. Raters just throw out numbers without any context. A 7.2 means a WELL above average movie. Average in a 1 to 10 scale is five or a six. This movie is low average at best, barely a FIVE. Simple plot, weak dialogue, and fails to capture the magic of growing up as a teen --- like the Hughes movies did. Emma Stone is likable and the only reason this movie is not a Four.

A John Hughes Teenager Movie Minus John Hughes,"Easy A does something almost no teenager movie does nowadays. It takes the theme and overall feel of a John Hughes movie. That alone awards the film two stars that it goes down the path of a true director/writer/producer. John Hughes was an inspiration and a legend in the filmmaking industry who's films will never even be matched by movies in the future. Though Easy A is well aware John Hughes is no part of this, but it takes elements and treats it like Hughes Gold which is the part I like. It even shows clips from The Breakfast Club, Say Anything, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Sixteen Candles in comparison to our lead character which was something I thought was dead in movies. Never would I have thought a current film, made in 2010, utilize and reflect on the characters brought to us on a piece of art made by John Hughes.Emma Stone is a woman of talent. Her perky attitude and gorgeous smile makes her one of the top female actresses in Hollywood today. This movie makes her. She was backup in Superbad and Zombieland now she finally gets the lead role spot she deserves. Every actor/actress needs a lead movie role, but only few put them on top. While Taylor Lautner had a role when he was younger in The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl, but girls didn't start paying attention to his abs until his breakout with The Twilight Saga finally emerged and since then he has been labeled ""hot"" by every girl in the United States. With Emma Stone's first real lead role in a movie she does a remarkable job and is just a pleasure to see on screen.The plot involves Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a clean cut High School student who is overheard by the religious fanatic girl Marianne (Amanda Bynes) while talking with her best friend. Olive and her friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) mention the word ""virginity"" and ""sex"" a few times leaving Marianne under the assumption Olive lost her virginity over the weekend. The rumor spreads throughout the High School (coming from someone who got of the middle school bus not to long ago I can say rumors spread faster than the news of Michael Jackson's death) and everyone now labels Olive as a Jezebel, slut, tramp, every derogatory name in the book.Olive figures that if people think she's a slut, she'll show no shame in acting like one, sewing a scarlet ""A"" on her clothing, a reference from Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel ""The Scarlet Letter"" which Olive is reading in her English class. Both coincide with each other since Olive and ""The Scarlet Letter""'s character Hester both are in the boat of dealing with sexual abstinence and taking very similar acts and approaches in the film. Things only get worse when after her homosexual friend is tormented at school and begs her to have ""fake sex"" with him at a party so he will be the ""stud"" and not looked down upon. Olive goes into business doing this for other kids and it only sinks her reputation lower and lower.This film definitely takes a path of it's own when it seems it's following the crowd. I couldn't tell you the wasteland of crap teen movies we have nowadays. In fact, I believe the last good teen film of the 2000 - 2009 decade I saw was Mean Girls a few months ago. So starting off the decade with something like this is excellent. it's in no way recycled. While the teenager plot can be excused because that part just establishes the overall attitude and sense of the film. But having being parallel to a novel and having a perky, upbeat, never dull premise and characters I was consistently amused at Easy A's constant effort and how high in quality it held in an attempt to be like a John Hughes film.Easy A is Emma Stone's gem in her filmography. This will be her best movie for a long time. While her part in Superbad was only brief and her role in Zombieland wasn't her at all as she played a Gothic/Emo character which was out of the ordinary. Easy A pretty much establishes a personality close to hers. Excusing the sexual abstinence part, she probably is a ""clean cut High School girl"". The topic of sexual abstinence is one usually overshadowed by safe sex and is rarely talked about among parental conversations I can assure, but overall, it is dealt with well in this movie and the outcome is nothing but satisfying. It's also refreshing to here Simple Minds' amazing song ""Don't You Forget About Me"" in a new movie and the reflection of John Hughes clips. That is the cherry on the sundae.Starring: Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Cam Gigandet, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm McDowell, Alyson Michalka, Stanley Tucci.

The appreciation for John Hughes and the comments on social lives in High School, while slightly over dramatized, relatively apt.Also, the portrayal of the local Christian zealots- its not a common occurrence, at least not in my experience, but made me think of Mandy Moore, in Saved (course maybe that was because I had just seen it again).Regardless, I would highly recommend spending the 12 dollars to go check it out.

ho-hum,"A high school girl becomes the victim of rumours after another student hears her tell a lie about losing her virginity. She decides the best form of defence is attack, and allows others to take advantage of her strategy to improve their own situation, while worsening hers. A decent premise, and there are some chuckles along the way. Emma Stone is charming, and Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are amusing if highly implausible and eventually a bit too smarmy and self-satisfied. The biggest problem is the main character's motivation. She decides to lie for everyone, then asks them to undo the lie for her, because she is fed up with it. That's it. No drama with her parents, and her love interest is devoted to her throughout the tale. Plot-wise, there is little or no development beyond that. All in all, a slightly odd, and bland, piece of storytelling.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This movie really needs a sequel.,"Emma Stone has built a career for herself playing the pretty, smarter-than-average love interest in male-driven movies like Zombieland and Superbad, but the time has finally come for her to be a star on her own. Once you get past the faintly ludicrous conceit that Stone was ever an average-looking high school girl who nobody noticed, she handily carries every scene the whip-smart and deviously funny Easy A. Like Alicia Silverstone and Lindsay Lohan before her, Stone takes a teen comedy that was already pretty good on its own and elevates it to something that's almost transcendently fun.Olive Penderghast is easily the coolest girl at East Ojai High School, even though she's unpopular enough that nobody would notice. She's got a great sense of humor and fashion sense, a rock-solid relationship with her equally awesome and hilarious parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci), and is generous enough to do a pretty major favor for a gay friend constantly beat up by the school bullies. Olive agrees to pretend to have sex with him to boost his reputation, and once word gets around to the other nerds and closet cases at her school, Olive develops her own reputation as a grade-A slut. In a plot contrivance that's not entirely convincing, the formerly happy wallflower Olive takes her skank status as a badge of honor, tormenting the sanctimonious Christians at school and reaping gift cards in exchange for her imaginary flings with the desperate guys.Though a girl like Olive probably ought to be able to see that this can't end well, it's too much fun to watch her exploits to quibble with things like reality. Working from Bert V. Royal's script that he tweaked significantly, director Will Gluck is playing excellently with third-wave feminism here. Olive uses her sexuality without shame, dressing up in revealing outfits and emblazoning a literal scarlet letter on her chest, but when she confesses that she's actually a virgin, there's no shame in that either. Easy A is refreshingly free of moralizing about both having sex and not having it, in the end concluding ""Sleep with who you want to sleep with, just keep it to yourself."" It's not the most revolutionary message, sure, but one absent from most teen movies that obsess over sex one way or another.Even with its rock-solid comedic tone and barrage of perfect one-liners, Easy A's story gets a little too sprawling for its own good. Olive's budding romance with high school nice guy (Penn Badgley) plays out at a nice delicate pace, but subplots about her teacher and his estranged wife (Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow) plus a 22-year-old high school senior (Cam Gigandet) feel subbed in from a worse, less confident movie. It's also bizarre to see former teen comedian Amanda Bynes, with her endless tics and big eyes and strained delivery, share the frame with the relaxed and effortless Stone; Bynes, too, seems transplanted from a lesser teen comedy with none of Easy A's idiosyncratic verve.It doesn't have as many quotable lines as Clueless, and just misses the whip-fast comedic pace of Mean Girls, but Easy A stands proudly alongside those two teen girl classics, and provides a cinematic snapshot of the current technology-fueled speed of the rumor mill, when something tweeted or texted is automatically true, even without a shred of evidence. Without leaning too heavily on its message and giving ample room for most of its stellar cast to shine, Easy A is zippy and clever and far more original than you thought a high school comedy could be again. and this movie needs to have a sequel. I wanna know what happened next!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More like C-,"I was really disappointed in this film. I loved Emma Stone in Superbad and Zombieland. She has a really nice, relaxed presence that is well suited to a smart teen comedy. Unfortunately, Easy A leaves out the smart although I feel like it thinks it has something to say. And, that's the big problem. The movie is about big issues especially for teenagers: promiscuity, the power of rumors and reputations, std's. But, its only point of view is that these things are bad. There's very little depth here. I don't think any character, especially Olive, learns a lesson they didn't already know. The antagonists, a group of chaste Bible thumpers led by Amanda Bynes, are one-dimensional caricatures. (It doesn't help that Bynes's hemline is higher than a pole dancer's.) And, the protagonists are basically all the same sardonic quipping, impossibly understanding people. This is where all the supposed comedy comes from; witty remarks and pseudo-intellectual playful conversations like the writer had just watched a Gilmore Girls box set. The best comedies have humorous situations as well as funny dialog. Easy A has neither.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Witty and excellent,"As a little white lie, Olive (Emma Stone) tells her best friend in their high school's bathroom that she lost her virginity. The white lie turns into a rumour, quickly casting Olive as the new school floozy. She decides to roll with it, enjoying her newfound popularity as similar rumours quickly pop up. However, things soon spiral out of control...'Easy A' is not a generic teen movie, mostly thanks to its unconventional protagonist, masterfully played by Emma Stone. Olive is quick-witted and sarcastic, mostly indifferent to her reputation or her classmates' opinions, and not easily fazed. She is accompanied by a similarly unconventional support cast, mostly her parents and her favourite teacher. In contrast to other great teen movies (for example 'Mean Girls'), 'Easy A' does not need any overdone stereotypical characters, instead relying on people and events that are reasonably close to real life (perhaps with the exception of the religious nutjob students, at least for a movie set in California).From a technical standpoint, there is nothing not to like about 'Easy A'.

I hope that other movie makers aren't inspired to try to get her into another movie because Emma Stone doesn't have it. Whatever it is, she ain't got it. All of the other actors in this goofy flick all act like this is just a job and they're happy to get the work. Bland acting all the way across. And the writing. It looks like there are certain producers and movie makers out there who will get people to brainstorm an idea for a movie and they don't even have to try very hard.

"A totally charming comedy about gossip, rash judgment and other sins","The poster of the movie ""Easy A"" sums up its big lesson well: ""Let's Not and Say We Did."" If you're going to say you've done something, then it better be true, because even a teeny- weeny lie could make your life a living hell and, worse, make your name synonymous with toxic skank forever.How Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) got to be wearing ""whore couture"" with a scarlet letter A on her chest — like Hester Prynne, the martyr of the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel — is the subject of this totally charming comedy that sheds light on teen misbehaviorial patterns and the nature of shame, rash judgment and other sins. This movie does a satirical take on the nature of gossip: that people are willing to believe the worst in others and that they will blindly believe what they choose to believe. Tell 'em what they want to hear and they will lap it up, spreading the news through phone texts and the Internet.The hemlines of Olive's clothes conform nicely to Ojai High School's rule: not higher than her fingertips. Her fashion preference is French designer brands: black, cut low, with lacy frills that say corset chic. The letter A recalls Hester's punishment for her crime of Adultery. No, it doesn't stand for Awesome; it's a play on the phrase ""easy lay.""How easy a lay? Well, some boys in this California school can claim to have bedded her just like that — this weird bunch of guys who many say were gay, repugnant or ostracized. Olive's reputation as a slut, a floozy and a Jezebel trollop was born at a party at a friend's house, where her classmates gathered before a bedroom door to listen to her kinky, squealing session with Brandon (Dan Byrd), who until then had been tormented by talk that he was gay.But Olive, 17, tells us a totally different story. First that it's all a lie, a bunch of fake relationships and pretend sex. She's been accepting offers simply to help boost the guys' egos and peer ranking. ""The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated,"" she says.For a highly intelligent girl to tell her closest friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) the lie that she slept with a college jock sounds dumb, but that's the Olive drawn by director Will Gluck and screenplay author Bert V. Royal: a jumble of contradictions. The trouble with this young woman is that she gives in too quickly to the whims of friends and emotional blackmailers. Is her personality too insecure or of such low self-esteem that she's always trying to please others, even the school lynch mob?After all, she has the greatest parents in the world (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson), a bit too liberal and hands-off perhaps but exceptional, and quite witty too. ""I will take a bullet for you, have my throat slit to stand up for you,"" dad Dill assures her. Dill and Rosemary Penderghast, plus adopted boy Chip? What a spiced-up family!Then, things start to get out of hand. At Stage 2, her reputation goes down from a common slut to a tramp who demands cash in exchange for easy favors. It doesn't matter that in reality she gets peanuts for her help, such as discount coupons for Home Depot or free tickets to a foreign-language art-house film. And didn't Brandon just send her a tacky gift, a vibrator?At Stage 3, she incurs the wrath of Jesus-loving, sex-abstaining Christians on campus, led by Cross Your Heart Club head Marianne Bryant (Amanda Byrnes). Hell-fearing Marianne has many positive virtues. As pretty and as gifted with words, she rivals Olive in a contest to win our sympathy. Yet, in the film's final irony, Olive turns out to have virtues that young Christians hold so dearly.Stage 4 is the turning point in the spiraling charade, when Olive allegedly turns into a home wrecker and, for the first time, reveals the pain she's been through. She idolizes her hip but wise English teacher Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), who is married to the very competent guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow). But Olive later does something to the Griffiths that doesn't make her proud of herself.And then there's mild-mannered, multi-talented Anson (Jake Sandvig), a hot-air balloon enthusiast and admirer of author Sylvia Plath, who invites Olive to a date at the Lobster Shack. He raises up Olive's hopes for a better social life. But what a letdown it is when, in the movie's eye-opening moment, he turns out to be no better than the rest of the guys.The movie leaves unanswered the biggest question: what is the motive behind Olive's over- identifying with Hawthorne's branded martyr? Also, it's hard to fathom why the people whom Olive had helped turn so mean in the end. But the movie does answer, in a droll, heartwarming way, the question of why the Penderghast couple has raised such a wonderful daughter in Olive. And as to the puzzle as to who among a short list of school hunks will win Olive's heart, it delivers a solution that is heartwarming, very romantic and obvious.Assessing this movie's cast could be done through what Olive and her friends call ""identifiers,"" or the initials of the key words that describe a person. Byrnes as Marianne and Michalka as Rhiannon are both F.L, funny and lovable. Haden Church and Kudrow as the Griffiths are B.S., believable and sympathetic. And playing the Penderghasts with a post- hippie style of parenting, Tucci and Clarkson are M.A.G., magical actor genies who are a delight to watch.And Emma Stone is simply A.B.C. — adorable, bright and a completely confident comedienne. What the critics have unanimously said about her is true. ""Easy A"" is as much the journey of a young woman into adulthood as Stone's stepping stone to a well-deserved stardom.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A surprisingly felt rather relatable.,"In fact, I'm sure many of us could relate to a character in this film. Whether it be a school friendship you had or the constant rumour spreading that the story revolves around, it evoked a sense of teenage nostalgia. And it is with this relatability that the film becomes effective and emotionally engaging. Olive Penderghast happened to be in the midst of a rumour stating she lost her virginity, slowly but surely this rumour increases in volume and soon starts to reinvent herself as the school slut. Rather unconventional, however the focus on the power of rumours and how it can emotionally inflict damage to someone is apparent. Then embedding the prominence of social media and how one can utilise the medium of webcam shows to express their emotion felt very relevant and surprisingly refreshing. On the surface it seems like a normal ""high school teen flick"" where girls bicker and struggle to get the guy of their dreams, and some of those mundane plot devices are incorporated here. But what the typical teen flick lacks is memorable and likeable characters. Fortunately, a bountiful of prominent lively expressive characters fill the screen at all times. Emma Stone carried this whole film, her quirky eccentric traits were put to excellent use here as Olive. Her dialogue execution is always on point, her facial expressions are perfectly suited to the role. The inclusion of Lisa Kudrow is an automatic win, I just see Phoebe from 'Friends' and consistently makes me jump with joy. Olive's parents were so damn likeable and lovingly endearing that every time they showed up I instantly smiled. The hilarity of the modern script that is used is actually consistent, I laughed on multiple occasions. Direction was solid, pacing was excellent albeit too short. The best way to define Easy A would be to say it's a perfect film to watch when hungover (me currently right now), and for that it does its job. Ever so watchable and incredibly cheerful, would happily view this again. But kids...don't spread rumours...",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A is for atrocious and hardly worth watching,"I wondered what the A stood for in the film's title, Easy A. Only now after watching it could I possibly tell you what it means. I think the A stands for atrocious, which is exactly what this terrible mish-mash of a teenage comedy is. Easy A looked like it could have been much better, but it failed to deliver. I had only started taking a bit of notice of Emma Stone after seeing her in Amazing Spider-Man. So I wanted to see this movie as this was her first major starring role and the movie that catapulted her to that position. It was a disappointment to say the least, but through no fault of Emma Stone's.The supporting cast was terrible due to not enough time devoted to the development of characters (eg. Amanda Bynes), overacting (especially from Patricia Clarkson, but also a bit from Stanley Tucci), and that they added nothing much to the story (Thomas Haden Church, Lisa Kudrow among others). As a result, the writing was bland as their seemed to be no noteworthy plot to speak of as it is unrealistic to me, and the direction was poor. I was expecting something in the style of Mean Girls but this is a poor girl's version of that. Emma Stone's character does come off as a bit of a Lindsay Lohan-Mean Girls clone, but not nearly as good. Thankfully, Emma Stone is much better than that. I prefer her in straighter roles such as Birdman and La La Land. If you are a big fan of Emma Stone, check them titles out and don't waste time on this dull film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fantastic high-school comedy that is both witty and insightful.,"Easy A reminds me of Mean Girls, Veronica Mars, and The Assassination of a High School President. It is a fun, witty high-school comedy with serious undertones that are very effectively conveyed without being preachy.Olive (Emma Stone) is an ordinary high-school girl that just doesn't want to hang out with her best friend, Rhriannon, (Alyson Michalka) one weekend. In order to escape she fabricates a date for the weekend, then spends said weekend at home, doing all kinds of unexciting and unremarkable things. Upon returning to school she is relentlessly questioned by Rhriannon in the girl's bathroom about her weekend. In order to get Rhriannon off her back Olive makes up a sex-filled lie that is overheard by the school Jesus freak, Marianne (Amanda Bynes). Thus the rumor is born and spread at the speed of text and overnight Olive becomes the school slut, who also happens still be a virgin. As nobody will believe otherwise, Olive embraces her new image (at least on the surface, she never actually becomes anything remotely resembling a slut) and begins to wear provocative clothing emblazoned with a scarlet ""A"" in reference to The Scarlett Letter, which she is studying in her English class.What follows is a very witty and entertaining tale about peer pressure, the power of rumors, self-confidence, individuality, love and self-sacrifice. The movie is funny throughout and the supporting cast includes Malcolm McDowell, Thomas Haden Church, and Stanley Tucci, all of whom are just as entertaining as Emma Stone herself. I very highly recommend this film and plan on buying a copy for myself when I have the opportunity to do so.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A is the most adorable and entertaining high school movie since Mean Girls. Everything about this movie is done to perfection. Emma Stone is as charming as ever. The Scarlet Letter based plot is effective. And the Juno-esque dialogues never fail to amuse.Easy A starts off as an average teen comedy with the protagonist and the best friend along with the obnoxious antagonist. But what makes this movie different from all the other mediocre films is its intelligent narration and its fast-paced yet deliberate story-telling. And unlike other teen comedies, Easy A doesn't just throw vulgar and clichéd jokes at you and expect you to laugh. Instead it is presented in a subtle and ironic manner.This film also contains many rich and relatable characters. To sum it all up, this is one of the best teen comedies of recent years.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Superficial,I do not understand why people are fascinated in this girl's growth and development. The main character (Olive) makes these live video feeds about these embarrasing lies that grab too many people's attention. She felt like a very distant character to like.

A great throwback to the 80's when teen comedies ruled!,"'EASY A': Four Stars (Out of Five)Emma Stone (of 'ZOMBIELAND' and 'SUPERBAD' fame) stars in this surprisingly well made teen film that's sort of an homage to the great ones, like those of John Hughes (which the film references several times). It's directed by Will Gluck (an experienced television writer / producer who also directed the awful 'FIRED UP!') and written by first time writer Bert V. Royal. The film co-stars Penn Badgley, Cam Gigandet, Alison Michalka and Amanda Bynes (in what was supposed to be her last role but she changed her mind and un-retired). It also has several older experienced stars in impressive supporting roles like Thomas Haden Church, Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow and Malcolm McDowell.Stone stars as Olive, a good girl who feels almost completely unnoticed at school. That all changes when she's coerced into fibbing to her best friend Rhiannon (Michalka) about losing her virginity to a guy she made up. That's overheard by stuck-up Christian gossip queen Marianne (Bynes) who blabs it all around school. Although despised by many she likes the sudden attention. So when bullied gay classmate Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks her to do him a favor and help spread a false rumor that she slept with him she feels morally obligated to do so (which furthers the rumors about her). More outcasts come to Olive for help and with a little cash incentive as well as pity she keeps helping them. Her life begins to imitate that of the character in the book 'The Scarlet Letter' which she's reading in school and things quickly spiral out of control.I didn't have any desire to see this movie after seeing the trailer and TV commercials, which sell it as a typical clichéd teen comedy, but after reading so many surprisingly positive reviews and witnessing it's equally impressive box-office earnings I felt compelled to do so (on video last week when it came out, through a dollar rental). I was surprised to learn all the hype is true; it is a surprisingly clever and entertaining teen comedy. The dialog is all witty, especially coming from the parents (Tucci and Clarkson, who play about the coolest parents ever depicted on screen) and Church (who plays one of the coolest teachers). The directing is effective and Stone's transition to leading lady is an impressive one as well (there's already a project re-teaming Stone with Gluck in the works). All of the supporting players are more than adequate, especially Bynes who makes a great bitchy religious nut. The film is funny, inspiring and a great throwback to the 80's (when teen comedies ruled).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVckRO-OANw",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the Best Teen Comedies to Come in a While,"Easy A is a brilliant teen comedy. The first half of the movie is extremely hilarious and attention-grabbing. It draws you in with its opening intro of a web-cast, and Olive (the main character) tells you her story of how she ruined her flawless reputation. It begins with a lie about her losing her virginity on a weekend, with that lie turning into a rumor. Then, a gay classmate asks her to fake having sex with her to keep her new found reputation consistent and to have bullies stop disrespecting him. You may think you know where the story is going, but it pulls the rug out from under you and under itself; it takes risks that other similar films nowadays would be afraid to do. The story is very original, with several great performances, especially from Emma Stone who plays Olive. She has superb comic timing and is able to carry the movie. Penn Badgley and Aly Michalka are funny and believable as her love interest and best friend respectively. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are particularly funny as the quirky parents. Dan Byrd plays the gay teenager with believability and humor. The only criticisms I have are that the film reaches its ending but runs out of things to say, and that the parents seem a little TOO perfect for a girl who is faking sexual activity.

"The previous teen movie influence is obvious, but Emma Stone's performance is impeccable.","MYeah is havin' an okay day. Saw Easy A, and got a coke zero at the gas station. Raise the roof!Olive Penderghast is a social outsider in her high school, but when a rumor starts floating around that she slept with a college student, she decides to use this to heighten her financial, and social placement by pretending to have sex with fellow students of hers. This works out fairly well at the start, but as the escalator of attention rises, she finds herself unhappy with herself, trying to save face, as well as dealing with a struggle between her, and the school's group of Christian enthusiasts.The film takes a lot of obvious influence from the filmography of John Hughes, as well as the recent Mean Girls, to move its story along, but only rarely is such a thing so trivial. The movie is neatly told, it moves quickly, and the humor actually works, thanks to the combined efforts of director Will Gluck, and screenwriter Bert Royal. Their work is smooth, although a montage of clips from John Hughes' filmography, as well as other little references to his films can become distracting, but the story really isn't the main reason to see the movie.The REAL reason to see the movie is the impressive star turn by the oh-so charming Emma Stone, who carries the film with a superb performance. Every witty one-liner, or subtle facial expression of hers is destined for a laugh. But her humor never overstays its welcome, her emotional timing works brilliantly, so she's more than enough reason to check the movie out. In addition to Stone, the cast includes Lisa Kudrow, Amanda Bynes, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Haden Church, and Stanley Tucci who all have a gift of natural comedy.It may not be the best teen movie ever made, but it does feature one of the year's best leading performances.And that's enough reason for me to give it an easy *** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I was a teen once, too; in fact, i was watching a series called 'Teen Wolf' once. But this movie is on another level of Sh❗t❗ness. This is just pure trash. The parents don't act like parents. The people don't act like intelligent beings. They're all artificial, one-dimensional creatures. This writing is just garbage. The script doesn't lead anywhere and it's pointless. The acting is cringy and contrived. And the jokes are like this:Man: Screw all these people.

Rumor has it....,"Well, I was definitely not the target audience for this movie, but I am sure that any teenage girl who ever felt out of place, felt like an outcast, or ever had any kind of trouble in High School will relate to this movie (or at least parts of it).The movie is straight forward and very easy to understand, and it portrays the characters in ways that you can easily get into the movie and sympathize for the characters. And hats off to Emma Stone for her performance in the movie, she was simply put, quite good in this movie. And also, Thomas Haden Church brought a lot of color and depth to the movie with his role, as did Amanda Bynes with her role.I had thought this movie to be another funny teenage comedy, but boy was I wrong. This is far from being just another pointless teen comedy with cheap laughs and shallow punch lines. Obviously, the movie is directed at teenage girls, but I think the movie does bring something out to the viewers, regardless of sex, age and such. The whole movie is built up around rumors, how they start, how they spread, and how they affect the people involved, and it did so in a good manner. And being the Hollywood movie that it is, of course, it had a sassy ending. Not spoiling it here by saying how it ends, but trust me, you will see it coming a mile away.If you, like me, saw this movie with the hopes of it being a comedy, you will be disappointed. Sure there are moments that had comedy value, but not enough to actually make you laugh out loud, or enough to be labeled a comedy as per se. There is a deeper meaning to this movie, and you will appreciate that fully if you are a teenage girl in High School, or if you were a teenage girl in High School in the past.Not a bad movie at all, just wished I had known what it was about prior to seeing it, and would have had some type of heads up on it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It's kind of obvious, now that I look at it, but it seemed like just general American landscape.This will always be my favorite adaption of the scarlet letter, though I do still hold out for a proper horror take on the play.Emma Stone is as good as it gets, and even in this relatively early career milestone for her, she's already endearing and relatable.

Refreshing and Intelligent,"When I sat down to watch this movie I wasn't expecting anything more than a boring, half-spun, tale of a misunderstood teenager where everything in her life goes wrong and she does stupid things to set them right. Throw in a love affair or two in there too.But NO. Easy A was surprisingly thought provoking and hilarious. It was simply and clean cut. The execution was flawless for such a simple plot. The characters were well written and the actors who played them were well cast.After having seen a string of unoriginal, bland chick flicks the genre has basically been reduced to a category of nonsensical, waste-time movies in my opinion. It's wonderful to see some intelligent film makers out there who can combine the woes of growing up, make a lesson of it and portray it in a comic light.There is nothing about this movie that I disliked... except that it was too short. I hope they make a sequel. I recommend you go watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Enough with the sarcastic wit...,"This movie was very well-written. I'll give it that. The writer obviously spent a lot of time on it. It was, however, incredibly pretentious and completely in love with itself. I will bet my bank account that no high school kid in America talks the way the main character did. You're constantly being bombarded with sarcastic wit. At first it's pretty funny but this movie went completely overboard with it. Halfway through I thought to myself ""Hmmm, a gay guy must of written this. Only they could reference this much outside pop culture and extraneous, irrelevant information."", and whaddaya know? I think in the midst of trying to make so many pop culture references he forgot that he was actually tasked with writing a structured movie because the ending felt pretty rushed and the conflict resolved too easily. Oh, and having the unconventional, hip parents was such an original idea, and funny too. The writer watched Juno way too much. The bottom line: If you're a woman aged 13-55 or a homosexual, chances are you'll LOVE this movie. If you're a couple of normal, average, unsuspecting guys just trying to be entertained on a Sunday through Netflix on Demand, you'll be severely disappointed and the only positive thing you'll take away is that you got to see Emma Stone in lingerie and acting slutty. Actually, this is the one redeeming quality it has for all of the guys out there. Definitely worth watching just for that reason. Just put it on mute.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma is Easy on the Eyes,"I saw this movie the other day with my wife...we were looking for a lightweight movie after dinner and decided to see this one.

The parents were funny, the religious crowd looked ridiculous (fittingly so) and all around - it was well cast.Emma - looking to shake things up a bit (she went unnoticed in her school before) takes her cues from the book ""The Scarlet Letter"" and decides to wear the badge of promiscuity after convincing her annoying friend that she had lost her virginity to 'fit in' with the current trends. This little white lie then causes a humorous snowball of events when she agrees to provide the back-story for boys needing some shoring up for their own reputations.Emma Stone is a delightful young actress!

Why?,"The story is school life. About how rumors can poison your life. But in case of occurrence, the heroine is also deserved.

But not in a bad way, she just had to open her eyes, especially those around her. But, if you are waiting for something unique, then in vain. The idea itself is absolutely not new and is found in all youth films. But the highlight is something else. The way the acting is conveyed is simply mesmerizing.Very cool professional game. The actress who visited the main character is just a bomb. Emma Stone is an amazing actress.

"Mr. Hawthorne, Meet Mr. Hughes","A film that answers the question: what would you get if you crossed Nathaniel Hawthorne with John Hughes?""Easy A"" is a perky riff on ""The Scarlet Letter"" done up as a 1980s teeny-bopper movie. Emma Stone is adorable as a nerdy high school girl who gets a reputation for being a slut when a tiny lie goes viral, and then realizes that she kind of likes the attention notoriety wins her, even if it's all based on false rumor.Though mostly lightweight and funny, ""Easy A"" does convey some serious messages about the power of words, and it confirms the very real truth that what is true isn't nearly as important as what is perceived to be true (all you kids out there who think you can post whatever you want on Facebook without any consequences, take note).The adult cast features Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Stone's impossibly laid back parents (their characters are a total fantasy, but with those two actors playing them, who cares?), Thomas Haden Church as a favorite teacher and Lisa Kudrow as an unhinged guidance counselor who makes a big mistake.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Super script and a great performance from Emma Stone,"You know a good film from early on as it sucks you in and refuses to let you go until the credits roll. Emma Stone (as Olive) sucks you in right from the start after an inventive title sequence which lasts well into the films first few minutes. Stone is not just perfectly cast for the role of Olive she delivers every ounce of sharpness from a terrific script and screenplay. And the characters around Olive are just so perfectly pitched and played by a very strong support.It is hard to dislike this film or its multi-layered messages about how we deceive ourselves as we seek to deceive others, and how we'd like to have something stronger than the truth to suck and see especially when the revealed fiction is about someone we can watch being destroyed. Olive becomes an unlikely target for destruction because truth bores the pants off of others in her life.But Olive is not the destructive type. In fact Olive has a heart so big it gets her into all kinds of mischief and it is just a question of how far things will go before she breaks if indeed she has a breaking point.The film is fun to watch with some real laugh out loud moments but it still manages to get its messages across at every opportunity. So I award a maximum ten to Emma Stone and a handsome nine to the film as a whole. Recommended with a warning (You will want to watch it all over again).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A GET'S an Easy A!,"A sexless, sex comedy about an average student named Olive, who, after lie's about having a one night stand with a college to her friend, Rhiannon so Olive doesn't have to go camping with her, ends up being heard by the school's Christian snob, Marianne. After a twist of different rumours, Olive decides to go WITH the rumours, instead of stopping them. Guys end up charging Olive so they can SAY that they slept with her, but actually they didn't. And of course, the rumour get's out of hand in some hilarious ways.The movie title goes so well with the movie. In most movies, it only manages to get so far with the storytelling, but this movie takes it's full advantage of the story, with hardly any flaws. It's a mix of Mean Girls and Juno. It has a lot of gossip and sexual remarks, and also a quirky main character with clever and hilarious lines. Amanda Bynes is excellent, as usual as Marianne. Olive's parents are very clueless to what's going on and are a hoot every time they're on screen. There are some lines in here that you'll be repeating. I cannot wait for this movie to come to Bluray. The only flaw is the ending. It could have been more constructed with a better conclusion.

"Overrated, unfunny, unbelievable","This is a teen comedy film set in and around a high school in Ojai in Southern California. Emma Stone plays a 17-year-old girl who becomes infamous after she falsely claims to have had sex.Stone is a grossly overrated actress and none of the characters in the film are likable. Having her character become a notorious slut, in 21st century California, just for having sex once, is ludicrous. Most 17-year-olds have had sex.I don't know what the makers of this film were aiming for. The dialogue was toned down a lot from the original script and it is far too tame to be a raunchy sex comedy along the lines of a female version of American Pie. If Stone is trying to be this generation's Molly Ringwald, then she fails due to lack of likablity and acting talent.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma Stone is now one of my favorite actresses,"When this movie first came out almost a year ago, I didn't think about it. I didn't plan on ever watching it, I had heard good things about it, but I just thought it was a chick flick. When in fact the movie is more of a romantic comedy, and a funny one at that, I'm still not sure if I liked this or Date Night more, but both were very good movies.The film does feel much like an 80's movie, mostly John Huges movies like Ferris Bueller, Breakfast Club, as well as others. Now I was born in the 90's, but I do have a love for 80's films, like Back to the Future, Star Wars 5 and 6, and the John Hughes movie's I've seen.

Nathaniel Hawthorne's version was never like this.,"Easy A is directed by Will Gluck and written by Bert V. Royal. It stars Emma Stone, Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Stanley Tucci, Lisa Kudrow and Aly Michalka. Brad Segal scores the music and Michael Grady is the cinematographer.In order to escape going on a hippie camping trip with her friend Rhiannon (Michalka) and her parents, Olive Pendergast (Stone) lies that she is going on a date with a guy. When pressed for details by the insistent Rhiannon the following Monday, Olive further fibs that she lost her virginity to said guy. This is overheard by leader of the God Squad, Marianne Bryant (Bynes), who promptly spreads the news like wild fire. When another pupil asks for her help to hide his homosexuality by saying they had sex together, Olive, her virginal stock already tarnished, agrees and sets in wheels the motion of a world of fake floozy and financial gain. But pitfalls are surely around the cornerOK, in essence it's just a comic spin on The Scarlet Letter, which Olive and classmates are studying in class, but following on from the great standards set by Clueless and Mean Girls, Easy A has enough vigour, vibrancy and savvy nous to make it one of the best teen comedies post the 1980's. True enough to say that some of the weighty angst themes such as promiscuity, peer pressure and peripheral love are glossed over in favour of lightweight comedy, not to mention the ballsy attack on religion, but still the social comment, all be it wryly, does exist. Besides, it's more fun this way, where the one line zingers and the whippy dialogue come thick and fast, courtesy of a fine script and a wonderful array of characters. Hell, Gluck and Royal even manage to, and get top results from, referencing and homaging those much loved John Hughes and Cameron Crowe movies that so many of us remember fondly. This is very much a successful whole.The support characters are well rounded, especially the adults, where Church and Kudrow have a potent plot thread, and Tucci and Clarkson, as Olive's easy going parents, almost steal the movie from the teen actors. Seriously, those two might be the coolest parents, ever! But a film of this type could only engage and delight so many if its lead off character turns in a great one. In her first lead vehicle, Emma Stone is a revelation, further delivering on the promise shown in support slots in Superbad and Zombieland. With adroit comic timing and charm in abundance, Stone manages to blend streety cred with star wattage, making it a complete whole. Which when she is asked to be the epicentre for 98% of the lens time, is some going. Backing up Stone is Bynes who is memorable to say the least, whilst it would be wrong to not mention the fine comedy efforts of Badgley and Dan Byrd as potential love interest and gay friend respectively. The former gets the cool moment, the latter gets the laugh out loud fake sex moment.The breeziness hides just how well acted and how well written it actually is, for it's one of the best of its type and one that just gets better on repeat viewings. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fun and Filled with Social Commentary,"A gossip going out of hand and bringing untold reuptation in the life of the titular protagonist is the basic premise of the film. However, when Olive, played brilliantly by Emma Stone, has to live up to the said reputation, is when the movie finds its charms and moments.In this film, we can Emma Stone, bring her A-Game. She makes the character of Olive likeable. All the supporting cast also do a great job of complimenting her. The script also does an amazing thing, where all the characters are strongly charecterized, which makes them memorable to say the least.One wouldn't be bored while watching the film, cause it has genuine moments of wit and laughter. I found myself chuckling throughout the film, as the character tried to live up to her new found image. But at the same time, the movie has a strong social commentary on the cons of peer pressure, and where it can lead us in the long run. You see Olive enjoying her new found fame, only for it to come crashing down. The movie is also a play on the novel 'Scarlett Letter', so even the literature nerds will have something to jump into.I really enjoyed the selection of songs in the film, and also the various pop-culture references that have been sprinkled throught the runtime.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Brilliant. An easy A. (Snicker, yeah... I did that.)","This movie is by and far the best teen movie in existence. Not only because it was cast beautifully, but because the writing is witty and intelligent and the characters are interesting. Not too much of any one thing and keeps you actually interested in the storyline and the characters themselves. Emma Stone is one of my new favourite actresses and this role was MADE for her. She is utterly adorable, but not in that way that teens are generally portrayed in film. She lets you believe that she could be her anonymous self, but instead of the typical ""nobody turns bimbo/mini-skirted/Prada'd/mean girl"" star of the teen comedy/drama, this movie offers a fresh and more genuine version of the heroine's transformation. She finds herself as she finds popularity and has a good grasp of what's really going on. The bottom line is that seventeen year olds aren't idiots, they are just lacking much in the way of real world experience... but they are so often given lame roles in movies like these. This one lets you believe she's seventeen, and she has to deal with all the normal high school crap, but in a far more believable fashion than usual. And with a fabulous script, all the characters come to life.Olive's (Stone) character is largely supported by her great relationship with her eccentric but genius family. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson shine in their parental roles. Their report is a brilliantly modern and refreshing journey away from what has become such a common cliché of dysfunctional family dynamic that I think teens are starting to believe that they are supposed to act like idiots around their parents. My own teen years looked far more like Olive's than anything else I've seen, and Stone's character portrayal allows a teen to believe that it's actually OK to be intelligent and have a confidence level that is parallel to high school rather than dependent on it. Or defined by it. All in all, a great film for anyone, not just the teen genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Easy A"" is enjoyable except for the annoying vocabulary","""Easy A"" has way too many similarities to the overrated ""Juno"" (2007). Like Ellen Page, Emma Stone did portray her character, Olive, with humour and heart, but no teenagers talk like that! She's not indie-cool and smarter than everybody else, it's only young adult writers who wish they were like that (or perhaps a young adult writer who wishes he could sleep with Diablo Cody).Olive is ostracized at school because of a rumour of promiscuity. Knowing that the plot is congruent with Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"", I was thinking that I should read that before seeing this film just to make sure that I catch all the subtle nuances, but no, there's no need, there is nothing subtle about this film. It's just a modern tale about exclusion and teen sex, but with a rather refreshing ambivalent take on abstinence versus promiscuity.The problem with ""Easy A"" is that Olive and her classmates are not as smart as their vocabulary (and based on a few evident mistakes, the writer is not as smart as the vocabulary either). I'll let the parents slide because Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were very funny and made me laugh through every scene. ""Easy A"" is an enjoyable watch but only if you can get past the sesquipedalian loquaciousness.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Emma Stone gets an A in her first lead role,"¨The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated.¨ I wasn't surprised as to how much I actually enjoyed this teen comedy because I had seen Emma Stone's work in the past. She was only a supporting character in Zombieland and Superbad, but she was great in both those films and her career looked promising. Easy A is her first lead role and she proved she can carry a film all on her own. Emma Stone has the right look for a movie star and at the same time has a natural wit that very few young actresses have. Her performance reminded me a little of Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls (I just hope her career doesn't follow a similar fate). Stone is a much better actress and seems a lot smarter as well, but let's not forget that Lohan also started off with a promising career. Easy A is directed by Will Gluck, who actually had only directed one other relatively unknown movie before this (Fired Up). The screenplay was also written by another unknown writer in the film industry: Bert V. Royal (who had worked for TV in the Dave Chappell Show). I really enjoyed the script however, and felt it was written by someone with the comedic genius as Tina Fey for example. Easy A had everything good going for it: Emma Stone and a really funny and smart script. That's all you need for a comedy to work these days. Will Gluck pulled it off and delivered one of the best comedies of 2010 (even though there weren't very many good comedies this year).Olive (Emma Stone) narrates via a video blog how she told her best friend a little white lie about losing her virginity, and how that small lie spread thanks to the High School rumors. The story is told by her and we see what she is saying through flashbacks. It all began when Olive told her best friend, Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) that she had a date with a college guy so she had an excuse not to go camping with her strange family. After not doing anything all weekend, Olive meets Rhiannon back at school and she asks how the date went. Rhi suspects that Olive had sex with this mysterious guy and insists so much that Olive simply lies so she won't bother her anymore. Marianne (Amanda Bynes), the religious freak in school, hears the conversation in the bathroom and begins spreading the rumor. All of a sudden Olive begins to be noticed by everyone at school and she kind of likes being the center of attention. That same day Olive is sent to detention and spends the afternoon with Brandon (Dan Byrd) who's also been detained. Brandon is constantly bullied on by his classmates due to the fact that he's gay. When Brandon learns from Olive that the rumor is a lie he comes up with the idea to lie about having sex with her in order for the students at school to stop believing he's gay. All of a sudden Olive's reputation as a skank begins to grow and she ends up finding herself lying about having relations with several of the students in order to help them out. Olive finds a parallel between herself and the character from The Scarlett Letter (Hester Prynne), the book they are studying in school with professor Griffith (Thomas Haden Church). Everyone seems to judge Olive based on the rumors, except Todd (Penn Badgley), the guy who she's always had a crush for.Emma Stone proved she can have a lead role in Hollywood and does it well, but she also had a great cast to back her up. Stanley Tucci played her father and he's always funny in every scene he's in. He's just such a great actor that always makes any movie so much funnier when he's on screen. Patricia Clarkson is also hilarious in her role as Olive's mother. These are two of the most unconventional parents I've seen in a movie this year. They were great on screen together. Amanda Bynes was also good in her role as a religious freak who was constantly judging Olive. Thomas Haden Church is always funny in every movie that he appears in so Emma Stone had a great cast to work along with. She also counted with a great script (I loved the narration about the 80's movies and how she wished her life would be directed by John Hughes). The video blog journal also added to the comedy as we got to hear Olive's witty side notes about what was going on. I really didn't care too much for Cam Gigandet and Lisa Kudrow's characters. Their performances were off par with the rest of the cast. Neither of them get much screen time so they don't affect the movie at all. Easy A is easily one of the best comedies of the year. I really enjoyed it and thought Emma Stone was great in it along with the rest of the supporting cast. I wish they made more comedies like this one.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun, entertaining but unrealistic movie","If you take reality out of the equation and look at this movie as a fun loving teen comedy then ""Easy A"" can be considered quite entertaining. Emma Stone was perfect for the role and it was fun watching her successfully transform from an innocent teenager to the school sex symbol. Her narration throughout the movie added to the story line and helped the audience to get to know the real Olive. However, in my opinion, it seems highly unrealistic in modern day society that the school would be in such an uproar after learning of her activities as it is common knowledge that teenagers are sexually active and high school is a playground for sex and drugs.

Sharp and Funny,"Great movie. Emma Stone as Olive is a likable character, full of sass, attitude and a sharp sense of humour. This makes her very easy to route for as the main protagonist. I really couldn't imagine anyone but Stone in the role....plus those beautiful eyes are just too hard not to fall for. Anyway.... The film is a modern take on The Scarlet Letter (with several references to early versions of the story throughout - just in case you missed the point) and brings the ideas of said story into the modern era, placing it slap bang in the middle of a high school, the perfect place to explore it's promiscuous tone. The film dabbles in themes from its '80s high school' predecessors and even throws in some neat satirical homages to boot. As Olive herself says: ""...no, no, John Hughes did not direct my life..."" and Will Gluck skirts around the clichés just enough to make Easy A unique amongst it's peers. I really enjoyed this film. Good writing, clever dialogue, solid cast and some genuinely funny moments. Also worth a mention are some wonderful turns from Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olive's parents.

Too bad Hollywood Christian Hatred Ruined this Almost Gem,"This film was almost set up to be a classic.. REALLY!!! But bad writing, ignorance or bias got in the way leaving a bad taste of unrealistic characters.Of course some may disagree but really anyone who really has Christian Friend or at least does not attack their friends beliefs Christian, Jewish, Islamic or Atheist will understand that BAD stereotype is in itself HATE. The reason I myself believe this was in fact Hollywood liberalism ??? Look at the characters.. all the Good People are in fact Liberal, Left or Atheist... All the Bad one.. well.. you get the idea... But saying that, I still loved the good guys for who they were as believable characters.. It was the hateful ones which lack realism.This is why I am so disappointed. The film mentions and uses many classic like the ""Breakfast Club"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"", yet by using it's negative and unrealistic stereotypes of High School Christians Kids the writers sabotaged their own movie.from greatness... I really loved the premises, Acting and most of the script.It is not that the film needed this mean spirit that all Christian High school Kids or even Any are somehow hateful, mean spirited, self righteous instigators of rumors and them-self not following their beliefs in acting this way. The fact is All Kids that age do gossip, spread rumors and hurt others.. but few actually act as mean spirited as the Christians were portrayed.Of course some will not see this, themselves probably believing this was real life and justified.. or perhaps tire of the mean 'Cheerleaders always taking the wrap... that's fine.The point is, No real CLASSICS, especially the great ones portrayed and in fact used by name or in intimation had to resort to naming any one religious or cultural group... It is this reviewers belief, if they had simply made the antagonist average High school ""Kids"" like most of the followers.. perhaps this film would be as loved ten years from now as the ones mentioned... Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey... Can't Buy Me Love....!Still a good solid 5... Worth Watching at least once in a lifetime but I believe, will end up in the $5 bin at Wally World then onward to the Lost and Forgotten list. Too Bad.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Predictable and cliché-like,"Let's start by saying that, even before starting to watch this film, I knew what I was going to go through: typical teenage comedy, full of sexual references, a protagonist that fights to get his/her revenge against a copious number of wicked antagonists, a cheesy finale and possibly just a couple of funny scenes. This is exactly what this is.The only reason I decided to put myself through this ordeal was that the film stars Emma Stone: a funny and vibrant actress, an explosion of energy, a chameleon capable of wearing different styles in exactly the same elegant way. That is the reason why I've given this film 5 and not 4 or even 3: her mere presence.The rest of it is just a disappointment, a sequence of surreal scenes, a nonsensical banality.

Interesting idea about saying that you did something when you didn't especially when its considered bad or a sin! I started the movie, watched few minutes to see if it could sustain my interest, and it did! The narrative was engaging enough that I didn't feel bored. The plot has an easy pace that keep things real yet it doesn't feel too serious. Emma Stone did a good role both as a protagonist and the narrator. I was happy to see Penn Badgley in a movie after watching him in Gossip Girl.

Wonderful 80s-style film with Emma Stone stealing the show!,"I have had this movie on my watchlist for many years, but I kept finding reasons to pass on it. I wasn't sure what to expect based on a one-sentence synopsis. What's in a movie about high school gossip and rumors? I thought it was a chick flick. I finally got around to it, and I was pleasantly surprised it was nothing like I thought. First, a brief plot. Emma Stone, who plays the character of Olive, is a typical high-school student. An innocent, playful comment she makes to her best friend Rhiannon in the restroom gets picked up by the school snot Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes (a former Disney star, whose name I haven't heard since I was in High School). Marianne makes sure the entire school knows about it. The rumors start flying from there, and other students take advantage of Olive. She decides to take advantage of it herself.There is little to not like about 'Easy A'. It was a coming-of-age film straight out of John Hughes' playbook. I especially liked the homages they paid to 80s classics like The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller, Sixteen Candles, Say Anything, and others. The acting from the cast, cinematography, pacing, and likeable characters all stand out to me. The comedy and wit take over the film. Emma Stone stole the show in her first star role here with amazing acting. Her film debut was 'Superbad' in 2007, which I thought of while watching this. She is charming, witty, carefree, and on point with her expressions. Ironically, Stone was homeschooled in hih school, and she plays a high school student. Wordplay is a big part of the script, including characters named after various foods. I also found it interesting that her character's name was Olive Penderghast, an anagram for 'I love pretend shag.' I won't explain it further because it would ruin the film. There are two issues with the film (both are nitpicking so don't bother). First, students often talk like no high school student I know. I will excuse it because it's a movie, not a documentary! Second, Olive was supposed to be an average, unattractive, low-key student. The movie depicted her as an above average, attractive, and popular student.Would I recommend this? Yes. This film brought back memories of other high school films. I have become a fan of Emma Stone ever since I watched several of her movies, including 'The Amazing Spiderman.' She sure can act and has a bright future ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Take it, Easy!!","Emma Stone continues rolling as a surefire outstanding actress with her vastly charismatic role as high school teen Olive in the gem flick ""Easy A"". Olive is the prototype perky, witty high school teen. Olive is a teen so she is entitled to make mistakes, and hers was lying to her best friend Rhiannon that she slept with a college boy. Olive spills the beans to Rhiannon in the high school female's potty room where the obnoxious, religious zealot Marianne is also at unknowingly to Olive and Rhiannon. Therefore, Marianne turns the gossip overdrive into high gear and before you could say ""I want some of that Olive Oil all over my body"", the entire student body thinks that Olive is a certifiable slut. There is more that transpires in ""Easy A"" than what was just explained or else it would have been an ""Easy D"". Particularly, the parts that Olive becomes a charity poster girl by helping out the geek and gay males of the school by pretending to sleep with them, so their bullying victimizations come to a cease fire. ""Easy A"" is a modern-day adaptation (high school style) to Nathaniel Hawthorne's literary classic ""The Scarlet Letter"". It was just our luck that Director Will Gluck did a phenomenal job in keeping the movie entertaining and engaging at all times. I especially loved how Gluck incorporated the 80's teen flicks homage into the narrative. That was pretty to think, and you could say anything about 80's movies, but don't you forget about how those 80's teen flicks made such a difference in the history of teen cinema. I was also royally impressed with Screenwriter Bert Royal's pretty nifty ""Easy A"" scribe; it was filled with zappy one-liners! The supporting ensemble of ""Easy A"" sure did aid to the film's success. The greats Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were (how do you say it?) great as Olive's modern parents Dill & Rosemary. Tucci probably had the funniest lines of the film, and nailed each one of them. The very much underutilized Thomas Haden Church was steady as the cool teacher Mr. Griffiths. Lisa Kudrow guided herself quite effectively in her role as the guidance counselor with a secret, Mrs. Griffiths; and yes, relation to Mr. Griffiths. And also the young gossip guns of ""Easy A"" also held their own with their solid performances- Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd (Olive's crush), and Alyson Mychalka as Rhiannon. But the spotlight of ""Easy A"" has to be the marvel of Emma Stone. She not only made the grade, but just moved up the thespian scholarship ranks as one of the best young actresses working in movies today. ""Easy A"" deserves an easy A, its one of the best movies I have seen in the last two decades about the lives of high school students.

A fresh take on high school bring back the lifetime drama at college,"Easy A (2010), directed by Will Gluck and starring Emma Stone, is a sharp, witty, and heartwarming teen comedy that stands out as one of the most memorable films in its genre. With a clever script, outstanding performances, and a fresh perspective on high school life, it's a modern classic that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages.At its core, Easy A is a playful reimagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, set in the halls of an American high school. The film follows Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a smart and self-assured teenager whose small lie about losing her virginity spirals out of control. What begins as a harmless attempt to boost her social standing quickly snowballs into a full-blown scandal, forcing Olive to confront the double standards and moral hypocrisies of her peers.Emma Stone's performance as Olive is nothing short of phenomenal. With her effortless charisma, razor-sharp wit, and impeccable comedic timing, Stone brings a unique blend of vulnerability and confidence to the role.

She gave me the Cruella vibe, especially near the end, and I loved her performance in this movie.The movie also did a great of job of showing the detrimental power of rumors, although in a funny and satirical way. The rumors spread faster than COVID, and the kindness of our main character only increased the virality of these rumors.As for problems, even though Emma Stone was great, she and other actors were just a bit too old to play high school students.

Being a teenager is no walk in the park.,"The movie was fantastic! Emma's portrayal of the main character was not only charming and captivating but also brilliantly executed. The narrative itself took on a satirical tone, presenting a teenage tale that was laced with humour at every turn. Emma's performance truly carried the film, as her down-to-earth narration made it easy for me to empathize with her character. On a deeper level, the movie delved into the theme of self-discovery amid external chaos, emphasizing the process of reshaping and rediscovering oneself beyond preconceived notions. The supporting cast, including Amanda Bynes, Penn Badgley, Stanley Tucci, Lisa Kudrow, and Dan Byrd, also delivered outstanding performances. One of the most great scenes was when Olive truly found love with Wood Chuck Todd, played by Penn Badgley. Emma Stone and Penn Badgley's chemistry was truly remarkable.

"Kind of mean-spirited, not all that entertaining and strangely out-dated, to boot.","Most of 'Easy A (2010)' ends up coming across kind of mean-spirited, especially in regards to its minority groups. It perpetuates some pretty out-dated, stereotypical ideals surrounding the need to 'fit in', even if you fake it, and the 'outsider' status that apparently comes with any kind of non-conformity. These elements both feel decidedly out of place in a 2010 picture, considering that society - and, even, high-school itself - had already moved past that kind of thinking (for the most part, at least). There's also an issue with the flick playing into the sub-genre's wider problem of sexualising teenagers, which is 'normalised' somewhat since adult actors are portraying the young characters, and the sense that the film adds to the problem of gender-imbalance when it comes to the perception of sex itself. It's a good step-forward that the picture has a female lead, don't get me wrong, but the way it handles its subject matter almost seems to do more harm than good. There are a few more specific story problems, with the keenest of which being that our 'hero' proactively gets herself into most of her own troubles, without much development done to explore why, which makes it slightly difficult to empathise with her - or some of her actions, at least - and reduces wider audience investment. The ending itself also isn't so much a solution as a 'brush under the rug and hope nobody notices'. Overall, the feature is just not funny or all that entertaining, either, and it's pretty difficult to see what the point of it all is, aside from pushing a few generic and, frankly, unfulfilled morals that should be obvious to begin with. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Smart and funny with good performances,"Though I have never been very impressed by director John Hughes, much less the Hughes parody films, I found myself engaged and even enthralled by Will Gluck's Easy A. The premise is intelligent in the fact that it takes Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter as its literary and character template. Gluck than combines this with John Hughes parody to create this original, even provocative film. The lines and dialogue are conveyed well by Stone and Bynes scores a hit as a snotty church girl with a lot of hang-ups.

The two key factors are the equally funny and clever script with tons of great lines and Emma Stone's performance, effortlessly carrying the movie as the charming, sarcastic, witty but deep down quite sensitive and insecure, Olive.There are parts that feel unnecessary and the movie could have done without, such as the actual romance between Olive and Todd, but not much time is wasted there and it never feels too annoying or distracting.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy A (2010),"There are many references to John Hughes films in Easy A, as there are to The Scarlet Letter (not the Demi Moore version).

Their banter is excruciatingly sweet and hysterical, such as Tucci's riffing on his adopted son ""Where are you from originally?"". Stone can be a bit precocious, but manages to avoid annoying arrogance or self awareness, like Juno. It's a film that deals with exploitation of those that are willing to help others.

Emma Stone has arrived,"http://reelpopcorn.blogspot.com/I don't know what it is about movies that take place in a high school setting, but too often characters in them just look way too old. This is definitely the case a few times with Easy A, but that little stigma aside the movie does deliver.Easy A, stars Emma Stone, of Superbad and Zombieland fame. She plays the role of Olive Penderghast, a precocious teenager who attends a fictional high school called Ojai North High in Ojai, California. This is significant to mention because of the liberal lifestyle associated with the ""Governator"" state. Olive's family is quite the diverse crew and her parents, played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, certainly give Olive adequate room to express her teenage self.Express herself is exactly what she does. Olive's English class is studying Nathaniel Hawthorne's, the Scarlet Letter, and she takes it upon herself, after a scathing rumor is started about her, not to deny the rumors, but let them take on a life of their own. This has an alarming effect on the student body at Ojai, who eventually all have an opinion of what she is doing or not doing.Emma Stone has, in my opinion, solidified herself as a very viable movie star. She basically crushes the role of Olive and is more than easy on the eyes. Also, at 22 years old she has a wide range of roles that she could fit into.Easy A, has a lot of social commentary directed towards teenagers that might be wasted on them, but it isn't on an older audience that has sat in classrooms similar to the ones in the movie. The advent of Facebook and other social networking sites has made gossip spread exponentially faster, but there hasn't been a movie released in awhile that depicts what types of effects it can have.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I loved !!!,"It's fascinating how the theme of adultery is tackled in this movie, and it's refreshing to see it portrayed in a modern setting. The film's exploration of the consequences of infidelity feels relatable, and it adds an extra layer of complexity to the story. The fact that everything starts with one lie shows how easily things can spiral out of control.Emma Stone's performance in the movie was undoubtedly excellent, and she brought her character to life with such skill and nuance. The supporting cast was equally impressive, and each actor brought their unique perspective to their respective roles. Together, they formed a cohesive and dynamic ensemble that kept the audience engaged throughout.The movie's emotional depth was another aspect that made it stand out. The balance between the light-hearted and the heavy moments was well-maintained, and the transitions between the two were seamless. The church scene, in particular, was a standout moment that elicited both laughter and tears from the audience. The film's ability to evoke such a range of emotions is a testament to its quality.The plot twists and comedic moments were also noteworthy, and they added an extra layer of excitement and entertainment to the movie. The clever writing kept the audience guessing and engaged, and the humor provided some much-needed levity in the more intense scenes.Overall, this movie is a testament to the power of love and the human spirit. It showcases the ups and downs of relationships, the importance of honesty, and the strength of the bonds that connect us. It's a film that will make you laugh, cry, and leave the theater feeling uplifted and inspired.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Clueless for the 2000s,"Easy A - a modern-day teen movie that actually works! A John Hughes-esqe flick for the 2000. Fresh content, witty and clever dialogue, charming characters make this movie a winner. Gives us a closer look at the kind of gossip that travels a high school, set up in a storyteling fashion, with the main character talking to the audience on a webcast intended for her classmates (and the movie's target audience) Our main character Olive, portrayed by new ""it"" girl (and Phx area native) Emma Stone, aims to grab the attention of the school. Through a simple white lie, Olive quickly, almost inadvertently circulates self-perpetuated rumors that she is the school slut, granting sexual favors to various boys upon request. We see various characters intertwine with Olive, including her hilarious parents (one of which is Stanley Tucci) who use brilliant humor effectively, her best friend who leaves her side, the judgmental oober-Christian, a few faculty members including her tough principal, and the boy in the wings.This quasi-romance/comedy tends to move pretty quickly - styling the humor to what we see in such shows as 30 Rock or Arrested Development, where if you wait too long to try and get a line the film moves on to the next line.The bedroom scene where Olive pretends to ""get it on"" with the gay character is quite the riot, I couldn't stop laughing. Her quick wit is displayed throughout by snappy comebacks with both her high school tormentors as well as her ""clientele"".The diverse mix of character personalities kept me continually entertained, especially when I couldn't guess what they were going to say or do next. I really appreciated the authenticity of Olive's character - she was clearly an atypical high schooler, yet you could identify with her and want to root for her, all while she stayed believable.Grade in my book: 8/10 stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Easy comedy,"Easy A is a crude comedy. Starts like a typical high school mellow drama where the teens live the modern life of connectivity while not being connected as such with each other. While being proudly rude to each other forming cults and spreading verbal viruses all over, it seems like the high school is functioning as it should be. But someone is unnoticed and she thinks that it has to end. So even though unwillingly she lies to her best friend about losing her virginity over a weekend date and that sure starts a rumor that spreads faster than wild fire. So then she becomes the talk of the school and ultimately for some time she starts to enjoy the attention she gets until things really starts to go south. Rumors, rumors and more rumors ultimately destroying her reputation, puts her under pressure to determine to get everything back to normal and find love with someone actually thinks she is special.Easy A is fast phased. Characters are quickly introduced , dropped out of the plot without much introduction. But there is no such big trumpet welcomes needed too after all as the characters become familiar rapidly too as each of them have something special about them. So the cast is not a waste. Even the acting is OK. You can't expect Oscar winning performances in a college comedy duh.The humor is subtle. But used appropriately in places where it suits. There is no huge camera movements or extraordinary cinematography, but I like the way the opening titles roll out. Easy A is a simply movie.

Clueless Mean Girl?,"Easy A (2010) -This film was a bit different from the usual High School film where everyone has already been sleeping with everyone anyway and bragging about it, usually quite loudly. In fact the attitudes depicted seemed quite archaic even compared to my secondary school years back in the 90's. I felt that the story would have been more believable if it was set in the 1940's or a Catholic girls school or something? I'd always assumed that to appear cool the idea was to pretend to have lost my virginity until I actually did and not the other way around.It actually had a lot of similarities to 'The Edge Of Seventeen' (2016), the Netflix TV series 'Heartbreak High' (2022-) and the stage show and film 'Dear Evan Hansen' (2021). There was even elements of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' (1997-2003) and 'Grange Hill' (1978-2008) in there. Basically anything that had ever centred around a school, including 'Mean Girls' (2004), 'Clueless' (1995), 'Scream' (1996) and so many more As such I didn't find it very original.What I did like was the family dynamic with Stanley Tucci, as the Dad Dill and Mum Rosemary played by Patricia Clarkson and their brilliant parenting techniques. The banter between the whole family was great actually and they would have been dream parents to come home to after trying times at school. I'd like to have seen more of them all. The little brother Chip (Bryce Clyde Jenkins) could easily have been a larger part for Emma Stone's Olive character to have interacted with and ultimately I felt that these were wasted actors and opportunities, that perhaps the story could have been about having cool parents during an emotional crisis. A sort of ""How To Deal With Teenagers"" sort of exploration, because the school element was all so samey.I did like that Emma definitely delivered the comedy with great timing and delivery and I liked Thomas Haden Church as her teacher Mr Griffith.I could easily watch this again, because it didn't offend or deliver bad performances, but I didn't feel that it gave me that much to think about, except perhaps Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley), whom even my Mother said ""I like him!"", because he was very nice.I was disappointed overall though, because the clips that I'd seen were so funny, most of them containing the underused brother and Mr Tucci.504.77/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

With his movie ""Easy A"", director Will Gluck pays tribute to John Hughes by telling a fun story that contains the interests and concerns of a large group of young students at a public high school in Ojai, California, in 2010.
Using an elaborate Bert V Royal script with very sharp dialogues, the director weaves a consistent plot in which his characters seem to be obsessed and with the firm purpose of building a false image of their true personality.
From this thesis, the director establishes a satirical comedy tone and gives free rein to pointing out the topics that concern him about our society: the games of loyalties and disloyalties as appropriate, friendships for interests, fidelities, betrayals: hypocrisy.
The film also shows how a small lie to support someone, can lead you towards a very problematic process for yourself and for third parties, reaching a point where amending mistakes and demonstrating the truth, will necessarily bring consequences and collateral damage.
Another very important aspect of the film ""Se Dice de Mi"" is the emergence of a great actress, who until now had only appeared in minor roles and here she forcefully demonstrates her limitless histrionic abilities, Emma Stone.
A very agile comedy full of references, scenes, cinematographic and literary that together with the thematic force, the measured direction, plus the impressive performance of Emma Stone make ""Easy A"" a key film and a benchmark in this genre.
Cast includes: Penn Badgley, Amanda Bynes, Dan Byrd, Thomas Haden Church, Patricia Clarkson, Lisa Kudrow, Malcolm Mcdowell",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Teen Drama,"The movie Easy A is good humorous teen movie that shows the life of average American girl who has the same dream like anyone else of losing her virginity once she comes of age.In social media this thing is being negatively propagated about the boys from eastern countries that they long too much for having sex and watch too much porn but those girls from the western countries who made these porn for their living are regarded as innocent and civilized which is the worst way of covering their bad life style.But after watching this movie one can easily know how much hungry for sex American teen boys are? Just to have sex with a girl or faking it boys are spending hundreds of dollars for this cause. It may be seen in the movie that married woman is having sex with her student while the husband is having no knowledge of that moreover the father and mother of the lead actress are happy that their daughter is going to school in a stripper's dress code and they don't feel bad about it rather they seem to encourage her.The worst example of a family is shown in the movie which is not at all in consonance with reality or if so it be than God should protect us from American family life, which is so disgraceful.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pleasantly surprised by this movie.,"I really thought this movie would be somewhat outdated or strange, but I actually really enjoyed it. I think it aged alright and it gave me a ton of laughs. Great casting and all the actors and actresses really fit their characters and if anything, added to them. They were all perfect for their roles. I think the dialogue was good. The script was funny and fresh and it wasn't at all stiff or unnatural. The score was good, and the characters were written nicely. It was a good portrayal of high school, nothing too outrageously weird. And it wasn't predictable. There were some twists and turns which I thoroughly enjoyed and although half the movie I was getting second hand embarrassment, I was also laughing and struggling to breathe. It was hilarious. I haven't seen anything like this one, original and pretty good if I do say so myself. The plot itself was good. It either would've turned out great or turned out horrible due to bad execution. But they did a good job. I enjoyed Easy A: anyone can like it, appeals to everyone, and it was a decent, funny, and sweet movie. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
MY V***** SMELLS LIKE SIXTEEN CANDLES,"Really more of a commentary on teen and high school comedies of the 20th and 21st centuries, but it's an entertaining and engaging dissection of movie tropes and social moresStone's character openly mocks the then-contemporary trend for film-makers to base their teen romances on novels familiar from the US high school syllabus, while appearing in a teen movie based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's weighty set textAs well as having great fun with the idea of lazy students basing their essays about the source novel on their viewing of the awful Demi Moore film adaptation, insteadThe central conceit - a lie concerning a sexual encounter spiraling out of control - serves as a strong spine to support the rest of the story, even if it doesn't unfold credibly and how Stone's character feels about the escalation of events isn't always nailed downThe dramatic and emotional stakes are very low, which is maybe a result of Tucci and Clarkson's parent characters - the usual source of stakes and tension in such narratives - being played as very light, glib and quippyWhich is all fair enough - the purpose of the film is to amuse and entertain, which it does admirably.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wow what a lovely movie,"""Easy A"" is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends wit, charm, and relatability, making it a timeless classic. Directed by Will Gluck, this 2010 film tells the story of Olive Penderghast, a high school student played by Emma Stone, who navigates the complexities of adolescence with humor, vulnerability, and a healthy dose of sarcasm.From the opening scene, it's clear that ""Easy A"" is something special. The film's clever script, penned by Bert V. Royal, is full of quick-witted one-liners and insightful observations about high school life. Stone brings Olive to life with a captivating performance that showcases her impressive range and comedic timing.As Olive, Stone is relatable, endearing, and utterly authentic. Her character's struggles to find her place in the social hierarchy, deal with the pressures of reputation, and navigate the treacherous waters of relationships are deeply resonant. Whether she's confiding in her best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) or trading barbs with the school's resident mean girl Marianne (Amanda Bynes), Olive's voice feels genuinely her own.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olive's delightfully quirky parents. Penn Badgley also shines as Todd, Olive's charming and laid-back love interest.Visually, the film is a treat, with a vibrant color palette and a keen eye for detail that perfectly captures the aesthetic of suburban California. The cinematography is crisp and engaging, adding to the overall sense of energy and vitality that permeates the film.What truly sets ""Easy A"" apart, however, is its unwavering optimism and empathy. This is a film that genuinely cares about its characters, flaws and all, and that radiates a warm, inclusive spirit that's impossible to resist.In short, ""Easy A"" is a triumph - a hilarious, heartfelt, and beautifully crafted film that will resonate with audiences of all ages. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP. And if you have seen it, well, it's probably time for a rewatch. Trust me, you won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
an infantile film with contrived dialogue,"I wanted to like this film given the good reviews, the cast and all. I found it unbearable and had to watch it in parts, just to be able to finish it. Why did I do this to myself? Because up until the very end I was hoping that the film would somehow redeem itself and prove worthy of the accolades in the reviews here. Alas. The film is infantile. As a European I don't know if U. S> teenagers really have such conversations or such infantile approach to all things sexual but I was truly left flabbergasted. Then, the dialogue tries to be witty but comes out contrived and artificial. The characters are not believable at all and with this level of fairness, they are not even likeable. The movie does not even come close to genre classics like American Pie or Road Trip.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Thriving in a chaotic world,How do one live in a world full of predetermined perceptions. Where those who are past and present have shaped the world you live in telling you how you should live and Act. In this movie Emma potrays such a world we live in. In her chaotic enviroment she self discovers herself and thrives.The storyline shows this in a funny way making the movie much intresting. It is funny in showing teen culture and conversations. Emma does a great job carrying this movie and what a great storyline from the writers and director. Is a good movie to watch and i give it a ten out of ten.

Easy A ( not the grade A though ),"Emma Stone is a talented actress & does a very good job in the film, however the point of films like this should be to teach a moral lesson or a few of them.When you watch this ask yourself how much of it is unrealistic &/or immoral.Why script writers feel the need to make 2D baddies in these films to justify the hero ( or heroine = female hero ) is beyond me, as if the mean girls are so unfair then that will make the audience let the hero be a bit more bad too right & then that is OK ( as turn about is fair play just so long as the hero does more good than bad right? Well in real life usually things are not so EASY ).Now some will say it's just a movie, it's not suppose to be real ( well though it is true why not make it more real, make it a better film & you still have a very good performance from Emma Stone & probably it would be even better ).The script is still OK overall & apart from some very convenient things that are all about luck ( not doing the right thing because you should do that ) but are what the script writers think will be more entertaining than doing what the character would have done based on what we learn about her upbringing, we end up with a film that teaches it is better to be lucky than it is to be good.There was a lot more real life moral lessons this film could have got over & with them this film could have been a lot more entertaining & as usual in these films some of the single truly nice people are the most attractive people in the school ( isn't it funny how in real life usually that is not the case however this is a film & we should not be realistic or worry too much about morality ).It is a shame as this movie could have been great, however you need a much braver set of writers & director to ensure all characters are 3D ( good + bad ) as the film should be a journey of growth just how real life is about learning.It is good some people watching this film take the good from it however I can only give it 5 out of 10 as just too much lazy writing of the 2D characters as Emma Stones character was 3D but she very much in a 2D universe here.You could say Emma Stone deserves an easy A for her performance but unfortunately the script deserves an Easy E ( as must do better in future ).",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very funny movie,"I love this movie. Watching it right now for probably the 8th time. I think it was very well written and entertaining. The character of ""Olive"" is funny, peppy, and she has a lot of Moxie. I honestly wish I had her confidence. Amanda Bynes looks great in this movie (this was her last movie) Olives teacher has a very annoying voice and that's hard to deal with and Rhiannon is a TERRIBLE friend but other than those small gripes this movie is a fun watch.

terrific!,"This was a hilarious movie. It parallels the classic novel The Scarlet Letter (which is being studied and brought up in the film and during the girl's class) and a teenager's life. Olive-the main character-lies to her friend about a weekend fling with a college guy. Unfortunately, the high school prude (who is a devout Christian) overhears her, and the rumor mills start cranking. Olive starts using this to her advantage to gain popularity with the boys, but things unfortunately get out of hand, and she learns how things can ruin your reputation-the hard way with a boy one night, and she tries to fix it. Fortunately, she has the right friend and family member. I love her podcasts and the scenes with Amanda Bynes. Lisa Kudrow's character was also good.

Pretty people problems,"This ""teen"" romance drama, performed by some 25-35 year old models, was not a great masterpiece. I'm not even gonna call this a comedy, there really wasn't enough comedic elements to justify it.The movie itself is well done, it looks and sounds good. But the story is just beyond stupid and the characters act like complete imbesils. But that's not what this movie is really about now, right? It's all about pretty people that are nice to look at.

Why was Amanda Bynes' character full of face filler and clearly just a copy of Mandy Moore from ""Saved!""? That was actually a better movie, just go watch that.Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clark were the best part of this movie, and even they were over the top and not a thing like anyone's actual parents.

Easy A Not Your Typical Teen Sex Romp,"""I just thought of the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for 'I love.'"" -- Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone)I thought the idea for this movie sounded like one of the most preposterous ideas I've ever read and so almost didn't bother with it at all. After contriving a story that she lost her virginity to a (nonexistent) college boyfriend so she won't seem like a prude, high schooler Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) gets propositioned by a gay classmate to pretend to have sex with him so he can disguise his homosexuality from the hulking football team which has been hazing him. Their ploy is a success, Olive receives other propositions and, before she realizes it, has a reputation that she has neither earned nor deserves. I still think it's a stupid idea, which makes me all the more delighted at the result, which is a far better film than I would have suspected could come from the material.Most of that's due to director Will Gluck's insistence on plausibility. After the initial ""fake orgasm"" while huddled classmates giggle outside a locked door at what they imagine must be happening (but isn't), Gluck spurns any reliance on physical comedy or silly situations. Funny things happen, but those things are all due to character and character development, not slapstick. And Gluck has in his arsenal not just a good cast but a great cast, a far better one than your typical teen sex romp boasts, including Thomas Hayden Church (All About Steve) as Olive's English teacher, currently expounding on Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter; Lisa Kudrow (forever associated with TV's Friends) as a counselor with a secret; Amanda Bynes (Hairspray) as a self-righteous uber-Christian out to save Olive's sinful soul; Cam Gigandet (Twilight) as Bynes' boyfriend who sings hymns with her, but harbors his own secret; and Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island) and Stanley Tucci (Julie & Julia) as Olive's parents. Clarkson and Tucci can virtually do no wrong, and their glib delivery is so good that I'd love to see them together in another film. In fact, if there's any fanciful element in the film, it's that nobody's parents are that cool, but they're so amusing that I can live with it.Too often in these things, secondary characters -- teachers, parents et al. -- are given the most cursory development and become props to facilitate getting us to the next lowbrow farcical scene, and rarely does a teen comedy seriously invite parallels with classwork in American literature. Yet here, with the exception of Malcolm McDowell (The Book of Eli) as a distant school principal, all the characters are justified beyond their strategic roles. They're people; they're not objects. Gluck even resists the temptation to make the indignant Bynes too much of a villain.The real success is Stone's ability to carry the film as its star. She flawlessly understands her character, understands the story, and approaches it with a maturity sometimes lacking in actresses twice her age. I'm not completely comfortable with the film's resolution, which involves an impromptu musical number, but then I seldom am, simply because it's harder to resolve these complex questions than to set them up. Nevertheless, Easy A at least asks the questions, which many films fail to do.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It's a teen movie,It's a dumb teen movie with some good things. Emma Stone is one of them. She does a fantastic job in the movie.

I found that it was shot in an interesting way. There are lots also lots of bad parts. -It was a dumb teen with dumb teen movie clichés -The tone was comedic in some scenes but very serious in the next one -Lisa Kudrow was very annoying,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Important Movie, Dressed in Skanky Clothes","I'm disappointed in the critical nonchalance. This picture deserves enthusiasm.Everyone is talking about Emma Stone's undeniable brilliance, but that isn't the only thing driving this movie toward multiple viewings. First of all, Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson turn in giddy performances (as usual; Tucci is one of our best in Hollywood) that revel in Royal's insistent and repetitive script. They are the source of some of EASY A's funniest moments. Indeed, it is structured so that the first half is a LOLian misadventure and the second is a more solemn exploration of the truth it is trying to expose. The camera work is commendable, with several exciting tracking shots that swerve in and out of slow and fast motion.Contempt for faith is becoming old. Films attempting to convert (or more commonly, dissuade) are insufferable. EASY A uses religion, but avoids that trap. The scene where Olive gives confession and no one is there to listen. The overzealous and hypocritical youngsters. Most of this is a nibble or gnaw on the state-of-affairs while still asserting that having values is possible -- even in a world like this one.And here we arrive at the thesis. Does EASY A have one? The final line, ""It's none of your damn business"" is quite telling. It's some kind of a plea for kids to stop living in other people's worlds. With Facebook, Twitter, and blogs, we all think that our thoughts are Gospel and everyone needs to understand them. Even in movies like AVATAR, they inspire the thought that living in a world other than our own might somehow be better. EASY A urges people to be honest, be personable, and get off the computer sometimes. Is the film cruel? A bit. Is the film unsure of its own point? A bit. Is the film worth understanding for yourself? A bit. It is proof that Hollywood can periodically hit the mark, or get an A, by building a foundation of comedy without resorting to crudeness and leading (potentially impressionable) viewers to a valuable idea. I'm not saying that the film is a piece of art rivaling its great-grandmother, The Scarlet Letter, but it is the best adaption and it does relate the fundamental plea for compassion to a generation that (unfortunately) needs to laugh and see gaping cleavage to understand.EASY A is a successful film. Emma Stone is young and raw, capable of great comedy and asking for the hesitant, sarcastic sympathy my generation responds to. There is a bright, relentless script and a slew of notable supporting performances. It was one of the best surprises in 2010, proof that you can still sprinkle vitamins into cereal like sugar.82.1",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Worth watching,"I think that this movie is pretty much what you'd expect from an average teen comedy film, as the film covers the issues that is known to concern a typical teenager. 80% of it involves the kind of explicit content that most teens get excited about. However, its Emma Stone's performance that made me really enjoy watching this film. Her hilarious expressions, her comedic timing and the way she articulates her lines makes this a worth-2-hours- of-your-life-film. Though I myself am not religious, I think that the way Christ- believers are portrayed in this film is quite distasteful and very unnecessary. By the way, I hope that I am not the only one who thinks that Emma Stone's face literally fits so perfectly for the character she played.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Lesser than the sum of its parts,"It's a great shame that they make such overt references to classic '80s teen rom-coms, such as 'Say Anything', 'Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles' &c., because what it instantly makes obvious is how much better those films are than this poor attempt. Easy A certainly has some moments, but the whole is lesser than the sum of the parts, making it a hard film to recommend.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Imaginary foreplay is the newest rage,"""Easy A"" is about a mixup that spirals out of control in a moderately populated town high school in California that blends literature, religious fanaticism, homages to '80s John Hughes flicks as well as adolescents at their peak with hormones. This is frequently narrated with snappy dialogue that's self-aware of its every move to a fault, as it often arrives at conclusions even before it allows the viewer to. It includes some humorously awkward situations of high school life, as well as pokes fun at other teen flicks even though it ironically embraces some of the same clichés. Minus the honesty and self-degradation and it's still riding as a passenger on the same train.Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) is overheard in the ladies room by the do-gooder Marianne Bryant (Amanda Bynes) when she tells her best friend Rhi (Aly Michalka) that she slept with a fictional guy named George despite still being a virgin to dodge going on another uncomfortable camping trip. Marianne, being the antagonist of the story and the moral crusader she is, sticks her nose high and uses the modern day equivalent of a rumor mill--text messages and social networks--to self-righteously put Olive, who was previously hidden from view, back in her place. Or so she thought. Olive has a hide thicker than a rhino and attempts to use reverse psychology on her hecklers and simultaneously fake it till she makes it about her own dating status. Marianne's lackeys come at her but she's like instant oatmeal with comebacks. After getting in trouble over calling one the ""T"" word, she serves detention with Brandon (Dan Byrd)--a gay kid who's made fun of and gets into fights--and he begs her to pretend to have sex with him so people will lay off his back. They go to a party so the socially elite can be a witness and both put on a noisy stir in the bedroom while none of the drunkards are the wiser.Why this charade wasn't stopped short was because Olive has liberal, adoptive parents who still think they're cool and trust that she'll make the right choices and correct her own mistakes. The overly honest mom played by Patricia Clarkson is hilarious because she says everything the daughter doesn't want to hear and doesn't always come with the best advice. Olive goes about in seductive outfits with an ""A"" stitched on relating to a literature story called ""The Scarlet Letter"" and takes it all in with stride as to whether she's gawked at or dismissed. From what at first started out as having sympathy for Brandon, turns into a gift-card giving business where she pretends to give nooky to unconfident guys who want the status but without actually doing the physical deed. This part of the story doesn't exactly transition due to it never being explained that she's greedy or desperately needs money. Though despite her cunning wit that's twice her age, she still seems a little naive with the trappings of a teen as to what she's doing and without exactly thinking about the afterwards. It has moments of causing the pacing to get lost in the shuffle and her character development to feel up and down: one moment helping those who can't help themselves, to going with the flow and then back again when she volunteers to take the rap for someone other than a student. After a date gone bad and a meet up gone right, she wants people to revert their stances to get her life back in order until she finds out people's true colors.""Easy A"" seems like an abstinence ploy within a ploy, but I digress this isn't out to make a major point about the subject of promiscuity besides to say that you should own up to your own actions and not perpetuate notions if you didn't actually do any action. This is more sarcastic, playful and clever than roll-on-the-floor funny--partly because it seems too well scripted than naturally delivered--but it comes with a relating factor that a chunk of teens go through when it comes time for blossoming sexuality: how to tell what they like, how to go about finding it and most importantly how to do it. Not to mention double standards of girls and boys, and peer pressure to do it and then an opposite pressure not to do it. This has an original take on an age old idea that covers common ground but came with some contrived caricatures such as the I-know-exactly-what-to-say knight in shining armor conveniently showing up at just the right moment despite being peppered throughout and giving a nod to John Cusack. Is that supposed to qualify as a reward? Not to mention what sucked out intrigue was a chunk of the story feels laid out like a spoon fed blueprint with easy little chapters and nearly every nuance told to what's going on even though the story is fairly simple on its own. Fortunately this did right by not having any closing morals pushed on the audience rather than letting them choose themselves where they stand.

"Fitting in is not always an ""Easy A""","A 2010 teen comedy about how little white lies can turn into rumors and rapidly spread briefly changing a young girl named Olive Penderghast 's (Emma Stone) life. Olive lies and says she has a date in order to avoid going on a camping trip with her best friend Rhiuannon Abernathy(Aly Michalka). When both girls return to school on Monday and Rhiuannon ask about the date Olive then tells another lie. The lies keep mounting and Olive begins to lie for others as well. The lies result others popularity improving and yet others getting hurt. When Olive realizes she is in too deep she tries to get those that she lied for to tell the truth and when that does not work she holds a web cast revealing the entire truth to the school population during a pep rally. The movie ""Mean Girls"" is another film that has a similar theme in the sense that teenage high school girls tell lies and spread rumors in order to fit in, gain popularity, or to have others believe they are someone different. When Olive begins embracing the role that she had created, she stitches an ""A"" on her clothes to represent adulterer. This is a motif seen throughout the entire film that can be tied back into the theme by showing how rumors spread through the populous can affect the individual's outlook on their own life. The scenes where Emma Stone's character Olive is continuously listening to ""Pocket full of Sunshine"" on the greeting card helps the viewer gain an understanding of who Olive really is through music. In conclusion, ""Easy A"" affectingly captures and recaps how the teen years are full of the painful anguish that is the balance act between trying to be ourselves and attempting to fit in. Emma Stone plays the role of Olive and portrays her with a spirit full of radiance which is not commonly seen in today's youth. She proceeds to drawl the viewer in even more by truly capturing the spirit of Olive whether she is showing the pain from hurting others or singing in the shower. This movie could be used as an example of what lengths an individual will go to just in order to fit in with everyone else.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Easy A is an effortless F,"I have no idea what this movie is trying to be, but I can tell you what it is. A shameless imitation of nostalgic 80's classics like the breakfast club and Say Anything.The main character, portrayed by Emma stone, is the only one remotely close to acting realistically. The premise of interest in a high school girl's sex life may try to come across as relatable through the eyes of her own experience; however, the suspension of disbelief in the actions and reactions of all supporting characters is great enough to outclass many children's shows based upon pure fiction.The behavior and obsession of the school upon this one girl is straight out of a fanfiction, and anyone who believes otherwise that this movie contains any insight into a real experience of high school or even a subjective exaggeration is fooling themselves.The characters, save a lucky few, are the victims of abhorrent writing, and a completely connived premise.

That is NOT what I got. What I got was 90 minutes of disappointment mixed in with a little bit of confusion. Like I said though, Emma Stone is good, she's just not given much to work with.

"GOOD Movie, Chick Flick","I have been known to like the movies some call ""chick flicks"" but that is not really true. While movies like Serendipity and 10 things I hate about you are two of my favorites I am more of a horror/action-adventure fan. That said, my review of this film is simple: it is one of the best films i have EVER seen. Emma's role - while seemingly an easy one to play, is a very complicated one, and she pulled it off with great ease - The writers gave us a GOOD solid progression of events that were totally believable, All the major roles played their parts perfectly and believably, and the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) humor present throughout this movie kept me watching with great interest waiting for more.Having been a small and insignificant high school entity back in the day, I sorta could relate to how Emma's character started out. If I knew then what I know now, my life in high school would have been a lot more interesting - not as interesting or lucrative as Emma's character was, but fun to say the least. Ending was not a letdown in any way as a lot of these types of movies are, but left me feeling satisfied and it just ""felt right""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
puts a spin on a seemingly overplayed hand,"Olive Penderghast is an erudite seventeen-year-old and things follow the usual rigamarole at her SoCal high school: she's smart and studious, thereby nerdy, anonymous, and virtually invisible to the opposite sex...that is until she spins a tale to her strong-willed best friend that she gave up her ""V card"" to a random college guy. This leads to a trigger effect when her quiet little fib circulates throughout the entire school and then quickly transitions her social standing from nonentity to on the map, but then her situation spirals in ways she could've never fathomed. Because the high school outcast trope has been covered more times than you care to count some familiarity is bound to show, but this really is intelligent and engaging with a hilarious mix of coarse and satiric barbs, colorful, quotable lines--with some welcomed John Hughes and other mainstream movie references thrown in, plus it's effortlessly anchored by Emma Stone's illustrious comic performance. ***",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
