Good Action Flick,"Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.Salt delivers exactly what is promised -- a solid 100 minutes of action. It keeps you watching, it keeps you guessing (even when it turns out you were right in some cases), and it entertains from start to finish. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie.As for the reviewers who criticized the way Russians are portrayed, the action genre plays to comic book-like caricatures. The villains are no more realistic than the heroine! This isn't a documentary!If you like action movies, give Salt a go. Angelina won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining Action Thriller But Die Hard Becomes Die Never; Also the Plot Development Gets a Little Unbelievable,"When Bruce Willis makes crash landings in the original ""Die Hard"" movie, at least he winces in pain and it takes him a few moments to regain composure. In ""Salt"", when Angelina Jolie jumps consecutively onto six moving trucks on the freeway, she's flying right up and instantly running at Olympic record pace, sort of like the original Terminator except sporting lipstick. Throughout the movie, she decks secret service agents faster than they can graduate out of combat training if she's not pushing out of moving vehicles going 70 mph while wearing handcuffs, although the officers forgot to put the cuffs on behind her. They put them on in front of her leaving her with a slight chance to get away. I guess the point of this movie: don't try this at home.The essential plot I think is quite compelling, and I don't want to give too much away but only to say that nothing is at it seems until the very end. But I think I would have liked more of the mystery behind the story than all the long action sequences which I felt undermined a potentially complex idea. These days in filmmaking, it seems that the longer action sequences displace story development. There are flashbacks to a greater story but a lot of it was more confusing than insightful.After a brief prelude in which Jolie is interrogated and tortured by North Korean military agents, the movie begins, presumably about a year later, with a Russian requesting asylum with the United States via the CIA. Agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) interrogates the defector who tells a strange story about how the Russians infiltrate the United States with moles programmed and brainwashed during childhood. Only seconds after the interview is over, the defector is killing CIA agents and escaping the headquarters. And so is Salt. In fact, the agency is more determined to get Salt than the defector, which is one of the many little glaring plot problems that occur during this movie. The non-stop action begins here, fueled by several plots and subplots.I think Salt is a decent film but not a great one. At least what it does successfully is keep you guessing. You're not sure what Salt is doing, where she's going, or even whose side she's on which keeps you at the edge of your seat. By movies end, I still had a lot of unanswered questions that were not explained through the action sequences. I also realized at one point, Jolie doesn't say much after the initial interview until the very end. It's hard not to like Jolie but I think she should have requested a bit of a better script with a little bit less chasing, gunning and blowing things up. Jolie can also act, not just chase.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Entertaining for sure,"Was it realistic? No. Did all the dots get connected? Not all. Was it fun to watch? Yes. Was it predictable? Not entirely. Lots of twists & turns. If you don't mind people sliding down a banister with six-shooters out shooting 5 hit men with Uzi's, then you'll probably like it. (This didn't really happen, and I don't really know guns but you get the message.) I thought I had it all figured out but I was oh so wrong. I would like to see it again, knowing what I know now. There wasn't a lot of cursing and relatively little blood & guts considering this type of movie. I must say, sitting next to some women who liked shouting at the screen and throwing their own punches heightened the excitement for the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jolie proves she can play rough in Kurt Wimmer's Salt,"While I can't say that I was awaiting Angelina Jolie's latest outing with bated breath, I was intrigued by the fact that Salt was originally intended to be a Tom Cruise vehicle.Tom's waning box office pulling-power aside, this sex-swap was a smart move by writer Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) as it gives Jolie the chance to prove that she can lay the smack-down on just as many henchmen as the boys can. Having her rather than him as the duplicitous CIA agent Evelyn Salt, Wimmer gives a fresh angle to a plot that could easily have been a boring instalment of the Bourne series. Salt also sees the welcome return of Russian villains to the cinema after a long period in which Middle Eastern terrorists were severely over-worked.When a Soviet defector strolls into the CIA and announces that Salt is a sleeper agent who will kill the Russian president, she goes on the run. Fearing for the safety of her husband Michael, Salt sets out to find him before agents Winter (Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) catch up with her. The question of where Salt's loyalties lie is the true source of tension and Jolie plays it cool, gaining and dismissing the audience's trust several times over.Schreiber and Ejiofor draw the short straws in terms of dialogue and simply run after Jolie for the entire movie without doing anything of significance. Hopefully, if the proposed sequel goes ahead, Wimmer will be able to correct this glaring oversight.The action scenes are sharply directed and Jolie finally gets her hands dirty, particularly in the opening exchanges where she's being tortured in a Korean prison. If that wasn't enough, she also flies down an elevator shaft by leaping from wall to wall – it was a silly effect but added a cheesy, fanciful element to what would have been an entirely too serious movie.Consequently the first 40 minutes are fast and furious as Salt evades her fellow agents by any means necessary but not to be outdone, the rest of the film takes a left turn and continues to surprise with some serious fisticuffs, gun-play and high-speed car chases. Admittedly, for all its skill and enthusiasm, Salt's finale is a little over-the-top and it wanders into well-worn ground without knowing when to stop. Aside from this minor gripe, Salt is a well-directed action movie that delivers us a potential new franchise, an intriguing lead character and an exciting close to a lacklustre summer.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Popcorn entertainment nothing more nothing less!,While I was expecting a little more sophistication in the plot department I realized that such a thing couldn't happen when US versus Russia is at play. (To my knowledge the Cold War is over and the spy business has become more complicated than ever. This oversimplification of old enemies and their wars is too much.) The plot is all over the place and realism is thrown out of the door. There are too many things happening in the movie that are too convenient and even impossible. Still it didn't keep me from enjoying this movie. It even managed to thrill me at occasions even if I was aware that most of the plot was nonsense. Jolie does an excellent job as the action heroine. The action is that makes this movie tick and that is almost the only thing that should count in a movie like this.Ignore the bashing and trashing of Jolie. This is pure entertainment!,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It is an explosive, briskly-paced spy action foray scorching with an appealing image of Angelina Jolie","When Angelina Jolie makes her appearance on screen, chances are most people are interested in seeing in nothing but her kicking some major ass. And for those who relished in a good time of shoving popcorn in their mouth while watching her go gun-blazing in the action thriller 'Wanted' back in 2008, this one makes a sound, if slightly lesser option. This spy action thriller, helmed from director Phillip Noyce who brought his work to the screen with two Jack Ryan adaptations 'Patriot Games' and 'Clear and Present Danger', is just another one of your average trips to the land of Angelina Jolie wielding her action skills against the baddies as she fights her way through the sporadic blemishes in the script written by Kurt Wimmer. Unlike 'Wanted', this flick proceeds with a slightly more political agenda at hand, primarily the corruption uprooted from Russia since the beginning of their fallout with the United States during the Cold War. This film focuses on Evelyn Salt (played by Angelina Jolie), a CIA operative who is a living a peaceful life with her German boyfriend Michael Krause (played by August Diehl) and being held as one of the most respectable agents at her job. Her life comes crashing down when she is accused by a captured Russian agent Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) of being a Russian sleeper agent with a plan to assassinate the President of the United States. With the law enforcement along with Agent Peabody (played by Chiwetel Eijiofor) pursuing her and her boss Ted Winter (played by Liev Schieber) the only one who fully trusts her, Salt must set out on a mission to clear her name.For a movie set on exhibiting Jolie in her frenetic ass-kicking mode, this one delivers for the most part. Watching the actress step into action with a frenetic gun-blazing, bone-crunching convulsion makes the tasty icing on the cake most action junkies crave for. But those who make the decision of taking the ride seriously fall victim to witnessing the flaws in the film's attempt at establishing a solid political complex. Adding substance to the plot is a political theme involving international corruption and relations between the U.S and Russia which ties knowledge the historical threats of the Soviet Union during the Cold War back in the 50s. It also makes the unfortunate feat of occasionally convoluting the plot, especially when throwing in a few twists and turns that will take audiences by surprise or leave them scratching their heads. Regardless, anyone willing to escape these blemishes are in for a nice treat, and that witnessing Angelina Jolie shoot, punch, and kick were way through the story in a sleek James Bond-style. Tension is kept high and the action falls nothing short of beauty, especially when adding explosions, car crashes, and vehicles slipping to the equation. For what the movie offers, it does enough to meet the appetite of cinema-goers hungry for a blend of sleek action thrills with brainy political subtext to go in the mix.Salt is an entertaining ride, if somewhat forgettable in terms of cinematic action mayhem. For those craving a sweet kick of action, this makes a fresh choice, though it nothing that reaches the peak of its genre. All that can be said is that fun and thrills is the best thing this movie delivers if nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
AS Salted,"Ready set get the popcorn! Non-stop action for those that want to veg out and popcorn up and for those reasons it delivers. Jolie pulls it off although if you take the film too seriously it has many flaws so resist the temptation to do so. I don't mind someone being really good at what they do but impossibly good stretches it too thin. Just keep eating your popcorn as the plot unravels and we like to follow it when it does.

Decent Flick!,"Phillip Noyce's 'Salt' is a decent action-thriller that focuses on Spys. The film has it's share of shortcomings, but manages to sail safely.Angelina Jolie stars as Salt a CIA agent, who is accused of being a double agent. Her journey from there-after, is filled with loads of action, and many twists and turns.'Salt' has a paper-thin plot, but it's list of twists keep the proceedings alive. However, I would like to state, that, the culmination doesn't appeal. The actual twist in the tale doesn't leave any impact whatsoever. Writers Kurt Wimmer and Brian Helgeland could've truly worked for a better culmination.Phillip Noyce's direction is fair, while the stunts are the mainstay of the film. Angelina Jolie is excellent as Salt and goes on to prove her potential once again. Among other performances, Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor leave a lasting impression.On the whole, 'Salt' also offers some spice.

Best not to think about it,"This is a fast paced, interesting movie that has many twists and turns, most of them that you won't see coming. Angelina Jolie has never looked more confident and beautiful, and some of the ideas in the script are almost brilliant.I say almost, because the more you think about this movie after-wards, the more highly improbable, and less intelligent, this movie seems. And, it only seems to get worse as the movie goes on, requiring the characters to do more improbable things as the movie moves towards the end.I'd say that any of the Tom Clancy films, or even the Mission Impossible films, give you a better experience than Salt.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jolie plays Bourne,"I enjoyed this flick - it's a satisfying thriller with nonstop action, and Jolie does it proud. I would like to say that I'm surprised by all the negative reviews, all of which seem to take offense at the various ""illogical"" and ""unrealistic"" aspects of the film. These same folks no doubt LOVE films like Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean, films of the fairy tale genre with license to dismiss realism altogether. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But it is too bad they can't appreciate a fine little thriller like this that just fudges with reality a bit. Almost every James Bond film was at least as silly as this film, but I loved all them too, as did most of the world. Maybe these picky folks are just a bunch of chauvinistic men and jealous women. I say let them eat cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Fast paced with twists and turns, an entertaining watch","What you will leave with is that Angelina Jolie does action really well. And that the blonde look doesn't suit her! A pacey action flick, reminded me of Wanted in several instances with the quick and classy action sequences. Although, in some cases its strange, since you don't really see any characters actually punching or kicking each other, its that quick! As expected there're a lot of twists , after all it does involve the age old US vs Russia storyline, but has a completely fresh take in its sub-plot.Overall, a fun-filled 100 minutes. Not too long so it doesn't drag, and it leaves you wondering what next, although after some thought that question answers itself. Liev Schriber does a nice job, reminiscent of his character in the Omen remake. Go watch this just to see Jolie and those amazing stunts !!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jolie's betrayals,"By its courage on enlightening KGB's anti-globalist vista, I first thought Salt is an adaptation, till I find out the fact that it's written for the screen by Kurt Wimmer, the genius writer of Equilibrium(2002)-which is the best contemporary sci-fi screenplay I've ever heard of-. As a matter of production, if Salt is especially written for Angelina Jolie to play the lead, Phillip Noyce isn't a bad choice at all to direct the movie; but I could still have preferred Kurt Wimmer to direct it, as he did the Equilibrium.Angelina Jolie's first action was Cyborg-2(1993), in which she showed the white feather for a thrill to be created out of a bad Jean-Claude Van Damme sequel; and she was pretty good at that. Consider that I compare her acting from the age of 18 with her capacity in Salt, herein she doesn't act nothing. It is either the director or herself that makes the movie seems like it's been done before with same look of scenes from Tomb Raider or Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible and the likes of them.As a whole, Salt is well worth to see and enjoy with suspense-action-thriller type of storyline. But as the one thing in common with all the suspense stories, there is a breach in the story development. It gets complicated and confusing at times forcing us to figure out if Jolie is working for CIA or KGB. The fact is that Jolie betrays every person she meets. She betrays CIA first, then when we start guessing she's a Russian militant but then she assassinated the Russian president. The problem is that what everyone calls them plot holes, there are no plausible reasons for why Jolie betrays everybody. Maybe in real life Brad Pitt asked this question to himself too.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salty Spy,"Not sure why this film is not as well received as it should be. It is about an American CIA or FBI agent who is compromised in order to set off a series of events leading to global chaos. This film has a lot of moving parts but is handled well and it is very entertaining. The action is well choreographed and shot without annoying shaky cam. Plus it is non- stop. This film didn't do well enough to merit a sequel, which is a shame because this is an outstanding example of a kickbutt film with a strong female lead. I guess that sort of thing wasn't trending hard enough back then. Sad how Hollywood is using important issues as a mean to market films nowadays. But what is sadder is how people buy into it.

good action movie,"Although action movies are not my favourite ones, the fact I liked ""Salt"", suggests to me it is a good movie, at least entertaining, thrilling, and being able to keep me watching, almost holding my breath, till the end. It's a movie full of energy, running, chase sequences: the heroine, Angelina Jolie, is really a portent of physical endurance, pure energy beyond all human credibility, she overcomes any obstacle, and makes you feel that energy and strength.The plot is obviously full of holes, almost absurd, but I guess plot is not so much important in this genre, being it is just a pretext in the service of action. Obviously everything sounds unreal, disregarding the most elementary laws of physics, but still action, and dynamism are what keep you attached to the screen till the very end. A good picture, certainly a tribute to the still flourishing beauty of Angelina Jolie, whose physical impact makes a difference and makes her role intense and effective, besides every excess and lack of realism.

"Salt is one ""peppery"" heroine","The people who wrote this film apparently don't think the audience is very smart. They want us to believe that Angelina Jolie who is about five foot four in her bare feet and 100 pounds wringing wet is capable of beating up and shooting about sixty people, crawling around a ten story building on a narrow ledge, jumping from tractor trailer to tractor trailer and climbing down a ten story elevator shaft! Boy she is one tough, ass kicking mama! Some people have said this movie is merely a clone of the Jason Bourne movies (one reviewer waggishly called Salt Jason Bourne with a vagina). However, Jolie makes her role distinctly unique. She holds this movie together with cool intensity that would rival any actor. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow but there is enough action for five movies, so just sit back and enjoy the ride. By the way, for you history lovers, there really was a theory that Lee Harvey Oswald had a Soviet lookalike who was the real killer of JFK and there really is an underground bunker below the White House.",,Anonymous,Mystery

I have seen this film many times on multiple occasions and it never seems to disappoint.,"PROS: This movie really is captivating to say the least. You're always on the edge of your seat, whether you are intrigued with the characters, or the action scenes. There is a little bit for everybody. The build up in the movie was great as well, from begging to end this movie never lets go of that tension it has built up. What also really helped this movie was the lack of plot holes. With a blockbuster hit like SALT, the director normally has no problems leaving big plot holes in the script, but this film doesn't do that. This movie was thought out immaculately. Last but not least, lets also give a shout out to Angelina Jolie (SALT) for giving her best performance in years. Any movie critic can give her credit for her Oscar winning performance.CONS: There are very little cons to this movie. The only thing that could have been more realized is the resolution.

RUN do not WALK to the nearest showing of Salt,"Do not walk, or worse, stop to read reviews, but run instead to the nearest movie theater and watch Salt.I say don't read the reviews because a lot of what the movie critics say may deter you from seeing what is truly not only an exciting summer movie but a movie which is sure to pave the way for other female actresses to play similar lead action hero roles in the future.The critics may be right in saying that the plot (like a thousand other action movies before it) has plenty of holes and is filled with one unrealistic chase scene after another. And, they may raise a valid point that a movie about post-cold war Russian villains may be decades too stale.But, what these critics fail to do is give credit where credit is due. And that is: Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar-worthy portrayal of CIA Agent, Salt, who may or may not be a Russian spy. You never really know until the end as Jolie keeps you guessing with every twist, turn, kick, shot, explosion, jump, chase, injury, and ass whooping, regardless of whether she is the one giving or receiving the whooping.Yep, I used the ""O"" word. I don't particularly care much for Ms. Jolie generally speaking which makes me even more certain that she deserves the award. I loved Salt because Jolie made me believe that a 110 pound woman can whip the crap out of 100 men, each two to three times her weight. Actually, she did better than that. She made me forget she is female. I just saw Jolie as a tough-as-nails ass-kicker.Jolie as Salt had me on the edge-of-my seat nervous. She sent my heart racing the entire time. She made me laugh; she made me cheer; she made me angry. She had me confused as hell as to who she really is. But, best of all, by the end of the movie, she made me find myself holding in my breath for a few seconds and crying a bit because I realized what Jolie has really accomplished by this role.Jolie has undeniably pulled off a first in history: She more than capably held her own as an action hero lead, a character which was originally written with a man in mind (Tom Cruise). I dare to even say that Salt with Jolie as the lead may fare better at the Box Office than Salt with Cruise would have fared. Why? Without Jolie, Salt would be just another ordinary action-packed movie. Fun, but ordinary. But Jolie adds a few extra layers to the character which Tom may or may not have been able to deliver as well.At pertinent times, Jolie certainly possesses the requisite coldness and bravado that Tom would have brought to the character. But, when necessary, Jolie also infuses heart, a sense of alluring mystery, charming vulnerability, and woman-scorned vengeance into Salt which makes us fall helplessly in love with that character yet tremendously fear her at the same time. I am not sure Tom or most men could pull that alluring mystery and vulnerability off as well. And what do they say? ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" Jolie surely proves that theory correct with her portrayal of Agent Salt.Call me sexist. Maybe I am. But I loved this movie mostly because a woman was the lead; and because a woman filled the theater to full capacity and had the audience cheering at times and gasping for air at others just like or possibly even better than the Tom Cuises, Matt Damons and Brad Pitts of the world have in the past. Jolie made me a believer. And I know she will make a believer out of movie executives when Salt brings in the ticket sales. And all future female action leads owe Jolie a big thank you for being such a mysterious, vulnerable, charming, money-making, ass-kicking machine.

Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who Is Salt?"" (Columbia Pictures)SALT is preposterous, absurd, and unbelievable. The filmmakers know this very well. Yet, it's an extremely well made action flick. Unlike INCEPTION, SALT never tries to be groundbreaking cinema. It's never too ambition and wrapped in its own world. It never tries to be anything more than what it really is: A highly enjoyable action film. AKA: The perfect summer movie. Because of this, SALT succeeds in almost every level.Star Angelina Jolie actually brings the film on another level. She's just very impressive in her role, bringing an emotional depth for her character and doing the terrific stunt works throughout the film. She does it all here, leaping from the tops of vehicles driving at high speed on the highway, making an exploding device with a fire extinguisher and some household chemicals, and running with no shoes on from one place to another, just to name a few. She's clearly THE female action hero. Liev Schreiber doesn't seem to have much to do but he's as good as always. I also liked seeing Chiwetel Ejiofor in more films because he's a unique actor.The film is also filled with many chase scenes that are done really well that is sure to pump up your adrenaline. The action sequences are surprisingly inventive and ingenious as well, the soundtrack by the brilliant James Newton Howard accompanying it with skill and playfulness. Let's not forget the light use of CGI and camera shakiness, making the experience a whole lot better than it already is.Overall, SALT shows us that Angelina Jolie is still the great action star that she always was and that action flicks can still be well made. While it won't change the world, it's a very entertaining summer action film that is sure to result in the same reaction the condiment of the very same name produced.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Looking forward to the sequel,"In thinking about this movie afterward I was left with the impression that this movie could arguably be labeled ""a female version"" of the Bourne Identity. I would disagree slightly with this characterization however in that there are some worthwhile distinctions.This film is at least slightly (if not more so) darker than Bourne in my opinion, and to me that makes this film touch home more.Jolie also does a very admirable job with her non verbal expressiveness. Because of this and because of the fact that the writing gives us good insight into her back story, I found myself more enmeshed with this character than with Bourne (don't get me wrong – Damon did a great job – it is just that I liked the overall ""taste"" of Salt more).Even though the action sequences are extreme, they were surprisingly not over the top for me. The movie flowed well and ended in a satisfying manner.

The action was also surprisingly good. The moves easy to follow and made sense. A lot of movies nowadays use shaky cam, also well as excessive editing and angles to the point you can't even tell what's going on. It's actually quite annoying and can sometimes turn me off to an entire movie because of it. The action in this movie was the opposite. The end didn't really make sense at first, but the more I thought about it, there is a counter argument. Not enough to outweigh it. Basically the end didn't make much sense, but I can see what they were doing, I mean its pretty obvious. Anyways, good movie throughout, but they could have worked the ending better.In conclusion, its a smart, deep, broad, and exciting movie. I'm glad I got passed the rating on IMDb and gave it a try.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Popcorn Movie!,"Salt is a very good action movie and the plot actually scared me somewhat. It occurred to me that this is a possibility that any country could do to America in the future. But this movie also proves why Angelina Jolie is the best female action star in the movie business. She's hot and she knows how to kick serious butt.This movie is about a CIA operative who is named as a Russian spy by a captured Russian guy. Now she's on the run avoiding the authorities as she attempts to clear her name.I said before that Angelina Jolie kicks butt and I wanted to say that again. I been a fan of hers since the first Tomb Raider. Liev Schreiber did a pretty good job as well.This movie is just one of those action movies with a great plot twist. It won't win any Oscars and it's not the best movie of they year. This is just for pure entertainment.Overall, this is a solid action movie. I hope to see Jolie back in action soon. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Peep This Reviews,"It's easy to say this is a female ""James Bond or ""Jason Bourne"" but it far excels such a description. In fact it's got better action than some of those movies. The action is very stylized and a bit over the top at times but it's consistently engaging. Forget Tombraider this is Angelina Jolie as the ultimate female action lead. Very well directed and features an exceptional cast who play everything very seriously even when it feels a bit silly, this is a big plus.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent fun,"People who don't like films like Salt are the type you wouldn't want at parties. No fun, and anything that is fun is frowned upon. This film has great over the top action scenes, an entertaining plot with some unexpected twists and a good looking star. There are some of us old enough who remember when action films used to be all of the above and were proud of it. There's nothing in this film I can really complain about. Some of the stunts were wild and the situations she overcome near impossible but so were Rambos and that is now a classic. For heavens sake people. Have some fun and enjoy this one.

"Very Predictable,","Salt is a good movie with a very enjoyable,albeit very predictable storyline,and a pretty impressive performance from Angelina Jolie.It didn't surprise or shock me once,I found everything was going to happen extremely predictable,but I did enjoy the great action sequences in this movie and Angelina Jolie suited Evelyn Salt perfectly.I heard rumors about a sequel and if one was made I would go see it because the ending made a continuation very seem very promising.The movie is a fun ride and I would recommend it to action movie fans,but don't be expecting a very good movie,just some good action.Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie),a CIA agent,has to flee when a Russian defector claims she's a sleeper agent about to commit an act of terrorism.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Philip Noyce creates an interesting plot, with a certain amount of suspense, and above all, very entertaining","Angelina Jolie has always been notoriously known for her talent, beauty and versatility. Nominated twice for the International Emmy and consecrated as the winner of the Golden Globe for George Wallace (1997 ) , Gia (1998 ) and Girl, Interrupted (1999) , and the Oscar for Girl, Interrupted (1999) and shown again 9 years later Changeling (2008), Jolie is also notable in action movies becoming one of the biggest muses like that. It fell to her to embody the archaeologist heroine Lara Croft in two adaptations of the game for the big screen and star in Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 ) where she starred opposite her future husband Brad Pitt . Back to cinemas after 2 years since starred in Wanted (2008), Jolie repeats partnership with the Australian Phillip Noyce , where they worked on adapting the book by Jeffery Deaver, The Bone Collector (1999). Some officers came to be involved in the development of Salt , among them Terry George and Peter Berg until they arrived in choosing Phillip Noyce, who was attracted to Salt for its themes of espionage , which are present in most of his films.Salt was produced by Sunil Perkash and Lorenzo di Bonaventura (Transformers trilogy) and scripted by Kurt Wimmer - the same Thomas Crown (1999) Equilibrium (2002) and Law Abiding Citizen (2009) - which was originally intended for a male protagonist, Tom Cruise , originally cast in the role. With the entry of Jolie on the project, the script was rewritten and ultimately adapted by Brian Helgeland. Filming took place in Washington, D. C. , in areas of New York and Albany , between March and June 2009, with reshoots in January 2010.Experienced in action movies like the films adapted from the novels of Tom Clancy, perpetrated by the character Jack Ryan, played by Harrison Ford in the movie Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994), Noyce returns to the genre bringing an exciting thriller action in which Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie ) swore to serve and honor their country . Now working as a CIA agent , she is put to the test to be accused by a Russian defector of being a Russian spy infiltrated . Determined to prove his innocence, she escapes and goes on to use their skills to protect not only your life but also that of her husband Mike Krause (August Diehl).The story begins two years before the present day in North Korea as CIA agent Evelyn Salt being tortured by Korean soldiers . Due to the intervention of her boyfriend in arachnids German specialist Mike Krause, Evelyn is traded for another hostage and back to the United States . Already today, Evelyn follows his normal life with her husband and now working in the offices of the CIA . When a Russian prisoner accuses Salt of being a Russian spy who put a plan into action to kill the Russian president who is in the United States for the funeral of the American vice president called on Day X (first of the actions that would initiate a series of Russian attacks on American soil), Salt needs to escape to prove his innocence.After the escape of Salt offices of the CIA, begins a series of action sequences and breathtaking action is uninterrupted . The main scenes are the Trail Salt not only inside the building of the CIA , as well as the streets and roads of the vicinity of the location, the sequence of the funeral of the American vice president culminating in the attack on the Russian President, the scene Salt trail cars CIA during the escort, the scenes of the kind of ""shed"" where all Russian allies receive Salt and sequence occurred within the site , all disguised invasion of the White House to kill the president.One of the main points that seem to attract the viewer's attention is that the action scenes - full of acrobatics and unbelievable and implausible exploits in most cases - are not played on the screen randomly. One scene leads to another in a coherent way and are very well concatenated. The script also has interesting face of course, and even though several similar stories of espionage , as the plot progresses, the more it shows not as predictable as can be imagined at the outset . The weaknesses that take a bit of strength and realism of the film are some holes in the story, as well as scenes of impossible action. Even Salt being one agent with extensive physical, psychological preparation, it is difficult to see someone with ability to jump on trucks at high speed escape from impossible situations , like cars playing bridge or disarm your opponents equally prepared and highly trained without killing anyone . Despite suffering some injuries, such leave falls and hits a normal person several weeks under medical care .The progression of events is also happy to play all the time with the dubious identity of Evelyn Salt. Reviving elements of the Cold War, the viewer will get a big doubt if there is a traitor in the CIA and there is a constant uncertainty of the direction the plot will follow . By the time of the interrogation of captured Russian CIA , truly think Salt is a CIA agent dedicated capable of being captured and imprisoned two years without revealing details of the operation to the North Koreans . Few later when she tries to escape, were already wondering why she be trying to leave the site if she has nothing to fear. With the change in the look, especially in hair color , it's as if new Salt identity came to the fore and we believe that after the events that occurred during the mass death of the Vice President and the attack on the Russian President she was on the Russian side, which is confirmed in the following scenes when the agent meets Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski). Only in the final climax, after entering the White House, is that we discover some secrets and details that will tell us, in fact , who was Salt. Only then is that we answer the question posed in the release of the movie poster: ""Who is Salt""The script, criticized by some for saying be very confusing , is one of the virtues of the film , helped in the editing process by double Stuart Baird and John Gilroy . We note passages of time between actions and especially the technique of flashback that this case does not serve to interrupt the action abruptly, checking more pace to the plot . With small insertions of scenes from the past know the important facts are revealed gradually, that help us better understand Salt, where it came from , why their actions and their relations with some characters . Some facts are shown: the first encounters her with Mike in the park where they met and later times of the day they were married; flashbacks of training with fellow Russians , the moment immediately after the car accident with parents of Salt in 1988 when she was visited by the American Consulate and brought to the United States, the torture suffered in North Korea and the subsequent exchange made between the U. S. government and among North Korean hostages after 2 years she was a prisoner on foreign soil ( this already extended flashback) .The director of photography Robert Elswit always uses a cooler that keeps the texture and mood of suspense in crucial scenes. The soundtrack of the Oscar nominated 8 times , James Newton Howard, is another highlight. If the action does not stop, the trail idem . Always pushing the pulsating action, arrived out of breath during the persecutions . Have the direction of Phillip Noyce has the merit of achieving maintain tension all the time, knowing very well dispense action and suspense, and it uses all the techniques of the genre as much handheld camera that keeps pulsating action without taking the understanding of the scene from the eyes of those who watch, and great aerial shots that show the grandeur of the environments where the action is. The director can competently create an interesting plot, full of memorable scenes (even if they were mostly virtually impossible to be performed), with a certain amount of suspense , and above all, very entertaining . By putting a woman to star in the action and putting in the same level of Ethan Hunt, Jason Bourne and James Bond , he managed to differentiate from others and give a prominent place in the genre dominated by men as protagonists almost completely. It is also true that Noyce could not have chosen a better actress. Jolie is fearless and does almost all his own stunts , not to mention their undeniable beauty and sensuality. Whether blonde or brunette, it is impossible not to get Jolie irresistible. A must for anyone looking for fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angelina Jolie Proves Why She's the World's Biggest Action Star,"SALT was a complete adrenaline rush. It's not Bourne but it's not quite Bond- it's got elements of both. Somewhere in between, like Bourne on speed. I don't want to give anything away, but no, the plot is not as complex as Inception. However there are enough twists and turns to keep you satisfied. The story is intriguing and will keep your interest but first and foremost this is an action film. And the action is top notch. There's a lot of new sequences that we haven't seen before in film. No, the movie is not overly realistic but it's not trying to be.But let's be honest, this is the Angelina Jolie show. Her presence just makes the movie and she is perfect as Evelyn Salt- who is a complete badass. After audiences see SALT there will be no denying that Angelina Jolie is ultimate female action star. Evelyn Salt gets really ruthless as the movie goes on. Look for some cool action sequences, and especially be on the lookout for what she does with a pair of cuffs.Overall if you're looking for a good time at the movies and nothing too serious, check out Salt. It's not perfect, but I loved it.A-",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Aging supermodel wins MMA title,I would have given it a 6.5 if there was a way to do it but I rounded up. The action scenes were definitely the weak point because it isn't a cartoon like Lara Croft. Angelina is simply too frail and unathletic to be Ms Jason Bourne. It was like watching adult males being tossed around by a 12 year old and she did it for the entire movie. They could have written around the physical scenes better. Aside from that it was a nice bit of cold war suspense and the strong cast did the best that they could. It wasn't utterly predictable and it is not a copy of the Bourne Identity. The role was written for a male lead but they did a nice job in adapting it for a female. I hope it does well enough in the box office to support a sequel because it was a decent popcorn movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overpoweringly Ridiculous...Simply Dreadful Cinema,"If you willingly go to see this, you are asking--nay, insisting--that your intelligence be insulted. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to this film aside from its making itself available for mockery with its heavy-handed, unrelenting cheesiness and awful, awful dialogue.

Just imagine ""Tomb Raider,"" except with anachronism-addicted Soviets running around and a 90 pound woman knocking out men the size of Sonny Liston with one limp-wristed blow.And the plot holes!

"A real ""page turner""","I won tickets to a sneak peek of this movie the day before it officially released and took my husband. We had no real idea of anything about it beyond it was a spy movie with Angelina Jolie. We figured we'd at least get eye candy out of it. What we got was an incredible ride (and my husband pointed out Jolie was not really eye candy in this movie). My husband called it best, I think, with the phrase, ""Hollywood's version of a page turner"" and he also said it restored his faith in Hollywood after ""The Last Airbender"".

Angelica's star vehicle,"Angelina proves once again she can kick ass and looking great doing it. The plot kicks off almost immediately and leaves little to the imagination, save for the word of a Russian outcast and the subsequent knee-jerk reaction from Salt and the US government.After that, we're led on some really defy-defying chases through highways and rooftops. Jolie's character is so complex it does truly live up to the tagline floating around for months. The twists and re-twists are interesting to say the least, along there is sometimes a case of one too many, but the cast makes it work. The two supporting members, Ejofor and Schreiber, are very good at playing the eccentric and the straight and narrow, respectively. The direction is fine, as it moves at a brisk pace while sprinkling more facts and secrets while unraveling Salt's past. Overall, this is a good vehicle for Jolie and she makes the most of it.BTW, what's up with giving the (mostly good) Andre Braugher like 2 lines? He must've really need a paycheck.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Salt,"It's Infernal Affairs at a national level, where instead of cops and robbers playing spy versus spy through the planting of moles in each other's operations, this one ups the ante with countries planting sleeper cells of spies in others, waiting for opportunities to strike when given the cue. It's something like The Manchurian Candidate (which starred Liev Schreiber too) as well, although here the operatives are fully aware of what they're in for. And it's not as far- fetched a plot as one would think, because as what had surfaced quite recently, there were after all, Russian spies who eat, breathe and live American in a typical neighbourhood, not drawing attention to themselves, and able to assimilate into society effortlessly.The million dollar question here is really whether Angelina Jolie's Salt, is a hero, anti-hero or plain villain, in this action-espionage tale directed by Philip Noyce who at one time helmed some of the Jack Ryan movies starring Harrison Ford, so political intrigue, and spy stories are right up his alley. Also, writer Kurt Wimmer had given us stories such as Law Abiding Citizen, The Recruit, adapted Street Kings, and written-directed Equilibrium and Ultraviolet, so we'd know what we're in for with his better films balancing action and drama, while duds like Ultraviolet had its action sequences to thank to get us through a boring plot.But thank goodness it is precisely that keeping us guessing, coupled with some nicely designed action sequences that made this film palatable. Tom Cruise was once attached to the project before he ran away, because well, this film featured a lot of running, which Tom has done to death so many times in his films. In comes Angelina Jolie and the story rewritten to accommodate a sex change, and yes, Jolie excels in her alpha-female, no-nonsense kick- butt role as a woman hunted by her colleagues when fingered by a Russian defector to be a Russian spy. And really with her being the marquee name, Salt relies very much on her charisma and indestructible best to engage the audience in her adventures involving assassination and new world order type of subplots.Which will leave you guessing just where her allegiance is drawn, since we see her working undercover for the CIA as a field operative together with Schreiber's Ted Winter, and whom Chiwetel Ejiofor's Peabody of their counter-terrorism unit wants to reign in for questioning after that iota of suspicion was raised. That forms the crux of the film stringing together action sequence after action sequence, some just the plain ol fisticuffs, while others are quite unique such as the driving of a car via Tazer. Yes, you read that right. And one of my favourite scenes involved Salt at her acrobatic best at finishing off a rival at the finale, which is effective, but highly brutal.The flashback that tells of the origins and motivation of these spies was quite intriguing, and makes you wonder if there's some truth to it, since one really needs to churn out assembly lines of operatives with rock solid allegiance so as to survive living in a new environment. Not all will make it, especially with being constantly bombarded on a daily basis by all things alien, and running the risk of Love coming into the picture, which the film suggests is a powerful emotion able to tame the wildest of hearts. And if you don't buy this concept at all, then you'll probably don't buy into this film.I suppose if the film does well, there may be sequels or even a spin off television series since Noyce and Wimmer left things open-ended deliberately for room to develop Salt's world further.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Russians are Coming!,"Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Cold War! OK, the Alamo has nothing to do with this, but if you can remember Russia as a superpower and the bad guy whom the U.S. spent years and billions trying to out-spy and out-defend, then this story might makes some sense to you. Of course, the story matters little here. What matters is the action and it is actually pretty intense and well done.Angelina Jolie has always reminded me of the scene in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" when Strother Martin is testing out Sundance's shooting skills. When Sundance misses the first target, he asks ""Can I move?"". He then proves he is much better when he moves. Angelina is the same. In her films that let her ""move"", she is amazing. Think ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" vs. ""Changeling"". The first she seems a natural. The second she came across as miscast. In this film, she does things no human being could do, but does these things with such commitment, that we actually believe she is capable. Her actions often border on parkour ... especially when in an elevator shaft or a freeway, and we accept these stunts because it's Angelina.Support work is provided by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, both who spend much of the movie trying to figure out how Angelina does the things she does ... surrounded by their teams of weapons experts. Most of the time, the way she is outnumbered leaves you thinking that if she gets out of this jam, this movie is just stupid. But once she has escaped, you just feel a little more pumped up! That's a sign of a good action movie.Sure, the story is ridiculous at most points and the plot holes are more canyons than holes, but it's kind of nice to re-visit the double or triple spy days, especially when it's placed within daring stunts and chases that work.The director of this is Phillip Noyce, who is best known for a couple of the Tom Clancy adaptations - ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"". Mr. Noyce got me hooked 20 years ago on a little film called ""Dead Calm"", starring a very young Nicole Kidman. That is a taut little thriller that takes place mostly on a sail boat in the middle of the ocean. If you've never seen it, you should.So in regards to ""Salt"", I will say that it's a fun action-thriller in a twisty little cold war spy setting. Don't get caught up in the plot details and just enjoy the action sequences by Angelina Jolie. Not very often I recommend ignoring a faulty script, but I actually enjoyed this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good action spoiled by stupid plot,"Hollywood's idea of Americans and other nations (rest of the world, miscellaneous, whatever...) has always been insulting. Bad Russians trying to blow up the world against patriots etc. Here it is no different although there are insanely a lot of (predictable) twists which try to dilute the idea a bit. Normally I would not mind as long as it is entertaining. However Angelina Jolie was trying really hard and very much invested in this movie that I felt sorry for her. All that stunts and tough acting for this absurd story? This movie could have been great if only the writers of the script were not lazy. Shame.

Just sit back and enjoy the ridiculous ride and give your cynical brain a rest.

Jolie Holds the Silliness Together,"Salt (2010)*** (out of 4)CIA Agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is accused of being a spy for Russia with plans on killing the Russian president to set off a world war. Salt eventually breaks free and tries to prove her innocence while at the same time stopping the real bad guys. In my opinion SALT goes down as one of the dumbest action movies in the history of cinema. The screenplay has so many plot holes that you could fly a plane the size of Russia through it. There are action scenes that are so fake and impossible that you can't help roll your eyes. The idea of Salt being able to get into the White House and down into the emergency area where a nuclear attack is about to begin is just crazy. Every single inch of this movie has cheese all over it but at the same time the thing is simply entertaining. It's hard to believe that someone would attempt to do a film like this because of how crazy it is. At times I had to remind myself that I wasn't watching some sort of spoof as I was waiting for Jolie to utter ""Salt. Evelyn Salt."" This movie has so many crazy scenes yet director Noyce holds all of them together with some nice style and of course we get a strong performance by Jolie who sells every bit of craziness. One of the biggest action sequences in the film has Salt running away from dozens of cops and eventually jumping off a bridge and onto a moving semi. She then jumps from semi A to semi B where she eventually jumps on a few more things only to take off once again. This entire sequence perfectly sums up the film because the action is nice but at the same time it's so crazy and over the top that you can't help but wonder if anyone was really expecting you to take it serious. The entire story is just downright crazy as this attempt to take over the world and star a war is something that ""C"" movies from the 50s would be laughing at. If it sounds like I'm being overly hard on the film I'm really not meaning to. The craziness here isn't a bad thing because it's part of the reason SALT is so entertaining. Jolie has no problem fitting the role with that laid back humor and toughness. She even gets to do some dramatic acting in the final few minutes, which I won't ruin. The supporting cast includes nice work by Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. If you're unable to turn your brain off for 100-minutes then I'd recommend you stay away from this film because it's ""plot"" will probably be too much for you to overlook. If you can sit back and enjoy a lot of craziness and action then SALT is just the film for you.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Just a little bit better than okay,"I love Angelina Jolie as a 'kick-ass' female superhero. She usually fits the bill just great i.e. Tomb Raider and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but there was something missing in her performance in this film. Maybe it was too serious. Instead of her normal tongue and cheek were just got more and more close ups of her big, bigger lips. She has no good dialog after the opening interrogation scenes and I agree with some of the others who say she look extremely thin, almost anorexic. The supporting cast is okay mostly just giving out one liners between the action sequences. I wish they had copied the Bourne movies a little more and gave Salt more character, though the many flashbacks help some, we only learn her motivation at the very end. That makes for a long, even though it's short- 100 minutes, less than satisfying movie experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jason Bourne Turns Into a Russian Female,"This is what ""Salt"" is all about really. It is essentially Jason Bourne who was transformed into a Russian female. The same super-human double-agent story! The same relentless slam-bang action scenes! The same set-up for a sequel or two!Although the death-defying action scenes in ""Salt"" comes across as more difficult to swallow, somehow Angelina Jolie makes it all so believable despite her lean frame. It is really to Ms. Jolie's credit that she is the only credible female action star nowadays. It picks up where she left off in the Lara Croft films, ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and more recently, ""Wanted."" She is tough and kick-ass, yet maintaining her cool, collected and sexy aura about her.The intricate plot which is woven around Evelyn Salt, her shadowy origins and her present predicament as she was accused of plotting to kill the Russian president. Like the Bourne films, it is one big chase scene after the other, and many people being killed like flies, while our heroine comes out generally unscathed. Don't think too much and over-analyze the preposterous storyline. Just take it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Incredible yes, but it was very entertaining for me.Good thing, Tom Cruise did not push through with this project, so they turned the lead character into a female and got Angelina Jolie to play her.

It's nothing outstanding, but it managed to get the job done for me during the 100 minutes or so. Salt has some pretty good suspense and some great action scenes as well. Angelina Jolie has proved she can be a formidable action hero when called upon. She did it in Tomb Raider, Wanted, and now Salt. I do have a qualm. It did start off a tad too slow for my liking, which made me think I was in for a mundane experience. Thankfully, the pace picked up quite a bit, and I was able to enjoy myself. Liev Schreiber is always a good addition to any film he's in, and I enjoyed him here. Salt also has great support with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, and more.Final Thoughts: Adrenaline junkies like myself will probably find much to enjoy about this one like I did.

Popcorn flick? Smells more like rotting eggplant,"Even an intentionally brainless film like this needs more than Angelina Jolie just running around shooting up stuff to be entertaining.Jolie phones it in. From a cell phone that dropped the signal. She is really awful in this, and it's obvious she couldn't care less. As usual, she wears clichéd black outfits. Her vampy Xena wannabe expression while she blasts people gets old way too fast; even she appears bored with the dull routine. The rest of the cast are not much better; calling them paper cut-outs is an insult to paper cut-outs.The plot is absolutely preposterous, and it only gets more absurd as it goes along. Jolie is a spy who gets framed for cold-war double agent shenanigans. Lots of bumbling clowns chase her and shoot. Committing the offense of making this film is far worse than espionage, and that's what they should have shot her for; but it's all academic anyway since they couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from three feet away.Don't expect your money's worth of entertainment value from this, except maybe from laughing at it.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that plays hard to get but delivers,"Angelina Jolie is the true icon of what you would call a female that can fill in the shoes for any masculine role. And what kind of audience wouldn't want that? She's a role model for women because of her talent of displaying power in the feminine lead, and for the guys, she makes them drool because of her ability to be sexy while being powerful at the same time. A benefit for both ends of the stick and there is no doubt that Jolie will not give such a performance for a film with a premise like this.The title is based on the main character, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), a CIA agent who is revealed to be a Russian spy sent on a mission with several other Russian spies to overthrow the United States of America. Once Salt realizes this, she flees from the government to try and discover why she is being sought after. Unfortunately (for her character), this leads to many twists and turns along the way. As for audiences' go this is probably the most troublesome part of the film.Kurt Wimmer, an individual who isn't a novice to the film industry, but doesn't seem to have a true understanding of what audiences want or expect to see in their films, wrote the screenplay. The way the story is written is so up and down on who's on what side, can become really tiresome. It does allow the movie to create a sense of paranoia about who is really who, but it is not given in a fashion that makes it any more clear for the audience either. In fact, depending on how avid a film-goer you are, this movie may take more than one viewing to truly understand what went down in the whole film. It really can be frustrating at times to keep up with what viewpoint the main characters' have and what side they support.Along with this, is the system of child hypnosis that a Russian antagonist puts on these ""creations"" of his. It is a really convoluted plot and sometimes it sounds just plain ridiculous. Also, anti-heroes are cool and have neat traits but for me, I just couldn't get over the fact of how Salt's character is always on the run. Yes she did fight (which I'll get to in a second) but a lot of the time she was fleeing from the authorities because she had NO ONE else to go to. Those kinds of plot lines annoy me because it feels like there's no hope for the character.As for acting goes, the actors all portray their characters well and understandably. None seem out of place or overacted. Jolie's abilities to perform action are still there as well. She still has the muscle to throw herself and others around while looking attractive at the same time. She's always good at doing that. I also liked the transition that Jolie's character made from the beginning to the end of the film with the color of her hair. Light to dark always shows a change in character tone and it's shown very accurately.As for James Newton Howard's musical score, I wasn't quite sure if he forgot how to portray emotion. His score definitely knows how to build tension with the blaring horns. But the emotional side of his music seems to be lacking. There are some vocals that reminisce of the Russian culture (which usually sounds tragic) but it doesn't occur frequently. Perhaps Howard missed these points in the film.With Angelina Jolie back in her action boots, there's bound to be plenty of fun. However, the story is a little over the top and James Newton Howard's score is a little dry.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Messy plot but moves slickly enough to stop you worrying too much till after you have watched it,"Evelyn Salt is an agent for the US government – highly trained and highly effective. However, when a Russian defector brings news of children raised in Russia as Americans and placed into the US as sleeper agents in all manner of powerful positions, Salt is one of those named. Knowing she is innocent, Salt's first thought is to ensure her husband is safe and, unable to do so from the custody of her employers, flees – essentially admitting her guilt in the eyes of Agent Peabody, even if her boss Ted Winter is adamant of her innocence.The plot of Salt appears to be the standard stuff of a highly trained special agent out on their own trying to clear their name while being hunted by their own people. To its credit it is a bit more twisty and turny than that and it does make it more engaging that if it had just been played straight out. This is not the same as me saying it all works though, because to be honest if you sit down and look at it in the cold light of day there is a lot in the plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In particular there are narrative-conveniences that are done for the sake of it even if they are incredibly unlikely. The thing is though, the film carries them and, while you may easily pick holes in it, the chances are that the majority of viewers will be doing this after the film rather than during it.It is not just the specific action sequences that do it but rather the overall tone and pace of the film. It is slickly made and delivered over 90 minutes so that there is no time for the viewer to ruminate on specifics – instead we are whisked to the next twist or next moment. Living in the moment is the action/thriller film's friend and it works well in Salt, making it fun and quite urgent while you are watching it. Of course a lot of it doesn't make sense and normally I would be the first to call nonsense on such a film, but somehow Salt makes it work.Having a banner star is essential and, although I'm not a fan of Jolie, she does have a screen presence (quite how considering how stick thin she is, but she does it). She doesn't quite deliver on the potential of her character here as she only lets a humanity come through now and again, opting instead to mostly go with ""sexy indestructible spy"", which is less effective and has been done to death for all but the most libido-led teenage boys. Schreiber and Ejiofor are both strong in support and add a weight to the film that it definitely benefits from. The rest of the cast are solid enough but the presence of Andre Braugher is a mystery to me – such a good actor and well-known face but yet here he is on screen for a few seconds and barely two sentences to say.Salt is not a brilliant film by any means and the sequel-friendly ending didn't have me excited to see the character more, but yet I enjoyed the film while I watched it. The slick delivery and strong pace help cover up the plot holes and convenient narrative devices and generally it is fun. Best enjoyed in a genre friendly setting such as the summer blockbuster season or as a Friday night DVD though as it is probably not strong enough to play well away from home turf.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Rock solid entertainment.,"It's a credit to Jolie's star power that she was offered the part of Evelyn Salt – originally conceived as Edwin Salt – after Tom Cruise pulled out of the production, however it's a testament to her talent and hard work that she delivers a powerhouse performance that makes it hard to imagine the role as a man. Jolie is front and centre of this enigmatic film, the success of this thriller relying solely on her mysterious nature, and she comes up trumps. Whilst it's pleasing to see her convince in the hard-hitting action scenes – some of the close-quarter combat is brutal – her genuine acting chops carries the movie to another level. When you think you have her pinned as either good or bad, a small look here or a change in tone there completely trips you up and you're straight back into ambiguous territory.Jolie is helped immensely by crafty direction from Australian filmmaker Phillip Noyce, this marking the second time they've paired up (both times successfully) after working together on The Bone Collector. Noyce shoots in such a manner that the dark evasiveness of the proceedings are emphasised and the audience's pre-conceived notions of the picture are utilised against them. The situation presented on paper may be familiar, the method in which we're thrown in to witness it on screen is entirely dissimilar though. There's no easy choices to be made, no neatly wrapped conclusion, the opening scene warns you of this instantly.There's plenty of excellence elsewhere too. Director of photography, Robert Elswit, boosts the ominous atmosphere with his dusty cinematography as James Newton Howard provides an immensely exciting original score that captures the to-and-froing storyline perfectly. Schreiber and Ejiofor round out the trio of known actors on the cast list, the latter establishing himself as a major star of the future with yet another thriving turn. Appearing opposite Jolie isn't always easy going thanks to her gargantuan star-wattage, however the class of these two supporting men ensure they have a part to play in the striking accomplishment of Salt.Rock solid entertainment.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A straight up Action movie,"Anyone who complains about the plot holes in the new Angelina Jolie film Salt, or calls the story ridiculous or asks if the director thinks that we are idiots is missing the point completely. This film does not ask anyone to believe that there is a new Russian spy network operating within the U.S government, it simply uses it as a premise to get a good chase thriller going. Angelina Jolie is exactly right in this film, head on straight butt kicking chick. She isn't like a James Bond whovalues how much better she is at outfoxing her opponents. Evelyn Salt is someone who uses her incredible skills like knowledge of weaponry and ability to jump from semi truck to semi truck on a freeway in the name of what is right and in the name of who had it comin. She seems unphased by how she is able to escape each impossible situation but rather looks at it as part of her job. She expects these desperate situations and thrives within them. This film is fast, exciting action, and anyone who wants a semi-docu-drama action flick which involves realistic pressing issues might want to try Syriana. Don't take this film too seriously, it's just a lot of fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A passable slice of entertainment,"SALT is a modern-day Hollywood spy thriller with a plot as preposterous as they come: Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who's falsely accused of being a Russian spy and is forced to go on the run from her former colleagues. It's one of those movies whose plot involves layering twist upon twist, identity upon identity, so that come the ending even the most steadfast viewers will be scratching their heads in puzzlement.The movie proves to be fitfully entertaining, thanks to a lightning-fast pace that has no time for extraneous sub-plots or dreaded romance. It's focused and fluid, bringing a lot of energy in and keeping the momentum until the climax. The whole thing is indebted to the BOURNE series, of course, but there's no harm in that; if you're going to imitate something, then you might as well imitate the best.The direction is lacklustre, though, which is a surprise given Aussie director Phillip Noyce's pedigree. This is the guy who brought us the excellent suspense flick DEAD CALM, after all, along with two decent spy thrillers in the form of the Harrison Ford/Jack Ryan movies. The dialogue scenes are fine, but Noyce mishandles the action. Most attempts to emulate Paul Greengrass's cinematography end in disaster, and this film is no exception.Angelina Jolie, stick-figure thin and supposedly an expert fighter, is also miscast. Something strange has been happening to Jolie over the years; she was never a great actress, but she looked the part in the likes of the TOMB RAIDER films. Nowadays her extreme weight loss sits at odds with the physicality of the roles she plays and renders the fight scenes ridiculous. Liev Schreiber must be pretty bored playing another in a long line of similar roles, but look out for an excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor as the dogged cop on Jolie's trail.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Salt is no Tomb Raider,"After the performances given by Jolie in 'Mr and Mrs Smith' and the Tomb Raider saga, we've all come to see her as this potent mix of sex siren who leaves you gawking, and a femme fatale who can beat your guts out faster than you can say 'Wham bham thank you ma'am'.Sadly however,the much anticipated flick fails to impress. The plot is predictable, and the characters forgettable.Enter Agent Salt, a typical hotshot protagonist with a perfect life. In typical movie fashion however, things go awry and she's forced to play nanny and clean up the mess while being hunted for by the authorities.Yes, there are moments when the action makes you heart race, and yes, there is the occasional twist that leaves you flabbergasted. But no, the movie does not shatter your world and leave you gasping for more.Maybe I've being a little over-critical, but you will forgive me because I've seen Jolie's previous work, and I've come to associate her with mind blowing 'rock your world' type of performances.

utter crap,"nonsensical utter crap. I'm a Russian and despise narrow-mindedness in all its manifestations. And I hereby claim that ANY SINGLE PERSON who liked this movie is as narrow-minded as it gets.What this so-called movie is is a collection of anti-Russian clichés, albeit wrapped up in a slightly different package. However it boils down to the same old ""truth"": all evil, aggression and brutality resides in Russia, whereas light, justice and all forces of good belong almost exclusively in America. Laughing stock, pulp fiction which is daily fed to the imbeciles of this world!!I honestly think you should be ASHAMED OF yourselves for being so petty-minded,so willing to embrace all sorts of stale clichés, banalities and sheer asininity regarding Russia which is daily poured upon you in your press, TV and movies. And you just swallow it without a thought as your parents used to during the cold war years, but the truth is: Russia has changed BEYOND RECOGNITION in each and every respect over the last twenty years, people have changed, values have changed, outlook has changed, everything is different now, but they still sell u the same old stories, as in this ludicrous salt, about a backward land full of brutal, imbecilic thugs plotting annihilation of the US.

Bourne meets Sleepers and Boys from Brazil,"I found this disappointing. True, it is fast paced, has exciting camera work and adrenaline rousing music. Also, Angelina Jolie is excellent in the action side of her role, although her acting was (for me) at best wooden despite the disguising of emotion being an integral part of the character.However, the thoroughly implausible story, ridiculous characters, unnecessary female bashing, and similarity to plots in earlier films cited above rob this film of any classic attributes and will make it date quickly. For me this was not better than a Contractor type flick overall.Maybe the big screen will provide escapist entertainment value, but unless someone else pays or you have a two for one ticket, wait for the DVD.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sugar and salt, but missed some pepper","CIA operative Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) hopes to retreat from active field duty to a more laid back office position after spending time in North Korean prison, only to be saved by German scientist Michael Krause (August Diehl). However when former Russian spy Vasily Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) turns himself in to uncover a conspiracy spanning several decades - special underground units are raised from youth to infiltrate American soil from deep within and soon they will be called upon to assassinate the Russian president. When Vasily names Salt as one of these supposed agents she is soon on the run, followed closely by CIA agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and home security operative Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor).With this action packed spy thriller Phillip Noyce attempts to create a female counterpart for Matt Damon's brilliant Jason Bourne. Evading capture via simple ingenuity, touch-on creativity as well as the occasional fighting dominance, Salt wriggles out of seemingly hopeless situations. Done with a spark for action, the script by Kurt Wimmer (""Equilibrium"", ""Total Recall"") doesn't afford as much believability, instead being culpable of what could be deemed deus ex machina. The dosage of suspension of belief far outdoes any of the Bourne trilogy, fronted by what unravels to be an unassailable plot spurned into action by a pretty rag-tag master-plan. Angelina Jolie does manage to instill some level of coherence to her spy persona, making Salt a pretty credible character with due promise for further sequels. Noyce as well manages to follow through with resolve, especially during a tension filled first half of the movie, where Salt's identity is yet to be truly revealed. Overall however ""Salt"" is watchable and enjoyable, but lacks the charm and character consistency to make it as memorable as the Bourne trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"it gets more and more preposterous, but it's always with craft and competency","Salt continues the very long and tried & true legacy of US vs Russia spy films (continuing even after the Cold War), and this one reminds one of films like Telefon and Three Days of the Condor. Who is this agent, Salt? Was she trained in Russia since her childhood to assassinate the Russian president, or worse? How skillful is she? Is it all just second nature? The real kick with Salt is that after a while her skills and fighting ability and way of sneaking around basements and corridors and sides of buildings and jumping from truck to truck, she goes from being superspy to superhero. If the film wasn't based on a graphic novel, it will probably spur on a couple of others.I could go on about the plot more, but it's really a kind of plot that needs to be just taken in as it goes. That the film becomes almost non-stop action after Salt is ""outed"" as a Russian spy is part of this as well. We're mostly watching what comes of another Russian spy coming in and claiming she really works as part of an 'Something-X' program, the likes of which were made to assassinate JFK (conspiracy action, very fun montage). The fun then, and really what makes it more fun that it should be illegitimately, is the actors believing so much in what they do. Jolie is part of it, looking glamorous like a movie star and also can kick ass when she has to - which is a lot - and Liev Schrieber and Chiwetel Ejofor get some decent supporting roles to play with. And of course twists keep coming, and second-guessing being the name of the game in spy movies helps keep one interested.I was never bored through Salt, and that is really the biggest compliment I would want to pay it. It could have been directed with a level of professionalism and courtesy for the viewer's intelligence, but still also not very interesting. The careening-around plot, Jolie's screen presence and hints at deeper meaning, make it something a little more than it could have been. And by the end, we're hoping that there will be another Salt movie, perhaps with an even stronger plot. It's not a triumph, but a tightly constructed summer spy movie following long after the coat-tails of Bourne.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jole does a great job playing the role and making it real. I put off watching this because of some of the reviews - wow, I strongly disagree. Shrieber pulls off a strong performance, and really adds a lot to the movie. Adding in that Jole does a majority of the stunts earns this a high score.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"James Bond, Jason Bourne and now... Evelyn Salt?","Sorry, but I still prefer Charly Baltimore (Geena Davis) from ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"". She is still the ultimate kick-ass heroine for me, followed by Ellen Ripley from the ""Alien"" quadrilogy. But Angelina Jolie still can carry an action flick, and it certainly shows in this one. It's way better than her ""Tomb Raider"" movies.From start to finish ""Salt"" is action-packed and leaves little to no time for dramatics. It's all about Jolie and the action. Briskly paced at 100 minutes and with perfect, fluid editing time flies by as you become entertained at what's happening at the screen, no matter how preposterous it is.Preposterous? Why yes, there are some (note: SOME, not all) overdone moments, and some plot devices that are too far-fetched to be believed, but we're entertained too damn much that we never really notice. It's like the right movie to see after becoming mind-screwed by ""Inception"" (which isn't a bad thing); a Panadol for the brain.Jolie is perfect for the role, showing cold emotion and ruthlessness in all her scenes, especially the action sequences. Kurt Wimmer who wrote the script did a nice job tailoring Jolie for the role. Liev Schrieber and especially Chiwetel Ejiofor are also great in the roles that they portray, with Ejiofor giving a tough performance which is the polar opposite of his worry-wart character in last year's ""2012"".What I like about this movie is the constant guessing game the film presents to the audience. At times the film become too predictable, but at times it isn't. Kurt Wimmer weaves these in to his action-packed script that is filled with intrigue and danger, although I wish some of the twists were more original. The premise is nicely written and not overblown though, and that's a good thing.Having said that, I must commend the filmmakers for getting this done (even Roger Ebert said it): bringing back the Russians as Hollywood's favorite villains. Ever since the cold war ended we've been bombarded with a variety of politically correct villains such as Arabs, North Koreans, South American crime lords etc. Russian villains has always been a favorite with Hollywood: just look at the early James Bond films and even ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" and ""Rambo III"", mainly because of their dangerous nuclear capabilities, but in most of these films they're depicted in a cartoonish fashion. ""Salt"" not only brings the Russian villains back from the dead - it makes them believable.Who else but Phillip Noyce can direct a film with such tension and fluidity with ease? I've been an admirer of Noyce ever since ""Clear and Present Danger"" and he is a great thriller director, and this film somewhat proves it, albeit a somewhat physically absurd one. Physically absurd because, as mentioned earlier, some of the action sequences are preposterous. But they're well-directed thanks to Noyce. The cinematography also frames the action well, with the cameraman NOT afflicted with Parkinson's (Is Hollywood returning to STEADYcam?) The music score by James Newton Howard suits the tension and rousing action of the movie perfectly, and the production design is classy,In short, it's everything a popcorn action movie is. Don't have too high expectations and you'll be pleased. It's a fun ride from start to finish, and I recommend it for a fun time at the movies without too much overkill.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A few issues don't bother me.,"I pretty much got exactly what I wanted out of this film, and thus I walked out quite satisfied. A female version of Jason Bourne, mixed in with a ""24""-style storyline and old cold-war movie nostalgia and some good plot twists made this action film great to watch. No matter how skinny Jolie may be (or how she may look in real life), Hollywood always makes her look pretty on the big screen - covered in blood or otherwise. HOWEVER, my biggest qualm IS Jolie - her size doesn't fit the role and the type of stunts she does. She certainly appears capable, but certainly not believable. I have to agree with an earlier comment, Michelle Yeoh would have been a better fit for this role (and a female lead in this film would surely have been more interesting than Tom Cruise).In contrast, PERHAPS Inception may have been a better film and more successful at the box office, BUT I walked out far more satisfied after watching Salt than Inception.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Getting' on a motorbike, Lookin' really ladylike","The year was 1997. Modern-day megastar Angelina Jolie had yet to hit the big time, and had earnt her latest paycheck from appearing as a runaway escort in the music video for The Rolling Stones' Anybody Seen My Baby? (A lyric of which serves as the inspiration for this review's title). The clip was extremely well directed, and the song was, in this music- illiterate's opinion, the standout of their Bridges To Babylon album.But I digress. There are many ways to describe the slightly above-average Salt, but Mr. Jagger puts it best. With this film, Jolie proves beyond doubt that no other actress can carry the weight of an action film with the poise and style that she possesses. In a similar fashion to her husband (but not quite to the same extent), Jolie's life has become so engulfed by the media that one can easily forget that acting skills that made her so famous in the first place. The plot is arguably the most inspired and enjoyable aspect of the film. A multitude of twists in the second half make it difficult to describe without giving away key details, but its outward originality is very refreshing in a genre typically lacking in new ideas.Evelyn Salt is a CIA interrogator who becomes involved in a conspiracy theory concerning Russian sleeper spies planted in America almost fifty years ago. Needless to say, it requires an immense suspension of disbelief (none more so than when an explanation is given for the Russians being responsible for the murder of JFKwe all know it was the Mafia's idea) but it becomes increasingly enticing, even if it does lose its way a little at the end.Jolie really does carry this film right from the opening scene. Aptly complemented by Schreiber, Ejiofor and Inglourious Basterds' August Diehl, this is the type of film that dosen't require the lead to overstretch their acting chops, but instead deliver where it counts: the pure entertainment department. With a performance that requires rapid personality changes to accommodate different scenarios, Jolie's character remains at the forefront of the action, and more than holds her own during the speedy but well-directed action scenes. And yes, she does look good doing it.But Jolie does not deserve all of the credit with respect to the portrayal of the title character. Screenplay writer Kurt Wimmer, while not exactly delivering a groundbreaking script, has created a complex figure in Evelyn Salt. As the viewer, you'll find yourself constantly questioning her role in the story, even after her true identity is revealed.As mentioned earlier, Salt begins to stray in the final scene, where the characters' motives are somewhat sacrificed in preference of an explosive, gun-toting finale, which comes dangerously close to filtering in an avalanche of crime-thriller clichés in the process. In fact, it becomes too convoluted for its own good. For a film that commences so promisingly and keeps up that air of intrigue during the Second Act, it feels as if director Phillip Noyce tried to pull an Inception, that is, putting together an ending so mind-bending it leaves everyone in the cinema talking long after the movie is over.In that respect, the film fails. The outcome is needlessly complicated, and the process through which we get to that outcome makes less and less sense the more I think about it. Nonetheless, the film on the whole is, just like the apple strudel in Diehl's previous film, not terrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's best not to be too concern about the plot, and just enjoy the action. The ending finishes with an obvious nod to a sequel. In fact it doesn't really end which dilutes the power of the climax.

Three cheers for Angelina Jolie.,"What a great movie! Fast-paced, high energy entertainment. Angelina Jolie has never been better. She is truly the star of this movie.

Far from being obvious, the movie succeeds in grabbing and keeping the audience's interest as the plot unfolds and develops. Liev Schreiber gives a chilling portrayal of a high ranking government official with a hidden agenda and the rest of the cast is equally excellent in their support roles. But the star as always is the beautiful and talented Ms. Jolie. She carries this movie and through her efforts this movie becomes great entertainment.

However, Salt is like a ticking time bomb; from the moment the interview with Orlov starts, hold on cause it is going to be one-hell of a ride! You rarely find films like this!Angelina is brilliant! Her stunts are awe-inspiring and she shows everyone how it's done! She pours a lot into her character! In the end, leaving the theater, all you'll be thinking about is her and the great work she's done!Nobody goes into a summer film expecting something smart or a character-based flick; let's face it, we see for the action and the fun of it! Regardless of all of its ridiculous moments, this does it! One of the best summer offerings so far (excluding Inception and Toy Story 3, of course). Don't miss this popcorn film!

"Quite interesting and keeps you hooked for most of the time. Your standard popcorn movie, and this one doesn't bull-sh*t much.","Greetings from hicflicks.wordpress.com !After seeing quite a few doozies this year, I went for this movie with low expectations. However, it turned out to be quite enjoyable, fast – paced, and kept me glued for most of the run time. Of course this flick did have its fair share of popcorn elements , and cheesy scenes, but all-in-all this one turned out to be quite an entertaining watch. Angelina Jolie delivered a fine enough performance, but I can't help but observe that she seems to be getting thinner by the day (and thus unattractive as well). Anyways, from the ending of the movie it looks like Salt will have a part 2 soon, and I hope that the sequel should also be as good.. and hopefully Ms. Jolie would have put on some weight by then :)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tour-de-force by Jolie makes Salt watchable,"CIA agent Evelyn Salt interrogates a Russian defector, Orlov, who tells her about ""Day X"", an operation organized by a powerful Russian since the Cold War, which will lead to the destruction of the United States. Orlov mentions that at the funeral of the late Vice President in New York City, the visiting Russian President will be killed by Russian spy Evelyn Salt. Salt, shaken at the accusation, attempts to contact her husband Mike, a German arachnologist, fearing for his safety. Meanwhile, Orlov escapes, prompting Salt to escape — causing the CIA to think she is a spy but is she? And if so what are her motifs ?I was looking forward to watching Salt, I really like the spy genre even tough it's hard to find a great film in that category and, when I saw the trailer, I was instantly reminded of Jennifer Garner in the amazing TV show Alias. It seemed right up my alley. Something about sexy girls kicking ass, maybe? Unfortunately, Salt disappointed me. Not that it's a terrible film but it's average at best. The premise is great and holds a lot of potential but it evolves into something completely ridiculous and over the top. The plot is so flimsy, so far-fetched that, if you're going into this film expecting a smart, well-constructed story, then you're going to be just as disappointed as me. I'm not even going to talk about that final scene. See it and judge for yourself.I have to say that regarding the action, the film delivers in spades. There's plenty of chases, stunts, fighting sequences and so forth. And for the most part it was all very nicely choreographed; there's a bit of cgi in the mix and the usual cuts but still, it looks great. And so does Jolie. Not only does she look gorgeous but she did a terrific job considering all the physical stuff she had to do, and overall, she delivered a strong performance. Granted, it's not enough to make this into a great film but Jolie may very well be the reason why Salt is watchable.6/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
Make sure that they bring body bags we've got at least seven,"***SPOILERS*** Very exciting but factually ridiculous film about this plot to destroy the USA by a group of Soviets sleeper agents on what they've designated to be called X Day: The Day of Judgement! The trouble with all that is that their totally unaware that the Soviet Government that engineered this half baked plan back in he 1970's at the height of the Cold War has been out of circulation or business for almost 20 years.The top honcho or assassin in this entire scheme turns out to be sleeper CIA agent Evelyn Salt, Angelina Jolie, who's in fact outed by Russian defector Vasily Oriov, Daniel Olbrychski, who claims he dying of cancer and has nothing to lose. As it turned out Salt is to be part of an assassin plan to knock off the Russian President Boris Matveyev, Olek Krupa, who's to attend Vice President Otis' funeral in New York City. It's then that the action really starts popping with Salt having her clover blown now on the run throughout the entire movie for reasons,besides being outed, known only to herself. It seems that Salt has somehow changed her opinion for those she's working for and become a good guy or good gal and joined forces with the good old,where she spent almost her entire life, USA.It takes a while to realize what's going on in the film with Salt preforming all kinds of superhuman feats like jumping 200 feet with a wet t-shirt from a helicopter, after being shot, into the freezing Potomac River that would make spies and martial art artists like James Bond and Bruce Lee look like stark armatures in comparison. Salt is first involved in the assassination of President Matveyev and then for no reason whats so ever turns on her Soviet sleeper comrades, whom she put to sleep permanently, ending up knocking off the entire crew. Including Vasily Oriov who in fact turned out to be her father! There's also the very pressing problem facing Salt in that theirs a mole in the CIA who's using her to do all his dirty work! He's then planning to ice Salt and become a hero in saving the USA and the world, that this sleeper unit he's part of was planning, from nuclear destruction.Algelina Jolie is very convincing as the indestructible Evelyn Salt who's out to save the world with the world,or US Government,out to stop her in thinking that she's in fact really trying to destroy it. Salt's boss in the CIA Ted Winter, Liev Schreiber, doesn't quite know what to make of her in feeling that Salt is somehow a double agent and playing a deadly game of cat and mouse with both countries that she's working for. The same goes for head of White House security Mr. Peabody, Chiwetel Ejlofor, who despite all the damage Salt caused him, killing dozens of his men, feels that she's really on the right side, the USA, of the issues.***SPOILERS*** There's also Salt's husband Michael Krause, August Diehl, who's expertise in spider venom comes in very handy for Salt later on in the film in being able to bring back the dead in the case of Russian President Boris Matveyev. An event that not only blows the entire plan of setting off a Third World War, by Oriov & Co, but ended up costing Michael his life.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Now don't you feel ""Salt""-y?","**1/2 out of (****)After the trailer debut of ""Salt"" worldwide audiences started to groan because they thought, ""That's just another Angelina Jolie movie where she kicks butt and takes names, *sighs*. Despite some mixed reception from global audiences, ""Salt"", surprisingly gained positive feedback from the critics. While the reviews weren't as mind-blowing as say ""Inception"", most consisted of mild recommendations. Where do I fall in line? I found ""Salt"" to be an enjoyable summer blockbuster that is truly the epitome of pure escapist fun. However, let's not get too carried around here, ""Salt"" is highly flawed and only serves as a mild recommendation. Nevertheless, ""Salt"" still comes off as a decent film that boasts great performances and a break-neck pace.""Salt"" revolves around a CGI agent who accuses ""Salt"" (Jolie) of being a Russian spy. The government is all over ""Salt"" after this accusation which alarms them. However, ""Salt"" escapes from the government in hopes to find her missing husband, prove her right identity, and stay undercover. Although, the question is, is Salt a Russian spy or is it just a false accusation?First off, the performances are certainly great. Angelina Jolie is amazing as our action heroine and does her job. Liev Schreiber is also great because of how relatable he is in tight situations and how his performances comes off very authentic. Lastly, Chiwetel Ejiofor is great in this film because he plays the suspicious Peabody and his performances is very realistic. Moreover, this film is paced very briskly. When the film's resolution came, I asked myself, ""Is it over already?"". Yes, the film is paced so fast that the film feels like half of its running time (which is short in itself) and it feels so quick because it's very indulging. Furthermore, the cinematography is certainly eye-popping and captures the tone and puts a small emphasis on the big budget. Additionally, the action is non-stop so as to not bore the viewer.While the pros outweigh the cons, there are still flaws. First off, while the action set pieces are cool, they are slightly disappointing. Every time action graces itself onto the big screen, there are major cut-aways, so sometimes, it's very difficult to follow the action. In addition, the story is pretty weak. The premise is very paint-by-numbers, despite some twists. Moreover, this film starts out with a bang and ends with a whimper. The first half is a pretty slick action thriller and then the second half loses some steam and doesn't live up to its predecessing fifty minutes. Also, the ending is very predictable. Lastly, while this film is supposed to be mindless, there are some scenes that go so over-the-top, they distract the viewer from the film. Typically, unrealistic situations are welcome in a film, but for a film we're supposed to take seriously, it's very inexcusable.Despite some inane moments and a weak plot, ""Salt"" is a pretty decent film. Sure it's paint- by-numbers and the film is bloated with action, but the break-neck pace and performances make it enjoyable. Now viewer beware, this film is no ""Inception"". ""Inception"" and ""Salt"" are in two different ballparks. ""Inception"" is a very complex film that you need your brain cap on in order to view the film. ""Salt"" is a very simple film where you need to turn your brain off in order to view the film. Overall, ""Salt"", while not highly comes mildly recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Action Film from Start to Finish,"This movie begins with a young woman named ""Evelyn Salt"" (Angelina Jolie) being held in a North Korean prison and protesting her innocence while she is being brutally interrogated for being an American spy. Not long afterward she is released in a prisoner swap. The movie then fast-forwards 2 years later and shows Evelyn happily married to the German national who helped gain her release named ""Mike Krause"" (August Diehl). We then learn that Evelyn was indeed a CIA agent and is currently working in Langley, Virginia. Unfortunately, things take a definite turn for the worse right after that. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was an action film from start to finish. It had a good plot, and I liked the acting of Angelina Jolie. On the other hand, I must also admit that there were several scenes that were simply too far-fetched which ended up totally straining credibility. Likewise, the ending was much too abrupt as well. That said I rate the movie as just slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Where Salt gives a new perspective on bitter-sweet victory,"In the manner of other action spy dramas (see the Bourne franchise, for example, or the interminable Bond series etc), this outing is simply another vehicle for another (unlikely) action heroine, Evelyn Salt (Jolie), who demonstrates her ability to foil all attempts to keep her locked down, in chains, tied up, handcuffed or imprisoned – so that she can ""save the world"", as one of the key characters remarks towards the end of this frenetically paced, kick-butt, auto mangling, wall breaking, truck smashing and totally improbable plot. Still, it's exciting with some truly imaginative stunts to help take your breath away.Accompanying Jolie, we see her concerned boss, Ted Winter (Schreiber), Peabody (Ejiofor) – all CIA agents – Salt's husband, Krause (Diel), and Orlov (Olbrychiski), a Russian spy who sets the ball rolling when he surrenders to the CIA. Naturally, in this sort of caper, nothing is ever as it seems. So, keep the sound up when they're talking to keep up with the clues and plot twists. The most I'll say is that it's different; but it has similar convoluted excesses as, say, The Manchurian Candidate (1962, 2004) and the B and B series.Jolie is credibly tough, Schreiber is suitably urbane, Ejiofor cannily persistent, Diel naively supportive and the Russians are, wellstereotypically Russian. In other words, the acting fits the scenes (no pun intended). As you might expect, the editing is superb throughout. The direction by Noyce is precise and allows the story to unfold without too much thinking; just go with it.But why Salt – why that name? Well, during the Cold War, the USA and USSR actually held a series of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks – aka SALT I. Those talks morphed, later, into SALT II.I guess Evelyn Salt decided there'd been enough talking already: time for action. So, we might see Salt II down the road where she finishes the job.Give this six out of ten, mainly for action, photography and editing. Recommended for action fans only.January 25, 2014",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another one bites the dust ... I hope!,"Although I hate piracy and usually buy the movies I love, in that case I am strongly with the pirates worldwide. Let the piracy win, let the filmmakers be ruined, let the injustice rise! If that is the only way that can stop Hollywood from making tripe's like this one, let the fiends beat them once again! Not only this venture is a miserable and a grubby one - it can be used against the humanity and the world peace as well. Given in mind the very low level of the average intelligence in America, peoples around there can easily be duped to believe the Russians are still their biggest enemies, while it is their Government instead (remember 9/11, dudes, and do not ever forget who started the fire, oh, no, it wasn't Saddam or bin Laden, it was good old Bush Jr. instead!) Having been in Russia I've seen there with my very eyes a beggar who knows some of Pushkin's poems by heart; tell me how many Americans can cite, say, Mark Twain, or Sellinger, or Hemingway for example? Or any other American distinguished author apart from the pulp fiction ones? How many of them Americans knows which is the capitol of the US of America? How many of them Americans knows Europe is not a single country, but a continent instead?And do believe me - there are quite a few similar movies in Russia - they consider Muslim terrorists as their core enemy since Soviets fall apart and are making action/spy movies for them and not for the US any more.As for this so called ""movie"" - I haven't seen such a turd wrapped in glossy paper in my life! Not only it is not credible - it is unbearable to the hilt. Angelina Jolie is a disaster here - although she is a good (but not genial) actress, you can clearly see how she acts with the only one thought in mind - how to pick up the huge paycheck soon so she can be more independent and grow as many poor kids as possible (just for the show, of course) And again Russians who speak English and their mother language with a heavy accent ... because they are Polacks, not Russians... KGB (it's FSB actually but who the hell cares) agents who drink vodka in every single occasion just to let the main hero(ine) win, etc. etc.WHY IS Hollywood TAKING EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US AS IMBECILES WITH CLOSE TO ZERO INTELLIGENCE?At the 10th minute of movie until the end I was constantly under the impression I watch Soviet movie for the Americans, made in 1950 in Stalin's regime, dubbed in English and with the Russians/Americans swapping places.Do not watch this rotten piece of pork salt sh*t or you will regret after (if you have more than two brain cells)I'm sorry for being mean.

"Angelina's Best Action Movie (Ok, after ""Wanted"")","I really don't understand why people sometimes like to choose a movie and start complaining about it. ""SALT"" is awesome! Angelina Jolie even more awesome! The movie is fun, exciting and well directed. Angelina Jolie is great because she can do an action scene like no one, but she also can do the ""drama"" scenes very well because she's a great actress. The action sequences are not totally realistic sometimes, but still much more realistic than many other movies and they did a great a decision on not using CGI all the time (actually, i don't remember any scene with CGI, maybe the explosion on the white house, but that's OK). And all those things about children being trained, the White House Bunker and many others are all true, which is something very scary and even more exciting. Who is Salt? I think this was the beginning, and we can discover more about Evelyn Salt in a sequel. Salt is dangerous, determinated, and knows what she wants. Angelina Jolie is awesome, gorgeous, sexy, crazy and amazing. I really want a sequel, because Evelyn Salt deserves.

A Moth-eaten Heroine and a Truckload of Tripe,"Movie producers' contempt for their customers is legendary, and ""Salt"" is a prime example of their pathological greed. In this case they couldn't even be bothered to concoct a fresh plot, as yet another megalomaniac clique plans to start World War 3 by assassinating the US and Russian presidents. The genre was mercilessly satirized by the Austin Powers franchise more than a decade ago, and this ludicrous example insults everybody above the mental age of twelve.The story makes little sense, as the attempt at world domination by group of power-crazed conspirators is foiled by one of their own mole triple agents. The film's conveyor belt of action sequences is clearly the point of the exercise, as the stunt doubles of an anorexic Jolie spend almost two hours jumping from roof to roof of various speeding vehicles, and vanquishing hundreds of heavily armed assailants. The public seems to possess an insatiable appetite for escapist fantasies, and garbage like 'Salt' allows a cynical industry to take their money and laugh at them behind their backs.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Better - Very Good - would watch it again and again,"In my opinion, Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women alive in the world today. As an actress, she has played so many different roles and all so well that she could recite the alphabet and I would be enthralled and intrigued.All of this is to say that she very well plays the role of a super-spy CIA agent in this action/suspense/spy movie. Adding to the value of this enjoyable movie is the fact that her love interest is a very average looking guy (yeah, and a world-renowned scientist). I'll freely admit that I (an average looking guy) am attracted to movies where the gorgeous woman is devoted to such a guy.Jolie is accused of being a ""sleeper"" KGB agent and the movie unfolds to reveal what happens next.And what happens next involves amazing chase scenes, satisfying action sequences, and enough plot twists to make sure that even a non-Angelina fan will remain enthralled and intrigued. There have been enough posts about the plot weaknesses in this movie so I won't go there. Action movies generally require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief but this one clearly requires more. Suffice it to say that this is why my rating was 8/10 rather than 10/10.If you are waiting for Jolie to make a third Lara Croft Tombraider film then check out this movie.

Delivers.,"While this film has the tried and true essentials of it's forefathers, it nonetheless sets out to achieve in it's thrilling action and rapid-fire pace. There's a lot to like in this film with it's lead star giving a good performance with everyone on board and the story will keep you engaged throughout the running time. So far I like this. The only gripe that I have is that the film didn't fully explore the protagonist's inner psyche. There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea;having seen so many spy movies with mostly male heroes, this one mixes things up differently. The ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's not as cerebral as the Bourne films, but it will entertain you for an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angelina Jolie pulled it off again!!!,"I watched this movie because I read in IMDb that it has a lot of action. And I'm not disappointed. Some actions, although over the top, is believable.

She is firm and beautiful. Looking at her acting we could feel her determination. We are mesmerized by her beauty and her toughness. She is the perfect cast for this role. I heard that originally Salt is male. Now, after I watched this movie, I couldn't imagined Salt as a male agent. It would be so boring.. he he..My note, if you are planning to watch this movie, don't expect serious movie like James Bond or even Bourne. This movie doesn't fall into that category.

Wasted Potential,"The stunts and action of this movie were pretty good, although the fighting was not great. Something about Jolie running that made me think the direction went something like this ""OK, run, good, next shot"" It just had a dead pan delivery. The movie had it's highlights, they didn't pull punches, but then without character development, perhaps they didn't need too. Oh, they shot a good guy. That's bad. Now someone is upset. Unfortunately however, despite a lot of action and a willingness to shock the audience and be uncompromising, it really never captured my imagination. It was amazingly boring and entirely predictable. There was no other way that any of it was going to happen. The plot really needed something for tension and interest. However, it was pretty clear who the good guys and bad guys were, so only a matter of time until they did what they were supposed to do and the audience could move on.

"One damn good action hero Jolie is, and in SALT, it felt like a female ""Jack Bauer 24"" type non-stop for the whole 100 minutes complete","Yes, Angelina Jolie can very well be our lady James Bond, anytime. She has integrally proved in the superb Simon West directed ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" 2001, and opposite Brad Pitt as the dynamic duo in ""Bourne Identity"" director Doug Liman's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" 2005. From the Special Collector's Edition DVD behind the scenes, we learned that Jolie did her own stunts after rigorous physical training, that her agile moves were more convincing than stunt doubles. Impressively credulous - she embodies the character of Lara Croft and she is Lara Croft, The Tomb Raider, 100 percent (and beyond). And when she is Jane Smith, she is the unmistakable fearless lethal assassin just as her husband John Smith is. Jolie's star power, acting energy, physical and inner strength always intensely come through and through. As agent Evelyn Salt, she's no match for anyone - except Jack Bauer of '24'. I totally see her as the female equivalent to Jack, from the very first moment as SALT, the movie, opens.As one famous film critic pointed out that SALT made RUN LOLA RUN (1998 w-d Tom Tykwer with Franka Potente of ""Bourne Identity"" being Lola) seem like mere walking for its 80 minutes. Jolie in SALT is constantly on the run (sprinting, leaping, jumping, running down, running up, running across), and her brain never stops as unbroken string of hindrances every which way are coming at her, trying to stop her dead, literally. Fear not, and it's no spoiler, Evelyn Salt is one determined agent, Russian or otherwise, out to defend the US of A (just as '24' Jack Bauer does at all costs, risking loved ones and sacrificing oneself consciously to get to the next step and to achieve the unswerving goal - save the world, too, while s/he's at it). There's many twists and turns. Convoluted? 'Nah'. It's standard espionage fare, cold war related, action-filled screenplay by competent ""Equilibrium"" (2002) w-d Kurt Wimmer. Director Phillip Noyce is no stranger to this genre, he had given us Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan in ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994). It is Jolie whom you want to follow from beginning to end, and you badly wanted her to succeed, just as agent Salt does.Accompany her, worry for her, cheer for her. Is she or is she not a Russian spy product - you would at times waver but no time to ponder. Her next move may reveal yet another level in the game plan, and you'd think how clever she is, or empathize with her for why she did what she did - she's already moved on. The story pacing is non-stop and there's no time for second-guessing who's the real bad guy and who can really help Salt. Is she truly on her own? If you want a good thriller and your money's worth for 100 minutes, Jolie's SALT is the best bet.Music by James Newton Howard, along with director of photography Robert Elswit, editing team of Stuart Baird, John Gilroy and Steven Kemper, tightly delivered the scenes with earnest proficiency. Key supporting roles by Liev Schreiber as Ted, Salt's mentor (he's in ""A Walk on the Moon"" 1999 with Diane 'Unfaithful' Lane, ""Hamlet"" 2000, ""Defiance"" 2008 opposite James Bond Daniel Craig, among many others) and Chiwetel Ejiofor as agent Peabody (he's memorable in d- Stephen Frears' 2002 ""Dirty Pretty Things"" with Audrey 'Amelie' Tautou, and in last year's disaster-blockbuster of ""2012"").By the way, w-d Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" with stellar cast of DiCaprio, Cotillard, Page, Watanabe, Caine, Gordon-Levitt, including Cillian Murphy - is very much a mind-bending spiral tale of intrigue, psychological sci-fi if you will, while SALT is one continuous straight action-packed thriller helmed by Angelina Jolie from start to finish. Apples and oranges, not to be compared.For a down to earth, cold war period Russian (and French) spy suspense and human drama, based on true events in the annals of US-French-Russian spy history, see ""Farewell"" aka ""L'affaire Farewell"" (2009), a worthy French film by director Christian Carion (of ""Joyeux Noel"" 2005), along the vein of ""The Lives of Others"" (aka ""Das Leben der Anderen"" 2006, German Oscar winner by w-d Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck) - a little known string of events yet critical to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
If you read only one review...,"Let's keep this simple (because the writers sure didn't)...Anyone that rates this movie a 1 or 2 just can't be pleased. If they rate it a 9 or 10, they are WAY too easy to please.Salt is a John LeCarre style spy thriller, with a fairly implausible premise, and a couple of plot twists that you eventually have to relax and just ""go with"", or else allow them to spoil an otherwise decent picture.Without giving anything away, Salt is an American CIA agent. One of the best. A Russian agent wishing to defect to America is brought into the CIA where he is debriefed by Salt (an expert on Russian spies), where he reveals that someone at the CIA named ""Evelin Salt"" is actually a Russian spy. This is a big deal for Salt for reasons that are made clear in the movies' opening sequence. Soon Salt finds herself on the run from the CIA while the audience (at least those not paying attention) are left to wonder, ""Is she a spy or isn't she?"" If you pay attention, you'll know the answer right away, and the movie becomes purely an action flick. If you are easily fooled or otherwise aren't paying attention, you may find yourself guessing almost up until the end (but if you haven't figured it out halfway thru the film, you're probably too dumb to have found the theater in the first place.) It's not Shakespeare, but it's not Plan 9 either. The film feels like one long action sequence that holds your attention till the end (which comes quickly, trimming the film to barely more than 90 minutes because of its frantic pace).Jolie has the dramatic thing down pat in her career, but has been searching for a good action franchise for years (most notably the disappointing Tomb Raider series) without much success. Salt has the potential of turning into a decent female James Bond-esq franchise for Jolie, if they can just move past the sloppy plot formulation.Bottom-line, if you see it, you won't come away feeling you wasted $9. If you can handle a decent action movie containing a number of weak plot-twists without groaning, you'll come away pleased. In all, a 6.5 is about right ratings-wise. Good, not great. Better than average despite weak writing.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Action packed with a simplistic storyline,"I like AJ doing the action role so I was always going to want to watch this. The trailer was good and encouraged me to do so.The film started well and got very gritty from the start. Promising. Sadly though, this is the point where I should have switched off my brain. The storyline is VERY simplistic and doesn't really care if it makes sense or not. The scenes jump from one action stunt to another but the bit that joins them together is really not there. If you leave your brain switched on then you will struggle to watch this. The laws of science and biology do not apply to this film and AJ seems to be made from Kevlar. Oh, and please please please don't watch this film believing that there are any great big twists because a three year old could work out the plot from the very start. The reveal just leaves you thinking...Derrrrrrrr!!!!!So to sum up; The story is nonsense, the action is full on but illogical, the characters are cliché and the ending is highly predictable and lazy. In my world this film is nonsense but in AJ's world this film is good for those who have trouble remembering to breathe. Its stupid but there is action in it. Just don't expected to come away from watching this feeling enlightened.I've rated this as a 6 just coz you can forget reality watching it.

Entertaiining with a twist,"I really liked it. So many people want to criticize this movie and overanalyze things, feel slighted that their country is misrepresented, or that the movie is just not realistic. Folks, it's a movie. I didn't watch it to learn about the history of Russian-American relations. I watched and enjoyed it because it's engaging, entertaining, smart and enjoyable. I came away from this with unexpected, crafty surprises that left me guessing the whole time. It's good, and not just because of the action. It's well written IMO -like any good mystery.That said, is it realistic? Of course not, and you have to set aside your realism for a while and just enjoy the show. I rolled my eyes several times, but so what? I still liked it. You know what else - it's categorized as an action/crime/mystery, but I think because of the lack of realism, it should also be billed as a fantasy movie.I'm a Bourne fan, and I liked this too. Have you ever seen Equilibrium with Christian Bale? It's fantastic, but oh so totally unrealistic, but still have a 7.7 rating (currently).

Average action film,"To be honest. This does exactly what it says on the tin, it's a bog standard action film. Good action scenes, explosions, car crashes/chases etcWhat I didn't like. None of the characters were particularly likeable, you only really started to like Jolie's character by the end. My other issue was that I think I've seen one too many thrillers, because I was constantly questioning whether she's been set up or who it could be etc. When really, I needed to just watch the action for what it was. It's a simple plot, nothing difficult to understand about it at all. The characters would do questionable things as well which would bother me.Overall it's not too bad, I didn't hate it at all. But, I feel as though they could have done more with the plot and the characters. I watched because it's on top 10 on Netflix UK so I know plenty of English people will be debating this. Chuck it on if you like action films, just don't expect anything drastic.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bourne Salt-imatum,"Angelina Jolie's latest actioner Salt might have its fair share of explosive action, but even though it promises a quickened heart rate, it lacks any real substance, just like the mineral from which it gets its title. Ultimately, you will leave the theater wanting more. But did I like Salt? Perhaps (In fact, maybe a little too much).I was expecting constant action in Salt, but what I was not prepared for was how absolutely idiotic it would be. From what I assumed was a political thriller woven through an action template, it was quickly revealed to be nothing of the sort. The spy setup is simply an excuse to have Jolie perform impossible stunts and escape from any fathomable situation. These kinetic sequences, though ludicrous, are not what inhibits Salt from reaching loftier heights, but rather the plot-hole filled story which is as eye-roll inducing as it is perfunctory.As you might have gathered, the plot is moot, but the opening finds our heroine in a situation that could only be described as hairy but like most every problem she faces, proves to be one cool customer. We are fast-tracked, more or less, to Salt's interrogation of a KGB defector, who subsequently accuses her of being not from Uncle Sam's side of the pond. So off she goes to clear her name, or whatever, and destroys half of the city in the process. But hey, I would let Angelina Jolie trash my place any day.The plot plays second-fiddle to Jolie's sultry screen presence and the noisy, crash-filled action set pieces, but with its PG-13 rating, it gives the target audience everything they could want in a summer blockbuster. Like many actors who are slowly passing through or well within middle age, Jolie has matured and brings significantly more gravitas to the proceedings then she ever did in Tomb Raider. Her co- stars do fine work as well, Liev Schreiber plays the long-time friend and co-worker to able results, but the standout, even in a limited role, is the superb and underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor. He is memorable in any project he is associated with, if you remember, he certainly shined above all else in last year's 2012.The true strength of Salt lies within the action sequences which are elegantly staged, white-knuckle and most importantly decipherable. Unlike most, I am not bothered by what has been dubbed ""shaky can"" filmmaking, but I will eat some of my words as the clearly presented action scenes here are refreshing. The style is reminiscent of the latest Matt Damon spy actioners. Salt could just as easily be called ""The Bourne Salt-imatum,"" but I suppose the pedigree of the ludicrous plot sets this blockbuster on a decidedly lower plane.Amidst its inherent lunacy, Salt never becomes tedious, self-serious or boring for that matter. The pace is brisk and the action flashy so if you are looking for intelligence go see Inception for a second time instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outrageous but entertaining.,"My Rating: *** out of 4.Ridiculous. Implausible. Derivative. Way over-the-top. I'd be surprised if it wasn't! No one really goes to a movie like SALT expecting it would be moving or intelligent. They expect a good time, and in just the right time to beat the heat. SALT is a gloriously goofy but ridiculously enjoyable thriller. Not a great comic thriller like a James Bond movie or a serious chase thriller like any of the Bourne pictures, but it's fun all the same even if, with all the silliness that ensues, it could have at least had characters that would have cracked a smile just a little bit.Still, what it lacks in humorous and charismatic characters worthy of a James Bond, it more than makes up for it with the panache it gives to its action sequences. We've seen enough chases in action movies to last us a lifetime, and there's more than enough of those here in SALT. Not so much is added that it might as well establish itself as a remake/re-imagining of any other chase thriller or Cold War espionage plot ever made (which I think is what this movie really is). But to be fair, director Philip Noyce (a long-time action director) and writer Kurt Wimmer had me the moment Angelina Jolie suspects herself as a Russian spy and, tedious flashback sequences aside, never really lost me. Like so many other movies of its ilk, the plot is mostly a clothes-hanger which strings together a series of running scenes. And boy does Angelina run! And just to be dynamic, she jumps in a lot of things too, be it on the back of a passing truck (or three trucks) or an elevator shaft, Jolie's ankles must be aching with all the jumping she has to do in this movie.The plot is a belated Cold-War paranoia where CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is suspected by a defector as a commie, raised in Russia (along with other children) to be sent to America as a mole. A-huh. Yes, the plot is preposterous (but to be fair, it might appeal to any conspiracy buff who felt that they might have missed out on this one), but I'll be honest I was with it all the way, even if I was only holding my laughter a couple of times. The action sequences, whilst predictable and nonsensical at times, are exhilarating, and at 100 minutes it doesn't let up. Sacrificing any dramatic depth in the process, the movie just keeps on moving. It ain't art, and not at all different from a dozen action adventure movies I've seen in a long time, but it does play its part as a summer movie: It gives you all the requisite bells and whistles without having to insult you in the process.",,Anonymous,Mystery
For Angelina Fans,"Well seriously don't hope for some realistic things happening around on regard that it touches the political side. This is just another action packed thriller. I cant really comment on the plot as it do have holes and the direction as well is not great. But still its an entertaining thriller packed with some mindless action as usual in Jolie's flicks. Its not boring at all and is filled with surprises. There are lots of twists and so its not predictable which is a plus point for Salt. Frankly don't start connecting dots and criticizing on the images portrayed of Russia as its just a fiction meant solely for the purpose of entertainment. Angelina Jolie is stunning as usual and if you're a fan, you don't wanna miss this one. Overall Salt is a good package of action.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Finally a decent female lead action film,"'Salt' shouldn't be a particularly noteworthy film. It's a decent action/thriller with a few twists and turns (especially the Director's Cut version) that will keep you entertained and intrigued till the credits roll. When it's all said and done 'Salt' is just another film in an overcrowded genre that includes successfully entries such as the Bourne series, Mission Impossible films, the never ending Bond franchise and standalone films like The Departed and Body of Lies. However, there is a key difference here, only one of these films features a female protagonist. What makes the character of Evelyn Salt an important female figure in the action genre is not what she does so much as what she doesn't do. She doesn't wear skin tight leather, high heels or other impractical clothing for a CIA agent, she doesn't use her body to seduce her male counterparts, she doesn't require rescuing from a more experienced, stronger male character. Yes, Angelina Jolie is an attractive woman, she could be described as sexy, but she is not, in this film at least, a sexualised object of male desire and there is a world of difference between the two. It's interesting to note that the character she plays was originally written for a man, Tom Cruise to be precise, then later changed to a woman. This is reminiscent of the origins of the character of Ellen Ripley in the Alien franchise who was written as a man. While there was a slight change in pronoun to accommodate actress Sigourney Weaver, not a single line of dialogue changed from the original script. Ripley is arguably one of the best, it not the finest example of a non-sexualised strong female character in an American action/sci-fi film and it's perhaps due to the fact that she was written as a man. Being written as a man she comes across as strong willed, independent, ambitious, physically tough and aggressive, all qualities that are very rarely attributed to American female film stars. In a perfect world, 'Salt' would not warrant an overly wordy review or require any particular attention. However, due to the misogynist and sexist culture that permeates our patriarchal society it is significant when a film comes out of the Hollywood machine that features a female lead that is treated with respect and is presented to be just as capable as the men that dominate her world.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Nice action scenes, but the plot is cringeworthy: the cold war is over and dead.","While the film had great action scenes, and an interesting premise (Angelina Jolie as badass CIA agent) -- the problem is that the entire plot and story was written for a John McCain and Sarah Palin America, one where the continued escalation of tension between the US and Russia takes place.But since the NATO missile shield project has been scaled back, and since Obama and Medvedev & Putin have warmed up, and since the realization that the US and Russia are fighting on two fronts of the same war..... and oh yeah, the US and Russia just nonchalantly exchanged 12 Russian sleeper spies for a few US spies.... the entire premise of the movie's antagonists makes no sense.Unfortunately, the Cold War is over. And very dead.In other words, the plot premise is cringeworthy. The action scenes are pretty much the only redeeming factor, but it's still pretty hard to ignore the fact that all the bad guys are comical in either motivation or execution.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"A preposterous spy thriller, but a reasonably entertaining one","Ever since 2002, Hollywood has had a case of mistaken ""Bourne Identity,"" pulling the trigger on any script that weaves government Intelligence with guns and combat and centers on a protagonist who doesn't know his or her own strength. ""Salt"" is another byproduct of the ""Bourne"" era, yet barely executes half as well as that consummate secret agent thriller.Angeline Jolie plays the titular ""hero"" in question, a CIA agent. When she interrogates a Russian who claims a Soviet sleeper agent will attempt to assassinate the president of Russia, she finds the finger pointed at her as that exact agent and so she goes on the run, very quickly putting her innocence out of the question, whereas the film would lead you to believe it's a ""is she or isn't she?"" movie. Whenever that's the case, you can bet the answer lies in the gray area, but nevertheless, that's ""Salt.""Why movie scripts can't simply let go of old Cold War themes and plots warrants a rigorous head scratch. Writer Kurt Wimmer (""Law Abiding Citizen,"" ""Equilibrium"") has a history of penning films that are never as believable as they are entertaining and ""Salt"" follows suit. The idea of bitter ""comrades"" awakening sleeper agents 20 years later that they trained and planted in the USA in hopes of reigniting nuclear war might top his list of improbable.Yet ""Salt"" has a nuclear warhead in Angelina Jolie, Hollywood's most treasured femme fatale. When Tom Cruise left the project, she became the sexy choice and consequently might have saved a Cruise-led ""Salt"" from complete annihilation critically and financially.Philip Noyce (""Patriot Games,"" ""Clear and Present Danger"") could direct a film like this in his sleep and he may well have. I was able to watch the director's cut, which is insignificant when you don't see the theatrical cut, but I didn't find anything other than the action all that redeeming, so I imagine it made no difference. His expertise lies in flipping the adrenaline switch on and satisfying that part of every viewer that's just waiting for the action to kick into gear. It's very obvious when something will happen, but the results are less predictable than you'd expect.The real problem with ""Salt,"" preposterousness aside, comes in story structure. In order for the effective twists and turns at the end (not unforeseeable, but still exciting), Wimmer and Noyce both have to downplay Salt's character. Frankly, she sucks for most of the film. She's a terrible protagonist because -- without giving anything away -- the script's not-so-well guarded secrets are held in priority above her character development. Irrelevant flashbacks to her ""husband"" are an attempt at humanizing her, but her present actions become too strong for those sympathy cards to work.Espionage thriller and action movie fans will find comfort in ""Salt"" and continue to be drawn to Jolie's performances in these roles, but those who can't keep their fingers out of plot holes and have to ponder the feasibility of a story will be frustrated throughout most. For me, the twists at the end sorting the film out and making it ""matter"" more saved it from total mediocrity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jason Bourne in a skirt.,"Angelina Jolie is Jason Bourne in a skirt in this politically charged action thriller from director Philip Noyce. Jolie plays CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is revealed to be a Russian sleeper agent planted in the U.S. to carry out a plot called Day X. But have years of living the America way swayed her allegiance?If there's one thing I find even more puzzling than Angelina Jolie as a sex symbol (the gaunt face and puffy lip thing does nothing for me), it's her status as an action star: here, she is completely unconvincing as a highly trained special agent able to defeat countless enemy in unarmed combat, fall from great heights with nary a scratch, and leap from truck roof to truck roof on a busy freeway. Her slight frame looks as though it would smash on impact.Noyce conducts proceedings with an assured hand, and achieves a gritty realism to the violence, but the complete miscasting of his skeletal star and a number of action sequences that push plausibility to the limits make this a somewhat frustrating watch overall.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Predictable Bourne clone,"The problem with Angalina Jolie action films is that generally they she is better than the script and so the story goes again. 'Salt' tries to follow the Bourne route but without the charm or skill that the Bourne films had. Every scene is telegraphed and predicable with little to no suspense beyond the first 20 minutes. The story also comes over as completely daft which doesn't help.The acting is pretty standard, though I for some reason spent most of the film thinking 'doesn't Angalina look gaunt' which was a bit of a put off. Few of the other actors are given much to bite into, though Liev Schreiber does a good job playing her boss. The action scenes vary in quality with the occasional good idea. Generally though there is nothing that hasn't been done before or better in other films.I can't say I was much of a fan of the directing of cinematography. The camera work had the standard jerkiness that I have grown to hate over the years in action films and the editing doesn't really help. The music fits in OK and isn't particularly noticeable which is good and the set design is done well.Over all the film is a let down. Jolie is a good actress but not even she can save this very average film. Even though I have been very negative with this review, I didn't hate the film but I did feel that it could have been much much better. This film clings to a 6 out of 10 by its fingernails and probably should be a 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt ....even the Title is AWFUL,"Salt is a turn off from beginning to end. Anjelina is past it as an action heroine. Her credibility ended (if there was any doubt) with the movie 'Wanted'. The fight scenes in 'Salt' are WOEFUL and completely unbelievable even by Hollywood standards. The shots were TOO tight (as if trying to hide the fact the fact that choreography was RUBBISH)The plot (imagine Bourne meets Wanted) is irrelevant because you never believe Ms Jolie's character is credible. You feel like what it is, an Actor near the end of their career getting a quick pay day and they don't care if you know it. She doesn't even look good any more so the eye candy or Worthers Originals factor in Ms Jolies case can't carry a turkey of a movie like this any more.

"Lacking Logic, but Filled with Cool Action","It may have been a long Cold War, but Angelina Jolie is definitely quite hot. In Salt, Jolie does quite a bit of ass-kicking and also manages to give a good performance. Unfortunately, Jolie is unable to completely save Salt, which falls victim to the classic mistake of poor writing in the third act. Though it makes so little sense that it probably lowers one's IQ in the concise 99 minutes that it runs for, Salt makes for an enjoyable ride until the multi-twist finale that runs unnecessarily long.Salt is named after the title heroine, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie). Evelyn is happily married to her husband and enjoys a somewhat normal life as a CIA agent. And then one day she has a really bad day, one that rivals those that Jack Bauer manages to survive in ""24."" In an interrogation session, a Russian spy reveals a plot to assassinate the Russian Prime Minister, which is a part of an even larger plot to destroy the United States called ""Day X."" He also reveals that Evelyn is a Russian spy. Even though she claims this to be false, Evelyn stupidly decides to go on the run and murders quite a few people in the process. But is Evelyn really the person she seems to be? A great supporting cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber.Angelina Jolie is responsible for many of the reasons why parts of this film are successful. Salt was originally named for Edwin A. Salt and Tom Cruise was set to play him. After reading the script, Tom Cruise felt his character was too similar to Ethan Hunt, his other character from Mission: Impossible, and detached himself from the film. And it is a great thing that he did. Jolie plays her role with so much intensity and mystique, something that women in action films can rarely pull off. At her best, Jolie acts with ferocity and sexuality, and that is just what she does in Salt's slick action sequences.Unfortunately for Jolie, the story often falls flat. Although most action films (with the exception of movies like The Dark Knight and Inception) are not meant for people who are extremely smart, movies should still have a coherent and linear plot. Salt certainly lacks an understandable plot and, to make it worse, has absolutely no logic. The motivations are never clear for any character in the entire film and the plot twists around three too many times. It is obvious that Phillip Noyce, the director of two James Patterson adaptations, can stage a nice action sequence, but there has to be a stable plot to support a scene. Most of the time, Kurt Wimmer's mediocre script cannot support the intense action that unfolds on-screen. The last half hour of the film is so outlandish and unnecessary that it almost loses any respect from some audience members. Many viewers might not react positively to an ending that does not completely satisfy. (Note: A rumor is going around that a sequel is on its way.)At times, Salt is exactly what is should be: a nice diversion. But at other times, it is so extremely nonsensical that it proves detrimental to the movie's overall effect. Angelina Jolie does her best as Evelyn Salt and almost always succeeds in surprising the audience, but a so-so script sometimes weighs her performance down. Salt mainly suffers when its story begins to unravel in the final half hour. The ending, unfortunately, lacks a punch, but the first hour is still good enough to keep the viewer high on an adrenaline rush throughout the entire movie. Even though Salt is not nearly as good as it should have been, it still remains an enjoyable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angelina's Best Action Role To Date,"with a great performance to back it up.I don't consider myself a fan of Jolie's action flicks, but I surprisingly liked it. It's getting mixed reviews. There are some who are proclaiming it as one of the best action flicks of the year (Roger Ebert's 4 Star Review) and others who are saying it's just another mind-less action flick.The first 45 minutes are outstanding. They were written, acted, and directed on spot, in my opinion. There was mystery, action, thrills and chills. The second half gets more into the story, usually that would be a good thing. Here, it's not. It's writing moves way too fast, becomes preposterous, confusing and just downright sloppy at times. However the director does the best that he can and salvages some of the ridiculousness that comes with the second 45 minutes, with the help of a solid, consistent performance from Angelina Jolie.The cinematography, sets, visuals, sound all bring to the table to come out with a fine action thriller. If the script would've continued to develop it's characters and story I'd probably be giving it a higher score, but because of the second half I can't give it a glowing recommendation.

Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Salt,"Sitting down to watch Salt I was armed with the knowledge that it was an action movie and nothing more. And to that extent it did not disappoint. The plot flows well and unlike some action movies there is a story around which the action is based. It keeps you guessing as to what might be happening next but is also not hard to follow.Granted there are a few loopholes large enough to drive one of the many trucks that Jolie has a knack for jumping acrobatically onto through, sure the movie fulfils its quota for stereotypical Russians with coats, hats and vodka to boot and the character development is hardly going to blow you away but when I sat down I was not expecting the greatest action movie ever made just a good one.If you have a spare 100 minutes knocking about and are looking for something to entertain you then put this on, take it with a pinch of salt and enjoy.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just what you would expect from an action movie... maybe a little more.,"I was amused by this movie, but not impressed. It has plenty of gunfire, some good explosions, a few crashes, and some brutal beatings; the plot isn't totally boring and it had some decent acting, which is more than you can expect from a typical action movie, though the plot was a little predictable. The one thing that really bothers me about this movie is the lack of character development. All the characters seem hollow, with little or no insight into their history or personality. If the writers worked a little more on this, it would have done wonders for the script. I mean the just the espionage alone is cool and all, but if you had an emotional attachment, or some sort of relation to some of the characters - well that would be interesting to say the least. The good side to the lack of character development is after you see all the explosions and firefights, it does make you wonder ""Who is Salt?"" On the flip-side it also makes you wonder ""Do I even care?""I guess what I'm saying is the movie had the potential to be so much more than an action movie, but it isn't. But, with that said, it is a pretty good action movie. I can't say much more without getting into some detail so I'm going to sum up with a recommendation if you're into explosions and guns and such.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Salt is a worthwhile addition to the action genre and a must-see for fans of spy films,"I recently rewatched Salt (2010) on Hulu. The storyline follows an American special agent who is accused of being a Russian spy. She goes on the run from the government to clear her name and save her husband. As the story unfolds, we are left wondering if Salt could indeed be a Russian spy.Directed by Phillip Noyce (The Bone Collector), the film stars Angelina Jolie (Changeling), Liev Schreiber (Scream), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years A Slave), Daniel Olbrychski (The Promised Land), and Andre Braugher (The Mist).Every time I watch this movie, it feels a bit underrated within the action genre. It is a very smart spy film where you don't know the characters' intentions and ""whodunit"" as the storyline unfolds. The Russian grooming subplot is intriguing, and the flashback backstory interspersed with action scenes is well done. The action scenes themselves are top-notch, resembling a combination of Bond and Mission Impossible with shootouts, car chases, and fun stunts. The acting is elite and authentic, making it tough not to root for Jolie and Schreiber. The movie has entertaining twists and turns and a satisfying conclusion.In conclusion, Salt is a worthwhile addition to the action genre and a must-see for fans of spy films.

"Fair action movie, but still very unbelievable","I liked the action scenes in this movie, but quite a few of them were still just absurd. Angelina Jolie plays a CIA agent whom was secretly trained as a child to be a Russian spy. She is living in America waiting for the green light. First, why would Russia want to start a war with America in today's world. Simple, they wouldn't. This plot is more for the times during the Cold War decades ago. But overlook this, and then you have a petite Jolie, playing Salt, whom jumps off semis and lands on vans and hangs own and is able to over power about 4 guys in a police car and kick them out the car and use a stun gun to control the driver, and she is able to get up and walk out of a totaled car after going over a bridge. Not to mention her alone is about to get by security to get in the church during the funeral. It just starts to get silly and why at the end in the room under ground would all the glass be bulletproof yet the walls are not surrounded by steel. Instead Salt is able to blast her way through the sheet rock to get to the control panel. Don't buy that.FINAL VERDICT: Jolie is good but is given some silly things to do.

Who needs pepper when you've got Salt?,"Usher in another super-trained movie like ""The Bourne Identity,"" where the action is constant, over the top and swiftly moves from one kinetic reflex to the other with only a fraction of a second to think in between.Agent Salt (Jolie) works for the C.I.A. On her way out of a day's work with home life on her mind, a Russian defector walks in. Salt approaches with arms crossed while he's tested with high tech lie detectors and sophisticated fact checks. Without sending off any red flags, he tells a story about an elaborate training program designed to infiltrate the U.S. with Russian spies. It started with the assassination Kennedy, though this time the goal is to take out the Russian president. Is this guy loopy or just stuck in the Cold War days, or what? At the close, he names Evelyn Salt, his interrogator, as the spy. Her boss Ted (Liev Schreiber) vouches for her innocence, while the other head-honcho Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) plays it by the book and wants her in custody till things are cleared up. She can't get ahold of her loving husband Mike--a German national who got her out of a rut in North Korea two years earlier--and makes a break for it and goes on the run like ""The Fugitive"" meets a female version of ""XXX.""The action happens like a linear video game as it feels rehearsed and formulaic, than being unpredictable and truly challenging. Salt has an uncannily high level of intuition to the point of being God-like instead of some hundred-something-pound person made out of flesh and blood. She'll easily jump on and off high speeding trucks on the highway like she's Spider-Woman or her bones are grafted from steel. Taking an early leave off a moving subway train isn't a stretch, neither is getting into multiple car accidents without being the least bit phased. You're supposed to suspend your disbelief because they flash some credentials on a computer screen and talk about past training. It does have a constant traction forward with a thriller-like pacing as something is always at her disposal to use or manipulate.Salt's time on the run gets deeper and deeper and more and more conspiratorial. Tables get turned, traitors become uncovered and human lives are mowed through like freshly cut grass. Where audiences thought ""The Hunt for Red October"" was the last of its kind, we get pretty a spy popping up in real-life news stories after getting caught in the millennium. Though unintentional to capitalizing on the newly found panic, this picture never lets up from being a movie, one that's all about cinematic entertainment at its most primal element, enough to add twists and turns without confusion as the script could probably be read in a single visit to the loo. Getting the viewer to think is only incidental and not necessarily a direct result as everything is already laid out with suspenseful music, fast paced setups and quick edits; half the time Jolie puts on a stone-faced expression and the other is more exciting when she lets loose with a grimace. A large portion of the action in ""Salt"" is like a piece of toast that's smoothed over with butter but missing the crunch. As exaggerated as it is, the showdown it built up to was definitely a clencher and kept the thrills consistent to the very end instead of coping out with a typical wrapped-up Hollywood finish.

If you like this movie you're brain dead.....,"the good points.... nonethe bad points.... the film expects us to believe that the Russians have a plan based on sending a army of highly trained 6 year olds to infiltrate American security organisations and execute a plan to assassinate the president and to launch nuclear weapons against Muslim countries to enrage them and make them attack America. (of course when this full proof plan was hatched, there were no tensions between the Muslim countries and the West)The plan relied on the hope that while growing up, none of these highly trained 6 year olds would ever break their silence and maintain their cover as highly trained spies and stay fully focused on the mission of infiltrating the CIA and killing the president.

Thiz Salt Is Sweet!,"""The more we run, the more they chase"" is what happened to Evelyn Salt. Since Mat Damon's ""Bourne Identity"" (2002) which used more advance believability approach in runaway espionage tale, now everyone tries to become Bourne by running, jumping, shooting, fighting, car chasing, motorcycle chasing, you name it and it all happens in one action package. Some examples which also using the similar patterns recently are John Travolta's ""From Paris with Love"" (2009), Tom Cruise's ""Knight and Day"" (2010), Ashton Kutcher's""Killers"" (2010) and now it's the time for Jolie. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who is wrongly accused as a Russian spy and now she has to clear her name by finding the invisible enemy. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind ""The Bone Collector"" in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is filled with twists and turns, even sometimes the story just goes by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is uniqueness of the plots! The story effectively draws our curiosity. It is success to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is just like releasing the fish into water, it's simply what she does best. Jolie is still in the spotlight, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and strict boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it's simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies nowadays. One thing for sure, Jolie is back with some killing moves to remind us that she is still one of the favorite action heroines in our time.

"Stupid, stupid, stupid","Guess what? My cat sprouted wings and flew up into the sky, eventually landing on the moon and starting a whole new population of space cats. That's about as believable as the ridiculous plot in this movie. Occasionally an action movie is interesting enough that it is worth suspending belief a bit. I accept that. ""Salt,"" however, doesn't just bend believability, it folds it into and throws it in the trash can. Gee, a single (though really hot) woman can outwit and outfight everybody in the CIA, Secret Service, KGB, Washington, D.C., police and anyone else standing in her way.

well-cast but nothing special addition to the genre,"When an interrogated Russian defector accuses her of being a sleeper agent, capable, seemingly loyal CIA operative Jolie finds herself on the run with fellow operatives Schreiber and Ejiofor in dogged pursuit, and she's forced to use her many skills to try and prove her innocence before all hell can break loose. Whether she's guilty or not isn't really relevant as the purpose here is throwing out as many death-defying stunts and fatal escapes as possible, many of which are coincidental and improbable despite how admittedly fun they are to watch. Regardless of all the hype this standard espionage thriller doesn't add up to very much, and slickly allows little time to ask questions about the stability of the plot, but Jolie is true to form making it more watchable than it otherwise would've been. **",,Anonymous,Mystery

Hollywood Russophobia,"According to one story, Angelina Jolie was once asked if she would consider playing a Bond girl, but replied that she was more interested in playing James Bond himself. Lara Croft, her character in the ""Tomb Raider"" films, is essentially a Jane Bond figure, with a bit of Indiana Joan mixed in, and in ""Salt"" she gets another chance to play a secret agent in an action film. The screenplay, in fact, was originally written with a male protagonist named Edwin Salt, with the intention that he should be played by Tom Cruise. Cruise, however, pulled out, fearing that the character was too similar to his Ethan Hunt in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, and Salt underwent a sex change and was renamed Evelyn. (The use of a sexually ambiguous Christian name- think of Evelyn Waugh- may have been a deliberate hint at the character's male origins.)Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is ""outed"" as a Russian double agent by a defector. (In a dramatic coup de cinéma, this revelation occurs during an interrogation being carried out by Salt herself). The defector alleges that Salt is part of a Russian plot to infiltrate the United States by using English-speaking sleeper agents trained from childhood. He also alleges that she intends to assassinate the Russian President at the funeral of the American vice president, who has recently died. Salt protests her innocence, but is arrested by her CIA colleagues. She succeeds, however, in escaping from custody and goes on the run, fearful for the life of her husband. I won't attempt to summarise the further twists and turns of the plot as, in common with most modern spy thrillers, this one is extremely convoluted. The questions which remain to be answered are (i) Is Salt really a Russian agent? (ii) Does she really intend to kill the Russian President or to protect him? and (iii) Are there any other Russian sleepers in high places?Much of the action is implausible; Salt seems to possess a preternatural ability to outwit her adversaries and to escape from the most desperate situations without a scratch, but in the context of an action thriller film, especially within the spy genre, this sort of implausibility is not really a drawback as such films are not normally aiming at realism. One would have to be very naïve, for example, to imagine that the Bond films give a genuinely accurate picture of the abilities of the average MI6 agent. There are, however, a couple of more serious faults. There are a number of plot holes; it is not really made clear why Salt goes on the run, and her motivation at other points in the film remains obscure.The film is also a good example of Hollywood Russophobia. Tinseltown likes to pride itself on its liberalism, but can be surprisingly conservative in this respect. I sometimes think that American film producers are living in some sort of alternative reality in which the Berlin Wall never fell, the Soviet Union survived into the twenty-first century and the Cold War is still continuing. This tendency was particularly marked in the 1990s in films like ""Crimson Tide"", ""GoldenEye"", ""The Peacemaker"", ""Air Force One"", and ""Fair Game"", all of which featured Russian villains; when they weren't spies they were gangsters or renegade Army officers. ""The Sum of All Fears"" is a post-2000 example. ""Salt"", however, is even more conservative than any of those films; it came out as recently as 2010 but could have been made, with only a few changes to the plot, in the fifties, sixties or seventies. (""Telefon"" from 1977 has a rather similar plot involving Soviet sleeper agents).I have never cared for Phillip Noyce's previous collaboration with Angelina Jolie, ""The Bone Collector"", but he is generally a competent director of thrillers, with the likes of ""Dead Calm"" and ""Patriot Games"" to his credit, and she is one of the more charismatic female stars currently working in the industry. That the film is able to rise above all its plot-holes and its spy-thriller clichés is largely down to his skill as a director and her charisma. The plot may be preposterous, yet it is also ingenious, and Noyce and Jolie made it fast-moving and entertaining enough to keep me watching, For all its flaws ""Salt"" was a film which, overall, I enjoyed, which is why it gets an above-average mark. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I constantly wanted to leave but it was hot in my apartment so I stayed and also because I didn't feel like going to bar and being insulted by unemployed chicks that believe in the trash Hollywood thinks we like but in reality hate. I was hoping for some intellectual intrigue but instead was delivered a pointlessly flip flopping plot to the point where I didn't even try to understand or give it the respect to care what I missed.

Guilty as charged(?),"At least with pleasure. Guilty pleasure that is. If you into this expecting class as in ""The Fugitive"" than you are in for a big disappointment. This is nowhere near that movie. And it is only closely related of course. While ""Salt"" was supposed to be played by a male, I am happy that A. Jolie got that role and made it her own. It still does not diffuse from the fact, that the script is weak at best!But what is not weak, is the action choreography. It is shot very nicely. So if you are looking for a movie to pass the time, with enough tension and suspense, with a great lead actress, you could do worse than choose this movie. But if you are looking for depth of character than rent the Harrison Ford movie. The character bits here feel strangely forced and almost feel like annoying bits between the action.

A tight espionage thriller...,"I remember when this one came out it got a lot of very mixed reviews. It has finally made it to the small screen and so I thought I'd have a look. It's certainly not as bad as some have said, but equally, it's not all that great either. I think it suffers from what I call the 'Bourne Effect', in that the 'Bourne' films are a pretty hard act to follow and just about every film of that ilk since has failed to hit the mark. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly watchable but it just falls a bit short of the mark at those all important moments. Here's a brief summary.Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is accused by a defector, known as Orlov, of being a Russian spy. She immediately goes on the run trying to get to he husband, Mike, who she believes is in danger. The defector also said that she would assassinate the Russian President at a funeral in New York. Her boss, Ted Winter, and the head of another department, Peabody, are in charge of tracking her down but she gives them the slip more than once. She has a plan and in order to carry it out she may have to compromise herself. I'm not going to say any more because I don't want a sniper picking me off while I'm eating a sandwich.First of all I must say all of the stunt work on this film was first rate, I really enjoyed this aspect of the film very much. Performance wise, I thought Angelina Jolie did a great job as Evelyn Salt, considering the part was originally written for a male (Tom Cruise), I thought she was excellent. Liev Schreiber did a good job as Ted Winter, as did Chiwetel Ejiofor as Peabody and Daniel Olbrychski as Orlov.There are many twists and turns in the plot and, of course, a big twist at the end that I'm afraid I saw coming from a mile off (sorry, no spoilers today). There were a couple of moments where the film did fall a little flat, but the pace was pretty much kept at a fairly high level throughout. I guess where it fails, in comparison with the 'Bourne' films, is that the plot just isn't quite clever enough to give it the edge it needed. But as I said earlier, it's perfectly watchable and suitably entertaining. I also like the fact that it has a female lead that is believable, so many of these films fail in that respect too. So, over all, great action sequences, a believable heroine and quite entertaining, if slightly flawed Still though, recommended.My Score: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Salt, is great like pepper.","Another great Summer blockbuster. The funny thing about this movie is that this movie came out during when the whole Russian Spy's in America were captured in real life. Anyways besides that funny fact, this movie was simply awesome. It was truly Jolie's comeback, even though she really didn't take a break from acting, I'm just saying it is her comeback to a leading role in an action flick. The movies focus was on the feud and history between Russia and America, which is a topic people still talk about. It is one of those movies that sort of explains how Russia feels about America. It also deals with nuclear power, and what would go on in a situation of that power.It is quite a confusing movie, but you start to understand as the movie progresses. This movie is a type of movie where you think one thing is going to happen but something else occurs. It is also in a certain way a who done type deal. The characters can also confuse you. The one character that you don't know what they are thinking is definitely Jolie's character. You can't tell whether she is a spy or not, she does one thing that makes her seem evil, but then it turns into a good thing.This movie reminded me a whole lot like the Bourne movies because of the action and suspense and a mix of the actual feud between America and Russians. Anyways 4 out of 5 stars for this summer blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not quite Bourne with boobs, but almost.","(This is a review of the Unrated Director's Cut of Salt. I haven't seen the original theatrical version or the Extended Cut.)Salt is a fun spy/action movie. It had lots of exciting scenes, a credible action actress, and at times, it's downright thrilling. It even had me guessing at what direction it was going, at a few points. Salt is also derivative of lots of other movies. Primarily the Bourne series and the Mission Impossible movies, but also the Bond films, Tom Clancy's series, and The Manchurian Candidate. It didn't bother me much that Salt borrowed liberally from so many other films. As they say, there's nothing new under the sun. The one real issue that I did have with Salt was that the last part of the movie tries to be entirely too clever, and loses a lot of its credibility and falls apart, as a result. But, as I can't really go too much into that without spoiling the whole film, I'll just content myself to saying that while I didn't really like the turn the movie took towards the finale, it wasn't enough to ruin the movie for me.I love Angelina Jolie in these kinds of roles. She's a born action star, and there are very few actresses who would have been as successful in this role as she was. She almost makes you believe that her character could beat the crap out of and outsmart every other police officer, agent, and soldier that she came across, without missing a beat. It seemed like she did most (if not all) of her own stunts and (brutal) fight scenes, and given the fact that she had just given birth to twins a few months before, I was beyond impressed.The ending completely leaves itself open for sequels, and I'd love to see Jolie return for the role. All we need is a story that doesn't lose itself in shennanigans that would feel right at home in an over-the-top spy movie from the 60's, and we could have a really solid franchise on our hands.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angelina Jolie entertainingly kicks butt in her latest movie Salt,"Okay, I've just seen the Angelina Jolie movie Salt in which she plays the title character with the first name of Evelyn.

Along with Winter, she's also pursued by someone named Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor). She also has a husband to worry about not to mention the Russian president and the U.S. one, too. Okay, all I want to say now is what an exciting picture this is what with all the chases and killings and the pulse-pounding score and when the end comes, all I could thing of is, ""Maybe there'll be a sequel.""

Stunning Jolie slums it well in tight thriller,"Salt, a spy movie about a CIA agent who may or may not actually be a Soviet agent, is a heck of a lot better than others in its genre. It has a lot of pulse-quickening action, astounding stunt work, and a semiplausible plot. Oh, and someone named Angelina Jolie to do all the requisite butt-kicking.There have been plenty of psychological thrillers in which the protagonist is double crossed, then triple crossed, and so on until the audience quite literally has no idea who's on what side or who's doing what to whom - it's sort of an entertainment by obfuscation. Sleight of hand. It's when the director tries hard to confuse the bejeezus out of everyone, the better to disguise a thin plot and cardboard acting.But that isn't true here. Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA analyst who's accused - from the get-go - of being a sleeper spy, by a Russian attempting to defect. Naturally, our gal Evelyn bolts the CIA and goes on the run. But unlike other movies, where the balance of the plot would be devoted to her finding the Real Bad Guys and Righting Wrongs and Clearing Her Name, this film keeps us guessing: Is Salt really a preprogrammed spy with the goal of assassinating the visiting Russian president? Her CIA boss (Liev Shrieber) and the head of counterintelligence (Chiwetel Ejiofor) dash off to New York to catch her, and she eludes them at every step. And all the while, we're not sure if she's a good guy or a bad guy, or a good guy with bad intentions, or perhaps a good guy with a shady past.And although the ending isn't neat and tidy, it's also not implausible, another hallmark of run-of-the-mill spy thrillers. It's refreshing.Angelina Jolie has shown time and time again that she supersedes all of those preconceived ideas of pretty actresses. She's beautiful, yes, but she's also a very gifted actress. It's in full evidence here, as her Salt dons numerous disguises that really do a good job of hiding her amazing looks. Lesser actresses would wilt under the pressure of, you know, actually performing as opposed to being gawked at, but Jolie flourishes. And she has some serious action-movie chops, too! Apparently, she did her own stunts, and she's simply electrifying. It's easy to believe that her role was originally written for a male lead - what in Hollywood isn't? - but it's hard to imagine many top-shelf actors doing as much with the role as Jolie does here. As with the best actors, Jolie can do a lot with the slightest bit of movement or expression. She is mesmerizing and tremendous.She's ably supported by Shrieber and Ejiofor, and although neither character is particularly fleshed out, neither, too, is obvious and shallow. So, good script from Kurt Wimmer.Oh, sure, there's a spot midway through the movie where you begin to consider the possibilities of what Salt's up to, where the script's headed, and you figure out what the big twist at the end is going to be. Or maybe I just got lucky. Probably the biggest obstacle that writers of psychological thrillers face is the plot corner, where they've made things so intricate that they can't write themselves out of their own traps. Here, there are only a few possible outcomes, so it's not too tough to figure out what will eventually happen - the trick is that Noyce and Wimmer make getting to that eventuality a rough, perilous journey.All in all, Salt is the kind of movie that, say, Eagle Eye or Repo Men or State of Play or even Knight and Day wish they were. It's expertly directed by Noyce, who also has given us Patriot Games and the overlooked Rabbit Proof Fence and features a powerful performance by Angelina Jolie. Oh, and in case there was any doubt, it's sequel-ready.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Cold War: Part Deux,"I really don't believe one should look for logic or credibility in SALT, a film with an incredible pace and with enough twists and turns to easily screw the viewer's mind off, but luckily and successfully I kept attached to the whirling scenes of gunfire, car chases, explosions and gung-ho fighting. Angelina Jolie plays a straight-faced, ice-cold, uber- professional secret agent who's a wild horse struck by accusations of being a Russian mole - which she is. Or is she? Whatever you may crave from this one the film seems to take an alternate turn on the dramatics, and although there are clichés that comes on a string, it didn't tire me out because I knew that the film would just as soon as being knocked down, rise to its feet and continue relentlessly. Many people find mindless action-thrillers to be stupid, but one can't claim so when the film seems fully aware of being so itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent action spy thriller,"I've said it before and I'm saying it again. Angelina Jolie is the only believable action superstar that also happens to be a woman. She simply has the capacity and the sheer presence to sell us all these roles without in any way taking away from the badassery because of her gender. Quite often we see action movies with female leads that have been watered down because they tried to emphasize the femininity of the character. And that's simply not what we want from a classical action movie.Not Jolie though. Her characters are badasses without any doubt. Oh sure, there are touches here and there that show she's a woman - she's not trying to be more masculine than she normally is - but they're so minimal and so natural that they feel believable. There's no forcing in her performance, it's just who she is.Aside from that Salt also succeeds in its action scenes and its central story, which is over the top and more than a bit silly, I admit, but so are most beloved action classics. It's the serious execution, with just the right amount of tongue in cheek, that makes these kinds of films work and in that regard Salt succeeds beautifully.I'm really hoping they will make a sequel for this, because it's a really good action film with a great leading actress.

Good action,"Many reviewers here have stated that this movie isn't realistic because 'Salt doesn't get bruised enough' or 'no one her size could...' Have these people ever been to an action movie before? NO ACTION MOVIE IS REALISTIC. They are all written to be over-the-top because that's what makes them entertaining. We suspend disbelief to enter the world of the action-hero (or heroine) and we go along for the thrilling ride that is sometimes so over-the-top it's ridiculous! But that's what makes it fun. If action movies were realistic, they would be slow and boring. This movie does not cross the line anymore than any other action movie.Salt delivers exactly what is promised -- a solid 100 minutes of action. It keeps you watching, it keeps you guessing (even when it turns out you were right in some cases), and it entertains from start to finish. If you like the action movie genre, chances are you will enjoy this movie.As for the reviewers who criticized the way Russians are portrayed, the action genre plays to comic book-like caricatures. The villains are no more realistic than the heroine! This isn't a documentary! If you like action movies, give Salt a go. Angelina won't disappoint.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Leaves a ""salty"" taste in your mouth","As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt's efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: ""Who Is Salt?"" All i have to say about this mess is ""Jolie decides to be an action hero and studio executives liked the idea so they blew over 100 million dollars to make Jolie look good"".

Three word review,"Predictable. Formulaic. Enjoyable.This was a fun film. While I pretty much had the story figured out by about 20 minutes in, I enjoyed myself. Jolie as beautiful as always and does a good job with the role. The quick cuts during the action scenes had me wondering if her character wast actually capable of some of the feats she performed though.Liev Schreiber is OK too, though he is playing a part I've seen him in more than once. I fear he may become typecast.Still, there is a lot to like here for pure popcorn fun. I never found myself bored, and this is a good one for a DVD rental and some mostly mindless fun.My three word review: Predictable. Formulaic. Enjoyable.Nothing objectionable for the kids in this one. I am not ever sure why it is PG-13 instead of PG. No scenes of sex, no blood or real language.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The worm can turn, a typical Jolie action film,","An action film with Angelina Jolie totally dominating the cast. This movie is fast moving with few special effects other than fast robust believable stunts, well filmed and spliced. The storyline is a bit worn however Jolie and the supporting cast do their job well to produce a watchable film. Set in the American Capitol an in-deep Russian Agent is simmering for her chance of revenge. On whom I will not say. The twist in this film is predictable though and holds a message to those who watch it that the worm can turn. I like almost all of Angelina Jolie's films so I am a bit prejudiced when I say it is a seven star action movie, Worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly effective action film,"Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is happily married to spider expert Michael Krause (August Diehl) and is working for the CIA. When a mysterious Russian is picked up named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski), Salt interrogates him and he names her as being an undercover Russian spy. Salt's friend and co-worker Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) is sceptical but Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) wants to detain her and question her. Salt manages to escape the building and goes on the run with the two in pursuit. As Salt flees her pursuers, and leaves carnage in her path, Winter and Peabody gradually learn more of Salt's past and must protect the visiting Russian President who they believe Salt has been sent to assassinate.Action films are generally quite boring. They are very limited in terms of storyline and are always running the risk of doing something that has been done a million times before. The 'new wave' of action films such as the excellent Jason Bourne films, and even the James Bond re-boot have managed to combine generic action characteristics with a certain grit, and therefore injecting new life into the genre. Salt manages to achieve this not in it's action scenes, but in the fact that the main character just may be a bad guy. It's like the revelation in No Way Out but played out with explosions, hand-to-hand combat, and surprisingly violent deaths.Okay, f**k it, Salt is a Russian spy. It's revealed early on so I'm not really ruining much. This fact just makes the whole film better. She isn't fighting to protect the innocent, she is fighting in order to ignite a potentially catastrophic war between Russia and the U.S., killing the Presidents of both countries along the way. I was so surprised and delighted with this brave decision that I found myself rooting for Salt, and wanting to achieve her goal. The action scenes themselves are as well choreographed and filmed as you would hope, in that shaky hand-held Bourne vein. A lot of people have complained about it, but I like it - I want to feel the pace and confusion of a fight and I feel it helps place you there. And for a 12-rated film, I was shocked to see Salt smash a bottle on a table and then repeatedly stab someone in the neck with it. Again, delighted.Yes, it is far-fetched and a tad silly, but it's a bloody action film. Character actors Schreiber and Ejiofor are always reliable and are great in their scenes, and Diehl (of Inglorious Basterds fame) catches the eye in what is a relatively small role. Even though it does fly off the handle in the last twenty minutes or so, this is a solid little action film, and was a genuine surprise given I was expecting a generic and average shoot 'em up. It's also nice to see director Noyce back on track, given the debacle that was The Bone Collector and The Saint.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tense and Exciting, But Uneven","At a first glance, Salt may seem like another run-of-the-mill action thriller. However, it is much more than that. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, an agent of the CIA who is outed for being a Russian spy out to kill the U.S. president. The movie features Oscar-worthy sound effects and some surprisingly tense scenes. Jolie delivers one of the most sizzling performances of the year as a woman dedicated to her husband and job but holding many intriguing secrets. Her performance and the script prevent the film from being anything resembling a completely boring slog. There are still some flaws with the film. Action sequences involving trucks and buildings border on implausible, and the ending feels very forced, predictable, and uneven. Plot twists can be predictable and overwhelming. Overall, Salt is a multifaceted story that is well-acted and reasonably entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly brilliant overall thriller,"This is the best blue ray movie anyone can get in the spy genre!Angelina Jolie did most of the stunts herself which can be seen to add realism with natural lighting in many outdoor scenes. Is it better than 'Quantum of Solace', you betcha! Is it better than 'Bourne Supremacy' sequels, absolutely!The movie starts with a very simple scene where Angelina is brought back from capture as a prisoner. Seems simple enough to follow but when things goes wrong, Angelina put all her training into action which translates to a lot of credible action. I don't remember many James Bond movies having these kind of believability except for 'Casino Royale'. Sound effects are excellent for anyone with full surround system. Overall, it is an impressive movie.SALT is every bit as exciting as the fantastic 'Limitless' and the original 'Bourne Supremacy' with gripping tension!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Poor,"The movie was lame, very predictable. Jolie over acts, and I find her annoying. She is over exposed. Maybe a different cast could have saved this, who knows. Go see something else. Although predictable, it leaves some things unclear, as to her being in the White House especially. Many action scenes are violent but everyone is unscratched, to keep it to a PG-13 rating. I have no objection, then perhaps less violence and more brain work could have done this. A movie for the young for sure, and die hard Jolie fans who would watch anything she does.

Like a lot of action films it's filled with a lot of ridiculous set-pieces but to its credit it is fast-paced and entertaining,"A Russian defector enters the CIA Headquarters and proceeds to tell CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) that he has intelligence suggesting that the Russian president is going to be assassinated on US soil. Curious to know more she interrogates the man, but when he divulges that the person who will carry out the assassination is none other than Evelyn Salt herself Evelyn panics and insists that the man is lying. However, the defector passes the CIA's lie detector test and the CIA become suspicious of Evelyn. Realising that her colleagues don't believe her she goes on the run whilst at the same time trying to track her husband down whom she also believes may be in danger...Working from a script by Kurt Wimmer director Phillip Noyce clearly knew that he was forced to work around a fairly generic narrative with Salt; yes you could argue that there are red herrings in the story and the odd twist and turn here and there but the main components of the story aren't terribly original.Perhaps that's why Noyce chose to not get too bogged down with unnecessary exposition and needless sub-plots and focused on injecting the film with a fast-pace and plenty of action sequences (which is what I suspect that most audiences look for in an action film). Salt is a chase picture of sorts and thankfully that's exactly what it feels like and this is the main component that drives the film forward at a lightning pace. It's fair to say that Noyce gets a bit carried away with the action and seems to throw realism out of the door a lot of the time - Angie's antics (particularly on the freeway with the trucks are so far removed from reality that it almost makes her seem superhuman). The action clichés extend further in that the bad guys always miss and Angie always hits which would normally be a problem for me, but the film moves along so quickly that I was never really given the opportunity to allow for this to become a problem (I only thought about it afterwards tbh).As well as being fast-paced, slick and entertaining the film also benefits from a very good turn from Angelina Joile - she's a diverse actress whom I feel doesn't always get the recognition that she deserves - I've always felt that she's more than just a pretty face.For action-junkies this is a must see (despite Noyce over-staging the action sequences on numerous occasions). The story is reasonably good, it moves at a lightning pace and you get to see Angelina Jolie kick a load of butt and show off her lovely pins now and again. What more could you ask for?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It's not perfect, but it's one the year's more ambitious films.","This weekend, I got out to see Salt, a recent Summer action flick.In the film, Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a woman working for the Central Intelligence Agency, who is happily married to a German arachnologist. But Salt's world is turned upside down once a mysterious Russian man walks into the offices of the CIA with information. He states that Salt is a double agent for the Russians. This leads to steadily, and swiftly raising paranoia, none the least of which from fellow agent Ted Winters (Played by Liev Schreiber), and ONCIX agent, Peabody (Played by Chiwetel Ejofor). Salt proclaims she is innocent, but actions later in the movie seem to imply otherwise. Serious deceptions begin to cloud many serious truths, initiating a chain of events that places Russia, and the United States on a course of self destructive collisions.The plot of this movie is... kind of predictable, to be honest, and on top of that, a little reminiscent. You can kind of think it as a cross between The Fugitive, and the Bourne Identity, with a woman in the lead role normally played a man. There are lots of obvious Boom, boom, bangs! Gunfights, fistfights, car chases, and a couple of over the top, yet strangely awesome death scenes (Which of course, I won't go into detail about). But the movie is actually fun in its simplicity. The action is well staged, fast paced, pretty impressive, and expertly choreographed. It does help the movie.As does the cast. First bit of praise here goes to Jolie, who continues to prove that not only can she be a pretty capable dramatic actress, but she still knows a thing or two about how to be a sexy badass action star, and carries the film pretty damn well, might I add. Although, I could possibly imagine some people taking her performance for granted, simply because she only makes it look so easy. The rest of the cast such as Schreiber, Ejofor, and Daniel Olbrychski are pretty top notch.However, I must stress that Salt is a far from perfect movie. I think director Phillip Noyce could have seriously worked out some of the flaws of the movie, maybe even working some kinks out of Kurt Wimmer's script. Some things in the story feel pretty rushed, but it's balanced out by the good things about the movie, the last of which being the techs. The film's technical crew, such as DP Robert Elswit, film editors Stuart Baird and John Gilroy, Stunt coordinators Simon Crane and Wade Eastwood, and Sound Mixers Jeffrey Haboush, Scott Millan, Greg Russell and William Sarokin did their jobs fantastically.Simply put, I think I've found what will be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of the year. It's predictable, but the action is fun, and pacing is fast. And Angelina Jolie on her own, makes the movie worth a look.I give Salt **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Needs a little pepper to balance out the high sodium content otherwise it's a serviceable action flick for the masses,"Who is Salt? Is she an operative CIA agent or a KGB spy sent by the Russians? This question probably doesn't matter after you walked out of the cinema hall as you are likely unable to recall much of anything else besides the fact that Salt is just another relentless action flick that stars one of the hottest movie star in Hollywood right now, Angelina Jolie Voight or add a Pitt to it if you wish.Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a CIA officer who is being accused of being an undercover Russian spy by a defector. So what is Salt going to do to prove her innocence? She runs. You hear that right, she runs away from cops and her fellow colleagues including Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and William Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) in addition to the boggling fact that she is being 'activated' to assassinate the President of Russia. But her priority on hand is to look for her missing arachnologist husband. Thus begin the continuous action pieces that will make any respectable action star proud and for this reason alone, you might chose to forgive Kurt Wimmer's implausible writing.Eerily similar to ""The Bourne Identity"" franchise, ""Salt"" relies heavily on its high-octane action sets although discarding any good narrative treatment seen in the former. Its Bourne + that Bond from MGM meets The Fugitive meet the combination of Tomb Raider and Mission Impossible. But this is what you get if you hire Kurt Wimmer for the gig, the latter who came up with ""Ultraviolet"" and last year, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is not renowned for any subtly or hefty Tom Clancy's sort of conspiracies. Instead what you get is an undercover brainwashed operation initiate by the Russia to send their agents to penetrate the soil of the United States so as to await orders to strike at the right time.As a customised star vehicle for Jolie (for the record ""Salt"" was initially offered but turned down by Tom Cruise who found it too much akin to his Mission Impossible series and subsequently the role was rewritten to fit Jolie) and a product for the summer blockbuster slate, ""Salt"" definitely fits the bill. Director Phillip Noyce who returns to the studio arena after a number of years helming independent flicks proved he is still an adept hand in crafting a big-budgeted Hollywood summer flick. The old-school Australian helmer who is renowned for his political-charged action thrillers, ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" delivers the goods at ease and with the help of stunt choreographer Simon Crane and veteran editor Stuart Baird, the collision and explosion gets bigger with each setup not forgetting the dizzy, frenetic editing. Smoke bomb, a DIY bazooka and even a pair of undies is utilized by Salt to make her exit. The props department should deserve some credit at the next Academy Awards for the latter.The main star herself, Angelina Jolie was listed on IMDb for performing most of her own stunts. Watching her leaping from the roofs of moving vehicles, jumping from train, riding furiously on a stolen bike and dangling in an elevator shaft, at least you know the lady is worth every damn nickel on her million dollars paycheck. This is a star movie that practically sells on Jolie's charisma and face alone (just look at the poster for proof) and it works big time. Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor both respectively good actors are left on the sideline with the occasional bickering scenes that doesn't actually require an ounce of acting muscle from the duo.Despite a half-baked espionage plot that involves the what, Cold War? What's that for the younger generation? And a story that twists and turns without much of a satisfactory conclusion, the movie succeeds with its flawless chase sequences, marathon stuntwork and a gutsy leading lady. DC comics, you know who you should call for a Wonder Woman.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Angelina Jolie is Agent Salt, and that is all that matters","¨My name is Evelyn Salt.¨ Salt isn't your smart, suspenseful typical thriller, it isn't The Bourne Identity, it simply is a mindless blockbuster action film starring one of the best action stars of our decade: Angelina Jolie. Yes, I said best action star, and perhaps in a couple of decades she will be staring in a female version of The Expendables. Jolie is fun to watch on screen and we can't seem to take our eyes off her and that is why we went to go see this movie in the first place because I doubt anyone went into this picture expecting a smart film when they heard Kurt Wimmer wrote the original screenplay, the man who brought us Ultraviolet. Director, Phillip Noyce worked with Angelina Jolie in the past with The Bone Collector, before she had become such a huge star, and he is also known for directing Tom Clancy movies such as Clear and Present Danger. The problem with Salt is that Wimmer is no Clancy and the plot is pretty ridiculous, but what saves him is that Jolie is a pretty dependable star and we want to believe pretty much anything she does. Angelina seems to be in pretty good shape as she runs for the entire 100 minutes and jumps from bridges, moving vehicles, elevator shafts, and helicopters. She is able to single handedly outrun the CIA, FBI, and whoever stands in her way, and can even get past White House security. When you have so many absurd situations and plot holes the best thing you can do is rely on Jolie to jump from one mind numbing scene to another.Angelina Jolie is Salt, a CIA agent who won the respect of her colleagues after suffering as a prisoner in North Korea without giving away any information. Her boss, Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber), rescues her by exchanging her for another prisoner. Salt's husband Mike (August Diehl) is the reason why she's still alive because the CIA had made it clear they would sacrifice her for the greater good, but his insistence pays off and Salt is forever indebted to him. Twelve years later, on her anniversary, a Russian man comes to the agency saying he has crucial information. His name is Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) and Salt has to interrogate him. He tells her a story about an organization called ¨Day X¨ that's destined to destroy the United States. He claims that a powerful man has trained a group of kids to infiltrate the country and pass as Americans, but they are actually Russian spy's who will attack on Day X. One of these spies will kill the Russian President, and her name is Evelyn Salt. Winter doesn't believe these claims, but Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) says he has to arrest her. Salt argues she isn't a spy, but she is worried about her husband and decides to escape knowing that her actions might remove all doubts about her being a spy. From this point on the film became a high speed chase which is a relief because the plot was going downhill and our mind needed to be diverted.I thought the movie was going to completely lose me in the first 15 minutes when Orlov showed up and the plot was unfolded. The ¨Day X¨ organization seemed completely ridiculous and I was hating the movie, but after the action began at least my mind was distracted and I was entertained with the chase scenes. Jolie made the otherwise ridiculous movie entertaining. There was plenty of action and the movie could be enjoyed simply as a blockbuster movie, but don't expect an intelligent thriller, and keep your mind off the plot and the ridiculous twists. Liev Schreiber and Ejiofor were decent in their supporting roles and did what they could with the terrible script. The only reason why I enjoyed this movie and had fun was because of Angelina Jolie who is a bankable action star, but if you happen not to be a fan of her work then I guarantee you will hate this film. This is one of those movies you enjoy seeing once, but probably wouldn't want to watch again. It is a fun, but forgettable blockbuster action movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An action movie does have to have a certain element of plausibility to it at least to set up the story before taking us on a ride. There is something weird about Roger Ebert's 4 star rating .

"""Salt"" is everything the TV spots and commercials promise it to be.","When venturing into the movie theater with my girlfriend Ashley last night, I actually didn't know what to think of ""Salt."" I mean from the television spots and trailers, the movie looked like it would be a decent action flick so I was kinda 50/50 on seeing this one. I am normally not a huge fan of Angelina Jolie, I am not saying she is a bad actress but I just don't think she lives up to all the hype that surrounds her. With that being said, my girlfriend thinks Angelina is ""awesome"" so I figured this would be an interesting film to have a debate on the drive home. So without further delay, I begin my review of ""Salt.""""Salt"" tells the story of CIA Agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), whose life seems perfect despite her troubled past. The movie starts off showing Salt happily married and enjoying her job working for the CIA. One day, there is a security breach at the agency. It turns out the breach was done by a Russian man, who was sent there to inform the CIA of a Russian spy who has infiltrated the CIA. This Russian man claims the the spy's name is Evelyn Salt. This is where the fun begins as Salt must do everything she can to prove she isn't a spy or is she? Lots of action ensues...Let me start off my saying this...if you have seen the trailers or television spots for ""Salt"" than you know exactly what to expect from the film. ""Salt"" delivers on everything it promises from its advertisements. It's an action packed film that definitely delivers on the action. With that being said, if you think ""Salt"" offers anything fresh and new to the action genre, well I tell you now, it doesn't. My problem with ""Salt"" is just that. The storyline was extremely predictable and within the first 10 minutes I already figured out where the film was going. The action is intense and well delivered, however, like most action films most scenes are extremely far fetched and unbelievable. There is nothing about ""Salt"" that really makes it stick out from other action films besides the actors. At many times with the scenes shown in the film, you also feel like your watching ""Die Hard"" or ""Taken"" but with Angelina Jolie in the drivers seat so to speak.When watching the film, you as the audience member are entertained all the way through, which I give the film a lot of credit for. The problem is ""Salt"" requires you to really turn your brain off in order to truly enjoy it. Again, I guess that's typical nowadays from Hollywood action films. After viewing ""Salt,"" I now see why so many people have raved about ""Inception"" because that was a film that was action packed, thought provoking, and truly made you think. Nolan somehow created a film that even though it was fiction, it almost felt like it could happen in reality. In ""Salt"" all belief must be suspended in order to truly appreciate the film.Angelina Jolie throws on her normal action woman skills here. I can't say Jolie really shows off her acting chops here. If you want to see Jolie truly act, you have to check out her drama roles. They are the roles that truly show off her talent. In this film, she is just a kick ass woman. Think of Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"" and mix it with Liam Neeson's character in ""Taken"" and you pretty much have Salt. Liev Schreiber, who despite being a jerk in real life, is actually a great actor and again like Jolie this film didn't show off his true talents. But he did a good job as well with the material he had. As for the rest of the supporting cast, all did a good job for the type of film it is. I have zero complaints in the acting department.With everything being said and done, I can't knock ""Salt"" too much because it gave me everything the marketing promised it would. I was entertained for the 105 minute run-time and even though I enjoy to think with my action, I may expect too much from a normal Hollywood director. I totally understand why films like this have average ratings because truly it is an average film but it does get credit for delivering on what it promised. As long as you don't go into ""Salt"" expecting anything mind-blowing and original than you should enjoy ""Salt."" If you are a fan of Jolie, especially in the action roles, well this one is a must see for you because like my girlfriend said, ""it was awesome for the action and Jolie kicks ass."" I think with that being said, if you like action flicks, you can't go wrong but if you want something smart and fresh, skip ""Salt"" and see ""Inception"" instead.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Salt"" is a 7 out of 10. As long as you go into the film not expecting anything other than a normal action flick you should be able to sit back and enjoy the ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The name is Salt, Evelyn Salt...","Despite the massive hype surrounding the film, including a trailer that gave away nothing in regards to the secretive plot, there was one major factor speaking against Phillip Noyce's latest action movie, Salt: the fact that one Tom Cruise, though never officially attached, had turned down the lead role - subsequently redesigned for Angelina Jolie - in favor of the disappointing Knight and Day, which he considered a better, more ""fun"" option. However, Noyce's track record has always been an almost foolproof guarantee of entertainment, and while it isn't his best film, Salt is a good way to spend two hours at the movies.About that mysterious plot, then: Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a skilled CIA agent who tries to juggle her career and her personal life the best she can, without having her husband (August Diehl) suspect anything. All's well until a Russian spy is apprehended and a conspiracy involving sleeper agents on US soil, an assassination attempt and the so-called ""Day X"" is revealed. In fact, Evelyn is identified by this spy as one of the Russian undercover agents, leading to her arrest at the hands of her colleagues and friends (Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor). One impressive escape later, and Salt is on the run, desperate to prove her innocence, no matter the cost.It's easy to see why Cruise bailed out: there are certain similarities between Salt and his Mission: Impossible franchise, not least a scene that requires the main character to wear a latex mask (although the Slat version is far less convincing and makes for one of the picture's more laughable moments). What sets Salt apart, though, is a more reality-based premise: Day X is - apparently - something that gets mentioned in Intelligence circles, and a similar sleeper mission was discovered just a few months before the film's premiere. How odd, then, that Kurt Wimmer's screenplay (reportedly worked on by Brian Helgeland as well) is less precise than the circumstances would promise, with certain contrivances being too outlandish for the genre and the entire final act resting on a couple of plot holes. Clearly, attention has been put on action rather than narrative coherence.But oh, what action: never once stopping to breathe, the movie jumps from one set-piece to the next, keeping the adrenaline levels high and suspension of disbelief within reasonable boundaries (check out the Matrix-inspired highway chase). Noyce clearly cherishes this chance to make a kick-ass genre flick, and he has found his perfect ally in Jolie, much changed since their previous collaboration (The Bone Collector, a decade back): having evolved from an acting force to be reckoned with to go-to action lady (see Tomb Raider, Mr and Mrs Smith or Wanted), she delivers the good from beginning to end, cheerfully overshadowing equally talented people like Screiber and Ejiofor. If a sequel were to materialize (not entirely impossible), it would be worth it just to see her on the run once again.A great spy flick, then? No, not quite. But it's a lot of genuine fun while it lasts, as long as no one starts questioning the logic. I mean, who needs that when you've got Jolie doing her usual stuff?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Mindless summer fun,"This film has about as much action as can be crammed into a 90-minute movie. Of course, everything in the film is basically unbelievable: such as Angelina Jolie being bulletproof, scaling walls like Spider Man, plus a whole lot of surprising resurrections--so why should anything else be believable? Angelina and Liev Schreiber (who plays her colleague) are gifted enough to get the audience through several plot twists.I was never bored, and there was some considerable suspense which built up near the end. I think the film can definitely be enjoyed if not too much thought is given to the motivations of certain characters. And the body count by the end of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"For what it is, it's great fun.","Salt is filled with ridiculous ideas, plot holes the size of the sun, and completely overblown action. So, is it worth you time? If you can accept it for what it is, a vehicle for action, then it absolutely is.Its a movie that is honest with itself; it doesn't try to be something that it isn't. If, for example, the characters had been developed beyond the shallow point in which they are, then it might have been impossible to appreciate the film. But the film never pretends to be more than a vehicle for ridiculous action and as such, it works.Angelina Jolie is effective, but her efforts again play against the silliness of the film.Comparisons with Bourne are inevitable(especially the end scene), but this is a silly movie for the silly season, and as such, it compares favorably to the rest of the drivel.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt: An average action flick,"Today I managed to see the first show of Angelina Jolie's latest action flick, 'Salt'. In my opinion, there is no better actress than Jolie in female action figure. She did manage to charm everyone in her 'Lara Croft: Tomb raider' series. When I first saw the trailer of 'Salt' last year I was confident that this one is going to offer more than a typical popcorn flick, but I would say that I was disappointed.The story was interesting in first half of the film but it started sagging from time to time in second half. The action sequences were eye catching but it was the lack of a tight script which made everything go in vain. The ending was neither convincing nor interesting. And one question remained unknown, whether Salt is a bad guy or a good guy? The police continuously chased her from first minute till the last minute. This no-brainer flick may attract viewers for a time pass but it fails to make any impact.I felt pity on the director. After watching 'Inception' few days back, I was hoping that this movie won't disappoint me, but I did. Still I gave it 5 out of 10 because of good entertainment and a desperate try by Angelina Jolie. No other actors stood out except Liev Schreiber who gave a nice twist to the plot.Final words, give 'Salt' a watch because of Jolie and its well performed action sequences. It may not be a classic action-spy movie but it delivers nice entertainment which won't disappoint most of the audiences.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

SALT - A Modern Action Film,"""Salt"" may start off with some clunky storytelling, but once the action takes off (which it doesn't take too long to do), it's a senseless joyride, finding a niche style that fits nicely between ""Bourne""-style realism and ""Mission Impossible"" inanity (yes, a mask is used at one point in the movie). Of course, the driving force is Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy. Salt is altogether a static character, but shifts in narrative constantly make our view of her dynamic, not letting us know whether to pin her as hero or antihero, and Jolie plays this ambiguity to perfection. The movie itself isn't perfect, though - to me, occasional plot holes made it more confusing than ""Inception,"" and the idea of a Cold War carry-over in this day and age is somewhat laughable. Still, the movie plays its thrills right, and character of Salt fulfills what she was written to be - a bona fide action star.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underwhelming Bourne/Enemy of the State etc rip off.,"Was it realistic? No. Did all the dots get connected? Not all. Was it fun to watch? Fleetingly.Salt is a wholly underwhelming experience, promising so much but failing to deliver. Of course, there were some decent action sequences but without Angelina Jolie it would have been a B- movie. Typical storyline of secret service agent sought out by their own agency much in the mould of the Bourne trilogy or Enemy of the State. However, this pales in comparison and fails to really reach a conclusion in an impossibly frustrating way.I was expecting to leave the cinema satisfied from watching a standard action film, but left underwhelmed by its attempt at twists and lack of a climax. Left the cinema irritated.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Connecting the dots,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!A number of those who saw Salt had some questions about the movie. Here's my attempt at connecting (some of) the dots:Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, but she's also a sleeper agent for the Russians. The problem for her Russian spymaster, Orlov, is that she's married - which is against the rules - and so her allegiance is suspect.Here are some questions and answers.Who is Salt? She is a CIA agent. Although she started as a Russian sleeper agent, her allegiance is now with the USA, after her detention by N. Korea and her subsequent release made possible by an expert arachnologist whom she marries.Why is she exposed by Orlov? 1. Orlov wants the CIA to believe that Russia is behind the assassination plot to kill the Russian president in order to stoke US- Russia tensions and escalate the strain to a nuclear conflict. 2. Orlov wants to activate Salt from her sleeper status and carry out the assassination (which is also a test of Salt's allegiance). 3. Orlov wants to divert the CIA's attention to Salt so that the real plot (nuclear bombing of Arab nations by the US) can be carried out by another sleeper agent (Winter). 4. Implicating Salt will make her the fall guy after the real mission is carried out by the sleeper agent.Why does Salt run from the CIA when Orlov escapes CIA custody? Salt runs from the CIA because she knows her husband is in danger, since she her marriage is against the ""rules"" imposed on sleeper agents. If she can't find her husband, she figures her husband is held hostage by her Russian spymaster, but will be released after her mission is carried out.Why does Salt carry out her mission to kill the Russian president? Salt carries out her mission to ""prove"" that she is still loyal to her Russian spymaster, and hence secure the release of her husband. Although it initially appears that the Russian president is assassinated, Salt does not actually kill him - he is merely put into a state of temporary paralysis when Salt injects him with spider venom (not seen on screen, but implied near the end of the film).Why does Salt follow the presidential team to the bunker? To stop the president from launching the nuclear weapons. It's not clear at that point if Salt knows there is another sleeper agent (Winter) besides the NATO mole (Shnaider) who blew himself up. Presumably, Salt knows the NATO mole's self-sacrifice isn't the objective, which is to secure American missiles for the ""Day X"" mission.What evidence is there to show Salt's allegiance to the US? 1. No American is killed by Salt 2. The Russian president is not killed by Salt, but merely put in a state of temporary paralysis. This requires premeditation on Salt's part, and not an afterthought. 3. She doesn't shoot agent Peabody even though she has the drop on him. 4. She kills all the Russians on the barge (though this is also an act of revenge for the killing of her husband) 5. She stops the nuclear missiles from being launched",,Anonymous,Mystery
A Spy Thriller That Delivers,"SALT is a mostly well written story about a Russian double agent who is a one woman Seal Team 6 it seems. As a spy thriller, SALT delivers where most other spy thriller's fail at some point. At the end of the movie you can honestly say it was a very nice two hour diversion and of course Angelina Jolie as always is easy on the eyes. Yes this movie has plot holes as all fictional spy movies do, but it has fewer of them and they are easy to just take in and enjoy. The three main characters in this movie are all entertaining especially Jolie. The action sequences are first rate and of course over the top but that is part of the fun. I agree with others that the end of the movie left something to be desired but still this is one enjoyable movie to pass the time. Much better than almost all of the James Bond movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A fun and entertaining movie,"Angelina Jolie's latest film is this action spy thriller titled Salt. That the title of the film and her character's name. Seems like a carbon copy of a female Bourne movie. At first I didn't know what to expect from this film but I read many reviews, positive and negative and I finally got around to seeing this film. I thought it was pretty well done, the action scenes were great but the plot was predictable and kind of hard to believe. Though its on of those movies that make you feel excited with action, and it delivers. Granted it was a summer action flick to rack in a ton of cash, and it succeeded in doing so.Many things I like and disliked in this film. The only real issue that I have is that the film didn't fully explore the protagonist's inner psyche. There are some flashbacks that tell flesh out the character, but a little bit more would've been nice in addition to more exposition surrounding her character. Also, I felt the film should've been longer. The notion of a female spy is an exciting and intriguing idea. They should have added an extra 20 mins to the film but overall it was good. It is 100 mins (1hr, 40mins) but it had about 7 mins of end credits, so it was really closer to 90 mins. I personally think it they extended a few scenes, it would have been better. But it is what it is, and it was pretty decent in general. Also the ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel and I for one can't wait to see what they come up with next. It's not as cerebral as the Bourne films, but it will entertain you for an hour and a half. Give and take the price of what its worth, that's a good deal. ==================================================================== ======== As for a rewatch (07/19/17') this film is still quite an entertaining spy thriller. Though some things do not feel as good upon a second review. Perhaps the film did not age well, considering since it's release there have been better films of this kind of genre. Things are messy in the second half and do require of paying close attention. Also some of the twists and turns aren't as clever as I'd remember. Rating change from 7 to 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Don't Cross Her,"Businesswoman Evelyn Salt, energetically played by Angelina Jolie, is being tortured in North Korea for espionage all the while denying the charge. Later she is ""traded"" for a captured Korean agent revealing she is in fact a C.I.A. operative.Two years later, recovered, no longer in the field and happily married, Salt's life is thrown into turmoil when a Russian defector names her as a 'sleeper"" agent under orders to assassinate the Russian President in New York.The remainder of the film is largely a chase as C.I.A, FBI and Secret Service agents led by Salt's supervisor Ted Winter and Counter-Intelligence officer Peabody try to apprehend an escaped Salt who claims she's being set up and only trying to find her husband, whom she feels is in mortal danger now that her C.I.A cover as a civilian executive has been blown. But, to them, she seems to be making her way to the Russian President, just as the defector, Orlov intimated she would.I really liked this movie. The story is filled with plot holes, but is still the most energetic film of the summer. Filed with several twists and plot reversals, keeping you guessing literally the last moment where Salt's loyalties really lie.The ending not only leaves room for a sequel, it demands one.

Ehh...needed more sexiness,"Sorry, I don't watch Angelina to see how much of an empowered dominant female she can be. That being said, I can't stand reading the overblown, self-righteous, WAY too serious reviews by the other reviewers on this sight. Was there a decent plot? Yes - spy thriller genre with not-too-subtle twists. Was there an abundance of action sequences? Yes - mostly well done, but maybe a little over the top on the ""super female"" side of things. Did this reviewer get what he came for? Yes and No - fine entertainment value, but if Jolie is in it I'd appreciate a bit more hotness. As to the critiques of this movie, I don't deny that ""suspension of disbelief"" is kinda hard to come by. As usual, the lead character has the uncanny ability to improvise when getting out of danger....but, really, it gets a little silly in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Preposterous!,"I know the idea behind any fictional depiction is the audience accepts some deviation from reality as part of the process. But this picture establishes it's audience as complete morons before it's even off the ground. Tired, anorexic Anjolina kicks the ass of every professionally trained government agent possible without enduring a single scratch, bruise, or broken bone, then walks away cool, calm and sexy. Here the Russians are evil terrorists out to repay Americans for the Cold War (which in reality ended over 20 years ago). The portrayal of Russians is both laughable and insulting - all packing automatic weapons, calling each other ""Comrade"" and swigging down Vodka like a bunch of loser idiots stuck in some eighties Soviet time warp. The storyline is illogical and unbelievable at every turn. I cannot believe someone actually wrote this junk, someone else actually funded this junk, and people directed and acted in it as well. Didn't someone along the way realize that it was just total garbage? I never felt so insulted to be a member of a movie's viewing audience as I was with 'Salt'. Please spare yourself and skip it.

I really enjoyed this film.,"SALTWell... I was not expecting this to be that good.The movie is about a CIA agent who interrogates a suspected terrorist... but when the terrorist says there is a spy amongst the CIA and he names her... she goes on the run to try and clear her name.It is an action thriller and it delivers on both subjects. There is plenty of action, but not all of it was great. Yes it was entertaining but during some of the action sequences, it just felt too unrealistic. I know it is a movie and I know that it is not supposed to be real... but at points where you could see that the main character would not survive, it ruined it a little bit. Also, there was a scene where there was a huge car chase and a car crashes off of a bridge... someone climbs out of the car, undoes handcuffs and casually walks away without any of the 40 strong crowd even looking at her, let alone stop her.But the surprise factor was there... and it was done very well. I tried to predict what was going to happen... and I failed. It is a great film for keeping you guessing. There was only one part of the movie that I guessed correctly, and even that I was not sure about.The casting was brilliant... I can't fault anyone for their performances. Anjelina Jolie is the main character. I don't mind her, but I don't see her as the best actress in Hollywood like a lot of people do. She has made some fantastic movies though... and this in my opinion is one of her best. But I have to say I think the performance of the movie has to go to Liev Schreiber. This is by far the best performance he has done yet that I have seen. I mainly know him from the Scream movies which I love, and I have seen him in other things too... but he did a fantastic job in Salt.The main thing I was disappointed with was the ending... I was comfortable watching this movie and really enjoying it... but it felt like it was unfinished. Honestly, the action was about to carry on, then the credits started to role. I was so confused and gutted. Thankfully, there are rumours of a Salt 2 on the way... hopefully they will finish the story this time.All in all I loved this film. Yes there were things I was not too impressed with, but I was hooked from the beginning.I will give this film 8 out of 10.""How many more like you are there?""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good in parts, but feels silly, derivative and too open ended","Salt sounds like a pretty good deal, what it delivers is just mildly good. As is typical of everything Kurt Wimmer writes, Salt mistakes street smart for intelligent smart. I thought this was pretty dumb, maybe even Wimmer's dumbest movie yet. Okay fine, Ultraviolet was pretty silly, but then again, it was a b-movie right, (this isn't)Salt has a few good action scenes, which work well individually, but the film in its entirety doesn't amount to much. It feels rushed, shallow, devoid of common sense, and has an ending which makes the story feel vastly incomplete; perhaps a tell tale sign of a sequel to come.Director Phillip Noyce knows how to Make Angelina Jolie look good on camera, but she isn't much of a character. Her performance is a huge step up from her last action film Wanted, but even so, her function here is not too dissimilar. She has little to do outside of running around and killing people.Treated as an extended chase scene, Salt could easily get an A+, but as a hundred minute story, it feels rather feeble. It is a derivative spy/thriller which is usually slick, and certainly not dull, but its superficiality and general lack of brains make it difficult to appreciate to the full.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But why is she running from the good guys? And punching and kicking and killing them and being a total bad-ass?

Nothing more, nothing less. Some of the direction seems a bit manufactured at times and the pacing a tad bit slow, but Angelina makes up for it with a great performance. Liev Schreiber, who also plays a C.I.A. agent, hands in a appreciable performance, as well.

Convoluted plot and a fairly boring storytelling,"Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill CIA agent until a supposed Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) lets slip that she is a Russian spy during an interrogation. Salt is forced to go on the run, carrying out a series of increasingly dangerous actions that occasionally make sense. While being pursued by both her former colleagues and a sleeper cell of Russian terrorists, she keeps everyone (including the audience) asking the same question: just what side is Evelyn Salt on?It's possible that ""Salt"" may have the widest range of reviews of any movie from 2010. Comments from writers I greatly respect would have had me believing that this was either one of the better action movies of the year or one of the more convoluted, pointless films of the year. I'm afraid I come closer to the latter camp than the former. Clearly the point of the movie is to keep the audience guessing so that the final twist is especially earth shattering. Unfortunately, I had completely lost interest in the movie's plot by the time we get to the final reveal or whether or not Salt is a hero or a villain. I'm all for a film that challenges me to follow along (see: ""Inception"") but I have a tendency to shut down when I feel like a movie is screwing with my mind just for the heck of it. Maybe that's an indictment of me as much as it is ""Salt"" but regardless, the various twists and turns just left me feeling cold and uncaring as to what would happen. In addition, the action sequences are quite outlandish and while that might work for a Jerry Bruckheimer production, it doesn't seem to fit here. Moreover, I just don't buy Jolie as an action star. I've tried, I really have, but she just doesn't work for me in these types of roles. Add that all together with an under-utilization of one great character actor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the typecasting of another (Liev Schreiber) and the result is thoroughly unimpressive.Check out my site: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",,Anonymous,Mystery

Nuff said!Well....more about that....(to drive the point home!)......The ""Alternative Ending"" version of ""Salt"" (2010) available on DVD's with several variations of the movie is the best one, and all interested in the great ""Salt"" movie should see that version, rather than the version which was released to the movie houses in 2010, and which is the ""default"" ""official,"" and ""main"" version viewers see unless they visit the ""special features"" section of the DVD of ""Salt"" and choose the ""alternative ending.""To get back to the comparison of ""Salt"" (2010) with ""La Femme Nikita"" (1990), both movies are about beautiful females who look like high fashion ramp models, both unusually underweight with exotic faces and thick, sensuous lips, who are recruited, manipulated, forced to become government assassins, and who murder many innocent people in cold blood 'doing their job"" during the course of the story and the movie, but in the end ""jump ship"" and escape from their government manipulator puppet-masters, and disappear at the end of both movies to an unknown and uncertain future....the price both women pay for escaping from their roles as forced government assassins.Both movies demonstrate and assert that the classical ""femme fa tale"" may be part of a story which has almost nothing to do with romance or connection with any male, and also that the female protagonist in an action/ mystery story (both Salt and La Femme Nikita are action/ mystery stories) can be capable of astonishing feats of physical prowess and strength against male antagonists in which the female wins physical fights and the males lose....repeatedly.Both Angelina Jolie as ""Evelyn Salt"" in SALT and Anne Parillaud (one of the top fashion models in France before she became a movie star) as ""Nikita"" retire from the stories both star in ""undefeated"" in all serious contests they engage in....the men they come up against always lose, the female protagonists always win.The female protagonists never face female antagonists in either movie, which is significant.The Salt (2010) movie uses a lot of tricky editing and fast paced cutting to assist Angelina Jolie 'do her thing"" beating up men and doing Harrison Ford style action miracles which would easily kill most people....The La Femme Nikita (1990) movie is smoother, and more believable for that reason, and probably the better of the two movies for that reason.....it is much less a ""video-game"" Dark Knight type movie, relies far less on gimmicks and technical/ digital tricks.....Salt (2010) starring Angelina Jolie lacks the needed humorous and human intervals provided in La Femme Nikita (1990). The main female character in Salt (2010) is much less lovable and far more driven...she really does stay ""on task"" and is almost a machine as military ideal soldiers are supposed to be. Women may or may not be capable of all the superstar action and heroic stunts Angelina Jolie performs as the ""Evelyn Salt"" character, but such ladies are like the napkins neatly folded for wedding anniversaries Angelina Jolie (""Salt"") comments on at the start of the movie...""Not too sexy."" How true, how true.But Salt is a good movie worth seeing....so, of course is/was La Femme Nikita (1990).The DVD disc version for home viewing I bought included three different versions of the movie, including an ""extended cut"" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending. I can see why the version ultimately released in movie houses and offered as the ""official version"" was chosen. The released version (the ""official"" one) is more logical, and the ending is closer to La Femme Nikita (1990 French).Both Salt (2010) and La Femme Nikita (1990) examine the potential and unexpected physical and mental power of beautiful females built like super-models one sees on Vogue Magazine covers, and almost never in Hollywood (or French) action movies.Both are good movies. We need more just like them....odd that it took 20 years for Salt (2010) to pick up where La Femme Nikita (1990) left off.--------Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

"Interesting, fast and intense, there is no time to think.","It is not the first time that Angelina Jolie has brought a spy to life, she did it very well in ""Mr. And Mrs. Smith"". Here, she comes back and in good shape, with a good job, but she is no longer as young or as beautiful as she was.The script is simple but intriguing: Evelyn Salt, a highly respected CIA agent, is accused by a Russian defector of being a Russian undercover agent, trained from a child to be a convincing American citizen until it's time to act. While trying to protect her husband from the actions of his agency colleagues, Salt will have to flee in order to try to clear her name and discover the truth. It is a good script and it develops very well, but very much within what we can expect in a spy movie. In fact, we've seen similar movies before.The cast is, as I mentioned, led by Angelina Jolie. She is an actress who is no longer young, and may even seem old for her role here. But she is very good at what she does, she has charisma and presence. Anyway, I think this film will never be part of the top ten in her career, she seems very uninspired. The rest of the cast do what they have to do to support her: Liev Schreiber was very good and tried to surprise; Chiwetel Ejiofor has little to do besides being a counterpoint to Schreiber's character; Daniel Olbrychski had no material for more.Technically, the film is good. What I highlight most is the fast pace, which helps to keep our interest. Everything happens very quickly. Without that, and the excellent action scenes throughout the film, our interest would certainly be lost before the middle. The pace also helps to mitigate the credibility flaws in the story, as we are so attentive to everything that happens that we do not question the logic of it. A smart move. To add, we have good cinematography, with very well filming work and some light tension that helps in the action and makes the film fun to watch without making it too intense.Fun, fast-paced, action-packed and with an intriguing story behind it, it is a film that will make the audience stick to the screen until the end, although they may probably not want to repeat the shot after realizing the several flaws it has.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Least satisfying action film of the summer.,"""Salt"" starts out as a well made but painfully routing fugitive on the run thriller, then tries valiantly to do something original and different. Unfortunately, the routine section of the film is actually the better movie, as the plot twists become more and more ridiculous and don't hold together, and ultimately we are left caring nothing about any of the characters.Writer Kurt Wimmer has come up with a great concept, but a poor screenplay. Director Phillip Noyce tries, but there's only so much he can do with the material, and his only sillier tendencies also get in the way.In the end, ""Salt"" is barely worth a look, but it's actually the least satisfying of the major action films of summer 2010. ""Inception"" was brilliant, and all of the others at least knew they were just dumb fun. ""Salt"" tries to be smart, and falls on it's face. The spectacular chase scenes almost save it . . . but not quite.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wooden and predictable,"Terrible, typically American, and utterly predictable bullshit. Angelina Jolie as usual is brilliantly adaptable. When she is playing in a dramatic scene, she is wooden. When she is playing in an emotional scene, she is wooden. When she is playing in an action scene, she is wooden. Don't waste you time with this crap. But there is one good thing to say about this garbage. You can watch a film on another TV channel and flick back from time to time to see what's going on in ""Salt"". You won't miss anything. When you flick back you will see either Angelina kicking ass, or Angelina having her ass kicked. Oh! And if you flick back from time to time you will see a car chase scene. And then another car chase scene.And then a running chase scene. And then another running chase scene. And oh I almost forgot. You can also see Angelina kicking ass. Oh! And acting woodenly..",,Anonymous,Mystery
Twists for twists sakes. Not as clever as it thinks it is.,"One thing that is true of Angelina Jolie is that she is a talented actress. Another thing is that she is a stunningly beautiful actress. The latter is to such an extreme that sometimes i find myself so entranced that i forget I'm watching a stinker of a movie. Now, I'm not here to trash Salt, yes its silly, yes its not as clever as it thinks it is but ultimately , its one of the better action films that Angelina has appeared in. Whats frustrating about Angelina Jolie in action films is not that she doesn't make the character believable, the contrary, you can tell she's committed and full throttle in every scene and her off screen enigmatic persona really adds a layer of intrigue when she plays characters like this, no its that the scripts often let her down. In Tomb Raider she was every inch Lara Croft but the films stank. In Wanted she played the calm, cool hard faced assassin to perfection while matching the boys in the physical action stakes, but the film was awful. In Mr And Mrs Smith, she played it for laughs with some strong action set pieces thrown in but the film didn't have the legs. Time after time, Angelina is let down by those around here not being up to her level. Salt, while being one of better action films (not saying much) is still bogged down by over indulging itself, throwing twists in for twists sakes.In a way, it feels like the film is a few years too late and we've seen the same twists done so many times ,we are fully expecting them. From Phillip Noyce i can be forgiven for expecting something a little more cerebral and engaging but ultimately Salt just feels like an attempt to start a franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Riddled with nonsense, but Jolie holds it together","The plot lacks any semblance of credibility, however once disbelief is suspended it is internally consistent and an entertaining romp. It has the usual ingredients of a spy thriller, chasing, fighting and particularly plot-twists. I must confess that the key turning points came as a surprise but felt natural in the context of the movie. Jolie pouts her way through it all, despite this she performs believably and carries the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Please Pass (on) the Salt,"Where Knight and Day actually did have intentional laughs, Salt produced more laughs that I didn't anticipate. Namely in the finale. Pretty much that was the only unpredictable factor in a movie with a climax that will go down in history as one of the most foreshadowed ""twists"" from minute one in the film.Aside from the literal laugh-out-loud final 20 minutes, I don't think there was a scene in Salt that was crafted to invoke any laughter. This movie is as straight-laced without an ounce of humor, or humility, as one can make it.Furthermore, aside from the unpredictable comedy and the predictable outcome, let's get one thing straight: if someone compares this to ANY of the Bourne movies, ask them this one simple question: What else have you lied to me about? This is as much Bourne as Ramona & Beezus is about lesbian lovers.The title belongs on the popcorn you are eating as this is the main definition of a ""popcorn movie"" or Leave-Your-Brain-HOME film. Sure Angelina looked great and the action appeared to be CGI-lite – a favorite of mine, but it's hard to get past how incredibly mediocre both the script and action scenes were.Perhaps they were trying to be realistic. They failed there with Salt's (Jolie) truck hopping, or lack of motion sickness after getting out of the 15th vehicle she caused to drop 1+ stories. Perhaps they were trying so hard on ""making you think"" with the is she/isn't she a single or double agent. Again, they let us down due to all the blatant clues they LITERALLY told us. I wouldn't be able to get through an entire season of the excellent 24 if they gave away 1/100 of the plot points in hour one as this did by minute five.US-CIA Agent Salt was rescued by her husband Mike (Diehl) while tortured by the enemy and after that nearly, but not completely, pointless plot point, they fast forward two years to their happy home in D.C. This is all fun and games until a defective Russian confesses she's a Russian spy and her own kind turns on her.Hold it there. I'll admit, I don't work for the CIA. I've not been known for my espionage tactics. But, it did sound a little fishy that one unknown would unravel an established agent in seconds and no one believes her. I couldn't buy that, but I'll just chalk that up as one of the many weak plot points to move the story to what it's really about: The Chase.This is where people might compare this to Bourne as she's being chase by the same branch and she's out to solve her dilemma on her own. Well, that's been done dozens of times before. Jack Bauer, James Bond, Dr. Richard Kimble, to name a few. What the movie Salt needed to do, was separate itself, I don't know, with some original and exciting action sequences and less on trying to trap us in who's the mole.To sum it all up, a Russian spy is, in fact, out to kill both the Russian and US Presidents and since Salt is their only suspect, they void any search of any other assassin. Could the culprit be pulling a Skynet? Sorry, I forgot to say SPOILER ALERT, but if you didn't see that coming or who's really responsible, then congratulations on your first movie you've seen since E.T.Again, I'll admit Angelina looked wonderful, but this wasn't her day in the acting part. She was so up and down with real/fake emotions, she either made the director look bad or she took lessons from Megan Fox.Every once in a while a movie will change my mind on an actor, much like my distaste for Nicolas Cage was thwarted a bit in Kick Ass or my annoyance with Adrien Brody was lifted in Predators. Didn't happen here with the actorI'veneverliked: Liev Schreiber. He didn't do anything, quite literally, in this movie. He was flat-lining out of the gate and did nothing to add to his character or movie. He was like Keanu Reeves who can tell you he's an FBI agent or he's a vampire hunter, but we never believe him due to his poor acting.Who am I fooling? This movie's premise is just that, to fool you. It's not about acting, depth, originality or setting the bar higher. It's like an M. Night Shyamalan blunder whereas they were so concerned with the BIG surprise, they forgot to make a movie.I'd barely recommend it for action alone and Angelia who did look good in her Matrix moves and clothes, but it's more of a rental. A cheap $1 rental. Or even on network TV in a year with dozens of commercials and scenes edited out.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fast paced combination of wit, action and suspense. Don't miss it!","Let me first say that this movie isn't Inception. It's not overly deep or complicated. But Salt is still a great movie.You can read the synopsis above, so I'm not going to waste time summarizing it.Salt is a fast paced action thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. Angelina Jolie delivers a fantastic role- leaving no doubt as to why she's made it to the top of Hollywood's actresses. She has a phenomenal presence on screen that keeps the movie intact and makes the twisted plot flow with ease. Liev Schreiber also delivers a great performance, though it's hard to get past his roles in Defiance and X- Men Origins: Wolverine.There are plenty of twists, turns, car chases, crashes, blow up scenes, jumps, gun fire, and hands on fights to satisfy even the most dedicated action fans. The cinematic elements are great, the music is fitting, the scenes are well directed, the transitions aren't annoying, the plot flows well, the writing isn't overly corny, and the actors (primarily Angelina and Liev) are probably the best asset.This movie gives you a total adrenaline rush, too. You get enveloped into the plot and the characters in a way that makes every scene exciting. It definitely keeps you guessing, despite the reveal in the trailer.Overall, it's a great every day movie, and definitely one that I will buy for a few watches when it comes out on DVD and BluRay. Though it's not perfect (I didn't give it full stars because of a mistake in casting Hunt Block for the President's character, one poorly crafted special effects elevator scene, and a lack of proper costume design in the latter end of the movie that distracts from Angelina looking as fabulous as always), it's still great fun.Don't miss it!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Take it with a grain of the title,"As other reviews have pointed out, this movie is rather poorly written and plenty of things that happen do not make the most sense if you stop to think about it. If you would read my other reviews, you'll find that I care about such things. Therefore I do not want to rate this movie too highly.However, as a sort of guilty pleasure, the movie worked for me. As I write this, I am struggling to work out why, as in how many nonsensical stuff I am prepared to tolerate. I guess it helps that this is just a relatively short stand alone movie, so no larger franchise is damaged by all that is happening. I must admit, having Angelina Jolie in it does not hurt either, although here presence alone is certainly not enough to save a movie for me, as I found out when recently watching her first Tomb Raider movie.All in all, I definitely recommend the proper mindset when watching this movie: brain off (or on ""low""), and sit back. Like when tired after work or something.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There are no words to describe this abomination,"For the record, this abomination should have a zero mark. Even one star is too many. This excrescence is an insult to humanity. Angelina Jolie should hang her hypocritical head in shame for taking part in this stinking pile of ordure and then berating the rest of the world for the plight of starving children, or whatever her pet project is this month. Just think about it Angie dear: this malodorous movie cost in excess of $100 million to make - including, no doubt, many millions for your pathetic ""acting talents"". Would it not have been so much better to spend even half of this eye-watering sum of moolah on getting clean water and sanitation to some of the world's less fortunate children. Or do you think that adopting a few of them salves your conscience enough for you to continually make enormous sums of money from your somewhat less enormous ""acting talent""? Anyway, enough of the Angelina berating (for now). What about the movie? I hear you ask. Well, what about it? It is a waste of time, unless you're a brain-dead nit-wit. That's all I can say about it. There is nothing worth writing about. But Angelina...oh dear Angelina... I suggest you donate every penny of your unwarranted fee to one of your favourite causes and take up a career as a real charity worker, as opposed to a part-time celebrity UN ambassador, or whatever it is you're supposed to be, instead of asking the poor of the world, i.e. Me, to contribute a brass razoo to your bank balance.

"Better than expected, but, well...","Well, it is a decent action flick, with lots of twists and turns and unpredictable moments - perhaps too much; several scenes have just sophisticated and entertaining value, it is difficult to imagine them happening even theoretically or in the event of a huge turmoil. But the fights are there, as well as chases, explosions and double/triple crossings... However, the movie is too focused on one protagonist and the choice for the role - Angelina Jolie - was not the best, in my opinion, as her build and looks make many fulfillments hard to picture. The other questionable issue was to bring the Cold War into 21st century; moreover, almost all the deeds and plans of Russian characters resembled rather those of Islamic/Arab terrorists. Luckily, the ending is not slushy, and leaves room for a sequel.If you like political thrillers with strong players, the 1 hour 35 minutes pass with the blah! feeling. But it is no masterpiece, particularly script-wise.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Salt: Action-Packed, But Not Groundbreaking","Angelina Jolie is Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent whose loyalty is thrown into question when she's accused of being a Russian sleeper spy. What follows is a globe-trotting chase, with Salt on the run, trying to clear her name while evading capture by both the CIA and shadowy figures from her past.The film starts strong, pulling you in with its intriguing premise and intense action sequences. Jolie is captivating as Salt, her steely gaze and athletic prowess making her a convincing action hero. She carries the film with charisma, even if the script doesn't always give her character the complexity she deserves.However, as the plot unfolds, its familiarity starts to seep in. The ""lone agent against everyone"" trope, the Cold War-esque Russia as the villain, and the predictable twists and turns feel a bit stale, like reheated leftovers from other action flicks. The supporting cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber, does a decent job, but their characters don't have enough depth to truly shine.The action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting, but some might find them a bit over-the-top, bordering on unrealistic. Think Jason Bourne meets Mission: Impossible, with a dash of extra explosions and maybe a pinch too much of the ""lone wolf takes down everyone"" trope.Ultimately, ""Salt"" is a decent, albeit predictable, action thriller. It provides a fun escape with a strong female lead and enough explosions to fill a salt mine, but it doesn't offer much originality or depth. If you're looking for a popcorn flick with a kick-ass protagonist and enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, then ""Salt"" might just satisfy your cravings. But if you're yearning for a spy thriller that breaks the mold with a truly groundbreaking story and complex characters, this film might leave you feeling a bit peckish for something more substantial.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Entertaining Ride,"I went into this movie pretty stoked. I usually like Angelina Jolie movies. I was expecting some good action and an interesting plot. I was not disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either.The plot was entertaining. I liked the idea of it, and I was interested the whole time. I don't recall any particularly down periods of the film where I just wanted things to pick up. Some points seemed difficult to believe, but I tried anyway.I thought Angelina Jolie was great. I actually liked her character and how she portrayed her. She did an excellent job jumping off of stuff, climbing walls, and shooting guns. There was an emotional scene where she looked very vulnerable. It was good.I turned off my brain for this movie. I wasn't trying to figure out who the bad guy was, I wasn't trying to predict anything. In doing this, I experienced several fairly satisfying shocks. The friend I saw the movie with said that she knew what was going happen before it did, so I guess it was predictable. I dunno. :/ Turning off my brain worked for me.I wouldn't buy this movie, but I may rent it some time in the future. I think it's a pretty good action film. Not amazing, but not bad.

no pepper?,"I gotta say, I didn't want to like this movie... but I did! It moves at a fast pace, right from the start, and never really lets up! The plot is okay, but it is hard to believe that someone Jolie's size could beat up so many other people twice her size. Also, her leaping abilities are much too comic book-ish. But there is a bit of suspense about who she really is, and it kept me entertained for the running time, so 7 stars it is!

Why you should and shouldn't see Salt,"Salt's colleagues wonder if she is doing all of that running, jumping, shooting, exploding, and hair-dying because she actually is a Russian agent, programmed years ago to assassinate someone, or for some innocent reason such as concern for her husband or worry that she may have left the iron on or forgotten to feed the dog.From the moment Salt flees, the movie is a clockwork of kinetic energy, gravity and timing. The stunts, which account for much if not most of the screen time, are superbly choreographed, and apparently many of them were executed by Jolie herself.As evidenced by the poster above, Jolie can convey a knowing, beautifully cold efficiency with one glance. When not leaping from the top of one speeding truck onto another while dodging bullets, Jolie manages to juxtapose this aura with the occasional glimpse of anger, fear, grief or near-panic.The premise and plot are unlikely but cleverly assembled. Early on you'll formulate a theory as to what's happening, but you will question it more than once before the truth is revealed.Why you should see it You love the thought of James Bond-style action combined with a who-can-you-trust puzzle. Angelina Jolie.Why you should avoid it You're the type who asks a companion to explain movies to you, loudly, in the theater. You resent not knowing something, because wondering feels too much like work. Loyalty to Jennifer Aniston.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt,Salt was one of several movies to sell Angelina Jolie as an action heroine which began when she appeared in Tomb Raider.Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent who is accused by a Russian defector agent called Orlov of being a KGB sleeper agent. Her true mission is to kill the Russian president when he attends the funeral of the American vice president. The Russians have several sleeper agents operating in American soil.Salt escapes from her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) and goes on the run. While trying to figure just who she is and clear her name. Salt also goes for the Russian president after hearing her lover has been kidnapped. Orlov clearly is playing another game.The plot is both convoluted and illogically absurd. Jolie gives it her all in the action scenes but feels like a poor Jason Bourne imitation. The twist reveal was not difficult to guess.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
End of the day,"I watched this film at the end of a really long work day, and it was just what I needed. Short, predictable, and entertaining. Angelina Jolie and Liev Schreiber are solid actors in a just-fine film. The action sequences are fun to watch and the film breathes a certain Jason Bourne vibe. I should emphasize that this film is entertaining to watch, especially in comparison to films like Extraction and Safe House, which are just there as pastime without anything substantially entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dehydration,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this. With that said, I do what I can to give credit where it is due, and if something is well-done, no matter what, I will try to convey that it is, and why it is. First off, if you like conspiracy theories, you may very well like this plot(oh, and don't think about it much, it'll fall apart). There are a lot of twists(so many that at the end, you feel without any grounding). I think this is because Kurt Wimmer wrote it; and I think it would have helped immensely if someone else had helped with the action scenes, because I think they would have fared better in a stylized picture(like the ones he directs), instead of the somewhat realistic approach here(the two cause obvious conflict; it doesn't help that the speed of the martial arts gives up on trying to compete with the likes of Bourne from the get-go), and honestly, only about half of it is effective, and very little of it is downright memorable or outstanding. This is not his fault, I would say(Ultraviolet proves that he can craft amazing sequences, and I'm watching Equilibrium as soon as I can). He was an inappropriate choice for the tone. Noyce isn't bad(and he can certainly do one of these well when Tom Clancy is at least partially responsible for the source material), and we know he can deliver a popcorn flick that'll last the duration(and to an extent that is what happens here; this is intense, and I was never bored... not everything excites, though). The real issue is the lack of characters that you can really cling onto; yes, you spend this trying to figure out if Salt is ""good"" or ""evil"", and we're thus not sure who to root for. You can get away with anti-heroes, but ones that you have no idea about *for the entire thing*, that's going over the line. Dialog varies, most of the attempts at being clever fail. It doesn't help that the concept is hopelessly outdated. There are pretty cool guns in this. The chasing is excessive and often feels like it goes nowhere. Editing and cinematography is nice enough, and the hand-held is kept to a fitting amount. Music is appropriate. Acting is great, especially Jolie(who, in spite of being skinny, looks hawt) who truly does provoke emotional response, and to a slightly lesser extent, Schreiber. I like that they don't use ridiculous gadgets, and the spy-stuff has moments. The disguises somehow consist entirely of dyed hair, coloured contact lenses and/or a hat/clothes. There is a little moderate swearing, bloody violence and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to those who very badly want to see a chick kick ass(me, I'll keep my fingers crossed for more genuinely excellent ones like that). 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Who IS Salt? Nothing too special.,"A decent enough movie. It didn't strike me as anything special though.

The trailers for this put me off big time. It looked godawful. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. It could've been a lot better, and the first half was definitely the strongest.

Salt (2010),"Angelina Jolie is a spy on the run. Accused of being a Russian spy, she tries to sort things out for herself. The film does well in keeping her motives and character shadowy enough so we always suspect her. Schreiber and Ejiofor, two of the most perfect supporting actors, really make this look easy. Nailing the trusting and untrusting agents. The action is fast and heavy, with Noyce behind the camera, this all feels real and gritty. The violence was actually too much for an espionage thriller. It really pushed the envelope, but in ways that really disconnected me from Salt. Bond, Bourne, Bauer, etc. All managed to keep a certain amount of charm, humanity, or innocence in their performance. A bit surprising to find the female equivalent as a pretty heartless bitch.My main issue was the outdatedness of the whole cold war paranoia. Sure, the spy genre took a major hit when the Soviet Union collapsed, but I found it a bit too much to really feel any threat. Action good, characters OK, plot and originality very poor.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A action packed spy thriller with a twist!,"I always love watching the very beautiful Angelina Jolie on the big screen, so I tend to be biased in my review of her movies.Salt was a movie with a very unexpected twist in irony. I found it to be very action packed, and interesting in concept.The United States Central Intelligence Agency has always been concerned about foreign powers planting foreign spies in various government agencies and political positions, so they can secretly undermine Democracy. Could moles be in the FBI, or the CIA, or could they be at the heart of the High Tech industry, secretly embedding back doors and Key Loggers that upload passwords encrypted, in small packets not easily deciphered, into our governments and banking industries computers.""For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.

salt,"Filled with enthusiastic, attractive emotions, ""Salt"" is a vivacious, suspense thriller, which gives the audience the sense of venture and exuberance. ""Salt"" is a 2010 American action thriller spy film directed by Phillip Noyce, written by Kurt Wimmer, and starred by Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl and Chiwetel Ejiofor. ""Salt"" is a spare and lean piece of work; it manifest a modern action movie should be, yet it contains some ""errors"". With an interesting flashback to early 2000's North Korea, a semi-naked Salt who is accused by a defector of being a Russian spy is being tortured by soldiers in a dank-looking dungeon. They keep insisting she's a spy; she keeps repeating, ""I'm not a spy, I'm a businesswoman"". Proving that she is a Patriot, Salt with all her incisive skills struggled prodigious obstacles that increased the story's suspense;However, the music's choice and the movie's structure, which were directed by Noyce weren't as expected.The director,Phillip Noyce, had some minor issues that disrupted the movie sequence which affected the presentation of the movie.One of that problems was the choice of music it wasn't synced to the scenes that was played at that moment .The choosing of the story was perfected, but, lamentably, the movie didn't have a budget that supports such a story. Procuring only 110 million to produce a movie that needed a great number of equipments and work, the workmen hadn't had the enough equipment, yet they had a crew who with their countless efforts reach a huge success .The movie was filmed in an amount that does not exceed four months, from March to June. The movie was filmed in Washington D.C ,some parts of New York and Russia. Angelina Jolie had done a great amount of hard work so that she can be allowed to do the stunts herself and that is what she did. Although she had a small accident while doing a stunt, she returned to filming right after she had checked it in the hospital.Comparing this movie to other work, we could ostensibly recognize some errors in choosing the appropriate scene in ""Salt"". As an archetype, ""Taken"", which is directed by Pierre Morel, manifest how the scenes were adequate. In ""Taken"", when the father receives a call from his daughter that she is going to get kidnapped, this appealing scene evokes the audience in an attractive atmosphere. Directing the movie structure in an inadequate method, Noyce made tremendous mistakes in the scenes, where they filmed the movie. For a paradigm, when Natasha Chenkov(Angelina Jolie ) met with Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov (August Diehl) after killing the Russian president in a ship that didn't look like a ship who mercenaries live in. It looked like a place that was abandoned for more than 10 years. Additionally, in that same scene when she killed Daniel Olbrychski (Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov) and decided to kill all the remaining members of the brotherhood, she easily executed that by holding a few bombs and shooting 3 to 4 bullets, Which sounds unreal in our life.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Not bad for a Jolie action flick!,"I did not have high hopes for this film when I went to see it. I'm not a big Jolie fan really. This movie did do pretty good in many ways though.the Worst: Script was way too predictable. Some of the events just seemed silly to me. I had the plot twist figured out in 20 minutes. Some of the action for Jolie was just not believable by any standards, like the jumps. Her acting was predictable as well, really nothing new to set her apart. The bad guys had very little character.the Best: The action and editing were very good. The chase scenes and violence was overall quite entertaining. Jolie's fight scenes were good too. The sets and costumes were good as well as the camera work. Casting I did enjoy. I especially enjoyed watching the operations center and the CIA style procedures displayed throughout the film. It was very much like the Jason Bourne series in that respect. Non-stop action with a very fast pace.Overall a decent action flick though. Some cool violence and action. Was like Tomb Raider with a vengeance!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty decent action flick.,"How do you replace a male action star with a female? I mean sure, you can easily do it with a dramatic role, Glen Close or Meryl Streep could easily pull that off.....but an action movie? When Tom Cruise backed out of the movie, i couldn't understand why they would deciede to change the entire script to fit the role for Ms. Jolie, as opposed to finding another male replacement. However, if one woman could possibly pull off an action roll like this, it is certainly Angelina Jolie.Well, the first act of the movie is a little boring and predictable....not just because you've seen the trailer and know how it all starts. But because at first, it was alittle hard to swallow the idea that Jolie's character 'Salt' can transform from this sort of bubbly blonde agent, into this total bad ass chick. Not to say that she can pull off being a bad ass, it was more of the storytelling that didn't quiet add up.However, once this confusing and boring start was over with, the movie really started to take shape and become entertaining. What i thought started out as a ""Fugitive"" rip-off, started to mold into a pretty intense mystery action flick. And as the movie goes on, you start to realize why Jolie was acting so boring at the start. Now i wouldn't go as far as saying it's fantastic. I mean, it is still predictable at some parts, and the dialogue is a little on the cheesy side, but it is summer action flick, and it certainly kept my attention.Bottom Line.......yeah, it was a pretty nice summer action movie. I mean, it's nothing special, but compared to the other duds that have come out this summer, it was somewhat refreshing. And one things for certain, Jolie can certainly hold her weight in the big boy action movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt,"For a Hollywood action flick blockbuster, Salt is not bad to look at. A lot of that is due to Angelina Jolie's well done job.Salt opens with Angelina Jolie getting tortured in North Korea. Keep saying ""I'm not a spy."" Eventually someone gets her out of there and scene ends.Jumping back to present, Salt is married to a spider guy. She works for the CIA with Winter (Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor). Then she interviews a Russian defector and he accuses her for being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run.It's not an original idea to begin with. We've seen this kind of stories multiple times. That being said, Salt did a decent job of telling this not-so-original tale by adding certain elements. Won't spoil it.There are some flaws however. There are chase amd action sequences with quick edits and shaky cams that make people feel dizzy. There are sequences that are incredibly fake looking like the elevator shaft scene.It doesn't look that good but it's still well-paced and intense enough to be entertaining. If you watch Salt expecting some movies like 3 Days to Kill, you're gonna be surprised.It's perfect for popcorn fun. You shouldn't expect anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angie kicks ass.,"I liked this movie a lot. I hate to be typical, but it's nice to see a female character that is intense and raw like Salt, rather than the typical sexy, weaker female sidekick (though Angie is very sexy). Angelina Jolie is a savage. I'm surprised she didn't bite off anyone's throat (I apologize if that is considered a spoiler). Seriously though, I have never seen a woman kick that much ass in my life. She was pretty amazing. So if you are expecting the successful CIA one man show like Bourne Identity, you won't find that here. But if you are expecting comparable action with a weaker story, then watch Salt. In any case, who really watches these movies for the story anyways? I expected Salt to be a great action movie and I got it.This movie is really all action. My friend's main complaint was that it had too much action. Then again she didn't like 300, so psh to her.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I just had that feeling of complete nonchalance. And I wouldn't consider this a movie I'd end up recommending to someone to give a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ridiculous,"'Salt' is ridiculous. So ridiculous that the producers never attempted to make a Salt-Two; I say this because at the film's conclusion it's clear that the intent had originally been to continue to follow our female hero on to further heroics and acts of revenge. There are issues a'plenty unresolved. Murders not avenged. Issues that would require a Salt Two, and a Three. And so on.If what you want is to see Angela Jolie's character leaping from one truck-roof to another, this is your cup-of-tea. But if story means anything to you, even just a teeny-weeny-bit, then this film will drive you, as did did me, mad.What we have here is a Jason Bourne kind of killing machine (Jolie), employed by some underground Russian organization while she's working for the American CIA. The Russian organization's aims are vague as are her objectives. Motivations seem to change from scene to scene. We never really know for whom to root. And, worst of all, a whole lot of well-intended American characters are killed during the course of the film. But we're not supposed to care about them. Nope, our only concern is with Jolie's character but we never truly know whether or not she actually deserves our support.You want action? Ok, Die Hard. The Bourne series. Indiana Jones. Bond. But 'Salt'? 'Salt'? You gotta be kidding.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Hollywood Retreads Safe Territory,"Hollywood retreads safe Jolie = secret agent territory with Salt, a solid almost bi-polar film that can't decide whether it wants to be a taut thriller or an all-out action assassin flick and whilst it steadily balances the two, sometimes the tone wavers.

Salt is recommended if you feel like indulging in sustaining car crashes and mind-games, a considerably well-made film, you'll have fun trying to work out just who Salt is.

Nice performances all around but especially Angelina,"The first half of this film is particularly well shot and conceived, almost in the extreme. This director does what I enjoy the most and what some of the very best directors do, i.e. give you a visceral perspective on the very physical action. What's surprising is that Ms Jolie is up to delivering her part of the bargain because this is no Lara Croft excursion. It's far more suggestive of reality. Time and again women, and that goes double for beautiful women, have no real feel for violence. But Angelina definitely understands the role as conceived by Kurt Wimmer.Unfortunately, the film sags a bit in the second half and is more run of the mill there, though still very entertaining. Actually it's a good time to get a refill on that popcorn. But kudos to Angelina and the director especially, who do the genre proud. It's a fun time at the movies and Angelina is probably the first woman to successfully grab an action role from someone like Tom Cruise.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who is Salt? Better find out Quickly,"""Salt"" is an action thriller about a CIA officer named Evelyn Salt. After trying to interrogate a captured Russian person, she is then accused of being a Russian sleeper agent lurking in the U.S. With no other choice, Salt goes on the run to clear her name and so the question remains: ""Who is Salt?"" From the trailer, I thought it was so thrilling. I know, many trailers these days are thrilling even though the original film is horrible. But, it also looks interesting and I think ""Salt"" is an amazing action film that will blow your minds up.Although you might have some thoughts about the question or the tag line it self, the movie has many surprises than what you expect from the trailer. Maybe you expect this to be good but in the movie, he's bad. Some things like that. I'll tell you a tip, the main antagonist I may say is almost nothing what you expect from the trailer.The acting was perfect. Angelina Jolie acted Evelyn Salt like she was really Salt. It was mesmerizing. I loved her acting. No problem with the acting. Liev Schreiber as Ted Winter is a good friend of Salt. Schreiber who was Sabretooth last year was great now. He looked really confident and was really in depth in his acting. The other minors are also memorable. The acting was in a word ... amazing.The cinematography was brilliant. The action scenes were perfectly directed at any aspect of mine. The director, Phillip Noyce tried to make every scene enjoyable and the climax of the movie at maximum level. Of course, he needed the help of the music from James Newton Howard to increase the excitement of the film. The others like the special effects were simply perfect.If you know the plot from what you get from the Internet, that is barely telling you any part of the story. That is just the beginning of the story, not even a single secret out. So, I guarantee that when you watch this brilliant thriller on the big screen, you'll get surprised.To wrap this up, ""Salt"" is absolutely a rare thriller you might find these days besides ""Inception"" which was also a masterpiece. I recommend this to action lovers, people who love surprises as this movie provides many plot twists and of course, fans of Angelina Jolie when she's in action. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 and of course, thanks for reading my review. Hope you find my review useful.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Angelina Identity...,"A Russian defector, under interrogation by the CIA, exposes one of the agency's top operatives--a beautiful blonde veteran--as a Russian spy; she maintains her innocence, but escapes security anyway to warn her husband of the impending danger. Is she a spy, trained by the Russkies as a child into overthrowing the US government--and if so, where do her sympathies lie after her husband is abducted? Cold War revisionist balderdash, 'written by' Kurt Wimmer though seeming cobbled together from various (and familiar) action-adventure clichés. In the lead, Angelina Jolie shows up; she narrows her eyes in suspicion, she purses her famous lips in concentration. After rolling off an overpass onto a semi, Jolie's extraordinarily lucky Evelyn Salt is grazed by a bullet yet still manages to leapfrog through heavy traffic, later riding a police van off another overpass onto a taxi-cab (where she ridiculously walks away, unnoticed and unharmed). There's no logic to the film (not even crazy logic), and a character twist in the extended final reel is predictable. Those of us who were rooting for Jolie in her earlier, ""Girl, Interrupted"" days might be excused for giving up hope she'll become our next great movie star. She's the perfunctory stunt-woman here--and if that isn't Jolie but an actual stunt-woman on the screen, then she had even less of a reason beyond her paycheck to show up. *1/2 from ****",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A much better movie than I was led to expect,"Great show, although grim, and I'll probably see it again.I mainly went to see how Angelina Jolie handled her first action role post-twins, and promptly forgot I was watching the sexiest woman alive because of her complete immersion in the character, who was very often not sexy. This movie was more complex and psychologically consistent than I was led to expect by trailers and early reviews. The whole plot was NOT, as I had feared, revealed in the trailer.This is not a film that capitalizes on the actor's undoubted sex appeal; instead it reminds us why this actor won an Oscar. There's one scene in which the whole remaining plot cohesion hangs on the expression changing through her eyes while her face remains perfectly still. And she pulls it off. Although, judging from the number of (mostly male) media reviewers who say the plot doesn't hang together, a lot of people were focusing on the actor's lush lips at that point instead of watching the character respond (or not) to a significant event. Me, I was watching her eyes, and had a pretty good handle on what was going on inside the character during subsequent events.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I Tire of This,"I enjoy the espionage genre, in the light of films like ""Taken"" and the like, but this came off as laughable. I thought Hollywood was done portraying Russians as America-hating, vodka-drinking terrorists, but I guess not. The film has a few good twists, but none so extraordinary that i was in awe. And a lot of the action scenes are so generic, predictable and annoyingly unrealistic. How many times have I seen a CIA agent who leaps off a freeway over pass and land son a convenient truck? Not to mention the constant one a gent who always pulls the trigger first, who always beats the sh*t out of fellow agents with moderate ease. You would think our government would give all their secret service members the same training so that one of them would not be superior to whole squads of others. Not only that, but I don't care how sexy Angelina Jolie is, can any woman really take all that abuse? I mean over all it's just a popcorn flick, but I just tire of all this.A mediocre film I don't really recommend, unrated edition or not.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Salt - As in 'to be taken with a pinch of...',"About fifteen years ago the big screen became swamped with adaptations of comic book superheroes, both well-known and relatively obscure. One of the reasons for this was because filmmakers were able to take advantage of computer-generated effects whose sophistication rose in direct correlation to their drop in price. Today, with the superhero well more or less run dry, they've decided we no longer need to be fooled into believing the kid next door can develop super-powers when he's bitten by a radioactive spider. Hell, why go to such extreme lengths to justify the use of mind-blowing sfx? We'll just make the hero a medium-height, underweight woman who can balance on two-inch ledges ten floors up, leap from the roof of one moving container lorry to another, descend a lift shaft with acrobatic grace, emerge from a spectacular car smash without a limp or a grimace, and beat the crap out of trained men twice her size.The movie Salt is wrong in so many ways and on so many levels that it's difficult to know where to begin. Cynicism abounds – from the writers who believe a protracted chase sequence lasting forty-five minutes is actually writing (lets face it, the film's first forty-five minutes probably used up maybe three pages of double-spaced script) and that inserting an increasingly ludicrous plot twist every five minutes will divert everyone's attention from all the other plot deficiencies, to the leading lady who undoubtedly knows a lucrative little franchise when she sees one. Philip Noyce directs with panache, but then he has to in order to paper over all the cracks.In the film's defence, it's fair to say that probably nobody involved took it particularly seriously, and so the audience should really treat it the same way. Because it does provide a mindless entertainment, even though your neck will ache (unlike Evelyn Salt's) from all the shaking of your head as the audacious plot unfolds.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

You are just a TOOL

If you are surprised you are like the sheep who thinks the farmer is his friend because he feeds him every day
It is all to serve the purpose
When they are done your best hopes will be being left behind for the enemy to find you
Because unlike your entity the enemy values you alive now so they could know anything about the operation
On the other hand, your entity values nothing more than killing you after the operation because you don't have much to offer as an agent (they have plenty as good as you could be) while they have much to lose if you decide to talk for whatever reason either Your conscience wake up or you saw a potential opportunity to gain money or power
Their goal is not to let you vanish or disappear no it is killing and precisely doing just that

Though the star gave it all she got playing a Russian spy, she wasn't enough to save the film from its wrong pacing style and ridiculously bad plot. Being trained as a Russian spy since she was a little girl, Evenlyn Salt lived a secret second life all this time. She's married and has a dog. But she worked in the CIA, so I guess that's something. Given that Angelina Jolie played the role, we have high expectations that she'd pull it off with lots of dramatic scenes. And that's exactly what we got.

UNBELIEVABLY GORGEOUS STUNTS,One thing that stood out the most aside from Angelina Jolie's fierce performance as a dangerous spy was the stunt coordination. It was simply majestic. It complemented Jolie's persona in the most perfect way. The production was incredibly exciting and from the trailer alone one could tell that it was going to be an edge-of-your-seat blockbuster hit. It was also great for the film to establish such simplistic and direct background story for the entire plot. It was an example of great storytelling without giving everything away. I iust wish that the running time was much longer. It was a great homage to female-led action genre.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dumb as a Box of Rocks,"Let's all agree that Angelina Jolie is a beautiful woman. That doesn't give the movie a pass and her looks alone are not enough to carry it.

I knew we were in for a rough ride when the first 40 minutes had a bunch of Keystone Kops trying to corral Jolie and it was all downhill from there. Given her limited dialogue, Jolie is not half bad, nor is her supporting cast; however, the movie made less and less sense as time went on and the finale (no spoiler here) did not lessen my feeling that I could have been doing something more productive with my time....like cleaning the litter box or emptying the dishwasher.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Jolie is Russian?!,"I have watched ""Salt"" for a long time, but I still remember the positive impression of the film, which I will try to explain now.Looking at other reviews, the plot was most criticized, so I'll start with it. Well, the screenwriters came up with a story about a global multi-year plan to destroy America, well, they made the Russians the main villains and opponents, they composed all these events about a training camp for future spies - and so what? Why does such a scenario not have the right to exist? Now they are shooting such a huge number of films of different genres that, in my opinion, it is quite difficult to come up with something more or less original and catchy, and even so that you can keep the viewer's attention throughout the entire action of the picture! So, this film production, in my opinion, managed to do it brilliantly!A significant advantage of the film ""Salt"" is that the movie fully justifies the declared genre. A lot of effective charging action scenes, chase, shooting, bright struggle - in general, everything I wanted to see in an energetic spy thriller, I got it! The film looks in one breath, full of juicy and dynamic episodes that make you emotionally worry about the life of the main character. By the way, Angelina Jolie quite convincingly and expressively fit into the image of a CIA agent and was able to plausibly convey all the feelings and experiences experienced, as well as skillfully hide her emotional state at the right moments.Camerawork. Not perfect, but pretty good. In a couple of moments, there was a confused flickering on the screen, but in general everything turned out fine.Tricks and special effects. The stunts look very beautiful, the battle scenes are spectacular. Special effects don't show anything new, but they don't drop the bar either. The visual side of the film is on the level.Music. I remember it. The melodies are well chosen, competently merging into various scenes of the film.Dynamics. Here her film definitely does not occupy! All 100 minutes of the film are literally in one breath! Chases, battles, shootouts add unimaginable drive to the picture. Salt is a dynamic movie.There were also several unexpected plot twists in the film, and some personalities will actually turn out to be completely different from what they seemed before. The ending also turned out to be quite exciting and intriguing. Anyway, I was hooked! All the events looked very tense and held my attention and interest around them. It was a little sad in the finale for what the main character went through and what she lost, as well as how everything ended up in the end!Result. A wonderful intriguing spy action-thriller with detective elements and exciting events that are rapidly developing and holding the audience's attention with their energy. In general, the main advice to those who are going to watch this movie is not to treat everything that happens on the screen too seriously and scrupulously, and also to look for some deep problem. It's better to just enjoy the fascinating and super dynamic scenes, watching the main character trying to defend her good (or unkind) name! I think it's not worth watching for those who are sensitive and overly receptive and patriotic about Russia, as well as the exaggerated image of its representatives.Nevertheless, I liked this movie, I repeat, first of all because of the image of Jolie. If Tom Cruise had played the main character, the male character was initially doomed to look stronger and more masculine, and the mysterious empathy that I felt for the female heroine might not have been.In general, if you are interested in watching this movie, it is better not to listen to anyone, but to get acquainted with it, and then make up your own opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Was not what it should have been,"This movie was kind of enjoyable, but only kind of.Certainly not a top summer blockbuster by any stretch of the imagination. Salt was unbelievable and strangely unlikable. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and left little to be impressed by. The script was weak and the setup for the sequel seemed forced and contrived.Leiv Schreiber was good, as he always seems to be. There is something very watchable about this guy and hopefully his next flick will give him something more meaty to play with. Chiwetel Ejiofor was also quite good, but his lines and general part in the overall story were very poor and he seemed to be in there for just the setup for the sequel.Angelina Jolie was very poor in this movie. Perhaps because of the one dimensional, unlikeable and unbelievable character she had to play. The action scenes were particularly bad, as it was easy to tell none of it was done by Jolie. This is something most movie makers seem to get right, but in this film it is blatantly obvious that the stunts are being performed by a man. The biggest disappointment with the action is that Salt seems to be able to perform the actions of a superhero, and yet the whole time we have to believe she is but a mortal human being. It disappoints me as Angelina Jolie is a great actress and she has impressed me in many movies.This film is worth a look at, but not something you would choose to watch again and certainly has nothing about it to get you talking round the water-cooler.Could have been great, ended up very average.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Take this film with a grain of salt and you will have an exciting time.,"I only saw the extended cut and re-watched with the voiceover filmmakers' commentary so I will not be reviewing the theatrical version. The standard technology at the time of this viewing is in Blu-Ray and I will not waste your time with the description of the technology or presentation differences. The DVD I watched comes with the standard extras (more than most DVDs) and unless you do something the standard coming attractions.Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being pointed out as a mole (Russian sleeper agent) with a mission. This accusation automatically condemns her husband to death. So, Evelyn must go rogue to save her husband and prove her innocence. Yes, I know this story has been done before but never as well acted.Will Evelyn be able to track down the culprits before she is dispatched by her people? And she still has a good friend on the inside; at least someone willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and that is fellow agent Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber).The film has plenty of action, lots of great background music, and veteran actors that do not overwhelm their character's personalities. You may be able to guess the plot, guess the twists, and guess the outcome as they did not go out of the way to mask these two well.

Bourne would have salt for breakfast (on his eggs),"I shall keep this as brief as possible. The support cast do an OK job, i am a fan of Liev Schreiber, always underrated. There is a defining role for him out there, somewhere. I am not a huge Jolie fan, not since seeing tomb raider: cradle of life. (enough said about that abomination). Firstly i just don't buy into Jolie in this movie, she is way to skinny (feed her brad!!) to be a super agent, every time she takes a death defying leap I'm afraid she going to snap in two. The plot is fine, its only problem is it lacks a genuinely strong and believable actor to drive it along. Also the dialogue is dire, in the very last scene the conversation is laughable really. All i want with my movies is as little loving care and attention applied to the script. It should be a fundamental building block of any movie despite the genre. All in all this is a forgettable movie, the occasional big set piece, but absolutely no where near the class of Bourne Ultimatum.

Excellent Movie,"My wife and I just got done watching ""Salt"" and enjoyed it immensely. It was a great action movie and had great twists and turns. Yes, it was somewhat unrealistic and many posters are giving it a lower rating because it depicts a ""woman"" defeating all these ""men."" But come on, it's a movie. In the real world, it is difficult for a man to defeat two very well trained men at once, let alone several. Yet when Bourne or Bond do it, movie goers consider it ""realism."" What's wrong with seeing a woman defeating a group of men? It's the movies and it's entertainment. Angelina Jolie did a great job as Evelyn Salt and the plot left enough twists and turns to keep one on the edge of their seats. If you want to see an excellent action thriller movie and are not particular concerned about how ""realistic"" it is, you will enjoy Salt. We listened to the comments of people who sat in our audience as they walked out of the theater and many felt they got their money's worth. We did too.

Salt but no pepper,"This is a silly film. Unbelievable and fantasy yet set in contemporary DC in the post-cold war present. However, for the sake of a shallow storyline, audiences are introduced to Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who leads several agents through the streets of the metropolitan capital in search of her husband, a dedicated spider-specialist at the Smithsonian. After she is accused by a Russian defector of being a sleeper spy, Salt runs, leaps, and bounds over cars, people, trucks, and subway turnstiles to avoid capture by CIA spy guys who quickly turn on her in the the name national security. Why all these men are so easily turned against the beautiful agent who was so valuable the CIA traded for her release from North Korean capture is never rationalized. Nor, why no one ever bothers to check references by those who quickly rush to judgment over the accusations of the evil ""defector"". Nothing in this film bothers to have much credibility, it is simply a vehicle to showcase Ms. Jolie's ability to run and jump without fear of gravity and down shots of vodka with her Russian spy brothers.Believable is Liev Schriber as Salt's colleague/supervisor who keeps the hounds of investigation at bay, yet seems to have cornered the market on playing duplicitous government plants and credible agents. Ms. Jolie, beautiful yet too skinny to be a roustabout, is miscast in a film that tries to lead toward a future sequel yet is sorely lacking the basic structure of a taut compelling storyline such as the Jason Bourne films. Simply a chase and run film for the sake of car crashes and closeups of Jolie's stunning looks, this endeavor wastes time and money.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

There in lies the problem of how a 110 lb super spy might as well have super powers as she cuts through secret service agents, CIA, and special forces of the US government all while keeping her hair and make up done.This movie had a some what good idea of a cold war era plan still achieving reality, although the direction took away any realism leaving the viewer without any moment of suspense. No danger was ever truly conveyed to the audience as it didn't matter what peril our hero found him or herself in.Character development was poor as the audience cared very little if our heroes of villains lived or died. We have no bonding to any of the characters or chemistry showing they were anything more than robots obeying orders.

A total let down (In negative comments..),"I first reviewed this movie last week and was taken by all the negative comments - Jerky Camera angles, bad edited fight scenes, that the movie was too confusing and unrealistic.. I'm more confused over these comments than I am the movie. the movie was NOT confusing, nor did it have these jerky camera angles. If it did, I definitely did not notice them.. However, the fight scenes were edited too much to make it look like there was an actual fight, but it didn't bother me one bit. these jerky camera angles? Well, I can't answer that b/c I didn't even notice it but apparently others did.. the movie had a lot of twists and turns but was not confusing and kept you guessing the whole time.. now finally, these people who say the movie is unrealistic??! that is the most mind numbing comment of them all - b/c what movie is realistic?? If this movie was realistic, how boring do you think it would be? Movies are made like this so you could use your imagination and enjoy a good movie experience. Obviously everyone compares this movie to the Bourne franchise which is probably just as unrealistic! but this movie, without a doubt kicked major butt and I was so blown away by Angelina Jolie's performance as an action character! there is in my opinion no other female who could've pulled this off. I was wondering how this movie would be before i saw it about having a female as the lead role and blew all my expectations out of the water, especially as myself being a man. We are used to always seeing men play these roles - well this changed everything! she was amazing in this role and i look forward to her making another one! I also probably like it a lot b/c Leiv Schrieber is perhaps my favorite actor or at least one of them.. I admit i am very easy to please in a movie but no movie since Dark Knight kept me talking about it for so long after seeing it. Usually i'll see a movie, talk about it that night or occasionally here and there.. I saw Salt last week and I've thought about this movie everyday since and keep checking IMDb ratings hoping it will improve. A current 6.8 is not bad but this movie deserves way higher! it had everything you want in an action movie - A good plot, excellent writing, excellent acting and great action scenes! this movie delivered and then some! Usually twists and turns are annoying and hard to follow but this movie made it enjoyable b/c you just didn't know what to expect. Kudos to Angelina for probably changing the face of film and opening the door to more female leads in action film. Tom Cruise was originally selected for this role but after seeing her do it, this movie was made for her!! I can't say enough good things about it.. But as I was saying, what surprises me most are these negative reviews! I mean, am I that blind to all these people saying such things as it being so confusing, jerky camera angles, etc??

Salt Brings the Pepper and Spice to Make this Film Nice,"he Bourne Identity and Salt need to team up and have lunch when not on the run. They really have a connection and are in a similar movie just replaced genders. Salt is one of the better thrillers of 2010 and is not a movie that goes ape with twists and turns. It has a couple here and there but really its just a typical thriller. Its a movie that has fun with itself and thats something I look for in movies like this. A movie that can enjoy itself which can get dialogue when needed and give decent action sequences.Angelina Jolie has never been an actress I followed with passion. If something came out that had an interest level that was higher than expected with her, Id see it. But in retrospect I haven't seen more than three things with her name on it. Salt is one Im glad I did check out because I was debating Inception beforehand. Ill see it at one point, but I was looking for some slim and slender Jolie to satisfy. Rather blonde, black haired, or with a tomboyish cut, shes attractive.The plot involves Evelyn Salt (Jolie) a CIA agent who is recently uncovered by Orlov who reveals the plans of Russians who want to bring all hell to the United States. When Salt is said to be involved a brainscan is conducted on the man and hes telling the truth. The agent co-workers go on a spree looking for her and want to catch her as soon as possible. The action begins as we see Salt jump out of windows jump out of moving cars, run through traffic, tase cops, and so on. The action gets redundant, but after the CIA jargon scenes you want some mind numbing scenes.Salt has it's share of flaws. To begin with, like James Bond and the Bourne series the film has a lot of punching, slapping, and hitting in it. Which is fine, but almost no blood is seen, at least not that I noticed. Now, I don't want one punch to make the face explode in gore, but some blood dripping from cuts would be realistic enough. Im sick of watching action movies that that don't involve blood. We are supposed to believe a kick to the face leaves no blood? Also, its a shame that this film got cut to a PG-13 rating. If we got an R rating we could have perhaps seen blood, maybe some cutting, a sex scene or two? But for some reason, this had to be cut to a PG-13 rating. Honestly, I don't understand toning a movie down. Most notably Prom Night for being a PG-13 slasher film. Thats no excuse, no reason a slasher movie should be cut back to PG-13. Though, I must say, Salt impressed me and left me hoping for a sequel. After all, its not too late to get Matt Damon in Salt 2.Starring: Angelina Jolie, Liev Schreiber, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.

puh-leeez !!!,"A previous viewer was spot on when he or she said that no one with a mental age higher than 12 could enjoy this movie. Even action/adventure movies need some minimum degree of credibility, and nothing, absolutely nothing in this movie rings true. The story is the worn out cliché of a plot to get the U.S. and Russia to attack each other. ""SPECTRE"" in the James Bond flicks ran that one ragged years ago. And the James Bond flicks were meant to be viewed as cartoons, so the over-the-top charades in them could be enjoyed for the fun they were. The same shtick in a movie that wants to taken seriously as an action flick simply just doesn't work. It starts right at the beginning with Jolie's character escaping from a high security facility and jumping onto vehicle after vehicle from overpasses with nary a bruise, then later dispatching dozens of armed thugs with a few karate kids. Fuggedaboutit.The really depressing thing is that dreck like this can be swallowed by the viewing public.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Good Film, Definitely Worth Seeing...","Okay, so I was a bit apprehensive before watching this movie as had heard it referred to as a Female 'Jason Bourne'.I finally got round to seeing it and was glad I had. I'm now going to make a list of a few issues other people have commented on and give my opinion.1. 'A Female Version Of Jason Bourne'Undoubtedly people will compare this movie to the great 'Bourne' films. I don't think this is a bad thing personally. To say this movie has the same plot as the Bourne films would be untrue. There may be some similarities but at the end of the day if you watch the film to the end you will see the plots are only loosely similar. It does have a similar style to it though that the 'Bourne' films did very well.2. 'It portrays Russia in a Bad Light'Seriously, I don't understand how anyone can say that. The idea of this movie is to entertain, which it does. The movie is fictional, as in made up! So the films interpretation of Russia is irrelevant. In Action Movies 'Good versus Bad' is an important part of the plot to get you rooting for the Lead character. I'm sure there have been Russian films that have made the Americans out to be the bad guys. It's nothing personal, it just adds to the plot.3. 'Plot Holes'Anyone who has written reviews saying the plot has major flaws in my opinion is wrong. All you need to do is pay attention to the movie and watch it through to the end and everything will make sense. I actually enjoyed guessing the plot twists throughout the movie. Questioning the plot as you watch the movie isn't a bad thing it's simply done to make you keep wondering if she's good or bad.4. 'Bad Ending'I personally didn't see anything wrong with the ending, why not leave it open for a sequel? I definitely would like to see one or more. Why do some people think that everything has to be tied up in a neat little bow?! It doesn't have to be. The ending leaves it up to your imagination (something many of these 'bad' reviewers seem to be missing) as to what happens next or until they provide a sequel.5. 'Jerky Camera Work'The camera work and directing seemed to be spot on as far as I could tell. Why should the camera be stationary during fight sequences?! People move during fights so that means the camera has to also. Otherwise you'd end up with one dimensional fight sequences.6. 'How can Jolie's slender character dispatch trained agents with such ease'As referenced in the movie she is a HIGHLY TRAINED AGENT. With advanced hand to hand combat etc.. Special forces are trained how to take people out quickly, efficiently and use their opponents body weight against them. Also you see several times in the movie she gains leverage by jumping into the air and getting all her weight behind her punches/kicks. Which makes it not unreasonable to think she could knock someone out. As for them being trained agents the movie doesn't specify what level of combat training they have. You seriously think the average FBI/CIA operatives would be trained to the same level as a special forces field agent?! It's like saying an average sized Security Guard would be a match for a under sized expert martial artist. Her lesser weight class would not be an issue.So those were my answers to some common complaints from narrow minded critics.I highly recommend watching this movie. I've given it a 9/10 as it is a very good action film. You can't fault the Acting or Dialogue. The stunts are brilliant except one of the jumps from truck to truck was a bit to big to seem believable. The plot keeps you guessing the whole way through. Oh and of course who doesn't like seeing Angelina on the big screen?! Probably one of her best movies ever, second only to her superb performance in Changeling.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Just awful,"I mean it - it's really bad. There's nothing realistic about this movie, and I hate to repeat was most have said about the film, but it's hyper-violent with really no redeeming qualities. Oh, it starts in a promising fashion that had me thinking about the underrated classic ""No Way Out"" (back when Kevin Costner made good movies), but then it simply got more and more implausible and ridiculous as it went on. Ya see, I get it when The Bride in ""Kill Bill"" slices up a dozen or more Japanese guys, because it's a stylized fantasy that looks great and even laughs at itself. But this...well, let's just wonder why they aren't training U.S. Secret Service agents better. During the boring and predictable ""climax"" of the film (no spoilers), they even resort to the bit from the old ""Superman"" TV show, where someone actually throws a gun, attempting to hurt someone.

They thought Bourne with a vagina would make a difference (minor spoiler alert),"The truth is that there is a difference: clearly a big one. The Jason Bourne movies are just incomparable. Salt looked like some unfinished film. The basic story it's over-used and the only thing they added was another soap-opera twist after the relevant one. The clicheic storyline, the straight-forward dialogue, the obvious twists and the stereotypical development of the characters contributed all to the expected ""disappointing"" movie directed by Phillip Noyce. What's wrong with the story is that it takes all the basic ideas from great spy-movies like Jason Bourne especially and adds some basic new-age nonsense. The main character is Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie), some ex-Russian spy who along the road of her ""career"" decided to change parties and began to work in favor for (of course, as always) United States without them knowing about her past. The stereotypes are so vivid that it's almost impossible not to see them. The russians, again, are made to look like cruel and revengeful terrorists while the Americans are all for peace and fight for our freedom. This is the 21st century's biggest bullsh*t. Skipping away this political non-sense and getting back to the movie, one day some Russian ""ex-spy"" decides to reveal Salt's true identity to the C.I.A. From this point on the madness begins and each minute passes by things get worse. The action sequences are ridiculous for a ""skinny"" woman like Angelina Jolie is (and I'm sorry to say it but her days from Gia and Original Sin are long gone). I mean who could believe she would survive from all the falls and tortures and fights she goes through? It's just hilarious. The movie should have ended somewhere in like the first 20 minutes but no, Salt was somewhere close to Superman. It was painful to watch at times because everything was so unrealistic (remember the elevator scene? laughing my ass off).Besides the plot holes and bad dialogue, besides the stupid action sequences and terrible choreography the acting didn't helped the movie at all. Angelina Jolie was far from her older days, all we see is her sharing punches, shooting guns randomly, fight 3 C.I.A. agents at one time and shed some tears to make the audience probably feel some compassion towards the main character but what Noyce didn't imagined were the laughs in the theaters. Liev Schreiber, the guy from X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Repo Men played again the expected villain. I mean, was it that hard to not realize that by the middle of the movie? Other than the storyline and the average acting, the execution was also poorly done. What was with that chaotic camera-work in each chase sequence? Some shots were terrible and the editing was so by the book: no improvisation and no guts. The soundtrack was also off the tone of the movie. It has some key-notes from the Terminator's classic soundtrack which to me was laughable. Only two scenes were nice accompanied by music but everything else was cheap imitation.The ending of the movie leaves room for a sequel but I PRAY that they would decide to not make any since it didn't succeed at the box-office. And what about a couple of scenes that were in the trailer but were cut from the actual movie? Where was Angelina's leg in that dress? That's what I want to know? I paid money to see that also so... I left not 2x but 3x disappointed.Salt promotes itself as a serious spy-action movie close to Jason Bourne as far as the context but it forgets to deliver exactly the necessary. It's a good film to ""waste-some-time"" for the end of a horrific working week but other than that it's definitely nothing worthy of paying money for. You could easily skip it even if you're an Angelina Jolie fan.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angelina Jolie + Russian Spies = Amazing Movie!,"I heard that Tom Cruise was originally suppose to be Salt in this movie and I am sure glad he wasn't. We don't need another Tom Cruise Mission Impossible like movie, the change in gender was a perfect move. Angelina as Salt is perfect! She is the only female that could have pulled this off. I also like the idea of a female action lead, as we don't see it that often.Is it over the top? Yes. Is it somewhat unrealistic? Yes. But if you want FANTASTIC action scenes and crazy stunts- stunts that you have never seen before, you won't be disappointed. The plot is not too complicated but the number of twists and turns throughout will keep you satisfied.It is fast-paced and fun. Definitely worth seeing, especially if you are looking for an action packed flick, or you are an Angelina fan.

Bourne with Angelina: it sucks.,"I really loved the Bourne's movies but Angelina Jolie is not as good as Matt Damon period! Salt is a big disappointment. The character is lifeless and Angelina is not playing as good as Andy in Toy Story. I don't see why Hollywood bothers paying an actress so much when she does not act better than a 90's CGI character. The Avatars have more expression and feeling than Angelina in the whole movie, wearing a mask like if she was made in plastic or a bad CGI render.This movie is like a big fat burger, in the middle, you ask yourself if you will be able to finish it, and at the end, you want to puke..The worse in the movie is the wobble effect to the camera. Like in Bourne Ultimatum they use and abuse of the jerking/wobbling/shaking effect. It is like if you watch the movie on a boat. It is nauseous. This makes all action sequences harder to focus.Once you notice the effect, you cannot watch the movie anymore, it is so over used that you ask yourself why they did they add this all the time?Maybe wait the DVD, I think the movie will be easier to see on a TV screen than on the big screen for the reason explained before.If you have some money to spend, there are much better movies this summer. I'll see Inception again, Hollywood, you can do better than Salt!",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show!,"'SALT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Angelina Jolie, arguably Hollywood's hottest actress, returns to action form in this spy thriller directed by Phillip Noyce (director of such top notch action and suspense films as 'PATRIOT GAMES', 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' and 'DEAD CALM'). This, sort of female version of a 'Jason Bourne' film, tells the tale of CIA 'super' agent named Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who's accused of being a Russian spy, with a mission to assassinate the Russian President, by a Russian defector (played by Daniel Olbrychski). Knowing that the love of her life, her husband (played by August Diehl), is at risk Salt evades capture and goes on the run. She uses all of her expertise and experience to try and save her husband, clear her name and stop the assassination. The film is full of twists as we learn more and more about the assassination plot and the mystery of Salt's true identity.A lot has been publicized about how this film was originally written for a male lead and Tom Cruise was attached but he later turned down the role in order to do 'KNIGHT AND DAY', which many consider a big mistake considering 'SALT' is a much bigger financial hit than 'KNIGHT AND DAY'. Then it was rewritten for a female lead and Jolie was hired. I still think Cruise made the right choice; this is a better film than 'KNIGHT AND DAY' but that role was just more fitting for Cruise and a smarter choice for him at this stage in his career, regardless of how much money it makes. 'Salt' is a much more fitting role for Jolie. I'd much rather see a female lead in a serious 'balls to the wall' action film like this; it's more intriguing and a lot more fun. With that said who better than Jolie to play the role. She's an awesome action heroine, one of the best, and she definitely doesn't disappoint here. With this and 'WANTED' she has certainly established herself as the world's biggest female action star.On top of Jolie's performance there's a really suspenseful and action packed script. It does get completely far fetched towards the end but the action is so hard, gritty and somewhat realistic, compared to a lot of CGI summer blockbusters like this, that it doesn't matter. The directing is perfectly fitting to the material and once again there's Jolie. The supporting cast is all adequate, including Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor, but it all really comes down to the Angelina Jolie show. She's never been sexier, at age 35, and she really knows how to put on an 'ass kicking show'. That's why she gets paid the big bucks. She's a Hollywood icon and this movie is a great example of why.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4rYA-j3f3c",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ridiculous acting by Julie,Angelina Julie who looks like an anorectic woman is taking all of these large men who are much heavier and have more mussels than her. Looked so unreal that I could not get into the movie and the story because of that. She either should put more mussels on herself or this role should be given to a male like Mat Damon who is more believable on this kind of role. I don't believe that she is a good actress either. It is just publicity that she has and fools people by that! My husband and I did not enjoy it because of her stupid acting. I don't know who thought that she would be a good fit in this kind of movies. Story was very nice and interesting though.,1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It was like watching '24' with a female Jack. There was not a moment that I could sit back and take a breath. The suspense lasted two hours and I felt pumped full of adrenaline by the end. Sure if you think too hard it's improbable, (this is a criticism I have seen) but how many films out there are not?

The action scenes and stunts are beautifully crafted, and it was even better that most of the stunts were actually performed live, giving a sense of improved realism to the movie.However, what wasn't so good was that the plot for the movie was not exactly satisfactory. I won't give any spoilers here, but the general plot is that CIA agent Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) goes on the run after being incriminated as a Russian spy. The entire plot, however, did have quite a few holes, and sometimes does require suspension of disbelief. Angelina Jolie's acting was very good, and it pulled the entire movie up. The performances by the supporting cast was also not bad.I recommend the movie, as though it may not be the best in character development and the script, it does have many redeeming points, and is worth a watch if you happen to have an afternoon to spare.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Impressive action movie with a fine performance by Angelina Jolie,"I always regarded Jolie as a beautiful woman who was fun to watch in movies, but didn't think much of her acting ability. Well, this movie changed that. She gave a fine and riveting performance as a spy who is under terrific pressure by both her supposed friends as well as her enemies. She was very compelling to watch as an action star, and fit the role well with her athletic moves and lithe body along with her notable acting as a ruthless, cunning and deadly woman. This movie keeps you guessing, and has a good and interesting story line along with explosive action. Some people complained of many slow parts I noticed in other reviews, but I didn't see this at all, the movie runs at a quick pace and keeps the tempo high.

Salt It,"Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie)'s talent for the action heroine is obvious, her choice of plot is two decades too late. It is distressing that every aspect of the plot seems to have been drawn from some currently irrelevant Cold War cliché, and, in spite of the same, some of the sequences are barely believable. Cut to the story. An interrogation of a Russian defector reveals that the CIA interrogator – Evelyn – is possibly a double agent (why he gives this information voluntarily to the CIA at large is but one of the faux pas of the movie). In any case, Evelyn performs her dubious role admirably in battling the forces of law and order while fulfilling her near-impossible assassination missions through various decent to good action sequences, and suffice to say that many realities are stretched. When you have finished yawning through the Defcon II and suicide bomber and Universal Soldier-like sequences, the movie trails off rather ambitiously in the quest for a sequel. All the best on that one, Evelyn",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good tightly, twisting action flick","This turned out to be one of those over-the-top but real decent thrill-ride type actioners. Though there are those out there who just won't cut Angelina Jolie a break, even the haters can't deny that the girl can act. She's excellent in this film, about one of the CIA's top interrogators who's accused of being a Russian sleeper agent. It's fairly early in the film when the action begins and it runs and runs from there on. There's a good twist to plot much later on and personally, I like movies that let you try to figure them out as they go along, rather than force feeding you the answers with dumbed down dialog and screechy music because the writers assume the audience is too stupid to get the obvious story movements. This one doesn't do that. If you're not a fan of crazy stunt sequences that no one (in reality) would come out of without broken bones, much less survive, then maybe you won't enjoy this flick too much. Otherwise, see it.

All it boils down to is a misunderstood protagonist, who gives up her past for the ""greater good"". Furthermore, there is nothing you haven't seen yet, maybe a few close-ups on Jolie's face & lips. I found her huge lips more interesting than the whole plot. While on the subject of the plot, its flawed to say the least. There are more holes than there are in a swiss cheese. Since there is no story to rely on the audience has to fall back on mindless action sequences, one more violent than the other. One thing I didn't quite understand was what the movie tried to prove? It wasn't funny, thrilling, horror or anything. It was plain action, unbelievable action. I don't recommend this movie unless you would want your intelligence to be insulted.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angelina Jolie Pulls This Off!,"I confess that I went into this with doubts about Angelina Jolie's ability to be believable in this role - but I have to admit that my doubts were wrong. She pulled off the role of Evelyn Salt absolutely perfectly. Evelyn was an American child raised in Russia after the death of her parents, who worked for the U.S. Embassy. Trained to be a Soviet agent, she was repatriated to the United States as part of a Soviet plot to bring the United States to its knees at an undefined future date, and eventually (and, yes, too conveniently, ends up as a CIA agent, exactly as the Soviets had planned for her). Apparently the demise of the Soviet Union didn't result in the demise of the plot, which is eventually put into action and leads to a movie that - in addition to the great performance by Jolie - has sustained excitement, a lot of tension, plot twists galore and a completely bewildering cast of characters, of whom you can never be sure which are the good guys and which are the bad guys. In short, you're guessing all the way through this and really you have no way of knowing exactly how this is going to end.There are several truly unsettling moments scattered throughout this. Perhaps the two that stood out for me were the opening sequence in which Evelyn is tortured by the North Koreans after she's arrested as an American spy, and the scene in which Evelyn has to watch her husband die without being able to help him (and, indeed, having to pretend that she was completely unfeeling about it). The movie has some excellent action scenes scattered throughout. Yes, many of them are rather unbelievable (the scenes in which she jumps from truck to truck to truck to escape her CIA pursuers, and that where she takes over the police van stand out to me) - but that is, after all, the nature of the action genre. There's also a lot of pretty typical shootout action - which again means pretty unbelievable as Evelyn takes out pretty much everyone, but it's all well choreographed and truly exciting, and again it's the nature of the genre.I don't know if there's a plan for a sequel, but the ending of the movie certainly sets us up for a potential sequel. I'd watch it. This was a truly enjoyable, exciting and unpredictable movie. (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The plot was, in my eyes, pretty unpredictable and took many unexpected twists, the acting left nothing to be wished for and Jolie, once again, proved her versatility and talent as an actress. Now that I've seen it once I would really like to see it again now that I understand it better and knowing what I now know. There could be the possibility of a sequel as the end is left open.

Thus, as the best spy, my instinct warned me that this one would be a huge disappointment.Afterwards, this alarm is confirmed: the script is unbelievable whereas the action is good.Finally, you got a strange movie: the impossible stunts performed by Angie seems likely but a likely devilish plot from Russia seems Science-Fiction: JFK killed by a Russian twin, a threatened president protected by a small squad, a meeting of OTAN at the White House, a video game program for nuclear attack.In some paradoxical way, what's on screen is more believable than what's is told.As i never felt involved in this really bad script, the movie was dull and Angie couldn't save it this time.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Typical Summer Fare,"Salt is a fast paced spy thriller that keeps the viewer riveted to the edge of his or her seat. Angelina Jolie is well cast as the double agent Evelyn Salt. It is a challenge to think of any other actress who could do a better job than Jolie of projecting an air of mystery while taking on a physically demanding role. Like other films in the espionage thriller genre, Salt leaves it up to the audience to sort out the good guys from the bad ones. The plot is not too complicated that it will befuddle the audience but it has enough twists to keep them interested from start to finish. Salt has a noticeably short run time, just over an hour and a half which is comparable to a typical animated feature. Perhaps, the speed by which the story unfolds does not allow for more subplots which may not suit viewers who want more substance in their films. But as with other summer fare, this film is very much within the ballpark. It is highly entertaining with a big name star for a lead and is marketed to as wide an audience as possible. I would say that the audience does get its money's worth by seeing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An exciting movie you can watch again...,"This is a superior Hollywood blockbuster, engagingly told. Some movies out of America seem to court repeat business by telling the story in an incoherent way (e.g. ""Inception"") or by adding a twist that demands you see the movie again to see if it is consistent (e.g. ""The sixth sense""). Well, how about this...here's a movie you can watch again because it's a good story. Nothing more. Nothing less.Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt, a C.I.A spy. Her life is turned upside down when a former Cold War warrior, Vassily Orlov (played by Daniel Olbrychski) comes into her workplace seeking to defect in return for passing on information useful to the C.I.A. Orlov asserts that Salt is a 'sleeper agent'...someone working for the Russians and who will do their bidding...which will involve dire consequences for America.Salt does her cause great harm by running away, but not before letting her C.I.A. peers know that she is being set up. Orlov had asserted that their sleeper agent - Salt - was to assassinate the Russian President when he attended the funeral of the American Vice-President in America. The question becomes ""Is Salt going to try and prevent the assassination of the Russian president or carry it out like Orlov says she will?"".Almost an hour into the movie I was onto what the real state of affairs was and had formed some hypotheses about the characters and their motives. Which is to say that it was good that the movie kept me guessing for so long about what was going on.The action sequences in this movie are well handled. Cf the incoherent method used in the last James Bond movie ""Quantum of solace"". In fact, this movie comes across as being to Jolie what ""Casino Royale"" was to Daniel Craig...an entertaining spy movie. This movie shades the best Bond movies, I think and it also has the advantage of not relying on unbelievable technology like the Bond franchise does. Sure, it has some extraordinary stunt work, but nothing which makes you think you are watching superhero movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
draggy,"From the commercials, this looked like a fast paced action film, but it's more along the lines of a slow-paced action film. For the first 25 minutes there's all setup with no action, which I could have accepted if once the bullets started flying I found it entertaining. But somehow even the action sequences felt sluggish, and they are intercut with flashbacks and terse discussions that belie the trailer's promise of non-stop action. Instead this is stop and start action, and even during the most hectic parts it feels labored and dreary.Perhaps the problem is how seriously the movie takes itself. It's a ridiculous story with unconvincing plot elements and unsurprising twists, but the film acts like it's very grim and important, as though the director simply couldn't accept that at best his movie could be a fun piece of fluff. Alas, the movie is fluffless.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
loved it.,"I really did. Salt's heroine is interesting, complicated and for want of a better word ""awesome"". The storyline in hind sight is pre-posterous, but whilst watching, you're swept up in the interweaving sex appeal of the two leads, the meandering storyline and the high octane action sequences.Jolie as always is a solid and deep seeded lead, and with the support of Liev Schreiber who plays to his ""tough hiding a secret guy"" keep the film from falling where lesser actors may have let it. Giving Jolie the lead over a man was the right idea, she makes an hero that Bruce Willis and Tom Cruise wouldn't have been able to make. Vulnerable, but deadly and secretive may have been a stretch for there overtly masculine persona's. The direction is nothing you haven't seen before in the Bourne trilogy or other slick spy flicks, but the pace is relentless and won't ever have you yawning at any point.It may well be popcorn fodder for most and there may be some kind of misinterpretions of certain countries, but it is a work of fiction, forgetting reality and getting into the story will help with enjoyment of this film.By no means the perfect action caper, however one of the best I've seen since The Dark Knight.

Better we should focus on the actions and fights in the movie that are 'top notch' and with stunts unbelievable well done. We ran out of ideas and things got repetitive in the new movies we see nowadays, and it is normal to be so, but we do it better and better every time, and making a new movie with old subjects it's not a waste of time, instead should be a relaxing and enjoyable experience.

"Suspenseful, slick, daring....Salt delivers the punches","OK I thought this was simply going to be one of those - 'I've been framed' movies and discovering who is behind this whole set up thing. This is what turned me off from seeing it in the first place, but I was still intrigued, so saw it with a group of friends after celebrating my birthday.What a surprise! This was not only interesting but suspenseful all the way through. The action scenes have been criticised, saying they aren't realistic - for people comparing this to James Bond, come on - you think those scenes are realistic (aka: Die Another Day title wave scene?). This was well directed and I thought the soundtrack added a lot of the tension. In comparison with the Bourne films, well I don't think you can compare it on all levels because essentially they have different plot lines, different motivations and also Bourne is more about discovering who he is. In Salt, Salt knows who she is, but it is up to the audience to find out.What I think we miss nowadays are strong female leads in action roles in which the film has a serious tone, so it is a welcome refresher to see Angelina kick some butt. I mean we already had Matt Damon in the Bourne films, so I thought it was about time we had a woman. It was a wise choice to change the lead role (in which it was originally meant to be a guy with Tom Cruise, thank god it was changed since he probably would have made this really boring!) to a female as it gave it more depth and an added twist.The plot in short: Angelina plays Evelyn Salt, who works for the CIA, then is accused by a Russian defector of being an inside Russian Spy undercover in the US. Of course, Salt doesn't stand for it and ends up on the run, with us wondering exactly who she is.Yeah OK it's not the most original plot line (but what is nowadays) but the way it is handled is terrific, the action scenes are done fast enough to not make you notice the slight flaws and absurdity (which I think adds a lot to it anyway) of it. The truck trailer scene I thought was done spectacularly.Much has been said about the fact that Salt jumps from one truck to another then is able to run at fast speed again - well yeah I can see they sort of made her superwoman but I guess I didn't really notice it too much when I first watched it.I think they should have had a bit more quiet moments throughout the pacing; it pretty much jumps from one action scene to another, with a few flashbacks into her past, though more could have been done with character development. If Jolie weren't to star in this, I don't know which other Hollywood actress could pull this character off and have the same screen appeal to keep the audience rooting for her.There is one thing I am a bit tired of - why keep making Russians the villains? It seems America will never get over this love/hate relationship with them, so for all those Russians out there who watch this movie, well you are forgiven for criticising this movie, and are probably blaming Hollywood for Americans stereotyping them so much.Angelina never looked better as a black haired action heroine, and she definitely delivers. It is definitely a roller coaster ride that kept me intrigued from start to finish. The ending is a bit abrupt and was done for the purpose of a sequel but if the sequel dwelves more into her character, I'm sure it will deliver.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Totally hasbeen,"Let's face it - Angelina Jolie can not act. The only reason we shell out money to see her on silver screen is her exotic hotness and sort of senseless energy. Well, in Salt she delivers very little of either. I was with a friend, he's male, straight and nerdy - the very Jolie fan material - and he said DO NOT WANT. No surprise here. She looks gaunt and weak even for a trophy-girl character, let alone a cool action heroine. Her media persona also gets in the way. We hear so much about Ms Jolie that is really hard to forget who she is in real life and trust the character. You know watching a saintly UN ambassador and mother of I don't know how many at the moment, rush about and fire guns left and right is somewhat uncomfortable.Unlike many other fellow Russian viewers I don't feel insulted by the caricature way of portraying Russians in the movie. It is Hollywood, for God's sake, when did they do justice to any foreign culture? In American cinematic (or cultural, at large) mythology foreigners are either quirky villains or ""ingenious people"". You choose. I rather find it extremely funny that Russia still has that big evil image movie makers can cash on.

Totally absurd,"A totally absurd story without rhyme or reason developing itself in a series of not well explained, incredible or even implausible details. A CIA agent (performed by Angelina Jolie) is indicated during his interrogatory at CIA headquarters by a supposed deserter Russian spy as being herself a Russian agent and spy within USA. This leads her to run away and to a series of events full of goofs such as anachronisms, errors in geography, factual errors, plot holes and revealing mistakes. It's rather incredible the physical way how Salt (the CIA woman Russian agent) gets rid of several agents and policemen with whom she involves in physical struggle. The supposed Russian deserter is fake and he is working along with Salt from the beginning so we don't understand why he comes to expose her to CIA as the agent who has the task of killing the Russian Vice-president while in USA when in fact after evading himself violently from CIA custody we see that they are collaborating with each other. We can hardly understand who is with or against whom and why since sometimes some characters' behaviours are contradictory. And why is Salt's husband in danger of being killed by Russian agents since he is just only a scientist who has nothing to do with the film plot? The only positive feature of this movie is the technically well filmed some fights and chasings",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why action films are one of my favorite movie genres,"A Russian spy accuses Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent, of planning the assassination of one of the President of Russia.

I was enthralled with the fighting scenes, the car scenes, and just the whole action aspect of the film. Angelina Jolie did good with this one. Although the plot did get predictable, I was still quite impressed. Sure, it could have been a lot deeper, but this was meant to just be a fun action film to watch. It's really as simple as that!

Stick with Pepper,"Similar to The Hobbit, Bourne 4 finds itself in the middle of no-man's-land with little flavour to wet fans appetites. Jolie's latest heroine excursion as Salt proves to be less than substantial for those hoping not to find a film that seems to dither on occasional blasts of adrenaline, to twists which fall out of grasp to be tied up neat enough to be passable.Unlike Bourne's rediscovery of identity, Salt is on the run to clear her name and save her husband after a Russian defector accuses her of being KGB sleeper agent. Sadly another misleading trailer leaves an almost bitterly disappointed finished result. It never successfully seems to blend the style and motivation of Salt without going slightly daft in the plot to make the film more definable in its own right.Salt (the character) takes to new extremes, the lengths of modern day heroes/heroines. The change in lead (it was originally going to be Tom Cruise as the lead) has, if anything, shown Jolie again being superiorly capable in her role as a heroine with a deadly affinity with weapons. And while it may not have been satisfying watching the clunky plot unfold, Angelina has the sex appeal and grace to pull off what a younger budding amateur could not have done to the movie; make it (mostly) work.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

She must resort to doing seemingly acts of betrayal of her country in order to save it. She is then hunted down by the government however Salt's skills are so exceptional that they find it difficult to stop her.She is pretty much a reminiscence of the movie Ultraviolet but without the sci-fi and the disappointment. Milla Jovovich, although bland in her movie, would've looked more impressive as she is closer to actual Russian looking, however Angelina Jolie seems to be a bit better actress. Including video games and animations, there are not many that are of this caliber out there with a female action hero, perhaps less than a dozen out there.

No doubt the biggest credit in this horrid mess would be to Ms. Jolie's stunt doubles. Yes, the stunts are quite impressive but are totally negated by their overkill and the screaming ""Yeah right"" factor at at every turn. There is very little room for any true acting as a result, just action for action sake.

Tomb Raider meets Jason Bourne and no one wins,"Another entry into the superspy genre, this film stars Angelina Jolie who plays Evelyn Salt a CIA operative who gets framed or rather caught into action as a double agent. She eludes her American fellow agents, thwarts the Russian conspirators and smashes her way as a superheroine, superior to either JB: James Bond or Jason Bourne. Liev Schreiber is solid as her fellow agent in the CIA who sticks by her side. August Diehl is convincing as Evelyn's loving husband who never abandons her and changes her outlook on the world. Beware the superspy on a mission of vengeance! Phillip Noyce does a nice job of directing.So that's the good, fun news. The not-so-good is the weak script, weak plot and just unconvincing action. Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is a bit more convincing, more human character. James Bond made more than a few human errors as in his Quantum of Solace. But at least the action is terrific. Perhaps it reminds me of La Femme Nikita without the stylish director of Luc Besson and the vulnerability of Anne Parillaud. Only in the opening spy trade-off do we really feel for Evelyn. If it stayed more to that path, it would have made a much better film. The rest of the way it is a charade or worst, a farce. It's a fine movie to watch on DVD, not to pay $10 for the theatre but to pass a rainy day with nothing to do but watch a mindless movie with a plot retold a hundred times.I might give this film a 6 but it is so silly at times. Angelina's best action film was Tomb Raider. Here the writers decided it's Tomb Raider meets James Bond.

"Good action, with a dash of mystery and great pacing","I never saw 'Salt' back in 2010 when it came out, but I also somehow managed to avoid all spoilers for it. I remember the promotion for the movie being entirely based around the mystery of ""Is Salt innocent or guilty?"" I like a bit of mystery in my action films. I finally saw it tonight and it was an enjoyable experience I have to say.The plot of this movie is very well crafted and clever. The logic at times not so much. It makes all the police forces and intelligence agencies involved look incredibly inept and stupid. Usually these types of things don't bother me in film, however I found them especially egregious in 'Salt'. Making a terrible mistake once is one thing. Making it three times is lazy and unrealistic.The action sequences are very good in this movie. It is also electrically paced. The movie is over before you know it. Angelina Jolie was such a good action star back around this time. She was more than capable of carrying a film on her back.

All Action - but Storyline A Flop,"This is an absolutely absurd movie. From an intriguing plot line, the movie just doesn't deliver. There are holes in the plot that one could drive a Mack Truck through and not come close to scraping the sides. Far too much time is spent on chase / action scenes with no plot development. Unless one is fond of James Bond escapes, the action scenes don't deliver. Good fiction is the willing suspension of disbelief - the absurdities throughout the movie never make compelling watching. Salt's ability to escape time-after- time from impossible situations is possible only if all the security forces (American / Russian / Korean) majored in stupid.

Enjoyable summer action blockbuster with more than enough salt for the taste buds,"Angelina Jolie in the trailer speaking the line ""You think everyone is who they say they are"" sets the premise surrounding the mystery of ""Who is Salt?""The basic story is that Jolie plays a CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is happily married to her husband a German arachnologist. During work she ends up talking to a Russian who accuses her of being a spy and her colleague Ted Winter (a part played superbly by the reliable Liev Schreiber) and Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have to track her down. Meanwhile her husband goes missing as she tries to find him.Salt is a terrific film in a lot of ways. Jolie carries the part well. Just like most of her other movies when they are action like Tombraider etc, she does all her own stunts which are terrific and add an air of authenticity to the film without the use of CGI. Her acting is good as she also looks great visually and in a few flashbacks of her character being with her husband, you feel the emotional connection of caring about them as I felt the love between them. The action sequences themselves were choreographed well and was exciting.One other aspect I will say is the choice of director Phillip Noyce of keeping the allegiance of Salt in the dark was refreshing and made me think what side she was on. This kept you guessing. I figured it out about halfway through, but it is challenging as there are an initial few twists and turns that happen fast so you might be thrown off balance in trying to figure out who she is. With the film keeping you guessing keeps up the suspense and tension of what Salt will or will not do next. Some reviewers have complained that it is impossible to root for any characters like Salt in the movie making you not care about them, but as I said I think it makes it challenging for you to figure and actually engages the viewer.As to far as the story a lot of people have poked plot holes in it. This may be true but to be honest with you I wasn't paying much attention. It seems to make sense to me, but maybe I'm not as smart as some people, but I really enjoyed it anyway for what it was.A lot of people have also said the ending is a cop out but I think it sets it up nicely for a sequel, like a continuation of her journey. I look forward to the sequel if there is one and hope there will be more depth to Salt as a character as I thought the film could have been extended by another five to ten minutes with maybe some more flashbacks of her character. However my taste buds are already tingling for a Salty, hopefully Saltier sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
*Spoiler Warning*,"It starts out well as a great fast-paced movie with all of the action and extremities. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt who is a CIA agent and is completely out of everyone's league. Of course it's a bit out of whack being that she is a light, small, petite woman who can perform in ways no one else can. I guess that is part of the magic of Hollywood. She has the strength, speed, mobility, skill and intelligence of no other character in the movie. The acting was acceptable and very well communicated by the entire cast. Angelina taking the main role, Liev Schreiber, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Daniel Olbrychski, August Diehl, Daniel Pearce, Hunt Block and the many others did a fantastic job in bringing you into the story. The story-line is intense and keeps the audience interested on the edge of their seat, especially because it surrounds itself around the politics of the white house bringing it to more of a personal level. What I did not like was that in the end it left me wanting more. I felt that there should have been more closure.. but that's just me.

"Well Made Junk, It's a  Mindless Hollywood Action ""Spy"" Movie","This movie has about as much relation to spy craft as watching a Star Trek TV program would help you understand the Apollo space program, but without even the occasional social moral theme that Trek throws in . Nothing in in made any sense. Spies aren't killer cyborgs who can burst into a building and disable trained guards and agents with bare hands or improvise Rube Goldberg devices then deactivate complicated electro-mechanical systems as if they designed and built them themselves. She made Rambo look like a drunk college baseball player fighting in a local college bar on Friday night. She seemed to have the same mythical warrior invincibility as Alice the Enhanced One has in all those Resident Evil movies & video games. I realize that James Bond commando kung fu trained warriors are the norm in movies these days, but at least James Bond used to be novel and humorous, unlike our Terminatrix here.The climax involved a couple of Russian deep plant agents taking over the Whitehouse and president so they can launch nuclear weapons, natch. ""Whitehouse Down"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" had similar plot lines but there at least there was a whole bunch of bad guys, and lots of them were killed fighting the various security forces stationed there. But here one of the agents runs interference for our female cyborg by detonating a suicide bomb vest all of 10' from her, in an underground corridor. But our female terminator was barely fazed by the enormous blast. Or in an earlier scene, she stages this elaborate kill operation on the president of Russia in a cathedral in NYC where she sets up all sorts of stunts and booby traps in a place she was utterly unfamiliar with & had all of five minutes to set up the stunts that worked perfectly. Then she takes out 3 NYC cops in an SUV while in cuffs. Not just that but she used a stun gun to get the driver to shift gears, apply the gas or steer the wheel as if she tapped right into to his neural pathways with the zapper. That was so silly it even one upped the rest of the stunts; and it was pretty sadistic thing to do to some schmoe cop who was just doing his job.I watched it because the highway scene was filmed nearby and I borrowed the DVD gratis. If you like a lot of action but don't care about plot or even a glimmer of reality to the script, then you might like it.That being said, Jolie did well with her limited female kill-bot role. The black CIA Guy, Chiwetel Ejiofor, did well too. The rest of the cast, including wooden Liev Schreiber, were adequate at best. There is nothing I took out of this movie worth remembering save some well done but a load of ""impossible in real life"" stunts. Even the paper thin veneer of humanity and ambiguity most of the fawning reviews spoke of are flat. We knew she was some fancy Russian Manchurian double agent type, something about being conditioned in Russia when she was young by the same guy who ratted her out later. That had been established early in the movie. It was easy to predict that she was a good bad guy character who in the end wouldn't do anything very heinous, She'll just kill lots of bad bad guys but only seriously disable the good ones.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Awful,"""SALT"" is a cinematic catastrophe that defies both logic and entertainment. The storyline is an incomprehensible labyrinth of convoluted plot twists, leaving the audience more perplexed than intrigued. Angelina Jolie's performance, supposedly as a super-spy, is an uninspired and wooden display that lacks the charisma needed to carry such a role.The film's action sequences are a tedious exercise in monotony, with poorly choreographed stunts that fail to evoke any genuine excitement. The attempts at creating an espionage atmosphere fall flat, as the narrative delves into a realm of implausibility that stretches the audience's suspension of disbelief to its breaking point.Character development is virtually nonexistent, leaving the audience disinterested and detached from the fate of the lackluster cast. The supporting characters serve as mere plot devices, contributing nothing substantial to the overall narrative.The screenplay seems to have been crafted by someone with a penchant for confusion, as scenes transition incoherently, leaving viewers struggling to connect the dots. The film's pacing is erratic, swinging between moments of sluggishness and poorly executed attempts at tension.""SALT"" is a cinematic disappointment on every level, from its lackluster script to the uninspiring performances. It fails to deliver the thrills expected from a spy thriller, leaving the audience with a lingering sense of regret for investing time in this forgettable and poorly executed film. Save yourself the frustration and opt for a more deserving cinematic experience.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Greatest Female Action Hero---of ANY time!,"I'm not a action movie kind of person at all, but I agree with the previous viewer stating that NO ACTION MOVIES ARE REALISTIC. It is very true. That's why I never like actions movies, the car chase, the fights and all that stuff bores me. But I have to say that Angelina has that magical and mysterious aura to her that I really enjoyed all of her action movies since Lara Croft. I think she is a really great, and actually the ONLY outstanding female action movie star who can deliver the same heavy weight ""punch"" of action like her male peers such as Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson or The Bourne Identity series. I think her action movies are much better than her dramatic roles such as the one she played a mother who lost her boy set in the 50s in Los Angeles. That really ruined it for me. But after Salt, I'm a fan again! Way to go Angie!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"10/10 For entertainment, unwarranted reviews.","This is my first review for IMDb, as I felt compelled to do so after reading some of the .... reviews it received.It contains everything you could want from a film, excellent acting, a good plot, twists & turns and a large production. Yes, at some points it could be perceived as non realistic, but people have to remember this is a FILM! Not real life, I don't remember reading such harsh reviews for Laura Croft or Mission Impossible, perhaps everything that happened in those films are realistic? Why can't people watch a film without criticizing every single aspect of it. I agree on one or two occasions watching this film, you will think ""OK, that couldn't happen"" One example would be ""Salt's"" disguise to enter the white house, but that's the only flaw I could find in the film. Why are people criticizing this film because apparently it reflects Russians as ""Idiots"", once again it's a film! Just as many other films in the past have used other countries as the protagonist.If your looking for an entertaining action film, filled with twists and turns, superb acting and you have the ability to look outside of the box, realising this is just a film and not a historical documentary then this is the film for you! I personally am looking forward to a Salt 2, as the film seemed to end opening the doors to a second one, lets hope!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Needs more salt...,"Strange movie, no doubt about it. Angelina plays a spy that's confused (or not), about her origin. Russians are bad guys like usual, but we all know that for a fact, from western style action movies. Its East vs West in cinematography since the iron curtain. The approach, like everything Lady Pit does, all is superficial and based on actresses good looks. She not only fails miserably here, she even shows a signs of bulimia. CIA looked like a pushover. None of this stuff is remotely real and you can't feel the bond between the character and everyone else. Pit's wife tried to act like she was for real here, and everything went into chaos. Turns out, everyone knows each other from when they shared a diaper. Lame and totally stupid movie, makes Angelina look worse than she already is. I loved her movies back when she played nerdy, sexy, programmer and was in tune with youth needs. Today movies need to make a leap that will change the industry all together, not reminisce about cold war dinosaurs, but if Lady Pit feels like a dinosaur herself...in my opinion, she better disappear, and don't even think about fossilizing.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Instant classic, Love it!","Angelina shows once more that she is an extra ordinary action film actor! This is one of the best action films of all time and will certainly stand the test of time! Everyone involved with this film should be very proud. Every aspect of the film is exceptional, writing, casting, directing, acting, effects. The only disappointment is that there is no sequel. There is a great deal of potential for multiple sequels. All of Angelina's action films are great but I think this is the best. The story is very well written and not too over the top to be believable. It truly amazed me how Angelina and all of the cast make you believe and feel the excitement of this incredible adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good spy movie,I have always been a fan of Jolie's acting and once again she chooses a movie with substance. Wow is she thin though - I felt a little uncomfortable watching her and as a woman who enjoys I felt this was too unhealthy.The movie is well acted and I really enjoyed watching Salt's husband - he had small part but he played it very well. The actor is August Diehl and he has done more a lot more German movies - he apparently speaks 4 languages and was also in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds too.The story is solid and it's all about who is the traitor? We have a few twists; as for the ending well.....that's something for you to enjoy.Overall good movie; solid acting and good dialogue.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A top notch spy thriller,"Look for them and you'll find the flaws but this spy thriller has Angeline Jolie showing how good an actress she is in keeping us guessing which side she is on. The acting is excellent throughout.The opening scenes sets out the story the clearly for us with Evelyn Salt (Jolie) being tortured and then released in an exchange between the US and North Korea set up by her husband Mike. Pan forward two years and we find Ev and Mike in marital bliss when a Russian defector walks into Ev's CIA office out of the blue. Ev interviews him and within a few minutes everyone is asking who she is. A plot has been uncovered which suggests Ev is about to assassinate the Russian president. Whose side is she on? As in the ""Changeling"" Jolie plays a doubted woman exceedingly well, and there is some well crafted subtlety in this performance too, as Ev tries very hard to contact her husband whilst the plot unfolds.The set pieces are well executed, the plot twists cleverly worked, and even the predictable sometimes working as quite unpredictable. This isn't another ""Bourne"" movie but at times it does show similarities with the genre.If you enjoy spy movies see this film. Eight out of ten.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Action-packed,"I can accept any premise to a movie. What I expect is for the plot to unfold in a plausible way based on that premise. This movie succeeds in that respect. Agent Salt deals with every situation in her own way, bearing in mind she is a highly trained killing machine. People complain the Russians are pictured in a bad light in this movie. Duh, they're meant to be the bad guys people! Finally, as an action movie, SALT sure delivers. The pace is fast, but slows down at the right moments to let people catch their breath. Add a few unexpected twists (but still plausible based on the premise that the Soviet Union has infiltrated every echelon of the US security administration with sleeper agents) and this movie is very entertaining. Acting is reasonable, not that it matters for such action movies anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Salt is much better than I thought it'd be. I recommend it.,"The aspect that really made this movie work is the obvious love she has for her husband. By the time you finish watching the movie and finally know what was going on, to watch it again is to have an even greater appreciation for events and why Salt does what she does - then you start to realize how decent and well planned out the film really is. Jolie's portrayal of Salt and her ultimate ambitions really nails it for me. I must say I couldn't figure out her true motives for quite some time - a testimony to the cleverness of the plot.Granted some of the things she did in some of the action sequences were a little beyond humanly possible, but being a movie you really don't mind. And quite frankly, this is becoming more the norm on action movies these days. But in spite of this she had a very human and vulnerable side which was a nice touch - especially when on the run.And for those who are complaining about inaccuracy of Russia and Russians in this movie: it's a movie, not a documentary. This is a filmmaker's version of a fictional Russia and a fictional America. How easily some were able to do what they did on the American side could also annoy people who are looking at it as if it's a nonfictional documentary.Schreiber was convincing in his role, as was Ejiofor. Even August Diehl as her husband worked very well IMO. Very enjoyable - one I will be watching again (and already have).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Soooo bad!,"No, this movie is not bad, it is beyond bad. It is not near thriller and action scenes are poorly performed. And I had really low expectations because Jolies movies are pretty bad and she is mediocre actress but this film took me by surprise how bad it is. The begining is promising and I thought the story could be interesting but as far as it goes it becomes more stupid. Do not waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, fun, and I hope there is a sequel","Well, many gave this bad reviews because it was not ""realistic."" I think consumers of movies can no longer just watch a movie and be entertained. Everything has to be real to them in spite of the fact that everything that happens on the big screen is not real.No, perhaps it wasn't a ""realistic"" representation of Russia. So what? Another reviewer criticized the Russian names they used for the characters that they were not authentic enough. So what? Sounded convincing enough for me.I think Jolie pulled it off as a hard-edged spy. Her performance was actually quite good and I was surprised that a female lead could come off like she did in this type of role. Liev Schreiber also put on a very convincing performance as Ted Winter.The plot kept you guessing until the end who was the bad guy and who was the good guy. Good twist to the plot.Lots of action, there really was not a lull in moving the plot forward. It was entertaining to see how Salt kept getting out of her predicaments thinking on her feet and using creativity.One reviewer criticized how ""unrealistic"" is was for her to be climbing around the outside on of a 20 story building along the window ledges. It was interesting to learn in the Special Features that she did most of the stunts and that she was actually walking the ledges in real life! (Yes, she was connected to a thin safety cable, but still...) No green screen, no CGI, she was doing if for real. So it was entertaining to read that review accusing it of being unrealistic and hokey. (Open mouth, insert foot.)I was entertained and felt that I got my money's worth. I appreciated the fact that the Theatrical Cut kept more of the graphic violent scenes off-camera. If you want more blood and detailed gore, watch the Extended and/or Director's Cut.I hope there is a sequel. An interesting premise has been setup for it. I recommend viewing this movie. Lots of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pretty good action flick,"Why so many haters of this film, what are you expecting? I'm pretty cynical and critical but I know when NOT to take a movie so seriously. Lighten up all you factual geeks...so Russia isn't like that these days (isn't it??? oh yeah Putin is such a nice chappie eh?), or in real life this wouldn't happen and that wouldn't happen!!! For Gawds sake it's an action movie like those before me have already said...it's mean't to take you out of your miserable mundane existence...took me out of mine for a few minutes...what more do you want? I'm asking myself if my IQ has dropped down a cliff overnight...nope...you haters must all have HUOWGE IQs is all I can think!?!? Or maybe you just take life too seriously. I've seen some pretty bad movies in my time and this isn't one of those where I wish I could have my time back please and thankyou!

Turgid Spy Schtick,"They almost made it. So close! One more impeccably choreographed, operatic action sequence....one more whip-lash plot twist...one more peel-off of the latex facial disguise...one of any of these and Salt tips the scales to become a full blown parody, whether it wants to or not. And, my god, did you SEE that disguise? Straight out of the SNL skit footlocker. Simply awful...and hilarious.Alas, Salt didn't quite tip the scales, though...which left me in the somewhat unsatisfying position between being unable to take the film seriously and, then again, unable to give it a full-bodied Mystery Science Theater 3000 scoffing. And so....The Urban Dictionary has an interjection which accurately describes the feeling upon following through to the credits on this film.
