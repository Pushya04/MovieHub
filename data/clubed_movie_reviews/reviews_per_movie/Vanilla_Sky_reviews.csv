"Frightening, sad, touching and so underrated","I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. Regardless of what you have heard about it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Tom Cruise's most underrated movie,"It is too underrated and that is unfortunate; it has suspense, drama, and Tom Cruise's performance is excellent; it is highly recommended.Its score of 4.5 on Filmaffinity is completely RIDICULOUS.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
What a mindblower.,"There is not a single movie that blew my mind more than Vanilla Sky, even after watching it for the second or maybe third time. Until half an hour passed, you understand almost everything that is happening, but then you get lost on purpose, the director wants you to get lost, just like Tom gets lost in his life. He drives you left and right, up and down, your starting to lose your patience with the movie and then, pop, your back in the driving seat again, why ?, because wow, you just understood something, you connected a few puzzling scenes and your feeling confident about the movie again. You feel for Tom, you are feeling sad like all of that is happening to you, not in some movie that already lost you a few times, but managed to get you back in the last moment. The ending explains it all, makes everything so perfectly clear, but many things leave you feeling pointless about the movie now, and that is why I don't like the ending. It is to sci-fi, to unreal and to supernatural to be implemented as an ending for this beauty.. but I guess there was not a better option to end the movie then this one...",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
When the dream of a life becomes a nightmare.,"Director Cameron Crowe strikes gold with an intelligent, erotic and frustrating romantic drama. This is one of those love or hate movies. I absolutely love it. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a multi-millionaire that seems to have the whole world by the tail. Inheriting leadership of a multi-faceted publishing business at such a young age has not endeared him with the seven member board of directors. His womanizing is legendary and subject to much speculation. He is stalked by an obsessive lover(Cameron Diaz)and his life soon becomes very scrambled when he meets an attractive Penelope Cruz at his birthday party. The Diaz character gets fed up with competing for lover boy's affection and decides to commit suicide by driving off of a bridge with him in the car. Aames is left disfigured and charged with murder.Whirlwind flashback sequences accompanied with a tremendous soundtrack pace this mind wrecking, nerve snarling, and confusing, but interesting piece of storytelling. Cruise is totally in control of his talents. This is one of his best performances. Miss Cruz is adequate and highly overrated. The perky, gorgeous Diaz is sexy and haunting. Kurt Russell is compassionate and strong as Dr. McCabe. Jason Lee is underrated and deserves kudos for his part as the best friend of the egotistical lead character that seems to always be there to be s**it on and humiliated.The star studded soundtrack features music by R.E.M., Peter Gabriel, Jeff Buckley, Nancy Wilson, Bob Dylan and the haunting movie theme song ""Vanilla Sky"" by Sir Paul McCartney. This project also features the singing debut of Miss Diaz singing ""I Fall Apart"" written by Cameron Crowe and Nancy Wilson.Like this one or not; understand this one or not...this movie will give you something to contemplate and more than enough to talk about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Good movie but suffers from the same minor problems as the original.,"The original ""Abre los ojos"" was a great but not perfect movie. It had a bit of a dragging beginning and especially middle-part. Unfortunately this remake suffers from the same problem and is even a bit worse with its dragging parts. In the first hour and an halve it's still mainly unclear where the movie is heading to and makes perhaps a bit of a pointless impression. Just like in the original, the ending compensates for this even though the ending for this movie isn't build up as a good and executed as in the original was the case.Yes, it's a pointless remake. ""Abre los ojos"" is perfectly watchable for everyone. You don't have to be a fan of European cinema to enjoy that movie. The original is also just a tiny bit better but that doesn't mean that ""Vanilla Sky"" itself is a bad movie on its own. It has some great acting performances from Tom Cruise and especially Cameron Diaz in it. Quite honestly, I have never seen Diaz acting better in any other movie. Other well know actors in this movie are Pen√©lope Cruz (who reprises her role from the original but she isn't halve as good in this movie as she was in the original.), Kurt Russell, Noah Taylor, Jason Lee and Timothy Spall with who Cruise later teamed up again for ""The Last Samurai"".The atmosphere is good. New York is the perfect background for the movie its story. The story is good and surprising enough for everyone to enjoy even though at times it tries too hard to be confusing.It's a good movie but you're still better of watching the original. Are the many difference between this movie its story and that of the original? Hardly, both movies are very similar with the story, sequences and even dialog. Still ""Abre los ojos"" is a better movie because it builds up the story and characters better and has a better, more powerful and surprising executed ending.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
I still say It's the Vanilla Sky at sunset these days,"This movie was so divisive. People either loved it or despised it. You can either accept the ending or you can't. The movie really makes you think and wonder, ""what's going on?"" You are not always supposed to know what is going on. A lot of people do not want to have to think too much lol. Great movie, good soundtrack. I love rarely when movies change the way you listen to a song. Good Vibrations by the Beach Boys came across in the moment as so eerie, I still think of that now when i hear it. It is a movie that is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This was a weird thriller... but I liked it!,"I remember liking it when I saw it way back then and I enjoyed it again upon recent viewing. I never knew it was a remake and still haven't seen the original so I can't compare but Vanilla Sky on its own is a pretty solid movie. It is very strange in its pacing and cinematography but it didn't bother me or felt boring as these exercises in style often do. Great thriller with very good acting performances overall, and unhinged Tom Cruise was the perfect guy for this crazy role in this crazy movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"It can be hard to follow, but it's watchable.","David Aames Jr, a wealthy, carefree stakeholder in a massive publishing firm is accused of murder, he recounts his tale to A Police Psychologist, and explains that he was almost killed by a jealous lover, what's reality, what's fantasy?Vanilla Sky always seems to pop up on various lists of worst films, worst Tom Cruise films, worst remakes etc, but the reviews here are generally favourable, and the score is pretty high, as it stands it has a higher rating than The Firm, a Cruise thriller that's generally well liked.I don't think it's casual viewing, it's not a film you can pop on to chill out to, or have on just in the background, you need to be concentrating, or you won't have a clue what's going on, even if it has your full attention, you will be scratching your head a few times.It's not the easiest film to follow, it's definitely complex and twisted, David isn't sure what's reality or fantasy, the same can be said for the viewer I guess, it's not exactly straightforward.I love that scene where Tom Cruise leaves his apartment and enters into an empty street, it's wonderfully surreal and trippy, it looks great.I liked the lead performances, I think Cruise does a good job, as do Cruz and Diaz, I liked the supporting cast also, the likes of Timothy Spall and Kurt Russell are very good.Overall, I get why some don't like it, some elements of it are pretty frustrating, but I quite enjoy it still, it deserves points for complex storytelling.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
An ethereal classic of emotion and visual splendour,"Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky leads you on an incredibly picturesque journey into the life of a wealthy publishing heir, played with impressive emotional heft by Tom Cruise. He once had an idyllic life that gave way to some tragic events, and is now in a way station of existential despair, lamenting his sad tale to a sympathetic psychiatrist (Kurt Russell) and daydreaming of his gleaming past. Crowe's films always have an impossibly bright, strikingly beautiful sheen in their composition, displayed here by a distinct urge to forge the melodrama, and melancholy not with dark, muted tones like some craftsmen might, but to keep a vibrantly lit, dreamy aesthetic that never lets go of beauty, even in dark places. Cruise is forced to contend with a jilted, unstable lover (Cameron Diaz) whilst pursuing his angelic dream girl (Penelope Cruz) into realms of thought, feeling and action that ripple through his life like scintillating reflections in a sunlit meadow pond. I'm purposefully being vague and poetic as not to disturb the veil hanging over plot and resolution, for the surprises which lay in wait for you are a riveting rop-a-dope and should be explored with a blank canvas of expectation and complete lack of any previous knowledge about the story. The supporting cast sees very memorable work from Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, Alicia Witt, Tilda Swinton, Michael Shannon, Ivana Milicivec, Johnny Galecki, W. Earl Brown, Tommy Lee and Noah Taylor. Cruise is compelling, finding the confused soul in his creation, Diaz scares wonderfully as the unpredictable live wire, but Cruz steals the show with her usual sweet disposition. This film is based on a Spanish one called ""Abre Los Ojos"" which also starred Cruz in the same role she plays here. This, however, is the superior version, for me a masterpiece and a personal favourite. Crowe makes poetry of light and colour, painting visual splendour that flows flawlessly in tandem with the achingly beautiful soundtrack, another aspect of film he always excels in. And as for the deep well of secrets that is the story? I'll tell you in another life, when we are both cats.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Kind of lost me.,"I thought that the premise and some elements of David's story felt compelling and worthy of my interest...up to a certain point. It eventually lost me when more and more details emerged and with what was really going on with him. It was basically a photocopy of the Matrix with less action (which many films were at that point in time but ended up not being really as cool). Plus, I'm normally a big fan of Tom Cruise and admire both his physical roles and roles involving just acting and dialogue, however even I have to admit that he comes across as a arrogant and egotistical character in this movie who's not very worthy of my sympathy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Open your eyes and you will notice the mistakes,"Abre Los Ojos was a great film, with solid performances, haunting atmospherics and a unexpected, original ending. Vanilla Sky is the remake, a film that tries to copy Abre Los Ojos and fails rather miserably.In fact, you can say it very simple : if you have only watched Vanilla Sky, than you're in for a movie that reaches some nice intellectual heights for an American movie with an original ending. But, if you see this movie and then see the original (or if you had already seen that one), Vanilla Sky suddenly becomes a quite lame movie. Which is a shame actually, because I like Tom Cruise and certainly because he has given the attention to Amenabar he deserves. Cruise has always been to me one of better actors in America. But Cruise should have known that the quality of the original could never have been injected in the remake. There are a lot of things which make the original better, but now I'm going to give the 3 main points why this movie is way underneath the original :1)the performances : how hard Cruise tries, he never puts as much tragedy and quality in his role as Eduardo Noriega. But this goes for every actor here (also Cruz, who had a more sharp, vivid character in the original)2)the approach : the original is more scary, leaves more to the imagination of the audience and has a better ending (yes, vanilla sky manages to remove some of the intensity of the original ending!!)3)the music!!! : although the songs on their own are good (2 songs from my fave band REM), the music is just totally inappropriate and actually ruins some of the scenes. you know what i'm talking about when you can compare the 2 moviestherefore 1 advice : just go see Abre Los Ojos and wait until Vanilla Sky comes on television, late at night. Ironically, that's what the special featurette on the VHS edition suggests!!!",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Engaging psychological tale,"Recently the BBC in UK held a poll for worst film ever, and while Titanic *won*, this came 4th. I just don't understand how anyone can dislike this movie...Vanilla Sky is a dark psychological drama about dreams, reality and 'what might have been'.Tom Cruise is Dave, a yuppie who has it all. He has a 51% stake in his father's company, therefore the majority shareholder, and constantly finds himself in a battle to main his control over the '7 dwarves' who make up the rest of the board. His personal life is a mess, with a shallow relationship with Julie (Cameron Diaz) the closest he gets to love, while his best friend Brian (Jason Lee) who adores Julie sticks by him regardless.However, on holding a birthday party he's introduced to Sofia (The perfect Penelope Cruz) and falls instantly for her.This is all very well but the plot is parallel to a side story of Dave wearing a white mask in a cell with Dr McCabe (Kurt Russell) who's accusing him of murder and wants to understand why it happened.Dave begins on a journey to make sense of his life.I admit there is a 'Hollywoody' feel to this film, and given it's a remake of a Mexican/Spanish original also featuring Penelope Cruz it's probably disappointing to purists. But only viewing this on its own terms I absolutely love this movie. It keeps you guessing, and the ending is very conclusive.It may not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Yet another pointless remake.,"If English speaking cinema-goers could learn how to read subtitles, we would be spared having to watch remakes of films that were made perfectly well in the first place. There is nothing particularly wrong with Crowe's version, and if it had been an original piece of work I would be hailing it as a challenging, left-field, atypical Hollywood product. However, comparison has to made with Amenabar's film, which in my opinion is superior in almost all aspects. The main protagonist of ""abre los ojos"", Cesar, is an unlikable character, whom it is difficult to warm to. Contrast this with Cruise's David, all of whose actions have some reason other than his being a spoilt playboy. Crowe, who is a filmmaker I admire, has lost all the ambiguity, and a good deal of the mystery, of the Spanish original. He spells out everything,as if a multiplex crowd could not be expected to draw its own conclusions, or even leave the theatre without any conclusion. I would compare this to ""Donnie Darko"", where the movie seemed so much better before everything was clarified on the DVD release. So my wish for Hollywood is to stop plundering other nations' film archives, and for English speakers to overcome their prejudices against movies in other languages.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Open Your Eyes,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the great 1997 movie, Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you won't be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Odd but interesting.,Tom Cruise has done his career no harm over the last 3 years with the choice of films he has decided to do and Vanilla Sky is no exception although it's by no means his best. This is an odd film that is confusing for the most part but it's not a film that you can say is dull. It does have you guessing right to the end as to what is happening. Is he dreaming? Is he going mad? Is it actually happening? In the end the answer didnt really matter as the film was unique and highly watchable and very well acted. Penelope Cruz looks stunning and her acting is of the highest order and charms the viewer nearly as much as she Charms her on and off screen boyfriend. 7 out of 10.,7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Now I want to See The Original,"A nice convoluted and confusing story told solely from the perspective of David Ames (Tom Cruise). I enjoyed the ride and it was much better when I let it unfold in front of me instead of trying to work out what was going on.I found Tom Cruise character thoroughly unlikable and I never warmed to him as the rich kid trying to be in love after an horrific car accident. It just seemed in every scene TC was hogging the screen and not letting Cameron Diaz cut loose as the over the top stalker or Jason Lee use his cutting subtle wit do it's thing. The scene in front of the doctors was cringe worthy and showed TC at his overacting best. Sorry, didn't buy it.It's a 5 for a glorious Cameron Diaz in a deliciously evil persona and Jason Lee holding his own. It's also a 5 because it makes me want to see the original Spanish version.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Picks Up Steam As It Moves Along,"After the first hour or so of this movie I was thinking ""this is truly bizarre."" I was finding it very difficult to follow and in all honesty not particularly interesting. But it does get better as it moves along, and by the end of the movie it had actually turned into a decent sci-fi adventure whose ending I was really very interested in.The story, as I suggest, is a bit confusing in the first hour or so and it takes some real commitment to stick with it, but it's helped along by better than average performances from the main leads - Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz. The love triangle that's represented by the three is a bit of a mystery, particularly the nature of the relationship between Cruise and Diaz, and how that relationship ends is quite shocking and was the point at which I really started to sit up and pay close attention. From there on it's interesting to watch as Cruise tries to sort out fantasy from reality and comes to terms with his ultimate fate and the decision it leaves him with.Overall this is a better than average movie; a bit long perhaps, but worth the time to watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"so much promise, unfulfilled...","This could have been a great movie, or at least a very good movie. Instead it ends up being merely an interesting so-so flick. Basic plot - David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a playboy millionaire living the good life, sleeping with his friend Julianna (Cameron Diaz) and playing tennis with his buddy Brian (Jason Lee). At a party he snubs Julianna and falls in love with Sofia (Penelope Cruz). Julianna exacts revenge by running her car off a bridge with herself and David inside, killing herself and disfiguring David. Weirdness ensues.The movie tries to be a psychological thriller/drama, but moves way to slow. It loses its way distracted by scenes that don't advance the mystery, tension or plot. At around 150 minutes, the movie runs close to 30 minutes too long. Tightening up the movie would have done wonders for it, really.The second major problem is the music - I've no idea what Crowe was thinking here. The music at parts is too loud and actually distracts from some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie.The ending of the movie also left me feeling rather cheated. With a mystery like Mulholland Drive all the pieces start to come together and you see it all fall into place. Vanilla Sky is reduced to having one of the characters go into a ten minute speech explaining the entire 140 minutes that came before. Ugh.In closing - a simple re-editing could improve the quality of the movie by a lot, removing the annoying soundtrack during certain scenes would help a little. Maybe we can hope for a new cut of the film when it hits DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Made me think,"""Vanilla Sky"" was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather, ""Abre Los Ojos"" was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. I wasn't disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I couldn't get it off my mind. The whole idea of it just blew me away. The ending, was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The cast, superb. It was an all around wonderful movie.

"Better than expected, still doesn't hold a candle to the original though","""Vanilla Sky"" suffers from a bit of mainstream Americanalization. (Is that a word? I don't think so, but oh well.) It's the US taking a popular and successful foreign film (the Spanish ""Obres Los Ojos,"" a.k.a. ""Open Your Eyes"") and re-working it with... Tom Cruise in the lead? ""Vanilla Sky"" is, then, the ultimate clich√© of the America/remake fascination inherent in most mainstream Hollywood films these days. People on this site love to bash Hollywood for doing this - they consistently take foreign films and remake them with popular American names. Casting Cruise is a bit too much of a clich√© to be true. He's America's most popular actor alive (statistically, anyway).Surprising, then, that the movie isn't bad. In fact, it's quite good, at least in a watchable sort of way. Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original, Cameron Crowe (""Fast Times"" scribe and ""Jerry Maguire"" director) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume.The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz, returning to her role in the Spanish film, only this time playing it in English. And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder, ""Why did they cast her?"" Plus, and maybe this is just me... but I don't find her very attractive. Between her and Diaz, I'd take Diaz, even if she was a suicidal maniac.Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film, even if it's nothing special. And believe me, it's not. But Tom Cruise is better than expected. And his notorious vanity pays off -- we finally get to see his face all messed up. Alas, he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film. That would be American Hollywood sacrilege. I can just hear the producers: ""Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man? WHAT?!""",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A sixth emotion: Boredom,"At one point in this film the main character is told that there are five basic emotions: guilt, hate, shame, revenge and love. My immediate response was, what about anger and fear? I think this serves as a good illustration of this movie as a whole. It tries to appear intelligent, but it just isn't.This movie asks some basic existential questions. For that purpose it tells a confusing story where the main character is led to question reality, his sanity, what's important in his life, friendship, love and all the usual clich√©s. And the answers are mostly the usual dogmas we all know by heart; Friendship and love is more important than money and good looks. D'oh!This lightweight philosophical theme is set against a confusing story that doesn't have any real progress or goal. We just get to watch the main character get more and more confused, and his reality is failing more and more. Until the end, when we get the conclusion in a way that's just as imaginative as explaining all the unanswered questions of reality with something supernatural, such as God.I suspect this movie will cater very well to intellectuals who love to analyze movies. There are plenty of metaphors here to dig into. The problem, however, is that they are not really interesting since the questions asked are, as stated earlier, mostly the usual clich√©s, and the answers are the usual dogmas. In my opinion this leaves no real reason to try to analyze this story, except for the mental exercise of analyzing and satisfying ones own intellectual ego through the process. That can of course be fruitful and interesting in itself. But it doesn't make an exciting movie.To sum up, the problem with this movie is that the story is uninteresting and boring, and with an unimaginative conclusion. The questions raised are clich√©s, and the answers are dogmas. Good for those who like to analyze movies, boring for the rest of us. I give this film 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
How to use a photocopier,"From the point of view of pure cinema, it is quite impossible to make any review of this film: `Vanilla sky' is the carbon copy of the Spanish film `Abre los ojos,' translated practically verbatim, and with the only difference of a higher percentage of in-your-face special effects (including the typical never-ending fall from a building) that, if they don't add anything to the film, they certainly add a lot to the budget of Digital Domain, the company responsible for most of the special effects. What is left for us to do is to reflect on the meaning of such an operation. We can't honestly call it a remake because of the temporal closeness of its antecedent (Abre los ojos was released in 1997), and of the consequent lack of the `cultural distance' necessary to any reinterpretation operation. We can't call it an homage to a genre (a la Brain de Palma in `Blow Out,' just to make an example) because the referent is too specific, and the carbon copy quality of `Vanilla Sky' too evident.So, what is left? The producers, obviously, believed that the story would appeal to the American public, for otherwise they wouldn't have spent a considerable amount of money filming it but, in this case, wouldn't have been simpler to release the original in AMC theaters around the country? The only explanation I can find, one that is rather insulting for the American public, is the following. Hollywood producers believe that the mainstream spectator will not see a film unless it falls completely within the expected (and very restricted, Hollywood canons). So, the setting has to be a familiar American setting (New York instead of Madrid) and there has to be the usual sprinkle of known American actors (Tom Cruise). But, most important, the dialog has an undefinable Hollywood quality: just the mix of witty, sad, and sugary to which Hollywood films have accustomed the American public.This film, in other words, is an explicit insult: Hollywood is telling us that they got us so use to their style of crap that the only way for us to go see a film is to make it into crap.What is truly sad is that they might be right: Vanilla Sky was a discrete success. On the other hand (and I quote Barnum paraphrasing Mencken): `Nobody ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the American public.'",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Really good at first,"Really good at first and even half the way through it is interesting and even if not quite as thrilling as it might have been it is still okay. The girls are amazing, Penelope Cruz very good and Cameron Diaz surely brilliant as it is a very difficult part. Tom Cruise is not quite as good but it is a really odd role he has to carry and on the last half hour I'm afraid the film just goes on too long and it gets just a little bit too crazy as it carries on. I have to say that the songs are splendid even though I didn't seen to notice all of them as shown in the credits. It was a long time ago when I saw the original Spanish one, Abre los Ojos aka: Open Your Eyes (1997) although I don't seen to remember but thought it was rather good at the time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Sweet and Sour,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.Its a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to ""open your eyes"".Only complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though.

"Thank God I Watched the Original First, Because This Wasn't as Good","This is a movie that I wish Fincher had directed, especially because I've seen The Game and he's definitely the right guy for a movie with a mystery plot.But unfortunately, this movie is not really mystery and it more feels like your average rom-com, especially with all the upbeat and happy pop and rock music playing, even during the twists and reveals and the important parts that should not have happy pop songs played during!This is probably my biggest complaint about the movie and why I didn't really vibe with it as much as I did with Open Your Eyes: The tone and the music choice. What I most loved about the original was how it was shot, the amazing theme and the music that added so much to the mystery and dream feel of the whole movie and the tone of it. For this type of story, I definitely prefer to have this tone and feel over the cheesy Hollywood-style remake that feels more like a rom-com with a happy ending.I suppose me having watched the original and knowing all the twists and turns of the story did a lot of ""damage"" to my viewing of this movie and I wonder how I would've felt if I never knew how the story goes and what my reaction to the twists would be. But nonetheless, having seen the original, the twists still have less impact than they did in the original.In the original, you can actually feel what a d-bag the main character is and how much he loves himself and the beautiful face he has, and his reaction to what happens after is done way better than this one. Tom Cruise obviously does a great job in this movie and this is definitely one of his best performances ever, but the script and the direction are not as good as the original and many things are done way better in there.The original is under 2 hours and somehow it does a way better job of presenting and telling this story and even telling more than this movie did in a longer run time.The casting choice (no Tom obviously) is really weird too and some characters like the male friend of the protagonist don't feel like they belong in the universe of this movie.And the dialogue is just meh, like it's nothing remarkable and I was expecting some better dialogue. Though I cannot deny that Cameron Diaz has the best line of dialogue in the history of cinema and you know what scene I'm talking about.I also don't really like how it ended and it differs from the original.My suggestion to someone who can't decide on these two movies is that watch both, but definitely watch the original movie first and then watch this, because despite all my complaints, this is still a well-made movie and I would've probably given it an 8 if I didn't know about the twists and turns and didn't know there was a better movie with the same plot.

And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity?  What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?  Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality.  It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  At the age of thirty-three, David Aames (Cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. His fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion's share of the company.  And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.Admittedly, David likes to play; still, he's in control of the business and does what he sees fit, whether the board (he refers to them as the `Seven Dwarfs') likes it or not, and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly.  But during a lavish birthday party in his honor, one of the corporate lawyers, Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall) warns David that the seven are up to something behind his back.  At the time, however, it's the last thing on David's mind; he's been having a casual affair with a friend, Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he can't get out of his mind.  Her name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz), and after knowing her for only one night, she becomes a pivotal part of his life-- which is about to be turned upside down, as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever.  And he is about to learn that sometimes, there is simply no going back.Director Cameron Crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one; far more than a movie, `Vanilla Sky' is a vision realized.  Beginning with the first images that appear on screen, he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting.  It's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away; emotionally, it's a rush-- and it may leave you exhausted, because it requires some effort to stay with it.  But it's worth it.  Think `Memento' with a driving rock n' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist's brush. There's darkness and light, and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain. And all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky.  Simply put, this one's a real trip; it's exciting-- and it's a mind bender.As to the performances here, those who can't get past the mind-set of Tom Cruise as Maverick in `Top Gun,' or his Ethan Hunt in `Mission Impossible,' or those who perceive him only as a `movie star' rather than an actor, are going to have to think again in light of his work here.  Because as David Aames, Cruise gives the best performance of his career, one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door.  He's made some interesting career choices the past few years, with films like `Magnolia' and `Eyes Wide Shut' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here.  And give him credit, too, for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity; this is Cruise as you've never seen him before. `Jerry Maguire' earned him an Oscar nomination, and this one should, also-- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers.  Cruise is not just good in this movie, he is remarkable.Penelope Cruz turns in an outstanding, if not exceptional performance, as well, as Sofia, the woman of David's dreams.  There's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special `something extra' to the part.  But Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors, and he certainly did with Cruz.He also knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie.  She's never looked better, and fairly sizzles on screen.  But make no mistake, this is no `window-dressing' part, and Diaz delivers a complete package with this character.  The quality of her performance can be measured, in fact, in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time.  And it's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable.  Overall, a terrific job by Diaz.The supporting cast includes Kurt Russell (Dr. McCabe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galecki (Peter), Armand Schultz (Dr. Pomerantz), Noah Taylor (Ed), Mel Thompson (`L.E.' Man), Jean Carol (Woman in New York) and John Fedevich (Silent Ed).  About half-way through, this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality; but rest assured, by the end of `Vanilla Sky' all will be revealed.  It's a reality-bender, to be sure, and a wild one; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying-- and unique-- experience, one you have to see to believe.  It's the essential, and absolute, magic of the movies.  10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Super Romantic Thriller,"David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a 33 year old American, heir to his late father's magazine house and lives a flamboyant lifestyle with two love interests- Julianna (Cameron Diaz) and Sophia (Penelope Cruz) when all of a sudden his life changes drastically when his face gets disfigured in a gruesome car accident.
Tom Cruise is drool worthy and his performance is outstanding in this movie. David and Sophia's chemistry definitely manage keep the temperatures soaring.
With its nonlinear narration this movie suddenly changes its genre from romance to a psychological thriller which keeps resonating. It really messes up with your brains and its left open to the audience for interpretations. It is so thought provoking that it kept me obsessed over it for quite a few hours and I looked up for its different interpretations and advice you to do the same after u watch it.
It implores the concept of the power of the subconscious mind which is used sometimes to escape reality but what happens when u get trapped in it so much so that the lines between them become permanently blurry and everything is just a lucid dream?",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Interesting but ultimately disappointing,"This film is worth seeing on several levels but ultimately it disappoints. The lead role was a perfect fit for Tom Cruise - normally, I find him external and not really believable; however, in this part, I liked his acting.  His scene before a panel of doctors is especially effective. I always love Cameron Diaz.  As for Penelope Cruz, I will only ask, what is the big deal.I thought I was going to be watching a compelling murder mystery.  Turns out that wasn't really the case. The way the true plot is introduced, very late into the film (like the end), I felt like it was the kitchen sink being thrown in.  That is one objection I have.  The other objection I have is, though the film only ran about two hours, it moved very slowly and seemed MUCH longer.  Whenever that's the case, you know there's a problem.  Fifteen minutes at the beginning could easily have been cut and we would have gotten the point of the main character's life and lifestyle, and the pivotal scene of the film would have been moved back considerably.Nevertheless, if you're up for seeing something that will spark discussion, intrigue you and has depth to it, this is a good one to see. It doesn't succeed but hey, Cameron Crowe tried.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky is dream come true.,"I could not agree more with the quote ""this is one of the best films ever made."" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a ""re-make,"" you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.Visually, because the film is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes).The music and sounds tie into this movie so perfectly. Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think.This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and altogether a work of brilliance. Much of my film-making and musical inspiration comes from this work alone. It has honestly touched my life, as true art has a tendency of doing. It continually surprises me that there are many people that cannot appreciate this film for what it is (I guess to understand true art is an art itself).Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Watch the original spanish version to feel the thrill of this movie,"The concept was pretty good but not executed well in American version. You can completely skip this movie and watch the original spanish version (Abre los ojos). I am not one of those people who always say that original version is better because sometimes I like remakes too but not in this case. If I had not seen the original version, i would have given 7 stars. For original version i would give 10 stars. Reasons: (1) Acting/cast fits perfect in spanish version. (2) 90% of dialogues have been adapted without modifying a bit - just sounds a little weird as they might fit in Spain but they should have americanized those while making remake. (3) Some parts have been modified/removed specially in the end which gives substance and thrill to the movie. (4) One crucial part of this movie to show the actor ugly (and even a little scary) - the spanish version gets 10/10 in that but the makeup team couldn't make Tom Cruise that ugly (unless he can't be made ugly). (5) Some funky and happy music have been incorporated in the movie (during serious scenes, why?) which is not the case in spanish version. Even with English subtitles, i would rate spanish version 10 and Vanilla sky 6. Don't waste time on American version if you like to enjoy a good thriller suspense sci-fi movie",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A Pale Representation of the Original,"I was originally very curious about this film when it first came out because I loved the original, Abre Los Ojos was enthralling melodic and enchanting, and Vanilla sky tried very hard but it just kept missing the mark.Even when you compare the amazing Penelope Cruz's two performances there was so much more in the first film. She had this sweet haunting eloquence that was not present in the latter. Then we come to Tom Cruise who can ofttimes be so hit and miss with his acting (yes I know this will earn me scorn, but its true), there are films he's done where he is brilliant, The Last Samurai, Born on the 4th of July. This felt like one of his more pedestrian performances, much could be said for Cameron Diaz in this as well.Perhaps if I had not seen Abre Los Ojos my opinion of this would have been vastly different I really can't be sure, but it was sad for me because I desperately wanted to like this.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
One of Cruise's better performances,"One of Tom Cruise's better films of recent years, and certainly less ""Hollywood"" than most others he has done for a long time.Publishing magnate Cruise has everything -- money, fame, success and two beautiful women [Cruz & Diaz] in his life.Then he loses it.

I won't tell anything more than this film truly takes an unexpected direction and becomes something entirely. The first act of the film is your standard rom-com, then the second act takes a very dramatic direction and the final act is something really bizzare. I won't spoil it, but it is one of tbe biggest mind f#$k's in any movie I have seen so far.

"Thrilling and surprising story full of intrigue , excitement, twists and turns.","This Vanilla Sky (2001) was a Hollywood remake by Cameron Crowe as starring Tom Cruise , Cameron Diaz , Kurt Russell from a spanish film ¬®Abre los ojos¬®starring (Eduardo Noriega, Najwa Nimri, and Pen√©lope Cruz also stars in Vanilla Sky, Cameron Crowe's remake of this film, playing the same character, Sofia.

This suspenseful movie starts with our protagonist , handsome David Ames (Tom Cruise) , who has a life full of pleasures and parties, a womanizing playboy who finds romantic redemption when he falls in love with his best friend's (Jason Lee) girlfriend Sofia (Penelope Cruz, reprising her role from the original film).

Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling score by the same Alejandro Amenabar , including some wonderful songs. Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a notable film. Colorful and glowing cinematography by John Toll which heightens the suspense .The picture was well directed by Cameron Crowe, though some critics deem to be a simple copy of the Spanish flick from a script by Alejandro Amenabar and Mateo Gil. Cameron Crowe's first script was for Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982). This movie was important for more than his career - his future wife Nancy Wilson had a small role in the film. Music remained important to him, with the rock band Pearl Jam playing a bit role in Singles (1992) well before they were ""discovered"". His next movie, Jerry Maguire (1996), took over five years to develop. His films frequently contain scenes where a character sings a song in a car (John Mahoney sings ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"" in Say Anything (1989), Tom Cruise sings ""Free-fallin'"" in Jerry Maguire (1996), the band sings ""Tiny Dancer"" in Almost Famous (2000)). The one to note specifically is Cameron Diaz in Vanilla Sky (2001), who does not sing in the car but plays a CD in which she is the singer. Rating: 6.5/10. Decent acting, Cruise's fans, dreamy photography and an engaging musical score will provide entertainment at the very least.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Criminally underrated film by Crowe,I think the main reason that people didn't take to this movie is because it was way ahead of its time. Tom Cruise was at the peak of his crazy psychotic bs and the concept really takes a few watches to really get.Such an amazing film,10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Why bother?,"A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means. Cruise's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor. Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla sky all time movie,"I'm from Romania i'll try to speak in English. All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one.

Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie.

Defacing Reality,"This challenging and thought-provoking science-fiction feature certainly kept me on the hop throughout. Tom Cruise's David Aames character seems to have it all, an inherited business empire which provides him with a lifestyle of indulgence. As well as the good looks with which he was born, he has an expensive New York apartment, a supercar to run around in and a playboy existence where he can attract the kind of beautiful women his best friend can only dream of.But his shallow, cavalier existence is shattered when his sometime girlfriend, Cameron Diaz's Julie Gianni, in a fit of possessive jealousy decides to visit karma on him by taking him on a crazed, suicidal car-ride which ends with the car plummeting over the edge of the freeway, leaving her apparently dead and him broken and disfigured but still alive.When he opens his eyes, he finds he walks with a limp and has a distorted face, the latter of which he's encouraged to cover with an expressionless mask. He reverts between being interviewed in a grey, private hospital ward by a seemingly sympathetic consultant, Kurt Russell and somehow continuing his life as before, his body and face whole again where he encounters Pen√©lope Cruz's Sofia. Elusive, enigmatic but soft where Julia was superficial, direct and hard, he falls for her, only why does Julia keep reappearing, calling herself Sofia and still out to disrupt his life? We learn of the existence of a shady corporation which promotes cryogenics to extend life and the apparent ability to choose your own preferred lifestyle while you're in your comatose state. As David gradually becomes aware of this, he will have to choose whether to live a sometimes disturbingly unreal dream life or take back his real life, even if this ultimately means his own death.It all ends up on a vertiginous roof-top high above the city where he makes his decision in a climax which in a way will tragically prefigure the 09/11 catastrophe which visited the real New York later that very year.I can't pretend to have followed every plot line with director Crowe cross-cutting scenes, blurring reality and making us question which of the characters in David's life are real and which imaginary. Former music critic Crowe unsurprisingly fills the movie with music so much that I can't remember ever seeing more song-credits for one film as well as strewing random Easter eggs throughout to add still more intrigue to the heightened narrative.Cruise deserves kudos for taking on such a complex role and proves himself up to the challenge, effectively debunking his pretty-boy image with a convincing portrayal of a privileged individual unsure whether he's living the dream or living the nightmare. Cruz and Diaz both shine as his well-contrasted dream-girls and Russell also excels as David's awakening support mechanism.An eye-opening film, in more ways than one, it's one of those movies which you can probably watch and watch again and still end up with different conclusions every time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
My favourite movie,"I have watched this film whenever my life has taken a worrying turn and it always lifts me up. The affair between David and Sophia is so beautifully handled that one can't help but be moved. All of the characters are written so beautifully and the acting excellent. The best friend, the father figure, the seven dwarfs and LE all make me watch in awe. I have never been able to watch the final scene on the rooftop without shedding a little tear and I'm a fully grown emotionally in control type of guy.

"The ending, that is bitterly unpredictable, could be better!","Just 15 minutes ago, I watched this movie. Before finishing it, I was totally submersed under dreams and puzzles. It was creating puzzles one after another.Indeed, the movie is very emotional and romantic. It has a very good story that has been presented beautifully. During the last half an hour of this film, it seemed to me that nothing can be better than this; while I was expecting a consistently good ending. But, the finishing could not satisfy me, as I desired more-actually, this film was creating desire. But, some people might like the ending too! I personally, do not like to see science-fiction to solve a puzzle because the movie was emotionally romantic, and bringing science-fiction(that seems to me against emotion) into it destroys the flow.Except the ending, I love every thing of this movie.

"Confusing, mindbending did I miss something?","I no idea what I was leading myself into when I first took a glimpse of Vanilla Sky?I mean sure it was another Tom Cruise flick re-uniting with 'Jerry Maguire' favorite Cameron Crowe and throwing in the likes of Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and the un-avoidable Cameron Diaz but there was something about this film I didn't quite catch.  . . .?To begin with I heard it was a remake of a Spanish film ""Open your Eyes"" and secondly the story was not was it was meant to be then I realized that maybe it wasn't such a good idea?The confusing aspect about the story was Tom Cruise's character' a successful millionaire who's claimed everything only one could ever dream of and then meeting the girl of his dreams (real-life love interest Penelope Cruz).The story then begins to take a somewhat ""abstract"" turning point when past girlfriend Cameron Diaz turns up taking our lead for a ride only to end up committing suicide by driving off a bridge. All in the name of love I might add.What you end up experiencing is a series flashbacks of present day events and wonderful vivid dream like sequences. Which sends a host of ""should I say"" unanswered questions.For me this film reminded more of a Dario Argento formula: Stylish camera work and set design not to mention awkward scenario.Although this is my first time seeing a virtual remake it's not surprising in the least how some of these big time directors dish out bucket loads of cash on sprucing up old cuts with style and vision. The one image that many will reflect upon is the Times Square scenario, in which Tom Crusie gets out his car and begins to run through an isolated environment (note: Cameron Crowe had closed off Times Square for an hour just capture this one beautiful scene).All in all not bad, but when watching this film it began to remind me of other mindbending films that had me on the rebound (Total Recall, Twelve Monkeys and Fight Club).With alot of style but little appreciation towards story, I'd probably have to say that this is a slight let down. The film too began to suffer from an identity crises.

"Try to find the original Spanish version, you'll be happier","When I first saw the previews for Vanilla Sky, I scared everyone around me with my jumping up and down that ""I've seen this movie before!!!""  Indeed, I had seen the original Spanish version on IFC, and was literally forced to watch the whole thing to the end to find out what really becomes of the main character.To say I was rather p***ed someone tried to remake that movie was an understatement.  But I came expecting nothing - though I hoped this might be just as good, if not better.Unfortunately, like most other 90-00s hollywood remakes, this film was rather hollow.  Sure, Cameron Crowe followed the original Abre Los Ojos exactly (rip-off might be more appropriate) - like the gutter shot, the nightclub, the post-birthday party experience (including the drawing and photos), the post-accident ""dream"" - but he added way to much meaning to the whole story.  Abre Los Ojos was just a psychological thriller, Vanilla Sky wants you to believe it will change you...My suggestion?  Find Abre Los Ojos and watch that...preferably before you see Vanilla Sky - the plot will be more entertaining.

A lesson in excess ¬ñ not a patch on Abre les Ojos!,"David has everything his heart desires having inherited a huge publishing company from his father at a young age.  With women he trades on his easy charm and good looks ¬ñ stringing as many along as possible without commitment, the build up being as good as the sex that comes with conquest. At a party he avoids one lover, Julie, by striking up a conversation with Sophia ¬ñ going to her home and spending the whole night talking and laughing.  The next morning he leaves her flat to find that Julie is waiting for him.  He gets in her car but during a fight, she crashes ¬ñ killing her and badly disfiguring him.  He struggles with his loss of beauty until a new surgery comes along that offers the chance of restoring his looks ¬ñ however it also messes with his mind to the extent that he appears to mix dreams and reality.  David tells his story to McCabe during a physiological review that will set the basis for his plea during his impending murder trial.To set out my stall ¬ñ I saw Abre Los Ojos before I saw Vanilla Sky.  I say this because I imagine that most negative reviews come from those who have seen the original and most good reviews come from those who have not seen it at all.  I don't intend to buck this trend.I can't criticize the story because at heart, it is a good story.  It is a little complex and dark, but it's a compelling, disorientating story none the less.  But we know this already ¬ñ we saw it in the original movie (which I gave a 9 out of 10!).  So that Vanilla Sky has a good story at it's heart is maybe not quite so remarkable a feat.  Crow monkeys with the story slightly  and alters the mood of the ending just enough to be irritating to those of us who didn't see any flaws that needed fixing ¬ñ but this is a remake not a copy and that's his right.However he does tend to copy the original scene for scene ¬ñ in some cases shot for shot, again that's not a big problem for me as he simple seems to be saying that he can't improve on what has gone before and hence won't even try.  No ¬ñ my main problem is with the adding of stuff.  Vanilla Sky runs about 20/30 minutes longer than the original and it's in this padding that I had a problem.  The film knows that an American audience is not used to thinking things out for itself ¬ñ hence we have constant references to Benny the dog etc, almost as if we're not smart enough to make the connections ourselves.  The padding doesn't add anything of value ¬ñ it extends scenes needlessly and adds baggage to scenes that were fine in the first place. The perfect example being the nightmare scene at the start with an empty Manhattan ¬ñ Crow fills this with quickly cut visuals like a pop video, taking away from the tension of the scene.In the reviews for this all anyone seemed to be shouting about was what an awesome soundtrack Crow had put together and, yes, it is made up of a diverse range of very good songs ¬ñ however a soundtrack is not just about making a CD that's going to sell, it needs to work in the movie.  Here ¬ñ it doesn't work at all.  Almost all the music seems out of place ¬ñ as if someone in the cinema had just turned on their stereo.  The scene where David discovers what's really going on was sickeningly tense in the original ¬ñ here it is smothered by the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations', does anyone think this scene works?  That's one example but there are plenty of others where the music destroys any sense of mood and just seems out of place.The mood is another problem ¬ñ the original was very dark.  Here the mood is quite upbeat, very Hollywood.  The soundtrack doesn't help but it's made worse by the performances.  When Noriega played David/Cesar, he wasn't a totally likeable character ¬ñ unloving, vain and with a smarmy charm ¬ñ after the accident he was pathetic and desperate.  Cruise comes across like a movie star rather than a person ¬ñ he seems to want to flash his well built chest and beautiful smile in every scene, this stops us noticing his failings as a person because his character seems to stop at the smile. After the accident Cruise doesn't want to become pathetic or desperate ¬ñ instead he clowns in a half pathetic way but never lets his character be pushed to the very edge for any length of time ¬ñ this stops us caring about him, he just doesn't seem a real person.  The other Cruz is ok, but never as good as in the original.  Here the overall upbeat mood of the film seems to have gotten to her and she smiles her way through it ¬ñ we barely see her trapped by the disfigured David who looks to her for support and her happy performance at the end totally changes the mood.  I love Jason Lee but he just seems out of place here but he is the only one of the leads who actually manages to convince when the mood goes from comedy to anger and resentment.  Kurt Russell is good but in the original the Doctor had a huge emotional punch at the end ¬ñ here Russell doesn't do well with this scene and makes his role a damp squid.I could go on for days, but overall the main problem with this is that Crow can't improve on the original.  All he can do is add material that pads out the story unnecessarily.  Vanilla Sky is American excess ¬ñ a remake of a film that didn't need anything added to it. 4 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

falls short of original,"I'm going to put my feelings about the actors and actresses past aside. I am going to only critique them for this movie. For anyone who hasn't seen Abre Los Ojos (the original version) in its original language cannot understand how much this movie is lacking. Tom Cruise (whom is generally a pretty d*mn good actor) does a horrible job in this one. However, i think the only way to really see how bad he does is by comparing him to the actor from Abre Los Ojos. He had a much more realistic feel. I also like the setting form abre los ojos. The fact that penelope cruz was a mine in the other one instead of a dancer also helps a lot. It just makes more sense for a younger character to play this role. Tom Cruise was wayyy too old for this role and it really shows on the big screen. Besides the OKAY acting (bad acting by the best friend), the old actors, the setting, and the crappy remake. The worst part of the movie has to be how the Simpsons and conan obrien are present in the movie. It really takes away from the beauty of a movie. This is one of the biggest reason people tend to like foreign and indie films. It's a chance to get away from that crap that many cannot escape from their normal lives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A worthy remake,"""Vanilla Sky"", Cameron Crowe's remake of the 1997 film ""Abre los Ojos"", written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, had two potential strikes against it from the onset: It was a remake of a film that was made four years prior, and it was a remake of a film where the original reeked of sheer genius. Luckily, Crowe was able to overcome these two hurdles and make a solid film that stands on its own merits.""Vanilla Sky"" centers around David Aames, (Cruise) a spoiled rich kid who has inherited his father's vast wealth and publishing empire. David is an attractive man (and knows it) who lives a jet-set lifestyle that involves having as much fun as possible in every given moment. Julie Gianni (Diaz), a girl with whom he has a casual ""sleeping arrangement"" is not able to subscribe to this lifestyle and when she tries to glean more from the relationship, is cast aside. On the night of his birthday party, David's best friend Brian (Lee) brings his new friend Sofia (Cruz), and the two develop an instant connection. In an attempt to get away from the now stalkerish Julie, the two escape to Sofia's small apartment and proceed to have a wonderful, meaningful evening together wherein David's life seems to have changed for the better. On his way out the door, he runs into Julie, who has followed him to Sofia's apartment, and she convinces him to drive with her so he can ""make it up to her"". What happens during the rest of the film is a mixture of intrigue, murder and romance, at times blossoming and others faltering, and eventually becomes a race for David to find out the truth about what is really happening with his life and those who are involved in it.I didn't want to get too spoilerish with the plot summary, because although the trailer for the film don't hide a lot in terms of plot points, some things that happen are still more shocking when you simply see them for yourself. ""Vanilla Sky"" has an intriguing and interesting plot that sincerely kept me guessing until the last five minutes of the film, something I was not expecting from a Cameron Crowe film. Cruise's David Aames is like Jerry Maguire if he was even more of an asshole in the beginning; charming, but so self-centered he practically leaks smarminess from his pores. I actually didn't think Crowe had it in him to produce such a well-executed psychological drama, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a very good film. Once again, Crowe shines with his use of music, something that he has never faltered on. From ""Say Anything"" to ""Almost Famous"", he has exhibited the uncanny knack to take a song that is either historically beloved in its own right or one that one would never think to use in a particular film, and insert it into a scene that is so fitting that the song and scene become married to one another immediately. He did this with Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" in ""Say Anything"", he did it with ""Tiny Dancer"" in ""Almost Famous"" and the great musical moment (in my opinion) in ""Vanilla Sky"" was near the end when ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys is playing over a semi-chaotic scene. I'm not sure if this is one of them yet, but Crowe's knack for turning simple scenes into iconic moments in film is staggering and admirable.The acting in ""Vanilla Sky"" is decent enough, none of it was really a stretch for Cruise, and Jason Lee was his usual laid-back self. The surprising performances for me personally were Cruz and Kurt Russell, who played a court-appointed psychologist. I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, but I found her casting to be absolutely perfect (not a stretch since she reprised her role from the Amenabar original). She was cute and quirky, but her vulnerability was so subtle that anytime I felt any kind of emotion, it was usually in response to a scene she was guiding. Also, Kurt Russell, a mediocre actor at best, was great as the psychologist; his strength and warmth are so low key that when a significant plot point about him is revealed at the end, you almost have to slap your forehead in an ""Oh yeah!"" reaction.I really enjoyed seeing ""Abre Los Ojos"", and I think that it still has advantages other than its originality over ""Vanilla Sky"". But when gauging a film like ""Vanilla Sky"", a film that can be criticized as being Hollywoodized, bastardized and super-sized, it is a testimony to the film and filmmakers that it came out as good as it did. Being a foreign-film and independent film lover, I'll always like ""Abre Los Ojos"" thismuch better, but ""Vanilla Sky"" is a worthy remake. I highly recommend both. 7/10 --Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The saddest girl to ever hold a martini,"The film was an enjoyable watch and unravels very nicely. Up until that point it is a bit of a mess.Tom Cruise does his usually thing, he acts like he's too big for his boots and is convinced his corny character is the coolest person in the world. It comes off as insincere but honestly that's to expect from him. This is not a film to watch if you want good acting.There are some iconic one-liners especially from Cameron Diaz that had me in stitches, even if they weren't meant to do that. This is another confusing thing about the movie - it deals with traumatic themes but has an underlying humour about it which makes it a fun watch for sure, but I don't know if the humour is the right choice for it.The bright cinematography eventually makes sense but it is initially a bit out of place, so this movie never really sets a consistent tone which is all over the place. It's pretty though, nice to look at and with surprisingly good effects.I had a nice time watching this, I won't be revisiting it though unless I'm referencing some of the hilarious quotes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A Misstep for Crowe and Cruise,"Tom Cruise is a movie star, not an actor. Which is sort of a shame for him, because part of what makes Tom Cruise so likable and successful is the fact that he tries so hard: from his earliest scene-stealing efforts in 'The Outsiders' and 'Taps' to 2004's 'Collateral,' Cruise has never stopped working to prove himself. There's no other explanation for how a vertically challenged, horse-toothed kid with a hawk's beak and a nasally voice to match could redefine star quality and become one of the biggest box office draws in movie history.But let's face it: this guy is no Olivier. More often than not, he has played the same role in barely altered incarnations (ex: in 'Top Gun,' he's a cocky, reckless Navy pilot with an Oedipal hang-up facing down his fears; in 'A Few Good Men' he's a cocky, reckless Navy JAG lawyer with an Oedipal hangup . . . etc.). Even in his better performances, he badly overacts, specializing in stagey emotional displays that tend toward unintentional comedy. Cruise can be a commanding presence when the director in charge knows how to exploit him appropriately, as did Oliver Stone in 'Born on the Fourth of July' and P.T. Anderson in 'Magnolia,' where the character either matched Cruise's persona--Ron Kovic, the Vietnam vet Cruise plays in 'Born on the Fourth of July,' is, like Cruise, a small, scrappy, intense, highly emotional overachiever--or was designed with Cruise in mind, as is the case with most of his post-'Top Gun' ouevre, including his role as Frank T.J. Mackey in 'Magnolia'. In both of those roles, Cruise emotes shamelessly--shaking bouts of grief-stricken weeping mar both performances--and yet you still like him, and you're still rooting for him, which is what makes him a movie star. But for the very same reason, you NEVER FORGET that he's a movie star--that is, audiences are always aware that they're watching Tom Cruise, super-celebrity. Suspension of disbelief when watching a Tom Cruise film is impossible. It probably wouldn't be any easier even if he were as good an actor as he desperately wants to be. Unfortunately, he's not.This is glaringly obvious in 'Vanilla Sky,' which has Cruise playing an utterly despicable character with the depth of a backyard birdbath. David Aames lives in an adolescent wish-fulfillment fantasy: heir to a magazine publishing fortune, he still rides a skateboard at thirty-three, spends most of his time clubbing, shopping, toning his rock-hard abs with his sycophantish starving-artist pal Brian (Jason Lee), or laying one of the scores of beautiful babes who are suckers for his wealth and cocksure good looks. David's arrogance and self-absorption are obviously setting him up for a fall, which I won't disclose here other than to say that one should never get in a car being driven by an obviously emotionally unstable woman you've been using for sex. But after said fall, David does not work through his folly to become a likable guy, but, rather, remains a narcissistic jerk desperate to reclaim the easy, comfortable, pleasure-seeking life he once enjoyed.One can't really comment on the intricacies of the plot without giving the whole thing away, so I'll simply say that it was better the first time, in Alejandro Amenabar's 'Abre Los Ojos', the original version of the story from which Cameron Crowe adapted 'Vanilla Sky.' What I can say without spoiling is that a film such as this stands or falls on the audience's ability to sympathize with the main character, which is virtually impossible here.Despite the implications of this review, I really like Tom Cruise--I even enjoyed 'The Last Samurai,' the latest in the line of self-produced (with partner and agent Donna Wagner) star vehicles in which Cruise plays the macho-but-stoically sensitive stock-character that made him famous. But 'Vanilla Sky' was a misstep, both for Cruise and for director Cameron Crowe, who, despite his skill, is incapable of making the audience care what happens to a jerk like David Aames.The most frustrating aspect of 'Vanilla Sky' is that it is a visually arresting film with a superb cast (Lee, best-known for his turn as the cynical, acerbic Banky in 'Chasing Amy,' is excellent as always, as are Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Noah Taylor, Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton, and Timothy Spall). A scene in which David finds himself in a deserted Times Square (not a digital mock-up or soundstage; it's the real thing) is itself worth the price of admission. But the film as a whole is inscrutable, and Cruise is unable to inject Aames with enough complexity or even a shred of likability to compensate for the meanderings of the plot and the essential loathsomeness of his character.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

How Can You Be 100% Sure You Aren't Dreaming Right Now?,"The strange thing about dreams is that, while in one, the dreamer usually does not realize a dream is taking place. Only upon the conclusion of the dream experience is an individual able to distinguish between dream and reality. That concept is the driving force behind ""Vanilla Sky"".
For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on David Aames (Tom Cruise), the heir to a vast business fortune who is very much a playboy. At a party one night, David is smitten by exotic beauty Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) and begins a relationship with her. When jealous fling Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) finds out, however, she involves David in an accident that will change his life forever. Because this is a ""big reveal"" type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.
There are two primary reasons that ""Vanilla Sky"" is such an extraordinary film:
First, it is very much high-concept. Much like ""Inception"", or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", this movie deals with dreams and how they affect the dreamers. This plot line is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.
Secondly, though, is that a film like ""Vanilla Sky"" can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves. In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot-on. It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.
Overall, ""Vanilla Sky"" is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with ""Eternal Sunshine"", ""Memento"", ""The Matrix"", and the like. It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion. Simply put, the only people this movie won't appeal to are those purely wanting action/adventure. This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.(After a recent re-watch, I dropped this movie down from 10/10 to 7/10 stars. This film has lost a bit of its luster for me in the re-watch process and feels a bit dated. The themes are still interesting and the concept is high, but it has been knocked off the lofty pedestal I once perched it on).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"Good, uneven movie, solid actors, cool ending","I've always liked Cameron Crowe's movies - Jerry Maguire being my personal favorite - but I'd not seen Vanilla Sky until this week. When it came out, the previews were less than inspiring, so I avoided it - I didn't want to see CC blow it. Later a friend with Good Taste told me it was pretty good, but I just forgot about it.I'd like to compare it to another movie I've seen recently to point out some of the things that VS does right where this other, allegedly classic film completely floundered, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone. I will say that while Tom Cat Cruise wasn't his usual flamboyant self in this one, I like him as an actor - even if he is an ass in life. I'll also say that the film is intriguing at the beginning and lulls toward what seems to be the conclusion. Then, just as I began to give up on it, the movie found its feet for a interesting twist in the final minutes.There's a line very near the ending in which Cruise's character is told that he was careless with someone and it resonates - that's exactly the linchpin of the entire movie, distilled into a single sentence.As in movies, so it is in life, sometimes.

Do not open your eyes! Close them and DON'T watch this film!,"It's a fact. The few ones that consider ""Vanilla Sky"" a good movie (or even great ¬ø?) have not seen the ""real"" movie, Spaniard ""Abre los ojos"" by Alejandro Amen√°bar.It's common in the American film industry to see remakes of foreign films, due to the fact that usually, the traditional American film consumer will not watch a subtitled film. It happened with Amen√°bar's firs film ""Thesis"" with a very poor result. It is the same with Vanilla Sky.First, the performers. We have a non convincing Tom Cruise, which has had much better roles in his career (just remember ""Magnolia"" and you'll understand what I'm talking about). Cameron Diaz -considered by many as a not serious actress- plays a whore, not the interesting, bitter character played by Najwa Rimji in ""Abre los ojos"". Penelope Cruz, doing the same role, fails to achieve the complex performance in the original film. Finally, while McCabe (Kurt Russell) is just ridiculous, Jason Lee does a decent job as Brian Shelby.Second, Crowe proves everyone (and perhaps himself) that he's just a mediocre director: the story is too complex for his abilities. His script is just awful: it makes the story just stupid! In his next work, ""Elizabethtown"", he's just a decent director. But the bitter taste of this awful movie is still in me.

Joni's Clouds for Dummies,"Spoilers herein.I was prepared to not like this film; Crowe too consistently centers his vision on the cheap shot. And Cruise -- well, it is hard to be an intelligent actor when you're as dumb as a flagpole knob. I found my worst fears to be true, but also found some strong, really strong elements that make this worth watching.First the bad. Most films are built on other films; some -- especially recently -- openly quote other films. Some of these are also in the category of films about constructed realities, and that's when things can get interesting: you go to a film to construct a reality for you, and the story is about constructing a reality. Often these fold with sophistication. But here they do this intrinsically intelligent thing in a fifth grade dumb way. Not Monet, but paint by the numbers.The film is about fantasy love and deciding between lovers. Rather than quote 'Jules and Jim' on this in a light way as anyone else would: Crowe puts a floor-to-ceiling poster in Cruise's bedroom, then when a voice ('tech support') explains that the constructed images were taken from movies, we see an actual clip. Those of us who Crowe targets would immediately recognize the quote of Bob Dylan's most famous album cover. But instead of quoting it like Greenaway would use a famous painting, we are walked through it with chalk.Patronizing. Embarrassing. Discouraging. Does he think we all move lips when reading?But there are two really fascinating things. I believe that Crowe's imagination is based in popular music first, with the image to follow, and actors and story getting dragged in a matter of course. So the effect of the music is more powerful than any I recall. He deftly binds it, even having Cruise take up a song at one point. This is the deepest use of Dylan in a long time. For those of us that are Crowe's age, there is a cool take on the Beatles: in the late sixties, the game was that drugs could help you create your own reality. The Beatles provided three alternative worlds for you to choose. It really was a matter of pervasive discussion about choosing (or 'liking') John, Paul or George.Once the topic comes up in the film, everything from there can be seen as making a choice. John would have stayed in fantasyland. George would have declared the whole thing irrelevant and opted out. Paul would have gone back to the 'real' world. The film ends with Paul's song. Now that's the kind of near-subtlety that's missing in the story at large.The other thing is no small matter. It purely blew me away, using a cinematic effect I have never experienced before. The whole film is storytelling by reference; what is new is storytelling by direct reference to characters previously played by the cast!Start with Alicia Witt and work outwards from the center. (Alicia was the receptionist at LE, named Libby who is the first person involved in the dream mechanics.) She played an identical, small center as the whorehouse pianist in 'Liebestraum' (get the name?), also as the fulcrum of folded visions.Diaz played the shunned girlfriend in the last popular film dealing with constructed realities, 'Malkovich.' Russell plays Douglas playing the character who recreates the narrative. It is the complement of his role in 'Wonder Boys,' where he was the creator, but real; and a complement of a different sort of him in 'The Game,' where he was the target, not the creator. His work here and in 'Boys' are knowingly referential to his other roles. Very tight selfreferential acting. Kudos to him, it makes up for a whole previous life of selfindulgent frippery. (Made right by his finding his own film Latin love.)And then there is Cruise himself. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is this very same movie (so Kubrick even said in reference to the Spanish original), but with no quarter given to the less astute viewer. How cool that he would come to this very much dumber version while his exwife went to something more elaborately and cinematic ally selfreferential in 'Moulin Rouge,' (a real thrill that should be seen right after either 'Eyes' or 'Little Voice').And finally we have Cruz, whose reference is to an external movie of a different type: this same film. Except the original is more a film where this is a composite of films. She plays her role not in this film, but here in reference to there as if she herself was Jeanne Moreau. And if there ever was a case of films constructing reality, how sweet to have Tom and Penny fall in 'love.'",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I generally do not like Cruise that much (too much smiley, happy, slick guy) but he was good here. My absolute hero in this film: Jason Lee. HE RULES. Whenever I see him I must laugh. HE IS SO COOL.

Really balanced between two powerful genres,"The movie presents a very interesting story, although it's not an original one. Furthermore I really like how the movie marries its distanced genres of romance and science fiction. The movie did a very great job in shifting the focus from the romance side, bit by bit moving it until the grand revelation of the science fiction side. Both of the genres were done quite powerfully. The romance side had its story strong enough with the conflicts coming in and out. The science fiction side feels rather unlikely at first but then gained its significance more and more over time. The acting work is a great overall job. Tom Cruise did his character nicely although his usual grin really bores people down. Cameron Diaz did her part well, having her character suddenly reappearing after the middle point. Penelope Cruz adds her accent very nicely to the romantic side of the story. Having big names like Kurt Russell, Tilda Swinton and Michael Shannon's kind of a cameo, in supporting roles really adds to the movie as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Narcissistic exercise.,"""Vanilla Sky"" was another Tom Cruise exercise in narcissism.  In the movie he suffers the worse possible fate.  His pretty face is scarred.  I found the first half of this movie to be rather nauseating.   The main characters seem to be a mutual admiration society always telling each other how great they were.  There was a scene in Pen√©lope Cruz's apartment where Tom Cruise looks at pictures on the refrigerator.  The pictures were all of Pen√©lope Cruz.  I did a survey over the weekend of my family's refrigerator pictures and most were of other people or of them with other people.  My own refrigerator is covered with pictures of nieces and nephews.  I found this scene strange that a person puts their own pictures all over the refrigerator.  I wonder if the Hollywood types even caught this.  The second half of the movie was somewhat better in a Sci-fi sort of way.  I had a real hard time caring for the main actors though.

"""What is happiness to you?""","I'm not sure if I liked this movie or not. I'll preface this by saying that I love Cameron Crowe; I'm a big fan of Jerry Maguire, Singles, Say Anything, and my personal favorite Almost Famous. However, I'd heard a lot of mixed things going into it, and I'm going to conclude by saying there are a lot of things to like about this movie, but there were some things that took away enough enjoyment that I don't know how to feel. I've also never seen the original film this is based on, so bear with me.The performances are all great. Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz are all fantastic, and I have nothing bad to say about the performances. The soundtrack is wonderful, including Paul McCartney's title track, and overall, the ending gives a solid payoff to what we see, no matter how confusing it is, and the beginning is great too.I think my biggest issue was Cameron Crowe's directing. He's not really made for sci-fi. The beginning was so great because it starts off as one of those slice-of-life style movies like Jerry Maguire or Say Anything, and then there's an abrupt tonal shift in the middle.To me, this is where the movie kind of falls apart. Crowe's directing makes the middle portion of this movie too confusing for me to be properly invested in the sci-fi portion of the movie. Although the ending explains it all somewhat succinctly, at that point I just wasn't invested enough for it to mean anything. Again, these are just my thoughts, so maybe other people were more invested.Crowe's strengths lie in the characters he writes and the simple lessons you can take away from his movies, and less so in the big twists and turns and sci-fi stuff. I think the script just didn't allow him to showcase what he's best at. The sci-fi stuff and confusing buildup overshadow what is ultimately a really great message about finding happiness where you go, and not in material things.This movie isn't as bad as many people say, but it's definitely not as good as it could be. I would say watch it for yourself, but if you're already a Cameron Crowe fan, go into it with an open mind, and try to embrace the twists in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Mush,"This is another one of those films about the human mind and the content therein ... memories, dreams, emotions, perceptions, what is real and what is not. Hollywood has been there before, many times. In ""Vanilla Sky"" the setting is modern day New York City. The main character is David Aames, a smug, self-satisfied, wealthy playboy who is heir to a publishing empire. He's a man who has it all, until an unfortunate event changes him forever.The best approach to this film is to go with the flow, and not try to analyze it too much. The story gets complicated and confusing. The narrative jumps back and forth. There are many flashbacks. Interpretations vary as to the film's ""meaning"". And therein lies my main problem with the story. When filmmakers try to cover too much philosophical ground, and go deep into the human psyche, the end result is usually ... mush. This film would have been better if the screenplay had focused on one or two philosophical points only. As is, the film's complex subject matter and disjointed structure convey not insight but confusion.The screenplay aside, other technical components run the gamut from good to awful. Cinematography is probably the strongest element of the film, and includes some creative camera shots of Manhattan. Special effects are effective, and without being intrusive. And production design is impressive. On the other hand, the film's editing contributes to a confused plot. And the background music is very, very weak. As to the acting, well, I don't even want to talk about it ...Compared to other contemporary films, ""Vanilla Sky"" is neither better nor worse, but about average. Seeing it once is probably enough.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"So much to say, but I am speechless...","Cameron Crowe has written and directed some pretty good movies over the years. Starting with Say Anything in 1989, Jerry McGuire in 1996, and Almost Famous in 2000. But these movies don't compare to the complexity and splendor that is Vanilla Sky.In this American version of Abre los Ojos, Tom Cruise stars as David Aames, a rich publisher, thanks to his father, who has it all. His ""buddy"" named Julie (Cameron Diaz) is a little jealous about him meeting this girl at a party named Sophia (Penelope Cruz), who he was introduced to by his client and best friend Brian (Jason Lee). Brian is falling for Sophia but is sort of OK with Daivd making the first move. Julie becomes jealous and crashes her car with David in it. She dies and David is left disfigured. Basically, David's entire life is starting to turn upside down and doesn't even know what is real and what isn't. Intertwining throughout the movie is David talking to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) in prison, awaiting his sentence for a crime he doesn't think he committed. What happens next is hard to explain, and also would ruin the movie.This movie couldn't have been written any better. Cameron Crowe is on the top of his game. This smart, entertaining story of what happens to a man when reality seems to slip away is magnificent. The five main characters are phenomenal. Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Russell, and Lee all give some of their best work to date. Although the plot seems to be confusing at times, Crowe does a nice job of explaining everything so it all ties together nicely.Vanilla Sky is a masterpiece. The screenplay is reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Everyhthing put together makes Vanilla Sky one hell of a ride.

"Like Alejandro Amen√°bar before him, Cameron Crowe can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well...","Vanilla SkyDavid Aames (Tom Cruise) is a young and wealthy womaniser, who has a slightly jealous best friend, Brian (Jason Lee). At David's birthday party, he meets Brian's date, Sofia (Pen√©lope Cruz), and instantly warms to her, and they end up spending the night together, but only enjoying each other's company. When Julie (Cameron Diaz), one of David's latest conquests who has been developing an unhealthy obsession with him, crashes her car with him in the passenger's seat, it leaves David horribly disfigured. Feeling his life is essentially over, David becomes withdrawn and angry, but his relationship with Sofia helps him to see the world in a new light. He cheers up even more when he learns of the possibility that doctors may be able to reconstruct his facial features, but everything changes when a face from the past comes back to haunt him.It's great that Channel Four broadcast the 1997 Spanish original 'Open Your Eyes' the night before this Hollywood remake, 'Vanilla Sky' (which is also good, but suffers from the same problems), was broadcast. Problems, you say? Well, writer/director Cameron Crowe has made a very interesting, involving film, but like Alejandro Amen√°bar before him, he can't really balance the romance/drama and mystery/thriller elements too well. 'Sky' feels kind of uneven, even though the plot is fresh and surprising. However, the performances are good, and I can see why Cameron Crowe decided to rehire Pen√©lope Cruz for the remake, as she really is a radiant presence. Just a note, though: this film is more of a romance, while 'Open Your Eyes' is more of a thriller, so I guess your preference depends on which genre you like more, I suppose. I don't have a favourite out of the two, so I think they are both good...just not great.~ 7/10 ~",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Still a Next-Level Mind-Bender,"This was one of my favorite movies from 2 decades ago, so I decided to rewatch it and see if it withstood the test of time. I'm happy to report that it does! 20 years later and Vanilla Sky is still one of the most brilliantly written, painstakingly crafted, and meticulously calculated films. This is a next-level thinker.The attention to detail is the real star of the show. There are endless cultural references, Easter eggs, layered complexities, and other cinematic choices that make viewing this film a second time even more mind-blowing.Unpopular opinion, but I also think this might be Tom Cruise's best performance ever.The moral(s) of the story stay with you and the deeper meanings behind certain situations are thought-provoking to say the least.

"Needs a few touches, but I enjoyed it","From my point of view, it is a bit difficult to know how much credit to give Vanilla Sky for integrity or smarts when taking into account that it is a remake of a film which I have never seen (Abre Los Ojos). Cameron Crowe's remake (regardless of what it owes to the Spanish film) has its weak spot but is fairly enjoyable.The movie is part drama/romance part surrealism. Surrealist films are pretty tricky. I like my surrealism to be appreciable and clever (Donnie Darko, Altered States) rather than self- indulgent and disorienting (Mulholland Dr.) Vanilla Sky is a case of the former. It is arty, yet manages to tell a narratively coherent story, which allows for viewer investment. Vanilla Sky can range from funny to frightening and or from cold to touching. It is full of mood swings, and despite the fact that the finished product feels like three movies, it is never dull. (although the ending may be a couple minutes too long)What I like about Vanilla Sky is how it (eventually) acknowledges that the viewer is being put on a borderline of dream and reality. Instead of an 'open to interpretation' scenario, The screenplay comes with a good share of climactic explanation, which enriches the thematic material and the emotion. It is essential that Vanilla Sky be a subjective story. We have to be one with Tom Cruise. Even though he is not entirely a respectable character, we come to understand him by the end.The character, I have no problem with. I was more bothered by the performance. Cruise brings his character to life in a fashion that is too spectacular for comfort. Basically he overacts. This kind of 'kabuki theatre' performance may have been more understandable if Stanley Kubrick was directing. In scene one, he drives through Times square, and there is not a soul to be seen. This I find impressive. It hard to imagine any film production company (not even Spielbergs) having the power to clear and block off one of the World's most famous and busiest commerical areas. (Usually movie companies come to Toronto to recreate New York). For all I know this could have been a digital effect. Either way, it looks flawless.If anything, it just goes to show that Vanilla Sky always has your attention, right from the beginning. To be able to sustain that for two hours in a movie that has a sense of unconventional artiness to it is impressive. It's not a terrific movie, but it has been thought through and executed well enough, that it is recommendable as both a surrealist movie and a emotional drama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Not as good as the original,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie called Abre Los Ojos. I think that I didn't like this film as much as I could have because I had seen the original. This version had several main problems for me. To begin, this film added a lot of back story about the main character which just needlessly complicated the story. The original was very sharp in that respect. Additionally, this film didn't leave very much to the imagination, going into long expository at times that broke the fast-paced flow of the original. Finally, the music used in this film seemed to take center stage and some of it seemed very inappropriate for the tension of film. This isn't a bad film, but if you've seen the original before seeing this one, you may find it has many shortcomings.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
What's the Big Deal?,"Why are audiences having so many problems with ""Vanilla Sky""?  I've heard nothing but griping and complaining about how the movie is ""weird"" or ""doesn't play fair.""

I'll admit it's challenging compared to most movies, but most producers know people have zero attention span and this is why their movies are filled with wall to wall explosions or poop jokes.""Vanilla Sky"" wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, but it's still a fairly good movie as long as you're patient with it.  Everyone in it does a great job with their characters, and Cameron Crowe directs it in a very un-Cameron Crowe way.  I can see why some people would throw their hands up in the air with the ending because it does seem a little loopy if I think about it. Still, I'm going to give it credit as the only movie I ever seen in which the film's true genre isn't revealed until the last 20 minutes of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Protracted and somewhat dragging, but overall one overwhelming, truly original motion picture that you won't soon forget","I was anxious to see this movie, being that I am--and please don't think I'm corny for saying this--a Tom Cruise fan.  I didn't like ALL his movies (didn't care for either of the ""Mission Impossible"" flicks), but he is a real cool actor, and that was made evident ever since his breakthrough role in ""Risky Business.""  Cruise turns in yet another terrific performance. It's a shame, being he is one of the handsomemest men in the universe, that they had to fracture his face throughout most of the film, but I also have to admire him for allowing viewers (especially females) to see him disfigured, proving (like in ""Born on the 4th of July"") that he is not just a glamour guy, just a pretty face, that he is up to taking risks in the roles he chooses.If you've seen the previews, you've seen the first thirty minutes.  And for that, I'm glad!  Because so many previews nowadays practically give away the film.  Anyone who has seen the previews for ""Cast Away"" knows that's true. Though it was a great movie, we sat there for three hours knowing that Tom Hanks would finally survive and return to civilization in one piece.  I won't give away what happens after Cruise gets into the car accident with Cameron Diaz, because the outcome is utterly unpredictable.  Cameron Crowe surprises you with plot twist after plot twist, making you think more and more.  After leaving the theater, I had a totally different view of life. All sorts of questions came into mind.  All those magical ""what if"" questions.  What if things aren't what they seem?  Though the outcome is pure fantasy--created with great imagination--it still makes you ponder what lies in the future.  Maybe this COULD happen.Jason Lee is a scene-stealer, as Cruise's best friend.  I am a great admirer of Jason, but after cringing at his disastrous role in ""Heartbreakers"" I was hoping he could stay in the independent circuit, and not even dream of co-starring in another big-budget motion picture.  But in this movie he plays the role he was born to play--what he's truly good at.  Playing the wise-cracking, intellectual, smart-aleck, know-it-all best friend.  The kind of role that put him on the map in such films as ""Mallrats"" and ""Chasing Amy.""  He is hilarious and brings great comic relief to this moderately depressing story.  So I hope to see him in more movies, small- or big-budget--just be careful how they cast you, Jason.As for Penelope Cruz--I have to admit, I'm tired of seeing her on screen. I used to think she was attractive, but now I think she looks like a bird. But that's not my main reason for disliking her in this film.  In fact, I didn't mind her (small) role in ""Blow.""  I guess it's because her role was only semi-serious, playing a sex-obsessed cokehead.  In ""Vanilla Sky"" she plays a serious role that seems to have been written for an American, or someone with good control of the English language.  Here, she's struggling through her lines left and right, and the dialogue just doesn't sound convincing coming from her mouth.  Therefore, it's hard for her to convey any true emotion.  I've never seen any of her Spanish films, but she might've acted well in them, being she has great control of her native language.  So I'm not just being cruel.  I'm sorry, but I just find her accent to be annoying and distracting.At two hours and thirty minutes, the movie is too long for its own good and it does drag at times--a few scenes really didn't seem necessary and could've easily ended up on the cutting room floor.  But I guess Cameron Crowe is one of those directors who prefers to stretch out the running time, making sure not a single element is left out.  ""Jerry Maguire"" (also directed by Crowe) was also too long for its own good.  However, I'm still recommending this film because of the mere fact that it's like nothing you've ever seen.  It's the kind of film you won't soon forget and will definitely leave a lasting impact.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

From that point everything will change for him and he will have to deal with some new situations.I found this movie very interesting because the mystery never faded out and continued through the whole duration of the film. The interpretations of Tom Cruise who played as David Aames, Cameron Diaz who played as Julie Gianni and Pen√©lope Cruz who played as Sofia Serrano were very good and the combination of all those actors made this amazing result. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very good and he presented very well the stories of his main characters while the mystery behind some aspects continued.

A Drug You'll Take Again and Again,"""Vanilla Sky"" is about a drug. It's a familiar drug that every man tries once in his life, whether consciously or not. In the film, that drug is Sofia (Penelope Cruz). She embodies love‚Äîthat intoxicating drug that gives David (Tom Cruise) a high that permanently shifts his normal. In other words, his mood will never be the same again without it.David, a guy so perfect that a single gray hair is unacceptable, is seemingly forced towards humility after suffering a disfiguring accident shortly after meeting Sofia. However, it is not humility he achieves, but a curse that transcends any kind of physical deformity. David has to have that drug again, so he desperately seeks out his previous normal state, taking drastic measures to make it a reality.Both Cruise and Cruz play idealized characters. Cruise plays a meticulously perfect big shot, who is only likable because of his abundance of confidence and charm. Meanwhile, Cruz is the natural kind of perfect, and is as desirable as she is pure (she met his friend at a library!). It is no surprise that they were a pair in real life because their puppy love is authentic and palpable (an emotional stage on par with ""A Lot Like Love"" and ""Like Crazy""). I could not help but smile. And Cameron Diaz is utterly frightening as the irrationally clingy stalker‚Äîevery man's worst nightmare.The film just exudes replay value. It is a cerebral ride along the lines of ""The Butterfly Effect"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""Source Code"", and ""The Fountain""‚Äîall loose-reality based films where a man obsesses over a woman.Vanilla Sky is pure ecstasy and an enthralling cinematic escape. It's a drug I want to take again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky,"I'm not really a fan of Tom Cruise, but I think this film might be his finest example of actually not just being all teeth and torso. He might actually do some acting here as the full-of-himself publisher ""Aames"" who lives the life of the wealthy playboy. A beautiful apartment, vintage car and convenient relationship with ""Julie"" (Cameron Diaz) fill his days of inherited luxury. Then his world comes, quite literally, crashing about his ears and he finds himself in jail explaining what happened to psychologist ""McCabe"" (the sparingly used Kurt Russell). It's a story of jealousy that leads to suicide, disfigurement and presents us with a rather stark indictment of this man's rather shallow and selfish life. His decline all starts when ""Julie"" - who seems quite a bit more invested in their relationship than he does - gets a bit jealous of his flirtations with ""Sofia"" (Pen√©lope Cruz) who was dating his best friend ""Shelby"" (Jason Lee) until he brings her along to his party. Then sexual chemistry starts buzzing but that quite quickly adds a toxic element to just about everyone's lives. His have my cake and eat it approach swiftly leads to a series of circumstances that not only leads to his current predicament but also causes him to vacillate between worlds of dream and reality - he simply isn't sure what is happening any more. Which, if any of the scenarios unfolding is the true one? Are any of them? The story itself is not especially innovative. What does impress here is Cruise playing a character that is pretty unlikeable and he does it well. He imbues ""Aames"" with characteristics that made me feel a life behind bars was just about right. Unfortunately, I felt Cruz's ""Sofia"" character a bit under-developed but there are plaudits for Diaz who really does deliver her role of the jilted, besotted, lover convincingly. It takes too long to get up to speed, and there is too much dialogue but the last hour presents us with quite a compelling look at self-destruction in a man ill-equipped to deal with anything he hadn't already dealt with using his silver spoon and good looks.

Poor remake of a beautiful story,"This movie is an insult to the original version, Abre los Ojos. The original's title means open the eyes, but when you see this clumsy and wretched abomination, you'll want to close them again. Perhaps even gouge them out.The Spanish movie boasted a fine cast, skillful direction, and exquisite cinematography in relating a beautiful, romantic, inspiring, and thought provoking tale that touches both the heart and mind. This rubbish copy fails to do any of this. All you see is Tom Cruise sauntering around with a bizarre blemish on his face, while reciting lines in an uninspired mono tonal manner that fails to convey the rich story. A movie that poses questions about reality and fantasy, among several other topics, requires (and deserves) more convincing acting. Penelope Cruz did a fine job in the original, yet looks like a broken marionette in this version. Cameron Diaz, doing her same old over-aged teen girl bit, is simply annoying.A rare positive note here is Kurt Russell, not only for the one superior performance in this film, but for putting up with all these hacks and not just giving up as most people would be tempted to do. Also, I applaud whoever punched Tom in the face, marking him up like that: well done.

Not much to Crowe about!,"First thing is I must admit to not having seen 'Abre Los Ojos', so I can't comment on how much of this is a straightforward remake, or whether any of it is different or original . 'Vanilla Sky' begins as a murder mystery, but that is just a ruse, it is in fact more Phildickian than Hitchcockian. Any fan of PKD's mind-blowing work, specifically 'Ubik', 'A Maze Of Death' and 'Flow My Tears The Policeman Said', bits of which 'Vanilla Sky' share some similarities to, will feel more at home with this kind of material than 'Jerry Maguire' fans.I have two major problems with 'Vanilla Sky', and both of them I blame on Cameron Crowe, a director who fails to set my world on fire. Apart from the flawed but entertaining 'Almost Famous' I haven't liked much of his output, which to me is basically commercial pap. With this movie he is obviously trying to expand his range, and succeeds to a certain degree, but still doesn't entirely pull it off.My first problem is Crowe's direction which is disjointed, clumsy and ultimately turns potentially fascinating material into a bore. My other problem was the distracting and ridiculous use of music. It was almost like Crowe went through his record collection and insisted on putting in his favourite bits, regardless of whether it made any cinematic sense or not. Maybe he was going for a similar eclectic feel that the Coen's achieved in 'The Big Lebowski', more than likely, looking at the subject matter, it was trying to be a comment on pop culture and the media ala Trent Reznor's superb musical collage in 'Natural Born Killers'. Whatever the motivation it fell flat on its face, and almost single handedly ruined this movie for me.Ultimately 'Vanilla Sky' is neither a masterpiece, nor a complete turkey. Crowe is no Kubrick, Cronenberg or Lynch, and this kind of concept needs someone of that vision and creative originality to truly soar. It is interesting in places, irritating in others, and dull for too much of the time. Nice try, worth a look for sure, just don't have high expectations.

An undeniably odd Hollywood event picture,"In a career that started all the way back in 1981 with debut feature Endless Love and continues to this day with the likes of Top Gun: Maverick and multiple Mission Impossible's on their way to cinemas around the globe in the near future, Tom Cruise's Christmas release from 2001 Vanilla Sky stands out from an incredibly resilient filmography as one of Cruise's most daring and unique big budget efforts.Teaming up with his Jerry Maguire collaborator Cameron Crowe, a directional effort that too stands out as an odd one out in the director's romcom/dramedy heavy C. V, Sky see's the two Hollywood veterans re-imagine Alejandro Amen√°bar's 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, as they transport the story to New York City as Cruise's wealthy businessman and self-centered ladies man David Aames has his life upended by a near fatal car accident that leaves him disfigured and trying desperately to reconnect with the potential love of his life and his memories.Unafraid to get extremely weird, Sky would have to be one of the most trippy Hollywood event pictures from the early 2000's, Crowe and Cruise take the audience on a wild ride that melts timelines and real and fake as Aames (often under the clad of a very creepy facial mask) battles to understand where his life sits following his accident and where his destiny lays if he can't find and build a relationship with Penelope Cruz's Sofia Serrano, a woman that offers him the chance at a normal life and meaning in a world his lost touch with.Saying too much more about where Sky goes and just how bizarre things get would ruin the fun too be had from viewing this film for the first time and while its not hard to see why audiences and even more so critics were fairly harsh to Crowe and Cruise's big brand feature, it's also not hard to see why Sky has since garnered a mostly positive reputation post release with even its main star declaring this is a personal favorite for him, a bold statement from someone that's stared in the likes of Magnolia, Collateral and The Last Samurai.Speaking of the films leading man, Cruise delivers a divisive performance here and one that will continue to split opinion but his commitment is as strong as you'd expect from the determined performer and his a stoic presence throughout the film even when it veers off the rails only to find its way back again again creating a topsy turvey experience but one that can't be faltered for ambition and big ideas, something sorely lacking in many such films as this today.Final Say -A film that to this day remains a unique and ambitious undertaking, Vanilla Sky doesn't always soar and its ideas sometimes remain out of reach of its grasp but there's no faulting Cruise and Crowe's attempts at creating something special in a landscape that usually plays it safe.3 floor TV's out of 5For more reviews check out Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Awesome piece of work!,"Vanilla Sky was on my list from a long time. So much of mixed reviews and feedback for this movie, intrigued and hieghtened my curiosity to watch it. Eventually took time out for it, and certainly glad about it.Having watched Tom Cruise's quite a few movies, I felt this to be one of his best. Expressions and body language delivered more emotions than the dialogues. This is also true for other characters in the movie. Surely it comes out from an exceptional direction by Cameron Crowe.The story line and pace is gluesome. Keeps you there in every scene, as it unfolds. The chemistry of the characters, evelotion of David till the last scene and great acting delivery by most, sums it up as a great watch.To conclude, the movie doesn't get over in 136 minutes, but stays with you much beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Pretty engrossing,"There is an ambitious, original story here (at least there was in the film this was a remake of) which is unfortunately rare these days and the acting was good enough to get it's emotional hooks in me. It also kept me interested in the mystery throughout right up until the finale (which was refreshingly completely out of left field) when everything is explained. The only thing that left me cold was that this explanation gave me a deep sense of existential dread when the tone the movie seemed to be shooting for was one of freedom and excitement.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Waste of time,"This has been the worst waste of time that I have experienced for several years.

Underrated masterpiece.,"Surprisingly one of my favorite movies of all time. If you enjoy surreal, offbeat films then Vanilla Sky is right up your alley. Vanilla Sky is a mind-bending excursion across genres - a warped fairy tale that dabbles in romance, mythology, horror, mystery, and science fiction. There are plenty of philosophical musings on the difference between dreams and reality, and numerous occasions in which the film dares us to tell them apart. Vanilla Sky gives new meaning to the familiar phrase from a children's song: ""Life is but a dream."" Tom Cruise brings movie star wattage and appeal and both the ladies Diaz and Cruz are bubby and good. Top notch directing the film. The pacing is excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
One of those movies that the average joe will never get,"I'm sure Vanilla Sky has some deep profound meaning to it, but I have yet to find it. I'm not sure even the director knew where he was going with this film either - which works in some cases, but for me this was just one huge trip.I will give kudos to Tom Cruise and his stunning performance - he does passionate scenes of anger, confusion and remorse. Penelope Cruz is wonderful as the shy, coy and mysterious love interest.Throughout the whole movie, you wonder what is reality and what is not. When is David dreaming? When is he awake? Was he ever awake in the first place? If he wasn't awake then what was the point of this all - was this entire movie just a dream?To put it bluntly - I don't know if I see any deep message hidden in the confines of this blur of reality. It's just trippy. One of those movies that I, as an average viewer will never get, just being honest.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Heavy drugs needed for enjoyment or recovery from this film,"When I go to a party, there are two types of annoying guests. The intellectual eggheads who drone on endlessly, and the babbling motormouth airheads who must keep their lips flapping or they will apparently die of asphyxiation. ""Vanilla Sky"" is like the combination of those two guests. It drones on and on endlessly, and if you actually care to figure out what's going on, it will never let you get a thought in edgewise. Tom Cruise smirks a lot for forty minutes, then gets all confused, just like the audience. Cameron Diaz is hot and she can stalk me any day, but unfortunatly she's gone before we have a chance to know more about her. I don't know what the hell Penolope Cruz was trying to say, but they should have provided subtitles. The movie then turns into a pretentious hodgepodge of philosophy and virtual reality that by this point had me shaking my head. Of course, just like every other ""deep"" movie ever released since ""The Sixth Sense"", it has to have some quirky explanation as to why things were the way they were. Trust me, you'll be so underwhelmed by the secret suprise ending of ""Vanilla Sky"", you won't remember to reveal it anyone.

What is happiness to you?,"Vanilla Sky's trailer tells us that the movie is full of hot people in a tangled romance and that the movie is fairly fluffy and normal and something you've probably already seen a million times before and that couldn't be further from the truth.It is a haunting, dark, psychological movie that dives into David's subconscious and examines his innermost desires and fears. ""What is happiness to you?"" is a line that is used multiple times in this movie. I really connected with the main character as he faced his demons and tried with all his heart to find happiness. Vanilla Sky is a love story but it is also a story of maturing and finding yourself.The best friend of the hot guy who steals all the girls from him is played perfectly by Jason Lee. You can sense the admiration and resentment of David Ames all mixed in together. I've never thought much of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz or Penelope Cruz till I saw them in this. I figured Tom could only do action and that Diaz could only do comedy before I ran into Vanilla Sky.There's a scene where Cameron Diaz says, ""I swallowed your cum - that means something!"" and the whole theater was in shock. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. The director mentions that his intention in that scene was to let us feel as though we were hearing a conversation and listening in on something that is normally private and that's exactly how I felt throughout a lot of the movie.What is happiness to you? It's a personal question that everyone should find out for themselves.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Everything was in it's right place..,"No seriously, think about it. Tom Cruise had to play an arrogant and irritating achiever, a moneymaker at it's finest. Penelope Cruz had to be beautiful.

Many complain about it and said they didn't understand it at all, but I thought it was all pretty clear. We even got a proper explanation at the end.Also, who would know that such a confronting and gloaming story could be molded into such a warm little gem? This movie was genuinely feel-good, even though it's difficulties and events were heavy-weight and intriguing.Everything in this movie worked.

Literally brought tears to my eyes,"Vanilla Sky, as seen in many reviews, is not for everyone, but without doubt its story could easily relate to everyone in one way or another. David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a silverspooned financially fed young man, inheriting his father's lucrative business and he makes sure that everyone within a 10 mile radius is fully aware of this fact. Lavish parties, fancy cars, women bowing at his feet. It all seems so wonderfully unconquerable until suddenly it all comes crashing down and he is left to stand on his own two feet as a man. Not saying everyone becomes rich but everyone experiences tragedy in their lives and this movie really lets us know that everything we have could all be gone in an instant. That may sound depressing, yet the movie is never depressing, but it does invoke deep emotions of happiness, sadness, despair, loneliness, and what it really means to be alive and that we should never take anything for granted. This is a powerful and positive message that comes through and I was moved, particularly in the closing scenes. Penelope Cruz is really great as Sofia, supporting the story with her own style of mystique and believability. Cameron Diaz also stamps her varied skills here as Julianna, but the rest of the cast don't feature greatly - it's really a 3 person movie mainly and they (Cruise, Cruz, Diaz) carry it on their very capable shoulders. Some viewers may remark it's too self centred and egotistical as far as Cruise is concerned, but in actual fact, much of the movie has his character David Aames going through mental and physical hell, which again is relevant in our society where fears, loss and despair affect all of us at some time in our lives. There are happy parts as well which balances the whole story out well and I really enjoyed this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Good movie but is unable to justify any genre,"Tom Cruise is charming as always. Charlize Theron has minimal space but acts extremely well. Penelope Cruz although plays a bigger role but doesn't seem to explore much of her acting. The story is interesting and you want to know the end but that's it. You only want to know the end and their are very few thrilla in between. It is an interesting watch but Tom Cruise has done many better roles and there are many better movie options as well. However it's a fun Sunday watch. Yes, the movie does leave with some open questions but they dont stay with you and don't really care much about the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A meandering piece of awful,"It's hard to imagine a more disappointing follow-up to Cameron Crowe's delightful, captivating ""Almost Famous"" than this confused disaster, which is long on long and short on everything else.This is the kind of movie that needs a killer performance to ""save"" it--something to sink your teeth into and distract you from the fact that the story itself has little impact or interest.  Tom Cruise can't do it--not that he's incapable (I actually think he's rather underrated), but the character is a loser of a protagonist.  He's too self-satisfied early on and too self-pitying later to be even remotely likable.  I like Jason Lee a lot, so I'm sorry to say that his tacked-on buddy character doesn't cut the mustard either.Then we get to the ladies...OK, deep breath.  I really, truly mean it when I say that Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are probably the two worst actresses in Hollywood that aren't working for Vivid Video.  On top of this, as luck would have it, they decided to reserve their worst respective performances for ""Vanilla Sky."" Both of them are positively grating.  ""When we come back as cats.""  I hope someone backs over you with their car.Crowe deserves as much blame as the cast--he fails to inject any sort of urgency into the film--though probably not through lack of trying.  For example, nice try switching the girls back and forth with alternate shots...too bad Spike Lee made much more compelling use of the same trick a decade earlier in ""Mo' Better Blues.""  This movie didn't need gimmickry and trickery--it needed someone to grab hold of the story and really tell it. Instead, it sort of wanders along, and the big plot twist comes long after all our interest is lost.A real bomb of a movie--avoid at all costs.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Ok-ish movie for the non-believer,"Let me start by saying, barely any production from Hollywood discusses the real questions in live. Their answer to many questions is: guns, money, status, sex and our Creator is never a topic.The characters in this movie are lost, to say the least. This movie creates a futuristic ideal for the non-believer: you will not surely die. That was the exact lie Satan told Adam and Eve in the garden and people still believe this in the 21st century. This movie underrates our precious lives on earth. The story telling is persuasive but don't let it get to you.

Up in the air or down on the ground?,"Its only in the last 10 or 15 minutes of this film that we have an explanation as to what this movie is really all about;( a device which I found in context amateur-ish). Whilst the picture is often entertaining, it is confusing and uneven in parts and I had the impression that much of the film was made up as it went along even though at the end that was unlikely to be the case but that was the impression given to me. On the plus side....nice music, good special effects though the Spanish actress seem to be there more for her looks than talent. It is true that as the story unfold various ""clues"" are given as to where the plot is going but unlike for instance Matrix which can be said to be in the classic category, Vanilla Sky is a victim of its own confusion and that dilutes much of what ought to be a thought provoking theme.

This already classic might motivate you to ask yourself a lot of questions about dying and death,"Being very busy with life I missed this quite famous movie when it came out in 2001. We decided to see it now, 22 years later with my wife. It is one of the movies coming out around the break of the new millennium, when some people especially those being very rich started to have phantasies about somehow avoiding the physical death. Now we have another wave when some people again think they can avoid dying and death with the help of computers and so-called artificial intelligence. It is not that difficult to mix up your dreams with the physical reality, especially when you practice or get training in lucid dreaming as main protagonist of this movie David Ames. The first part of the movie is little bit boring, until everything really starts after the intentional car accident. Then we are provoked into some very interesting contemplations. Is it really better to dream than live a real life, as Marcel Proust years back was suggesting? Is it really so hard to recognize that we are dreaming, as David struggles? Can a lucid dreaming be better than the physical reality? Would you say yes if you practice lucid dreaming? Can we reach the state of science when we would be able to erase someone's memories stored in the physical brain and implant the new ones? Would you like to be frozen and revived in the future like David? I would not, maybe you would. Was technical support guy taking David to his Higher Self into much higher vibrations of our existence? Elevators in the dreams usually mean that. Is movie suggesting that David decided to commit suicide and incarnate again into another human body in another time in his hope to find Sofia again? The movie certainly avoids direct answers to these and similar questions. However, it is very inspirational for you to seek those answers yourself. Try, it is not so difficult. Worth to see this provocative picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
If you saw the original...,"...than this has to be a disappointment. I wish I could see it ""for the first time"" again because Abre los Ojos was a masterpiece to me. Maybe I was SO deathly bored because I already knew what was going to happen? Also, please Mr Crowe, we know you love rock music but it's not a SUBSTITUTE for emotion. Please turn it dow, the old Monkees and Beach Boys makes this seem like a weak acid flick like Jack Nicholson's ""Psyche Out"".Penelope Cruz seemed like a much better actress with subtitles, the reading is so monotone. The Cameron Diaz character was better in the first film because there was less of a ""relationship"" between her and David and she was less attractive. This makes her more dangerous, the more casual realtionship makes David more of a heel. Crowe, of course, would hesitate to make any main character less than likable, especially Tom Cruise, a fine actor who is miscast as he brings too much audience presupposition to this. The dialoge is TOO MUCH, as Crowe seems to want to add more meaning, more statements to a fine film that simply weigh it down. Unlike most foreign films, you cannot find Abre los Ojos boring or pretentious even if you hated it. Sadly, we can't say that this time around.** 1/2 as my expectations may be too high compared to the first film, but the soundtrack and banter are too much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Once it gets inside you, it doesn't want to leave","I'm a dvd collector at my young age in my middle teens and i went to buy some and saw Vanilla Sky.  The idea of the film intrigued me and the fact that it was a remake of a spanish film also interested me.  I saw Cameron Crowe as the director and I liked some of his previous work and musical tastes so, I thought i might like it.  I watched it confused, depressed, and all around melancholy.  It got to the end and all the strings were pulled it together and it all made sense about his journey as a man and I still felt uneasy.  I then watched the ending again to maybe see if I missed something but, I didnt.  This film really made a mark on me that i don't know the signifigance of it.  The whole feeling of the film is still in me and I feel somehow, inspired.  Inspired in the sense that I felt refreshed and the need to go out and do something with my life.  There is is something much larger then all of us out there and a reason for us to live our lives voluntarily. I heard some people just cast down the film as confusing and they didnt understand it but, the fact is this movie isn't for everyone.

"Never bland, but never terribly interesting (or comprehensible)","In an era of big-budget, super-duper special effects movies, a lot of people pine for the old days when plot meant something and characterization was key. Well, look what we get. A convoluted, disinterested absurd piece of pablum that's not worth the celluloid on which it was filmed.Vanilla Sky is about a dashing young publisher named David Aames (Tom Cruise) who has two women in his life - his ""buddy"" Julie (Cameron Diaz) and mysterious new woman Sofia (Penelope Cruz), who just happens to be his best friend's girlfriend. David feels he's being stalked by Julie, who wants more than sex, but he can't keep his eyes and hands off Sofia. You can see this is just heading for trouble.Much of the plot centers around a violent car crash in which David emerges with a disfigured face. What happens after that is quite surreal - kind of like floating in a dream in which at once everything and nothing seems to have meaning. Under such circumstances, one can twist logic and reality into whatever one desires (in this case, ""one"" would be the screenwriter). Anything can happen and be justified. That's great, but it doesn't always make for a good movie, just as free association doesn't make for a good novel.To begin with, Cruise himself seems miscast, although ironically so. He's the kind of movie actor who much of the world sees as the cocky, arrogant, preening archetype of male stars, always worried about how they look. And yet here he is with a horribly ugly face - is he trying to tell the world, ""Look, I can play creepy-looking, too!"" No, Tom, you can't.And for at least the third movie, I hear Cruise utter these words, or a variation: ""I've been set up!"" He sure gets set up a lot - see The Firm, this one, and the upcoming Minority Report, to name three. What it all goes back to is his characters' inability to believe they themselves have done anything wrong, ever.Secondly, there's a huge lack of chemistry between any of the three leads, especially between Cruise and Cruz. I'm sure there are legions of people who believe Penelope Cruz is the cat's pajamas, but don't count me among them. I didn't find her particularly attractive or alluring in the movie. I won't waste space picking apart her obvious physical issues, but please - let's not place her on some goddess pedestal. But for a couple that apparently fell for each other off the set, Cruise and Cruz don't seem particularly enamored of each other on it. Yes, they make goo-goo eyes to each other. Snoresville.And that plot! It's one thing to have twists and turns, each leading to more questions and mysteries, and it's quite another to have each twist cancel out the last twist. The movie kept negating itself. I know it was trying to show that the line between dreams and reality can be seriously blurred, but you can't have each scene render the last one irrelevant. Instead of being clever, all this does is confuse and frustrate the viewer.About the only real spark of life comes from David's best friend Brian, played by Jason Lee. And you know, when Jason Lee's the only one making things happen, you know you got yourself a crappy movie. There are supposed heavyweights in this movie - Cruise, Diaz - and your best performance is by Jason Lee of Mallrats and Almost Famous (another Cameron Crowe movie, like this flop)? Geez!I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater, although I might not have been so critical if I had (you know, it's the classic ""I spent $8 on this, so I'm gonna like it!"" rhetoric). I don't think Cruise's career is in any kind of jeopardy, as evidenced by his usual $20 million paycheck. He might want to develop an additional facial expression or two, however.This is a bizarre, pointless movie that seems to take delight in its tortured script, wallowing in its own nonsense.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Abre Los Ojos is better,"Vanilla Sky is the Hollywoodized, dumbed down version of Abre los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And a lot louder.

It even copies shots, editing, and formats (even a flash-black in grainy black and white!). And Pen√©lope Cruz plays the same role in both.I consider myself intelligent enough to figure out the plot without being hit in the head with it, so I prefer the more obscure, ambiguous original. It's also a lot more suggestive, rather than the expensive, explicit Vanilla Sky. There is no ILM in Spain, so they make up for the lack of special effects with interesting gaps and well constructed suspense.Overall, I believe this is a meddling remake, which does not really add much interesting material to the original (nor get rid of its flaws). It's on the line of the Psycho remake, and we know how that turned out.Yet I am Spanish, so there's also a bit of a bias here. Only a bit, though.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

This movie floored me,"We open with an aerial view of NYC with intermittent pauses of darkness and silence. David Aames (Cruise) wakes up and drives off to see a deserted NYC at 9AM. It's eerily quiet. But it's also just a dream and he wakes up again, and this time all is normal. But at that point, I realized that this movie is going to be a mindfu--. Boy, does it deliver.The movie can almost be cut into three pieces: the somewhat hokey beginning, the mindfu--ing middle portion, and the resolution that will make many go back to see it again. The hokey beginning shows Cruise living the life of a rich punk getting everything he wants, including Sofia Serrano (Cruz). They have an incredible non-sexual night together; one of those nights where two people connect. He falls for Serrano, which frustrates Gianni to no end, causing her to drive him off a bridge, disfiguring his face.The second part is filled with disjointed scenes where Cruise is in a jail cell talking with Dr. McCabe (Russell) about a murder while reliving the past. Things become less and less clear and soon the audience is completely confused as to what the hell is going on.But don't worry as when the secret is revealed, it explains much (though perhaps not all), and even does a nice job stringing in past scenes. I don't want to give anything away; you'll know what I mean when you see it.The movie isn't perfect, IMO. I wasn't crazy about Cruz, as some of the lines delivered seemed flat, and one scene where she runs away is almost comedic. Also, Crowe sometimes drowns the movie in music to the point of distraction. The first part does sort of lag, but only because it is supposed to establish the story so I don't fault that.Bottom line, this movie may require some patience in the beginning, but it totally captures you about 1/2-way into the movie and doesn't let you go. When it finally ""opened my eyes"", I was sincerely shocked. I talked about the movie for close to an hour with friends. When a movie makes you think about it after it's over, that's the mark of a good movie. On par with Memento, but still not to the level of Mulholland Drive, Vanilla Sky will probably end up as one of my favorite movies of the year, and one of those movies that come up in conversations of movies that ""you gotta see"". 8/10.-Mark",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

It was nothing so clear as ""I don't like it.""The uneasy feeling stayed with me.  In fact, it took me several hours to realize that I simply don't LIKE seeing Tom Cruise as a loser.

Best movie I've seen in a long time..,"First off I just want to stress to people who are planning to see this movie,that I didn't know much about the film before i watched it, other than it was a drama/romance and it happened to be directed by Cameron crowe. After seeing Jerry Maguire i decided i had to give this a shot.I was so glad i saw this before i saw the original movie it was based on, which was a Spanish movie named 'open your eyes'Now i know that most of the scenes/story is a lot alike the original but by far this is one of the best remakes i have seen in a while. The entire cast is a joy to watch. Not to mention Vanilla Sky has a killer soundtrack which goes amazingly well with the tone of the movie A very strong and convincing performance by Tom Cruise kept me gripped at all times in the movie.Crowe manages to keep me on the edge of my seat, scene after scene waiting to know what will happen next. Vanilla Sky has all the elements of what it takes to create a magical movie with its delightful chemistry shown between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz, and to the breathtaking visuals we see. Penelope is very believable in her role and you can't imagine anyone better as the sweet Sophia.Unexpectedly Cameron Diaz is charismatic and oozing charm even as a supportive character role.I can guarantee that Vanilla Sky will open your mind and explore every emotion you have attached to you. The story is cleverly portrayed and will not disappoint! I also want to add that watching it twice made me appreciate it even more. There isn't cinema quite like this anymore!I was disappointed to see that it didn't receive all positive reviews at first, although I think in time it will get the appreciation it so rightfully deserves!Verdict: Give it a chance.Chances like this don't come very often..!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Better than the original - a first for Hollywood,"Saw the original, hated it. Like Cameron Crowe, thought I'd see what he did with it. Very stylish, fair too much music piped in every 5 minutes (bet they shifted a few copies of the soundtrack) but it was visually appealing. And Tom Cruise was funny, though whether or not that was deliberate is a discussion point for another website.See it, forget about it. Cameron says on the DVD that he is still talking about this film as it was so memorable. Er, no it isn't. I am still taking about 'Memento' but I'll have forgotten about 'Vanilla Sky' by next week.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Life Extension,"I love the unique style and background Cameron Crowe brings to his films. It's like an unexpected mixture of juvenile wonder and adult innocence that appeals to me about his films. Vanilla Sky is by far his darkest feature, but also the one with the least amount of heart and pizazz. In fact, most of it is just a dull mess.Vanilla Sky is an American remake of the 1997 Spanish film, Open Your Eyes. While I haven't seen that film yet, I can imagine it's probably a little more coherent. The remake poses some thought provoking questions and themes, including questions centered around life, death, dreams, guilt, regret, and a few other heavy hitters. But the way in which those themes are covered is less than impressive. It's a poor pun, but perhaps it isn't too surprising that this film feels very vanilla.The performances were great all around, and became the main driving force for my dwindling interest as the film went along. You can see Tom Cruise's passion for this role dripping through the character of David. This may be the best Cameron Diaz has ever been, as the creepy but seductive Julie Gianni. And of course, Penelope Cruz is great as Sofia Serrano. As much as I love their performances, it's difficult to become invested in any of the relationships when the script isn't where it needs to be. It's a dull screenplay that feeds off your attention span, or lack thereof. By that I mean that the film is only as interesting as you make it out to be. It takes plenty of twists and turns to keep your interest enough, but what's the point of a twist if you don't really care where the characters end up?Vanilla Sky is essentially a melodramatic soap opera disguised as a romantic mystery. I wasn't necessarily bored during the film, but it didn't grab my interest the way a film like this should have. Great acting, trippy visuals, and a classic Cameron Crowe soundtrack wasn't enough to save this dreamy picture.+Acting+Poses interesting questions-But takes too many twists and turns for those questions to mean anything-Dull script5.6/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
great movie,"The great movie. have mystery, romance, thrill and every thing. I really enjoyed it. I just love Pen√©lope Cruz's acting. She is amazing and tom cruise have maintain his status. starting in polite way and with the movie thrill increase to its peak. classical story. perfect execution of story. strong end. most underrated movie.I had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at IMDb and that's why I had avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
As a confused viewer who was expecting a sequel to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs ...,"... I can understand why this movie might not have been enjoyable for kids. Vanilla Sky (2001) is definitely not a children's movie and is quite different from the lighthearted and comedic tone of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.Vanilla Sky is a psychological thriller that explores themes of love, loss, and identity. The plot follows a wealthy and privileged man named David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, who becomes disfigured in a car accident and struggles to come to terms with his new reality. As he tries to rebuild his life and relationships, he starts to question what is real and what is not.The movie is visually stunning and the acting is top-notch, but it can be difficult to follow at times, especially if you were expecting something entirely different. There are twists and turns that can be confusing and even unsettling for some viewers, and the movie's ending is open to interpretation.I can see why Vanilla Sky might not be enjoyable for children, especially if they were expecting a sequel to Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. However, for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, this movie is a thought-provoking and visually impressive journey into the human psyche.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"A frustrating and ultimately boring, pedantic experience.","Twenty minutes have gone by before I realized that I was watching a movie in which I cared little about what happened to any of the major characters. Ames (Tom Cruise) has no morality or integrity, and is surrounded by other characters (Cameron Diaz) of similar bent. At times, such movies can still hold my interest if the plot creates issues of some importance. Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver here as well since director Cameron Crowe has created a Lynch-like glob of glue that only held my interest briefly. The movie's only saving grace is the cinematography, especially, an erie morning drive to Times Square and the opening scenes of New York City from the air. Otherwise... forgetaboutit.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
no go,"On a rainy December night, more than a year ago, I piled into my local cinema to watch the latest film from legendary Cameron Crowe.  When I left, however, the only thing I wanted was my money back.VANILLA SKY is a disaster in every essence of the word.  It shows what can happen when Tom Cruise gets his arms around a director and forces him to make a star vehicle.The whole dream/reality was far too much for a rock journalist turned filmmaker.  And although Crowe has talents in other genres, this one made him look foolish and grossly misguided.  The only thing I really wanted to say was, ""Get the led out.""",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Amen√°bar shouldn`t have sold his idea,"Frankly speaking, I went to see this movie only for the reason I was curious about what Tom Cruise had made from this fantastic, terrific Spanish movie, but I was really disappointed. The only positive thing what I can say about the remake is that an empty Times Square at 9 o`clock in the morning is for sure far more impressive than Paseo de la Castellana in Madrid, and I liked the opening scene of Manhattan`s view from above. The rest is just a weak attempt to settle the story in the American reality. All the characters are much better in the original film, including Pen√©lope Cruz: even if she has a lovely Spanish accent in English, the fact is in Amen√°bar`s movie she acted better. I also heard from people that hadn`t had the chance to see ""Open your eyes"" that it was very difficult for them to understand the plot. And finally, although Cruise spent, as I believe, bigger bucks on his film than Amen√°bar, adding all kinds of special effects, money is not everything: it`s talent what really matters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
As litteral as remakes comes,"Vanilla Sky is about as literal as remakes commes. At least 97% of scenes are directly taken from the original Abre Los Ojos/Open your eyes, with very little cahnge. Even a lot of dialogue are almost word for word translated and transfered. I liked Abre Los Ojos a lot, and therefore I also like this movie. Had I watched this one before the original I might have rated it higher, and I know it's not quite fair to this one to rate it based on another movie, but as it is such a close copy, that is were I stand now. Vanilla Sky does win points for better describing the main characters company problems, but loses points over all for not feeling quite as emotional as the original. I wouldn't advise against seeing Vanilla Sky, but I'd first direct you towards the original. If you've already wtched Vanilla Sky and liked it, definatly look up the original, if you've watched abre los ojos already but not Vanilla Sky, I'd say you neednt bother too much about this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

The scene between Cruise and Cruz where they draw each other to Peter Gabriel's 'solisbury hill' is beautiful.There is too much to say about the genius of this film.

That and his goofy dancing that causes him to look mentally handicapped as well.

If only they could have done the beginning and the end and skipped the middle... Russell is almost always a treat, here in a very underplayed role.

Awakenings,"What is a line between dream and reality? Can we see dreams, believing them to be real? And if so, can we awake in a dream to figure out, that all around us is just an illusion, cleverly constructed by our sub conscious?Those couple questions sprung in my mind after I watched Vanilla Sky. It's rather interesting movie really, but it does have very poorly written and boring beginning as a romantic drama starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Story it self turns good after the car crash. Then it really starts to examine reality if David Aames (Tomi Cruise), who gets his face mashed up, but who still manages to find love of Sofia Serrano (Cruz).Cruz is great as she always is. You just gotta love that accent. Other actress deserving praise is Cameron Diaz, who play Julianne Gianni, a occasional lady friend of David. She was amazing in that part.Tom Cruise became good actor after he made ""Eyes Wide Shut"" for Stanley Kubrick. That was the movie, which proved, that Cruise can act besides just being a pretty boy. That was just to say, that Cruise does helluva good role as Aames in Vanilla Sky. Could say, that he manages to keep the movie in surface.Oh, and Kurt Russel does nice job as Aames's psychiatrist McCabe.Now to the weak points of the movie. As I said it is partly very weakly written, especially the beginning, which is just boring and mundane. Then there is the direction of Cameron Crowe. He honestly isn't that great. He's not bad, but there are several moments in the film that could do some tightening up, I refer on the beginning here.Overall a decent movie.

The story is more exciting and with more suspense (yes, even with the same script!), the end is less obvious and more surprising, and the music fits better every image. Actors: better too.

Playing with the time domain is still another.

"Turn it off when he starts yelling, ""Tech support!""  Trust me; you'll be glad you did.","This film had such potential, but it failed in the end because it gave the viewers far too little credit. This should have been an existential, philosophical, psychological thriller, and up until about the last ten minutes, it was. But rather than let the viewer try to figure out what's going on, rather than force the viewer to open his mind to the possibilities of multiple realities and to answer the questions of identity and sanity and reality raised in the first two hours of the film, it succinctly and in unremarkable language explains what was going on the whole time.This kind of convenient resolution is all too common in ""suspense"" movies (see also, Training Day(2001); Arlington Road (1999)) and is dissatisfying to people who actually want to interpret the film. It is typical of filmmakers who are unwilling to take a chance, namely that their film will be misunderstood. Of course when suspense is well done (see, Memento(2000); Usual Suspects, The(1995); Birth(2004)), the filmmaker need not worry whether his intentions were communicated.The end of Vanilla Sky, and thus the film as a whole, is a symptom of the trend among timid screenwriters to rely on a dubious plot device to make sense of an otherwise weak script. The real tragedy in this case is that the film would likely have been much stronger without this device.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

interesting failure,"It's nice to see Tom Cruise taking some risks lately, doing arty stuff like this movie and Eyes Wide Shut, and playing a drug addict in Minority Report.But risks don't always pay off.Vanilla Sky is a remake of the Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which I haven't seen. This is one of those movies where you're not sure if what's happening is real. I usually love this kind of movie (Jacob's Ladder is a good example of the genre), but Cameron Crowe messed this one up. It's hard to be affected (shocked, moved) by a movie that never goes beneath the surface of things. The characters aren't fleshed out, the relationships are never made believable, and the surprise ending has no weight - it may indeed be unexpected, but it is also rather uninteresting. The same concept was handled in a much less heavy-handed (and more entertaining and effective) way in Total Recall. I think the key problem is that this is a remake; I think Crowe could have done a great job if he had written his own original script. There are a few nicely surreal moments (such as the much-discussed Times Square sequence), but they are stranded in the middle of a failed experiment.The best thing about this movie is the director's great taste in music - the soundtrack features excellent, well-chosen tracks by Radiohead, R.E.M., Sinead O'Connor, and The Chemical Brothers, among others.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Different is not necessarily brilliant,"""Vanilla Sky"" is a hard movie to judge because it's not quite in the normal Hollywood mode, which is generally a good thing though it doesn't mean you end up with a good movie.It's hard to talk too much about the plot of the movie without actually spoiling the movie. It's sufficient to say that Cruise's character David is disfigured in a car accident somehow and has been arrested for murder. The details prior to his arrest are revealed in that, somewhat tired old narrative tool of flash-back. What makes the film more interesting is that it switches between a couple of time-lines and the time-lines themselves can shift in keeping with David's memory of events. However in the final third of the movie the plot takes a gigantic shift and asks the viewer to swallow some rather large doses of disbelief. The final ending whiffed a bit too much of ""AI"" for me in terms of tone and sentiment and was somewhat unsatisfactory. The plot may shift a bit but, despite what other reviewers would have you believe, isn't all that complicated. Certainly at the end it's hammered home as to what happened to David that only an idiot *could* be confused... and it also speaks too much of a ""big reset"" button. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it all.Cruise is good in this. Generally I'm indifferent to his acting, feeling he gets by on his pretty-boy looks but he finds justification for himself playing the tortured soul here. Penelope Cruz is adequate although doesn't exhibit a whole load of emotional range (presumably stymied by not acting in her native tongue) and Diaz has a tendence to put in a somewhat hammy-psycho-girl performance which I can not always take seriously. David's mate, played by Jason Lee, and David's lawyer, played by Kurt Russell, are both perfectly passable without being scene-stealing or giving the Academy anything to notice.As to Crowe's adaptation of the original movie, I found it for the most part well enough done. Firstly I enjoyed the sound-track, partially because it featured about 5 of my favourite bands but also because the musically was generally particularly well chosen (as someone pointed out the REM track ""Sweetness Follows"" is excellently placed). The cuts between scenes are generally well handled without being confusing or unnecessary and the production values, in the character's houses, reflect the personas well. Crowe can be a bit heavy-handed at times and this is of particular note in his overly-long explanation of ""what happened"" at the end of the movie. Perhaps this is for the benefit of the slower audience members but it made the ending drag out too much (again like ""AI"") - certainly I knew there would be a ""surprise"" ending and correctly guessed the main device that would be used (since Crowe made it quite obvious earlier on in the movie that it would be used - again too heavy). It's well done and capable - scenes like the much-touted Times Square are nice and add to the movie but it's nothing comparable to the sharper touches of David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" to which the movie has (somewhat erroneously) been compared.I'd recommend you see ""Vanilla Sky"" to form your own opinion. It's a breath of fresh air at least and is that bit ""different"" from your average formulaic 5 act movie. Whether you'll come across feeling somewhat mutely disappointed, as I did, is hard to tell. In the end I'll give it a 7/10 and look with interest to see if Crowe can do better next time seeing as how I enjoyed his last piece ""Almost Famous"" that bit more than this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"I wanted to like this movie, but ...","I just saw this on dvd. This was a movie that I wanted to embrace, but just could not.  To back up for a moment, I never saw the Spanish language film on which it was based, Abre Los Ojos.  So, whether that film was far superior, about the same, or somehow not as good, is irrelevant - for this purpose.The performances were fair to good - Cruise is a reliably good actor - this represents a solid performance.  Cameron Diaz was pretty good, Jason Lee did fine, but Penelope Cruz's acting (now, at times she looked gorgeous, and watching her dance is a pleasure) left something to be desired.  My guess (judging from this and Captain Correlli's Mandolin)is that she is much better, and much more natural in Spanish language films.  But, even w/ a great performance by her, this film would not be very good.I believe the set-up is ok, and some of the ideas expressed are pretty good, but the story is somehow a little bit self-important or trying too hard to say something or to provide twists.  I don't believe this is Cameron Crowe's best work at all.  I liked Almost Famous a lot, and actually think Jerry Maguire was one of the superb works of the 90's.  Look at Crowe's writing, and the performances from everyone in the JM cast-- almost, a perfect mix of dramatic tension and comedy).  And, I know that this is a different style film, but I felt that the music (he does have good taste in music) was a substitute for memorable dialogue or pacing -- it just felt like a bad montage of music videos.  The movie repeats lines of dialogue as if they are the most clever things ever written, but they're just ok.  And then, the movie has, in my opinion, the nerve to steal a scene and the wonderful score from To Kill A Mockingbird (off a flimsy pretext), when Vanilla Sky couldn't ""carry Mockingbird's jock"", so to speak...Anyway, this film just seemed too self-conscious and too derivative of other films to really go anywhere.

I really liked this movie.,"I saw this movie because I like Tom Cruise.  I feel he is a terrific actor.

However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured.  The twists turn like crazy after this.

a tad different than the original,"After seeing both (this and the original, Open Your Eyes) in a short period of time, I can't determine which I like better....they both have their aspects primarily in the develpoment of certain lines of action.  It seems that Crowe was a lot more interested in the romantic line of action between and also Cruise's profession came into play a lot more in Crowe's adaptation.  More time was devoted to the love that was developing between Cruise and Cruz (weird) before his accident, which was good.  The story involving his job was a little cheese, but whatever.  It also lacked the same psychological element as the original...but Crowe was obviously more interested in Cruise's romantic dreams, which helped because otherwise (my ultimate point), it's the same movie.  Still good though and worth it if you like to be confused until the end.And scared, you will be Luke.7.5/10 for the nice little love story, but for lacking the psychological overtones that drove the story in the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
It's Quite Innovative and Highly Engaging,"Even if I don't always like Tom Cruise, the man, mainly because of his pomposity and his L. Ron Hubbard stuff, I seem to really enjoy his movies. In this one, his character is much like him. He is not heartless, but not far from it. He is spoiled and entitled. He has expectations of others, including women, that he is the be all and end all. One day his life changes when he is in a car with the Cameron Diaz character, whom he actually exploits. She is willing to kill both of them rather than live without him. What follows is one of the most circumlocative plots, with apparent supernatural elements, dream sequence, cryonics, etc. A criticism of this film would be that it is so bizarrely convoluted, that reality is hard to discern. There is some validity to that, but it also makes it incredibly interesting. Sometimes I'd rather see a director or producer try to exceed their grasp. I would also recommend that the previous film ""Open Your Eyes"" is its own film. Must we always try to demean something because it has an antecedent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Good until the very end,"Most of Vanilla Sky was done well.  The characters are interesting.  The plot leaves the viewer guessing until the last five minutes or so, when the movie ends in an unfortunate manner.  Basically, one of the characters just tells David (Tom Cruise) what was actually going on throughout the movie. Rather than letting him and the audience discover it for themselves, the movie simply tells you in a conversation.  I found this quite disappointing. Now, I didn't have a problem with what the ending was.  It actually fit quite well.  I simply wish it was presented in a different fashion.The only other flaw in this movie was the music.  Cameron Crowe has a bad habit of using classic rock in his movies in rather inappropriate places. Most of the time it fits well, but there were a few scenes in which the music didn't fit the action at all.  Classic rock is fine and appropriate for a movie like Almost Famous, which is about the music world, but for other movies, such as this and Jerry Maguire, sometimes a good instrumental is all you need.  The music problem, however, was but a minor annoyance that only manifested in one or two scenes.Despite the expository ending, I do recommend this movie.  Better yet, see Abre Los Ojos.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

This might have been a good romance/psychological thriller if the science fiction elements to the plot had been completely, totally, absolutely omitted.  Sorting out reality and Cruise's dreams could have made for a good movie.  But the incredibly inept sortie into science fiction makes this movie a joke -- and not a very funny one.  The first hour or so of the movie is interesting; the last half hour is ridiculous and boring. The movie might have been worth seeing if a truly interesting and surprising ending had been devised. But it wasn't and this movie was stupid.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Deep, worth at least one viewing","You'll have to sit patiently through the first forty minutes of this film. There are times when it drags a lot, seemingly without reason. Don't try it if you're not wide awake and patient. (Unless you can't get enough of Cruise.)Then the film takes off and accelerates. The remainder explores many classic (and modern; it reminds me of Phil Dick) questions and dilemmas (what's real, what's love about, what's worth doing, beauty is skin deep, etc etc), in a modern context, with a lot of good acting. (Surprise, Tom Cruise can actually act!) Even if you're familiar with many of the themes and techniques used, it's a refreshingly confusing whirlwind and refuses to hand you easy answers.Lucky rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Unnecessarily convoluted and tedious romantic thriller,"Director Cameron Crowe takes a wild and overly complex turn in this mind-bending thriller that demonstrates the complexity and elements of the human mind that many struggle to understand. Tom Cruise stars as David Aimes, a wealthy, inner city publisher and best friend of Brian Shelby (played by Jason Lee), who is in relationship with beautiful blonde Julie (played by Cameron Diaz), but seems to be in love with a Latino woman named Sofia (played by Penelope Cruz). When David is involved in a devastating car accident with Julie that leaves his face horribly disfigured, he begins struggling to tell between dream and reality. Kurt Russell plays psychology doctor McCabe who has David incarcerated and interrogated him on the events leading up to the fateful car wreck. Mixing elements of science-fiction, mystery, and romance, this film is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film Open Your Eyes, which also stars Penelope Cruz and follows the same story structure.As interesting as the plot and the premise are, I really wanted to like this movie. While I am not saying I hated this movie, there were some major flaws that made this one hard to enjoy. The film sets a promising start with a solid introduction of the characters of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee, and Penelope Cruz. Then there is the intense car crash scene that leaves Tom Cruise's character with a horrendous facial disfigurement. From there on, the plot takes a whole bunch of of twists and turns that are far too confusing for not only the audience to understand, but the confusing for the film itself. This film tries so hard to be interesting but is completely unaware of the direction its trying to take, and it fails to give any sort of hints to what happens and instead leaves the audience consisting speculating. The plot feels like Cameron Crowe took the script and did some experimenting with it but got everything all mixed up. Throughout the story, there some questions left unanswered and scenes that serve no purpose. The cast's performances are decent, but perhaps nothing too impressive.Vanilla Sky has an intriguing plot and a premise. Overall, this is not a film for everyone and only for those who are fans of Cameron Crowe's works. While it's not totally bad, it would have been better if it the plot was more even and had a better and more structured direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Interesting, but Crowe doesn't live up to his potential.","I don't want to give anything away, because this film certainly is thought provoking.  There were parts I really enjoyed and parts, I felt, left something to be desired.Cameron Crowe proved that he was a worthy film maker with ""Jerry Maguire"" and that he was an exceptional film maker with the astonishingly good ""Almost Famous"".  That said, ""Vanilla Sky"" just didn't measure up.  At times I felt the acting was sub-par (with the exception of Cameron Diaz, who is always good), and that the film didn't know what it wanted to be.  Is it a romance, a mystery, or a science fiction film?I think part of the problem stems from the fact that this was not really Cameron Crowe's movie, unlike ""Say Anything"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Almost Famous"".  Instead it was a remake of a 1997 film, which I haven't seen but understand to be quite good (why would a film maker want to remake a film which is only four years old?).  His earlier projects were films about people.  That is what is so wonderful about them.  With the release of ""Almost Famous"" it seemed that no one was better a putting real life on the screen than Cameron Crowe.  ""Vanilla Sky"" however, is not about people, and this is most likely where it falls short.  There was no Cameron Crowe within the film, unlike ""Almost Famous"", which is all Cameron Crowe.  All of the world's best art comes from within the artist, this film came from within the guy who directed ""The Others"".With all of that in mind (and I realize it is a lot), ""Vanilla Sky"" is not a bad movie.  As a Crowe fan, my expectations were naturally quite high, and the film didn't live up to them.  However, I certainly suggest that you go see it, and draw your own conclusions.  I gave it a 7 out of 10.  The film is visually beautiful (not to mention the cast) and it will serve as a good conversational piece, if nothing else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"A dream within a dream; no this is reality; wait, I'm not dead! What the???","I do have to say, that even after Tom Cruise takes his shirt off five or six times and smiles a dozen more, this movie still is entertaining. It is about a man who is seriously disfigured in an automobile accident. And as his face heals, so does his mind, only not as fast; or maybe not at all. And just about the time you think you've figured it out for the third or fourth time, Director Cameron Crowe throws another log on and everybody is dead. No, they're not. Oh, who knows. There is one too many twists at the end, and that makes this entertaining journey through the mind merely an annoying farce. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. You can't say that. You're dead. Am not.

One of my all-time favs,"I'm a professional songwriter and film composer... and I try to watch this at least once a year. It never fails that I get at least one great song idea everytime I watch it.

Kurt Russell as the father-figure/psychiatrist... and the music. The music supervisor on this is a genius. Radiohead, Todd Rundgren... perfect choices. The sheer lunacy of the ""tech support!"" scene. I love movies that ask big questions, and this one might ask the biggest of all.

Another lousy Tom Cruise movie,"Long, boring, stupid movie about Cruise...oh forget it!  I can't be bothered!  This movie was total crap--bad script (especially the end), very dull and overlong...I believe 5 people walked out of the theatre...I should have joined them.The acting--Cameron Diaz is very good--sadly, she's not in the movie enough to make a difference.  Penelope Cruz tries but the script isn't there for her.  Jason Lee is surprisingly very good as Cruise's best friend.  As for Cruise...well...he can't act.  He's truly pathetic in this film...it was almost embarrassing to watch.  His character comes off as a total blank because Cruise doesn't know how to play it.  The guy has just two facial expressions--grinning or having a slack-jawed ""I'm stupid"" expression on his face.  Hopeless.  He's ugly too.  Also, he's playing a 32 year old here. Come on!!!!  Cruise is 39 and looks it!This is a total waste of time and money.  AVOID!!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Cruise fumbles the lead...,"Cameron Crowe is a great director and as always he managed to maximize the sensory experience through visuals and an amazing soundtrack.  But writer/director Alejandro Amen√°bar (""The Others"") is no slouch himself and Crowe demonstrates his respect by taking the original script almost for gospel and by using many of the same shots such as the ones in the disco club and on top of the roof in the finale.  In my opinion, the remake falls substantially short of the original, because of the limited development of the central character.  The original was played by a very talented Spanish actor, Eduardo Noriega (""The Devil's Backbone""), who did a great job paralleling his internal change with the external one.  The key underpinning of the entire movie is that the audiece believe that this rich, cocky womanizer falls fast and hard for Cruz and realizes in one night that he will never be the same.  But just as quickly everything is taken from him in a cruel twist of fate and when he finally appears to have regained his lost love, the audience's heart is ripped right out of their chests when they realize that all is an illusion.  But Cruise just forced it so damn badly that you never believed he really fell for this girl that night.  He flashes her a smile, so he's in love?  He flashed the same damn smile at Diaz though.  So why does he love Cruz over Diaz?  Diaz is just as attractive and she speaks English a hell of a lot better.  There was no transition or juxtaposition that made the audience think ""Wow, this little Spanish girl really knocked his socks off.""  As a result, he makes Penelope Cruz look like a poser.  Not her fault at all though.  Similarly, Jason Lee was supposed to be his weaker, ordinary looking, little brother buddy, but Cruise comes across as weaker of the two friends in their scenes together. Noriega just made much better choices.  From the opening scene, he makes it clear that he generally disdains women.  They are a trophy, similar to his money and his cars.  Cruise just plays the opening scene with the same ""$hit-eating grin"" waving to every secretary in the office as he wanders the halls of the company that he owns like a drunken party boy and a moron. He plays his character like Adam Sandler played ""Billy Madison"".  Despite being the lead of the movie, he seems to take no control over his conflicts.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Good effort, but too long","What is about some film makers that makes them want to go on and on, even when they've run out of plot?

A shame really, because, up to the last half hour, we can enjoy a story that is absorbing and well acted, if rather convoluted.

A Thought-Provoking but Ultimately Flawed Sci-Fi Thriller,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 American science fiction thriller film which is a remake of the 1997 Spanish film 'Abre los Ojos.The movie tells the story of a young, wealthy magazine publisher (Tom Cruise) who is involved in a car accident that leaves his face disfigured. He undergoes a procedure called ""dream jacking"" to reconstruct his face, but it goes wrong and soon enough he finds himself trapped in a surreal world that is not quite reality, and not quite a dream.For me, the film is flawed. The plot is convoluted and confusing, and the film's ending is ambiguous and unsatisfying. Additionally, the film's attempt to present the near future in 2001 now looks somewhat cheap and outdated.Overall, Vanilla Sky's idea is a thought-provoking one, but ultimately flawed as a sci-fi thriller, especially with the convoluted plot. Not to mention that the ending is unsatisfying.In 2023, I give the film 5+ out of 10 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A Cruise masterpiece in my opinion,"Vanilla Sky is a remake of a Spanish film also starring Penelope Cruz and this is where the problem starts: Many people disregard Vanilla Sky because it is a remake and that it is a mainstream film starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz which tones down the original's approach but they couldn't be more wrong. This is a fantastic quirky, offbeat science fiction film which is good in its own way. Cruise is really good as the rich heir and is ably supported by Cruz, Diaz and Kurt Russell who turns up as his psychiatrist.

One Of The Best Films I've Seen This Decade So Far.,"Three movies stick out in my head as the best movies that I have seen this decade so far:  LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, STAR WARS: THE PHANTOM MENACE, and this one.When I first saw this movie on video, it intrigued me.  Since I missed the last 30 minutes of it (I fell asleep.), I ended up disliking it because it confused me.  Then I saw it a year later in its entirety by finally seeing the ending and realizing how everything ties up...I was fascinated.If I used one word to name the theme of this movie, I would use the word: CHOICES.  David makes choices in this movie that alter it from beginning to end within his real life and his lucid dreams.  In applying to my life, I would learn that we should always (that means AT EVERY MOMENT) make choices that help others, that do not smack of any self-service/self-ambition, and that benefit the good of others.   Alternatively, we end up losing everything we hold dear...everything...like David.We may not get another chance at life, again like David, so we should take every opportunity by living our life as wise (not unwise) in order to get it right this time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A Masterpiece! Far superior to the Original,"There seem to be two main criticisms of this film. Either it is confusing and hard to follow, or it is a poor remake of the original. I found both of these claims to be nonsense, but at least I can understand the first. The key to our understanding does not show up until the very end, but given this key, the movie is perfectly consistent, and you may not notice the greatness of the film without a second or a third viewing.As to the second claim, this film is superior to the original in every way I would care to compare them, and I can only chock up the opposite opinion to a common, and mostly justified, bias against any Hollywood film, especially one starring Tom Cruise. To this mindset, the film is doomed from the start, regardless of it's actual merits. I would normally share such opinions, but this film is something special. Tom Cruise is perfect in his role and as much as you might hate him personally as so many seem to do, he is very good, as is Penelope Cruz.Just some advice to new viewers, have patience and trust that in the end all will be explained. The first 40 minutes can turn a lot of people off, but just wait. and for those who have watched the movie only once and found it wanting, try watching it again. You may be surprised.

Tantalizing Yet Frustrating,"I had already seen ""Abre los ojos"", the movie on which ""Vanilla Sky"" is based, before watching this film so I knew what to expect, and I am left with a similar feeling after watching, which is that this story and film had great potential, some of which is tantalizing teased but potential which is ultimately unfulfilled and thus leaving me disappointed. I rate this film a 4/10, the original a 3/10, but I don't hate them, they are just frustrating films. I think they are too long with too much time spent close up on Cruise agonizing over his reality with too little time spent dealing with interpersonal relationships. It all felt light and superficial which made it harder to care about. And why does he have to steal the friend's girl, that seems a unnecessary and cruel plot point. And when analyzing the details of the plot and twists I am left feeling that they are not all coherent or sensible in a real way. It seems more like one of those movies that tries to be profound but it isn't really there when introspected. As I said, I don't hate it, but it is a frustrating film that could have been better in my opinion. And some of the camera work is not great. Tom is maybe a bit over the top here, Penelope and Cameron are great as usual, but a bit long for the amount of plot.

Extraordinary movie,"Vanilla Sky shows that a remake of a European movie doesn't automatically suck. This is largely because Vanilla Sky is pretty much a scene-by-scene copy of the original Spanish Abre los Ojos. The unique thing is, they do a much better job than the Spanish creators. Abre los Ojos get's credit for their cool idea and for a good movie, but Vanilla Sky takes that material and creates more than a brain-twister; it's simply an amazing movie.While the original had good actors, Vanilla Sky has better ones. Maybe it's because it's in English, but I think it's more than that. Tom Cruise plays the role of his lifetime, very believable and also likable as David Aames, the man with everything he could ever wish for. If you think Cruise is just a pretty face, just wait and see and the movie will prove you wrong. Penelop Cruz, returning from Abre los Ojos to repeat her role as Sofia, is cute as a button but in no way superficial. Cameron Diaz is simply scary and shows she handles a dramatic role excellently. The rest of the cast is also very good, down to little details.Direction is nice, with occasional quick cuts but mostly just solid and still interesting. New York always looks good on film and Vanilla Sky is no exception. There is a spectacular scene in the start of the movie that perfectly sets the mood for the movie.The biggest difference between Abre los Ojos and Vanilla Sky is the soundtrack. While Abre los Ojos had an alright soundtrack, Vanilla Sky's one is simply amazing, well worth buying actually. Every scene has a fresh, interesting and suiting choice of music, many songs so out- there for the scene but still very effective. ""Good Vibrations"" is a good example of a song that really shouldn't work, but does.If you're looking for a mystery with some surreal overtones and a very satisfying ending(yes, it all makes sense in the end!), look no further.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

To me the guy has some 3 facial expressions and a ""broken nose look"". I really cannot understand the hype. Same goes for the Spanish actress who obviously had to practice a lot to be understood in the movie as her English is terrible (how corny- those foreign characters always being sweet, sincere and all). Diaz isn't too hard to look at but her character in this movie wasn't as developed as it should have been. And let's face it: her acting range is still somewhat limited. So far for trashing the people who made millions acting in this movie... The movie itself screams pretentiousness.

To like or not to like?,"Vanilla Sky reunites 'Jerry Maguire's director Cameron Crowe and star Tom Cruise.  There is hype before the film's release because its making seemingly brought about the romance between the two main stars Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.Tom Cruise plays David, a rich and successful owner of a magazine publishing company who meets and falls for Sofia (Penelope Cruz), his best friend's guest at his party.  He promptly dumps his 'f**k buddy', Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who actually believes herself to be a real girlfriend and starts stalking him.  A move which David must regret is when he gets into Julia's car with her, not realising that she is just a little annoyed at being discarded.  The result is a horrific car accident which leaves him badly disfigured and experiencing events which he can't be sure are real or imaginary.  Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to help David figure out whether what he remembers are dreams or reality and it is mainly through David's interviews with his psychologist that the audience is presented with flashbacks of events.Such is Cruise's superstar status that one feels he can take risks by accepting non-mainstream roles such as this -he spends a significant part of the film disfigured or wearing a latex mask.  No doubt, many people who go and see this movie will be disappointed by this fact but nevertheless, you still get to see that winsome trademark grin and Cruise manages to evoke sympathy through his character's confusion and torment.  Penelope Cruz is charming as Cruise's love interest and the chemistry between the two stars is evident on the screen.Events after the car crash are extremely confusing but stick with it and you will be enlightened by an explanation towards the end of the film which has a tinge of science fiction about it.  Although I was utterly confused, I was still intrigued and interested in the characters and what on earth was happening.  'Vanilla Sky' is certainly a thought provoking and memorable film but is also a film which I still can't decide whether I like or not. Thinking about it some more, I'm tending towards liking it.  After all, I am a Tom Cruise fan and he proves once again here, that he's not just a pretty face.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A missed opportunity,"I haven't seen the original ""Abre Los Ojos"", so I approached ""Vanilla Sky"" with something of an open mind. And the movie was for the most part entertaining enough, though I wouldn't rate the acting capabilities of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz very highly.I normally like films where you have to make sense of a seemingly jumbled chain of events and figure out the significance of what you're seeing (good recent examples being Memento and Mulholland Dr.). The quality I appreciate the most in these films is that they require you to think for yourself to work out a valid interpretation of the film (or at the very least piece everything together in the right order). The biggest flaw in ""VS"" is therefore the last half hour, where everything is laid out for you in excruciating detail.As I said, I don't know if this is just a carbon copy of the original Spanish ending but either way I see it as an insult to the viewer. It's basically the director saying ""I'm sorry for having let you watch 2 hours of something that might seem confusing. Here - let me spell it out for you since you obviously didn't come to see a movie expecting to have to use your brain"".""Vanilla Sky"" is not art but entertainment, and half-decent entertainment at that. And while entertainment has its uses, I certainly wouldn't recommend the film to anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Total Recall meets David Lynch...,"that's what I was thinking after viewing the DVD.  I gave it a 7, which for me is already a good mark as I need a lot to be impressed by a movie.  Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise, both girls are quite good and so is Jason Lee.  It's not the type of movie you'll fall asleep in front of.  You have to like plots in which you get lost, confused - OK not as ""mental"" as Lynch would do but during the entire time you will be wondering : is he dreaming now or not ?  It also shows how weak guys can be, the main character just met what could be the love of his life and he's ready to (and in the end does) jeopardize everything for a last ""time"" with his ""sleeping buddy"".  Rather typical, maybe that's the morale of the story...  Also I'm not an expert in plastic surgery but you would think that - especially if money is no option - nowadays surgeons can do a pretty good job fixing people's face after an accident, no ?  The film also shows how in fact you can loose your mind taking painkillers and other medications, what is reality and what's not ?  And what's that snobbery about having only poster of French movies on the wall ?  And whatabout the ""empty Time Square"" scene ?  Isn't that just a gimmick used to make the media talk about the film during it's making - great publicity stunt isn't it ?!  But does it really bring something to the movie, or is it just another dream scene to make sure you're lost from the word go ? Another question this movie is asking is : in this superficial world we live in, could one still be in love with another after this person gets disfigured, could you still kiss that person ?  Is it ""ok"" to steal you best friend's new girlfriend ? SO as the others have already said it might not be the best film ever but the picture will make you think, wonder and can be the start of great discussions among friends and that's already something, isn't it ?...",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

From 4.9 to 6.8,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters, I had just lost someone in my life and let's say I saw this movie a few times. Over the years I kept on coming back to this IMDb page to read people's reviews on this movie, the score started as low as 4.9 and came all the way up 6.8, i think once the blu ray comes out, in a few years it will go up some more. I have seen the original movie, and i have to say the low budget intrigue & minimalistic approach makes it a better film. Cameron Crowe put a killer mix tape over this and added some production value and it went from a sci fi indie to a melodrama. people savor it because they can relate to it, the bits and pieces of music and short quotes, like ""consequences"", ""every passing minute"", ""when we are both cats"", it's an effective movie because like Eternal Sunshine, this movie teases your emotions. so 6.8 really tells me a lot of more people are still out there with pain buried in their hearts, and that they have to live their lives with regret, and when they see this movie, their minds wonder about what could have happened.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Glossy but emotionally subpar remake,"I revisited Vanilla Sky recently. I wondered if my early impressions of the film might be ripe for revision. In one way they were. I came away from my second viewing with a clearer idea of the film's strengths and weaknesses. Vanilla Sky begins with a disadvantage. It's an almost frame by frame remake of the hugely successful and widely admired Spanish film Abre Los Ojos and so actively invites comparison. That's been done and I can't add anything meaningful to the debate. But since Vanilla Sky was made, there has been a rash of similarly themed movies, books and (in Britain at least) radio plays. Judged by these standards, the movie fares quite well. It's beautifully made. Everything and everyone looks wonderful. The girls in particular are perfectly cast and bring serious emotional power to their scenes. If you don't think Cameron Diaz can act, take a look at her scene with Cruise in the car. It'll send shivers up and down your spine. But that emotional punch is ultimately what the film lacks. It's the missing ingredient and the fault lies with Cruise. As the rich and impossibly charming playboy inheritee of his daddy's publishing empire, he's note perfect. Of course. Tom Cruise has made a career out of knowing his strengths and is rightly the most commercially successful actor of the last few decades. There's no denying his commitment to his craft and what serious actor could resist the lure of Charles Laughton's crown as the king of prosthetic pathos but it's the undoing of this film. All the training, all the practice, all the sheer willpower in the world cannot prepare you for a role like this. And that's the point. The role is pivotal and Cruise is not the actor to invest it with a full emotional life. Frankly, it's hard to think who would have been a better choice. Without Cruise, the film might never have been made and anyway, he's not the movie's only problem. Kurt Russel's responsible for some cringeworthy mugging, better suited to a bad daytime soap. Would I rather the film hadn't been made? No, it brought the story to a wider audience and has its own strengths. I doubt that it will be remade any time soon but if it were, I wonder what Tom Hardy would make of that central role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
As brilliant as I recalled it!,"I think the first time I saw this movie, I didn't totally understand it and as I grew older, I grew wiser :) This is the third or forth time I have seen Vanilla Sky and if you follow the story about David and the small messages you should be able to make a point out of it or at least understand the message it sent me. What is happiness to you? This is different for different people and in the end I think real happiness is to understand that you need to be happy in real life and you can't keep living in a dream world. At least this is happiness to me. Everything in life is a choice and now and then this is what life is all about, making choices that leads to other things, greater things in life, or less happy things in life. All though I'd like to think that the end was happy to David and he got the happiness that he deserved. Is happiness really to be good looking or rich or is there a higher purpose to happiness. I think there is and I think he did realize this eventually :) Vanilla Sky is a great movie and should be watched not only once, but twice or three times or more to be honest.

The Worst Film ever made,"This has got to be one of the worst films ever made. The story line is so bad that I know children that could have done better. The story line appeared to lack any direction or content. The star character is unbelievable and throughout the film I was amazed by the things occurring. After I finished watching this film my first thought was that there is 2 hours of my life I will never get back.The cinematography and make-up were very good, though, and about the only positive in an otherwise pointless film.I have my reservations as Tom Cruise as an actor. Whilst Tom has been in some very good films I feel that the films would have been a lot better if someone else was starring. Tom has got to be one of the luckiest actors around because some of the parts he has been given could fool anybody into believing he could actual act. You can always measure an actors ability in a film when the are co-staring with undoubtedly good actors. For example 'Interview with a vampire' showed me that whilst Brad Pitt could act Tom Cruise couldn't. This film would have been better if they had employed a better actor which could have raised the standard of the film, but the story still would have been terrible and unbelievable.My suggestion is get another film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Too much like the original,"Cameron Crowe totally copied the whole script from the original, giving his own little thing to fit an English/Hollywood audience. I don't think Crowe's version was convincing enough than the Spanish Version. OPEN YOUR EYES is much better. Penelope Cruz, I think, didn't do any better nor any bad. But Tom Cruise's performance was, I believe, not good enough. Jason Lee, like always, was his best as the much-talking friend that doesn't like to shut up.If you're going to remake a movie do it well, do it original, and do it for purpose. OK, so i disagreed when Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was released and it was different to the first and I thought that Tim should not have tried to match the original classic.

I'm saying this movie should definitely be watched again and again.

Vanillasky?,"Open your eyes. This overly ambitious film (not the sequel to ""Eyes Wide Shut"") gives us so much and asks so little in return. Another Hollywood cruise through dreamland that turns out a nightmare¬Ö or just another Tom Cruise vehicle?David Aames ((Tom Cruise) wakens to a NYC beyond his wildest fantasy - a city devoid of people making him the one and only. But that's only a dream... or is it? This self-absorbed magazine-magnate demands your attention. This is a narcissistic heir to a successful publishing house doing his least to promote its rags and his best to advance his own interest. You've met his type - a guy born on third base who thought he hit a triple. Tom Cruise, producer, cast himself in this role and are we surprised. A match made in heaven as we watch him descend to hell.Vanilla Sky should be sub-titled and programmed for the intuitively challenged. To follow this film in a linear fashion is a prescription for almost as much pain and suffering as our hero experiences without the rewards of both Julie (Cameron Diaz) and Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz). The hangover without the fun. This film has more beautiful people per frame than any audience deserves. And Mr. Cruise, please stop mugging to the audience.The opening line - ""Open your eyes""  -surprisingly the title of the derivative film by Alejandro Amenabar - is the appropriate wake up call to the audience after two hours of real/dream world transcendence. What was Cameron Crowe thinking when he inserted a 5-minute - or was it 15 - monologue at the end of a 2-hour terror trip? There might be more satisfying ways to clarify the plot but this sure must be the easiest.Unless you are a fan of Cruise or Cruz you may have a hard time sympathizing with their characters. Personally I have Cruise Control and sympathize with supporting characters like Brian Shelby (Jason Lee), David's best friend who (might) get trampled by David's dating games.

Fairly good film that is let down by the last half hour.,"""Vanilla Sky"" could have been a great film, but the unnecessary and overly long ending softens the impact and leaves one feeling somewhat disappointed. The first two thirds of the film are very well done, with some excellent shots (eg, the deserted New York city streets), and the viewer is left guessing at every turn: is this a dream, or is this reality? Is this the past, the present, or the future? Was it a setup, or did he really do it? The movie is enthralling and there are many details to keep the viewer's mind focused on the unraveling story, although by the end of the film you realise none of them really mattered.At the ""end"" of the film, all the pieces fall into place as the main character (and hopefully the audience) realises what's been going on, and had the film ended at this point, it would have been one of those chilling endings like ""The Sixth Sense."" The viewer has enough information to make sense of the film, but nothing is really explained in detail; viewers could have a wonderful time exploring the many possible explanations of the film. (For those who have seen the film, this is the scene where Tom spots the television commercial and starts banging on the glass in the cell).Unfortunately, once Tom has figured it all out, the audience is subjected to a long, drawn-out explanation of what has happened (just in case they hadn't figured it out yet), and the film explains everything in agonising detail, which destroys all the fun! No longer can you ponder whether such-and-such a scene was real or a dream, because it's all laid out in black and white. Ending the movie on an optimistic note also seemed against the grain of the film; it's been dark all the way through, so why change directions now?Others have compared this movie to Mulholland Drive, which I feel is a much better movie, despite (and because of) the fact that it is totally incomprehensible to me. It seems like ""Vanilla Sky"" is trying hard to be an artsy, intellectual movie, yet at the same time it tries to cater to the ""big dumb action movie"" crowds. This backfires as the ""artsy"" crowd will feel patronised whilst the ""popcorn movie"" fans won't be seeing this film anyway.All in all, an interesting film that is worth seeing for the first two thirds, but you can definitely wait for the video / DVD release.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A film you hate to love,"I want to state clearly first of all that I am a fan of the darker side of film. Give me Se7en, Fight Club, A Clockwork Orange, Memento, and Vanilla Sky and I'll be happy forever.With that said Vanilla Sky is the lightest movie I've ever seen.Stay with me, it'll make sense in the end.Tom Cruise has been fleshing out lately to test the waters of what he can achieve. Some are very good, such as Jerry Maguire, some are very bad, such as Eyes Wide Shut. Vanilla Sky breaks the mold as he steps far far away from anything he's ever done before. Throughout the movie his character, David Aames, feels differently about HIMSELF (a big change for male characters in movies). He goes from feeling his life is great, to how his life is worthless, to being a nutcase, to being a fake since he was born. The way Crowe directs leads all of these together in a confusing mass, but in a good way. The film is supposed to toss your brain around as much as David's.I won't go into the story plot, too many people do that. What makes this a film you would hate to love is that it's getting such horrible reviews. It makes you almost ashamed to admit you even saw it. But what Crowe and Cruise (and Cruz come to think of it) are giving you in this film is a new era. This movie is not aimed at any specific group. I'd have to say if anyone it's aimed at teenagers who are sick of teeny bopper films and some generation X'ers. I remember watching Castaway and Lord of the Rings and seeing people stand and cheer either at the end or at impressive moments. I nearly applauded this film for it's fantastic direction and momentum. Castaway was too long and Lord of the Rings...well nothing from 2001 or 2002 will compare to it. But Vanilla Sky is a look at our society and especially the highly sexual male. It picks apart the things we all know and none of us want to say. Male's won't want to admit that David is a bad character for having one night stands even though we know it's true. Females won't want to look like rebellious types for saying he's a jerk when he's doing what all their male friends do anyway. It's a sad cycle that equals dismal ticket sales.Do not be turned away though. If you want to see the best non-Lord of the Rings film for the next 12 months then go see Vanilla Sky. Do it now. You will not regret this if you're like me and hate teeny bopper films and see horrible holes in the plots of movies like Ali.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Vanilla Sky is Cameron Crowe¬ës adaptation of 1997¬ës Spanish thriller Abre Los Ojos. And in this film, we indeed open our eyes to the bizarre and intriguing life of millionaire David Aames.","It¬ës a fantasy, so even if there are many unrealistic and silly moments, they can be excused. Solid (bordering on strong) performances, excellent direction and a generally clever script make this film one of 2001¬ës most pleasant surprises.The film doesn¬ët quite match Crowe¬ës previous effort, Almost Famous. It lacks the Oscar¬ñcalibre performances, the script isn¬ët as well written and not every character is well developed. But he has still made a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes debatable film with quite a few memorable scenes.Here, Tom Cruise (Aames) makes the transformation from action hero to eventually troubled millionaire, and he actually does it quite well. While he occasionally overacts and seems nervous at times, he still does a fine job, even allowing us to sympathize with his character. It seems that, like in Jerry Maguire, Crowe knows how to get a good performance from the actor. Cruise¬ës current real¬ñlife love interest Penelope Cruz also gives a good display, mixing radiance with surprising effectiveness. Most of the stronger parts of the film feature her and Cruise, and chemistry between them is (unsurprisingly) strong. Meanwhile, Cameron Diaz is at ease in her over¬ñthe¬ñtop, if slightly small role. These roles seem to suit her well, and she plays this one to great effect. Other notable performers are Jason Lee as David¬ës friend, Kurt Russell as a mild¬ñmannered psychiatrist, and Noah Taylor as a mysterious stranger.The film has many surprises. You feel involved in nearly every scene, and most of the time, you can¬ët tell what¬ës coming next. The final twist to the story is indeed unexpected, even if it is a bit too bizarre and causes the film to drag on longer than it should. Also, the film is maybe a little too sentimental at times, and the scenes don¬ët always link clearly together. Thankfully, Crowe manages to prevent the film from becoming a mess. Set design is attractive, and the music, which includes the use of songs by R.E.M. and Paul McCartney, blends in well.I think calling this a masterpiece would be going a bit too far (its problems are all too visible, notably the slightly confusing beginning and overlong end), but this is a well¬ñmade and constantly involving film which shouldn¬ët be missed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Surprisingly good,"After reading some quite negative views for this movie, I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I haven't seen the original movie, but if its better than this, I'd be in heaven.Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs (for only the third time in his career- the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role, as does Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the acting that really impresses- its the filmmaking.Cameron Crowe excels in the director's role, providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick. The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime.You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable.

Best film ever made.,"I viewed Vanilla Sky primarily because Penelope Cruz was in it, as in the original. However on watching the film, I was captivated by the sparkling relationship between Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz, especially the scene involving their portrait drawings.I think the music works so well with the film, from Peter Gabriel to Radiohead. It accompanies the film really, really well and the subtleties in the film are stunning. I had to watch Vanilla Sky about three times before I got every little bit of the film and this is why the film excels. Other performances by Timothy Spall and Kurt Russell back up the film splendidly and it annoys me when people say 'Abre los ojos' is much better, it's like when Nirvana 'fans' say ""Bleach is better than Nevermind"" just to seem like more of a hardcore fan. Vanilla Sky is better. It's thought provoking, romantic, funny and beautiful. I was thrilled to bit's with it and have now watched it about 150 times.

"An essentially good, albeit flawed, movie.","Vanilla Sky had the potential to be a modern classic, but is let down by mediocre performances by its leading stars, Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. Tom Cruise is not bad in this film, but never engrosses himself in his role to the level of Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, where he captured a previously unimpressed sector of ""serious"" film fans. He's gone back to the bright, white-toothed Jerry Maguire mode, a more universally appealing, but shallower, character. However, the Achilles Heel of Vanilla Sky is the totally inept performance of Penelope Cruz. To be fair, this is the result of a hopeless miscast, as Cruz's acting limitations are only part of the problem. In the movie the director, Cameron Crowe, expects us to believe that the shallow, hedonistic David Aames (Cruise) would drop the salacious Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) like a ton of bricks for the Spanish cutsie, Sofia (Cruz).",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Words cannot describe the irritation,"Urgh..., or various other guttural noises is about as near as I can get to describing my feelings toward this film.This weekend, Channel 4 in the UK showed the original Spanish ""Abre Los Ojos"" (written by Alejandro Amenabar and Mateo Gil and directed by Amenabar) late on Friday night followed by a prime-time showing of this Hollywood version on the Saturday. Vanilla Sky is virtually a scene for scene remake of Abre Los Ojos and is the same, except nearly all the suspense, ambiguity and excellent acting and basically anything else which made the original good has been sucked out to be replaced by lazy pop cultural references, melodrama and repetition after repetition of plot developments just so the most idiotic of viewer can follow.To anyone who thought they liked this film: watch the original and you will see how much of a bland and lackadaisical remake this really is.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A movie that tries to be too clever for it's own good but fails.,"A wealthy playboy businessman is disfigured in a car accident. But all is not what it seems.Starring Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz,Written by Alejandro Amenabar, Mateo Gil and Cameron Crowe (Screenplay).Directed by Cameron Crowe.Weirdly this is one of those films I've always heard of but I always thought it was some kind of action movie involving fighter pilots. In reality it is totally not what I expected it to be.It's a very bizarre movie that starts off quite normally but then turns into a sci-fi flick. It's full of strange twists and turns and flips itself on it's head quite a lot. For me it's too bizarre and confusing for my liking. I never really got a grasp of what what going on and then the ending was pretty disappointing. It felt like a movie that was trying to be too clever for it's own good and in the end it kind of failed. Don't get me wrong I usually love twisty sci-fi movies but this wasn't my cup of tea.Tom Cruise was Tom Cruise. For me he's a good looking guy but I'm not convinced about his acting and so his performance was average. In fact there weren't really any fantastic stand out performances in this one. Penelope Cruz was hot. But Cameron Diaz was probably the pick of the bunch if I had to choose one.Overall a pretty disappointing movie that didn't rock my world.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

One of the greatest films ever made!,"WOW, where do i start!!!?This movie is one of the greatest ever made. It is incredible in every way; from the actors, to the music, to the cinematography. Some people seem to hate this movie very much, and the reason for this is because they completely missed out on the message and the plot. I will admit that the first time I watched the movie; I was lost and got frustrated for not understanding. But that's what Crowe wanted, and when the movie ended, i was very satisfied with the movie.I then watched the movie a 2nd time, and the movie had truly become my favourite movie of all time (and still is). The last scene encompasses so many deep emotions and is simply a work of art. This scene makes the movie simply beautiful and perfect. If you've seen the movie once, you must watch it again to truly appreciate it.The music chosen in this movie was also great. The soundtrack is a must-get. Unfortunately, the song Njosnavelin (Nothing Song) by Sigur Ros was never release (which is a shame because I love it). The music really set the mood and completed every scene.As for the Cast & crew, AMAZING! Tom Cruise was definitely the BEST actor for this part. David Aames (Cruise's character) was an extremely well defined character; I truly felt like I knew and understood him. Congrats Tom! Penelope Cruz also had a great performance. Jason Lee was remarkable as a supporting actor. Cameron Diaz really did a great job for her character Julie Gianni. Cameron Crowe... well, he is simply one of the best and he really does prove it with this movie.I could go on and on explaining how this movie is a great picture, but you must really see it for yourself to understand what I mean.

One..........Big..........MESS!!!!,"I first went to the theater to see this with my girlfriend....needless to say I fell asleep half way through...she somehow stayed awake through the whole thing and we both immediately wrote it off as a horrible film.  It just showed on HBO and I finally decided to sit through it and actually watch it this time, and my opinion hasn't changed.  As another reviewer put it, Vanilla Sky tries TOO HARD to be clever.  I got the gist of the film from the first 20 minutes and the last 15 minutes.  That's all I needed. Everything else in between is useless.  I read all the people talkin about this movie, saying that whoever doesnt like this movie don't like to think and 'don't know anything about movies', and so on and so forth. Okay..... its one thing to try and bring a story with deep meaning and insight into film....but its another thing to cram a bunch of philosophical, sci-fi babble into a film and pass if off as 'clever' and 'imaginative'.  That's exactly what Crowe does with Vanilla Sky.  Amazingly, in trying to do all of that it STILL finds a way to come off as boring.  Now I get the whole thing about getting a second chance at life, and finding happiness and true love and such...but CMON!Experiencing Vanilla Sky is like me asking someone to do a puzzle while I slowly drop its pieces onto the canvas as the person tries putting it together....only to then bring the person the puzzle almost put together with a few pieces still missing.  It's all a big MESS!  I see what they were trying to do with the story, but they couldn't present it better than this???  A bunch of ill conceived, drawn out, disjointed sequences that has no irrelevance, to the point where the story itself is lost??  Vanilla Sky represents a cop out in filmmaking, its that simple.  ""Lets just confuse the HELL out of them for 2 hours and in the last 20 minutes just explain everything that just happened"".  What's the point?  It's all a waste of time.  The only thing that matters by the end of the movie is, as I said, everything up until the car crash and the last 15 minutes on the roof. The story was executed SO POORLY, that anything other than those two parts is just an excuse to drag the story along.  This movie was TERRIBLY executed.

"A good adaptation. Here are no misinterpretations for Vanilla Sky. The right one is the one that makes the most sense to you, as a viewer","In the first few minutes of the movie Tom Cruise was being Tom Cruise, with that unmistakable smile, adding his blue eyes and a sexy look to each scene, it gave the impression that by his forced charisma he could carry the movie like that until the end. It was certainly all very well planned by the writers and director of the film, including this exaggeration in Tom's performance to demonstrate how artificial and superfluous David Aames was, surrounded by money and being able to do whatever he wanted and with whoever he wanted. However, the ""turning the tables"" is so surreal and symbolic (and could not have been better orchestrated), the fateful car accident where everything believed and experienced undergoes a metamorphosis. We are immersed from the beginning in a hodgepodge of dreams and real life, and from then on, friend, it's a mess where we can feel lost and at the same time safe, the feeling that all that can still be explained. The feeling is that we are in the subconscious of a schizophrenic and his delusions, of lives he thought he lived or lives, but in fact nothing is as we are safe in thinking, and together with David we walk afflicted, anguished, trying to help him discover whether he really killed his girlfriend or not.Evidently, the great premise without which the film would not work is the existence of a cryogenics system capable of putting the person in a state of suspended animation and, on top of that, allowing the person to have an existence in a dreamlike state in which they can have the experience of a perfect life, designed by your own mind. A science fiction of rather small appeal, given the technology and speculation about the possibility of such ventures. The film's great narrative knot - and the cinematographic merit - is to produce a dreamlike and surreal narrative in the right measure, making the viewer not kill the riddle right away about what was actually happening with David.In Vanilla Sky we have a less mystical situation, or at least a journey with fewer stages: an individual completely bound to his material reality chooses, in a moment of despair, the option of living his own lucid dream. Evidently, the disfigurement of the face is, for David Aames, an unavoidable reality: David is forever exiled from the symbolic world in which his life had unfolded until then. From the moment he is doomed to failure, David opts for lucid dreaming with a motivation similar to that of a person who resorts to drugs that alter his state of consciousness. The dream seems to be the last possible refuge for an individual who saw, from a single moment, his entire horizon of accomplishments simply disappears. Perpetually projecting a perfect reality for himself was the only way out for an individual who, at the time, only had his own financial resources, but who no longer had the personality that the loss of his face had taken with it.But a conclusion about the nature of choices is not (so) forced, and the film is still saved by a (small) existential content: a contingency took away from David the conditions to continue living in reality and the same contingentia mundi took him out of the world. Dream perfect. David's conversation with Ventura (Technical Support, whose name clearly evokes the force of chance) offers us more solid elements of what is an analysis of a personality: the vanilla sky (""the ideal world""), the romance with Sofia (""the ideal love""), the figure of the psychologist (""the ideal father""), all the elements of David's lucid dream were a clear portrait of his personality. This is the idea on which lucid dreaming scholars are based: lucid dreaming is a privileged context for the practice of self-analysis and, therefore, of self-knowledge. Which by no means denies that lucid dreaming works as an escape from reality, and David Aames is the personification of the escape from reality: evidently, the disfigurement of the face is a sufficient reason to throw an individual into a psychological limit situation. , but any experience can be the trigger for the abandonment of an entire existential project, insofar as the meaning and meaning of a personal life is always and ultimately, the creation and responsibility of the individual himself. To be faithful to what Vanilla Sky offers us, the negative conclusion is inevitable (a positive treatment of the theme of lucid dreaming would be possible from Waking Life): the matter that makes up dreams, the same that can be the context for a greater understanding of itself, it is perfectly adaptable to the needs of a mind that wants to alienate itself, to escape from reality, from the world and from itself.The script, adapted by Cameron Crowe from the original, is quite faithful to what Amen√°bar initially conceived, although some details have been modified: among other things, David's partners appear more clearly as possible antagonists, which accentuates the subplot involving a probable conspiracy (which is good). On the other hand, the American version errs (a lot) by ignoring a certain confrontation between David and the police in the final third of the plot, which incredibly increased the tension of Trapped in Darkness (in the same way, I will never forgive Crowe for having removed, in Vanilla Sky, the terrible conflict in which David's psychiatrist plunges when confronted with certain facts - for me, one of the best elements of the Spanish film). Another flaw is the explanation of what is actually happening to the boy: by insisting on using a series of visual effects in this sequence, the director made everything even more confusing, which is curious, since Amen√°bar did better using only two metal chopsticks (those who watched the original know what I mean). However, Cameron Crowe also brought his own personal touch to the film: as with all of his previous works, the director adds several elements of American pop culture to the story, shaping parts of his characters' daily lives from album covers, music videos, and so on (which makes a lot of sense from a narrative point of view). In addition, the pace of Vanilla Sky is much more frenetic than that of Trapped in the Dark - although, in the end, it becomes a little more tiring due to some problems in the script.Cameron Crowe uses dream play very well throughout the story. He's cruel in the ballad sequence, from the dreamy blue lighting to Tom getting drunk in the crowd; then when he wakes up in the gutter with Sofia and they walk together away from the camera, like in a dream, and in the next frame, we have Cruise trapped walking towards the camera, like the sad reality; anyway, we have some moments like that, but the strong point is the questions posed. There are a few theories about Vanilla Sky. You certainly have yours, don't you? A sticker on the windshield of David's car is dated February 31, which may (or may not) mean that none of this is real. Another idea, which I find interesting, is to imagine that David's entire life at the beginning of the story was a dream. He has EVERYTHING anyone could want, right? And finally, we can imagine that, tired of living on appearances, David wanted to live a dream where he was ugly to see if someone would be able to fall in love with him. The truth is, there are NO misinterpretations for Vanilla Sky. The right one is the one that makes the most sense to you, as a viewer.The film tends to divide opinions - critics were not very sympathetic to the overly Hollywood atmosphere at the time of its release. The public, on the other hand, moved by the star-studded cast, seems to have better tolerated the dazzling plot. For those who like good music, you will find here and there sequences packed by different names, such as Radiohead, Sigur R√≥s, REM, Paul McCartney - who wrote an exclusive song for the work -, Chamical Brothers, Jeff Buckley and Bob Dylan (by the way, the Freewheelin' album cover appears in one of the film's most touching sequences, in the final third). In the midst of sequences such as the opening, to the sound of Everything In It's Right Place by Radiohead (which with its eccentric lyrics works as a kind of preamble to a life like the protagonist's, which mixes reality and fiction) or the one after the accident the sound of Sweetness Follows, by REM, there are others, like the absurdly dramatic (and funny) scene in which an already injured Cruise, sings One Of Us, by Joan Osbourne, on a stretcher. It is in this nonsensical atmosphere, with a cosmopolitan and urban soundtrack - which balances pop, rock and electronic songs in the right measure - that Crowe transforms his film into a true almanac of the songbook of all times.Tom Cruise creates a 'hero' (or rather: anti-hero) a little less egocentric than the one played by the excellent Eduardo Noriega in the Spanish version (although I can't think of a better actor for the American remake). Unfortunately, unlike what happens in Trapped in Darkness, in which the boy is completely disfigured after the accident, Cruise uses more restrained makeup, which does not transform him into a grotesque figure - which would be fundamental to the story (Hollywood would never allow that the star appeared unrecognizable in the film, which is unfortunate).Vanilla Sky is an interesting film, but one that is inevitably eclipsed by the original. It's annoying to have to comment on a film from another production, but in this case, this is mandatory. So the advice is: look for the version directed by Amen√°bar.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Well, sigh.","What can I possibly say that hasn't been already said in the 114 pages before me? How about this: It has been 5 years now. Can we at least admit that the film's popularity has not withstood the test of time? The novelty of a plot twist and beautiful people may win you some ecstatic early reviews, but the arguments that it begins do not have the depth to become the kind of things you will want to share with your children twenty years from now.Or how about this: I wish I understood Mr. Crowe's motivation in making this film. It lacked the innocent exuberance of Almost Famous, a place where great music made the story better. Here, pretty effects and some good music may create some individually beautiful scenes but they only serve to distract from the tension of the underlying story. Which, in order to be compelling needed all of the tension it could get.Which reminds me, I would be really excited to see what a minimalist version of Mr. Crowe's work would look like. If he learns (or relearns?) the discipline to cut scenes that, while beautiful in themselves, only distract from the underlying story, will make better movies. It worked for Almost Famous, it was lacking in Elizabethtown. (Just throw them on the DVD as extras. They won't be lost.)Sad conclusion: It was just an uninteresting film with some good music. It could have been good if the story had not been lost to the eye/mind candy.

A must watch Psychological thriller,"Vanilla Sky is an American Psychological thriller movie released back in 2001. The story of the movie revolves around and is focused on the life of David Ames played by Tom Cruise who is inherits his father's wealth. One day at his party he is introduced by his friend to Sofia Serrano with whom David falls in love with at first sight but at the same time he is avoiding Julie Gianni who supposedly has a thing for david because of their shared past together. Following some incidents the next day, David and Julie together meet an car accident which mutilates his face and after waking up up from comma he discovers that Julie died in that car accident. All of this is story told by David to his Psychologist in Jail where he is convicted for Julie's death. David has trouble remembering the incidents of the past and various incidents from different time period and with him we are set on a quest on finding out the reason why Julie died.Vanilla sky was an absolute treat an individual who enjoys cinema and whose favourite genre is psychological thriller. However movie does lack in a little visual department as movie could have been a little bit more dramatic with darker tone as everything just appears so normal that the viewer might forget he actually is watching a movie. As story progresses a lot of twists happen which can throw audience wondering and shocked. Unlike many other psychological thriller there is always one maniac with their own ideology and thoughts but David as a protagonist discovers his own different identity due to memory loss. Many memories of david are changed or replaced by himself for which movie hints multiple times at human's subconscious and how dangerous it is.
Acting in the movie is something that has to mention as Tom Cruise totally nails it as an guy with disfigured face.For some reason the first part of the movie is great but later for which david is having remembering issue is addressed very poorly as movie completely changes its tone from Mystery psychological thriller to this Science fiction setting and such transition will obviously not be appreciated by most of the audience however i liked it but people won't because it was not executed properly and most of the time went in establishing character of david in 1st half of the movie itself.
Vanilla sky in the end becomes one of those movies which had great and unique concept for which it is expressed very nicely but later half brings it down and for that reason the next time someone asks me to suggest them an psychological thriller movie, I won't definitely suggest them Vanilla Sky and the reason is that because I love this movie for what it is no matter how much I criticize it and if someone else complains about it, I won't be able to take that. The ending is of movie is totally like many great films where you are given answers and are left to wonder and imagine story according to yourself.

I like it more than I should,"Vanilla Sky is, obviously, a very unnecessary film. Hollywood's ever growing tendency to hijack every somewhat successful foreign film and remake it in English for the local market is one of the worst diseases of the American film industry; this remake of Alejandro Amen√°bar's excellent Abre los ojos - made only three years after the original's release - is, by its conception, no better than any of them.And yet - and yet, I like Vanilla Sky. I can't say that I like it as much as Abre los ojos, but that's mainly because it lacks the element of originality. Some elements aren't as strong as the original, and there's definitely a Hollywoodian feeling that distracts, but the remake has many strengths as well - other than the obviously bigger budget, the biggest advantage it has is director Cameron Crowe. Crowe adapted the film nearly word-for-word and shot-for-shot, but he lent it his own style, his own penchant for pacing, and of course an excellent soundtrack which includes artists as varied as Radiohead, The Monkees, Red House Painters and Sigur R√≥s. Crowe's smoother, more elegant approach is just as appropriate for the story as Amen√°bar's grittiness, if not more, and it's actually quite refreshing to see these two different approaches to an almost identical film.Tom Cruise also does a surprisingly good job. While Jason Lee and Kurt Russell don't quite work out in their roles, I actually liked Cruise better than Eduardo Noriega in the lead. Cruise lends the role the same airheaded, self-important naivet√© he had in Jerry Maguire, to darker results, and supplies one of his better performances. I also liked - nay-sayers be damned - the increased emphasis on the sci-fi elements, which work as a truly surprising turn when they finally appear.Vanilla Sky isn't as complex or intelligent as Abre los ojos. Instead, it's more stylish and more dynamic, and as a film by its own right, it works just as well. Despite the many similarities these are two different films, and I like them both.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

No, there is no definite answers, but if you pay careful attention you'll realize how Vanilla Sky easily is a brilliant masterpiece.This is definitely the most mind-bending movie I've watched in my life. It makes you question what is imagination and what is reality, and the more you dive into the movie the more confused you will be, and that's exactly how it's supposed to be.

Why did he have to complicate things at all!!!!And ultimately the film falls flat on its face...........it suddenly says he is 150 yrs in the future? And wat ??? he wud never get old????It starts out nicely though i feel the acting on all quarters is really good. Cruz looks good and Diaz is no match for her. It does make you stop and think though!!!! and i was a bit depressed too!!!,3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Tom Cruise pulls off another brilliant performances, both as a very attractive playboy with multiple relationships and as a disfigured man trying to find place in the world.","Tom Cruise pulls off another brilliant performances, both as a very attractive playboy with multiple relationships and as a disfigured man trying to find place in the world. I went to this movie generally expecting a romantic story with a bit of a twist. Well the twist is there, but if you go to see the romance, you'll be disappointed, however if you go with an open mind you should find something to like. Although I have to say that director Cameron Crowe made a brilliant movie, at times the story seemed to jerk, and the pace changed rapidly, and on occasions was very difficult to follow. However if you can ride these bits as you get nearer to the end, those bits and the actual reason for jumpiness of the story becomes clearer. It's a story with a lot of surprises and a lot of twists. I would say that the story is one about life, not life as in birth to death, although that comes into it but life from the emotional view, of happiness and contentment through to angry and confusion. All the other actors play brilliant roles, I like to pick some out but I can't because they all were so good. It is however a thinking movie, to enjoy and as near as mere mortals can, understand it, you need to keep thinking throughout the movie, which my turn many people off it. I would say however that if you don't see it in the cinema do rent it when it comes out in video stores, even if its just so you to can have an opinion on it. Well I know that I'll be renting it just so I might understand it more, yes the first time is good, but I've heard that the second is better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A very interesting movie. One of its kinds.,"I think the movie was great and interesting. In the firs hour you still really don't know where the movie is heading to and I got a meaningless impression. But I gave it some time and suddenly it turned out to be a great movie.Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egoistical who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. But his life is taking a big turn when he met with a car accident. Unfortunately he got terrible defects on his face and suddenly his life is more less destroyed.My summary is that if you like movies that are intellectual, frustrating and have unexpected endings you must see this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A Mess,"Cameron Crowe finally confirms what's been suspected for quite some time--that's he's a shallow filmmaker with limited range and visual sensibilities--in perhaps the worst film produced by a major studio this past decade. Crowe reunites with star Tom Cruise to deliver a meandering, incomprehensible fantasy (based on Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 film, `Open Your Eyes', unseen by this reviewer) about the price of beauty and it's easy to see the appeal this theme would have to an actor whose career has been defined by his classic good looks. But Cruise has neither the intellectual prowess nor the acting chops to incite any curiosity (indeed, he spends half the time mumbling through a prosthetic mask or grisly facial makeup) and Crowe seems to want to do little else but indulge his star in wild bits of overacting. As usual, Crowe's staid writing style makes everyone else (including Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russell and Cameron Diaz) look bad too: each performer has some bad dialogue to deliver at one point or another and is forced to do it in an embarrassingly earnest way. Crowe, after incomprehensibly trying--and failing--to position himself as Billy Wilder (you can't be Billy Wilder without mingling romance with cynicism and Crowe doesn't appear to have a cynical bone in his body), seems to be setting himself up as a mixture of Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, but he's far too pedestrian a filmmaker to capture the essence of either director and the result is a trite, talky, open-ended mess that ends up becoming little more than an ersatz science-fiction mess--albeit with a great soundtrack. You could spend hours trying to decide what it's `about'--and Crowe would love nothing more than to have you do just that--but it would be a waste of time because, other than the vanity thing, it's really about nothing at all. The harsh shock editing is by Joe Hutshing and Mark Livolsi and they destroy the decent, if uninspired, work turned in by cinematographer John Toll. No matter--nothing could overcome Crowe's dull cinematic style anyway.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
How Unoriginal,"I was staying up late on Sunday night and with nothing better on TV, I decided to start watching a foreign movie on The Movie Channel. The movie was called ""Open Your Eyes"" and basically was the same movie as Vanilla Sky. Right down to the actress playing the female lead, Penelope Cruz. The same jealous girlfriend attempting murder him in the car crash, the mask, everything.Sad to say I actually thought that the original movie was much better. There was a little twist at the end, but much better and believable than Vanilla Sky.I used to respect Cameron crow but after seeing a worse remake, makes me question is creativity. This is the first time that I have actually preferred a movie with subtitles and a lower budget than a Hollywood blockbuster.If you have a night with nothing better to do. Check out ""Open Your Eyes"" and compare it to Vanilla Sky, you wont be disappointed.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A cover to cover Fear!,"After Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire, guess he had only Tom on his mind, who plays David Aames, as a spoilt Rich brat who inherits New York's Super seller Magazine named ""Rise"" The Movie begins in the streets with his Black Ferrari, where he sees the entire Times Square Empty!!! The best part I always wanted to hear the Directors commentary, when I got my own DVD, I heard it, right from the Producer that how it took them to Block the Entire Times Square - with the Mayor's permission all the shops and offices to be open but no living beings on site, it was physically made and no Digital mix or any graphics was used!! Really unbelievable shot!!! I heard they closed the shot in 3.5 hrs. Drawing the attention towards the accident that changed the life of this rich brat which made him feel incompetent in his life. His charms, smile and happiness were stolen by that single accident for which he gave himself. Another point to note ¬ñ The sticker on David's car reads 2/30/01, a fictional date. On the commentary, Cameron Crowe says that it was an accident, it did make sense..the make up was sketched perfectly that how one could not face even his best friend and was wearing a mask for a party, even one would feel that in-composite. Also his love Sofia (Penelope Cruz) whom he visualizes as Julie (Cameroon Diaz) when he is in the ecstasy of making love with his girlfriend Sofia, who then turns in to Julie due to the strong subconscious mind taken over - is perfectly depicted by nice camera work! Although a lone character which brings his father's senses to him through Dr.Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) who wants to reveal him to the world what he went through, but Kurt Russell rides to the conclusion that he was not under any pressure but with science and its re-engineering or moreover a treatment, from Life Time a sci-balance program which makes him feel young even after 150 yrs as such ¬ñ this is where the Director had to maintain his story but then takes as a tour and summarizes the climax on top of a building with a get together to prove that he has to come over his greatest fear ""Height"" and jumps! Well this is something, which the Dir could have emitted ¬ñ I would rate this movie 6 out of 10 also a must see for Tom's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Quite a nice surprise!,"This one has been sitting on my PVR for a while so I finally got round to watching it...Wasn't what I expected! Its not great but its certainly good. As a Lynch/SF fan I appreciated those elements but its certainly no Mulholland Drive (another reviewer here thinks Vanilla Sky is better which did make me smirk quite a lot!).It gets 7/10 for me because although its very good in places, its rather drawn out in others. The music didn't help either - I pretty much hated or didn't like or the music used in this film. I can honestly say that if this had had a good soundtrack (like Mulholland Drive for instance ;) ) I would have liked it more.To conclude - its a bit long and the soundtrack is pretty horrible (unless you like this kind of bland middle of the road rubbish).

One in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films,"This one in a long line of unnecessary hollywood remakes of good foreign films in the last few years...Insomnia, The Ring, The Vanishing to name a few others. The trend disturbs me a little. I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with remaking movies and there have been some great films that are loose remakes of other films, like A Fistful of Dollars and Scarface. But to me it seems unnecessary to take an already good film and do an almost exact remake of it. For me, the worst one of all time was Gus Van Sant's near exact remake of the masterpiece, Pscyho. I don't see the point, if you're just trying to copy it. I guess the point is to make money, but I'd expect a little more from established movie makers. It's obvious that the director, Cameron Crowe, has originality. He wrote, directed, and even composed original music for his last film, Almost Famous, which happens to be my favorite movie of 2000. Maybe he used up too much on that film, which was semi-autobiographical and needed an easier fix this go round...I'm really not sure. Vanilla Sky itself wasn't awful, but I find it significantly lacking on all levels in comparison to Abre Los Ojos. Vanilla Sky lacks the heart and subtleness of the original. There are a couple things I'd like to mention, but I think it gives too much away. Another downfall is that it's glammed up with big, known faces...Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, Cameron Diaz. Even Spielberg pops in for a cameo. However, I did find it interesting to see Pen√©lope Cruz play Sofia in both movies, but like everything good thing in Vanilla Sky, it was just ripped off from the original. I think when these lesser known foreign gems are found, they should be brought to the U.S. and given the bigger released they deserve and not just copied. Or at least if you remake a film, do something different with it and not just try and remake the same darn movie. Okay, that's my rant.** (Out of 4)",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Wannabe clone of ""Eyes wide shut"" or ""Memento""","It became quite fashionable in recent years to make confusing movies, with many of them changing perspectives or moving back and forth in the story. That goes very well and adds to tension and atmosphere in well thought-through plots like Eyes wide shut or Memento.It goes terribly wrong though if director and producer basically do not know what they want to tell us and what the true message of a movie should be. All of this is the case in Vanilla Sky, which makes this movie a complete vase of time unless you enjoy the beautiful looks of Cruz / Diaz or Cruise.It could have been either a nice yet conventional or a true sci-fi movie but it wanted to be a little bit of everything. While you are struggling for more than 2 hours to keep up with all the changes in perspectives and perception, there is nothing you get in return.

Disappointingly disappointing,"When I first heard about this film I couldn't wait to see it.  'Another quirky film with a Fight Club twist' I was told;  'If you liked Twelve Monkeys and Memento [loved 'em] you'll enjoy this.'  Not necessarily true.While watchable, I was left with an empty feeling when exiting the cinema. I was hoping for so much more, but all I got was a below-average movie with a good ending.  An interesting idea, I feel Cruise snapped up the rights to 'Open Your Eyes' without thinking about how the film would come across in the mainstream.  Crowe tried his best, but I don't think enough was added to make the improvements the film needed.  While enjoying the last third (to a point - anyone who states it isn't taking huge liberties regarding Total Recall is kidding themselves) I was only just managing to keep my attention after the fairly drab bulk of the film.  Yes character building was a necessity in this story, but the love story alone was not enough for me to warrant 90 minutes + of my viewing.  A new angle or sub-plot needed to be implemented.Sadly I wasn't even kept thinking throughout.  I knew very little about the film beforehand but I could predict it like a particularly badly written episode of Neighbours from fairly early on in the picture.

What a bomb,"A Tom Cruise vanity project: incoherent, senseless, confused and overlong. Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous was a delight, but Vanilla Sky's script, direction, casting and editing are a mess. Looking for SOMETHING a group of six friends could go to this weekend in San Diego, I nixed our seeing Sidewalks of New York as I'd heard it was endlessly talkative, and foolishly suggested we try Vanilla Sky instead. Well, some of our group thought this movie the worst in years. More boring than House of Mirth, more absurd than Eyes Wide Shut, more obscure than Memento and more embarrassing than Quills, we suffered to the end. When I couldn't take it, I looked at the floor or audience. Cruise's toothy smile is bad enough but his distorted car crash mask is harder to take. Penelope Cruz seemed vacuous--supposedly better in the Abre Los Ojos original, which I've not seen. Kurt Russell as a shrink is a joke, and only Cameron Diaz seemed adequately cast, though she's not on camera long enough. (For charisma, she easily trumps Penelope Cruz.) Plot motivation is thin, the music's an arbitrary rock hodgepodge, editing is MTV-style, and the film's muddled concept perhaps appealed to Cruise due to his belief in Scientology. 1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

There has never been so much TOM CRUISE in one movie and he can not carry this thing because he is not likable- hardly at all in real life, even less so in this film. The ending is the only thing which really makes this film at all worth seeing but it plays like a long, LONG version of an episode of the Twilight Zone. There is also an element of Spielberg's 'A.I' in here as well as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'. In 'A.I.', the main character is also named David and it also ends with a gonzo whopper of a sci-fi finale. Unfortunately for this film, 'A.I.' also had two interesting acts previous to the last one, which this film does not have. Not to strain the Spielberg connection too much, but the guy makes a cameo in 'Vanilla Sky'(why?).All of that said, there are some creepy moments but unfortunately they add up to nil. Also, Cameron Crowe's trademark ""alternative"" sounding rock soundtrack finally spoils the party. Finally when things are getting interesting I hear Sinead O' Connor and I think, ""Oh, this is from that album that bombed"".

A Complete Butchery of Abre Los Ojos,"The absolute most annoying thing about this film is that some people think it is so `original.'  The entire film is a re-make of a highly superior film from Spain called Abre Los Ojos.  As a matter of fact, re-make is too nice a word.  I would say it is a shameless destruction of another person's ideas. This person is Alejandro Amen√°bar, the Spanish director who recently made The Others.  The film Abre Los Ojos was made only a few years ago, hardly warranting a re-make.  Abre Los Ojos is original, entertaining and well made, with far less of a budget than Vanilla Sky.Now Cameron Crowe has taken this excellent film and literally destroyed everything great about.  The plot is needlessly lengthened to the point of absurdity.  Tom Cruse shows off his usual inability to deliver any sort of quality whatsoever (the only time I've ever seen him do anything worth watching was in Magnolia).  The ending is given a ridiculous happy spin and is dragged out.  The only person remotely worth watching in this film is Jason Lee, who actually does his part justice beyond the actor in the original.In the past, when Cameron Crowe has worked with material of his own, the results have not been too bad.  However, as Crowe attempts to show, or should I say steal another persons story, he fails miserably.  The film is injected with pop songs and references.  Okay I get it Crowe.  So, if you put a bunch of songs that people like, you think some of that quality will rub off onto your film?  Keep dreaming.  The songs are placed horribly and have almost nothing to do with what occurs.  It is not like in Rushmore, where the songs seem to match the mood of the scene.  In Vanilla Sky, the Beach Boy's `Good Vibrations' blasts through the speakers while Tom Cruse runs around all confused.  Oh yeah, Beach Boys.  That's exactly what I think of when I'm having a nervous breakdown.Trying to re-create Abre Los Ojos the way Cameron Crowe does is like attempting to draw a beautiful work of art with an Etch-A-Sketch.  It looks terrible and probably should not be attempted in the first place.  The penalty for stealing in some countries is to have your hands cut off.  If this sentence were carried out with Cameron Crowe, he would be getting off lightly.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Technically good but let down by acting and dialogue,"I'll begin with the positives. Technically speaking this is an excellent film. Excellently directed, haunting imagery- an abandoned New York being particularly haunting- and an absolute fantastic soundtrack. In fact the soundtrack is easily the best thing about this film. It is almost entirely pitch perfect with excellent artists such as Radiohead, REM, Jeff Buckley and Paul McCartney all seamlessly working into the film.Now the drawbacks. The acting in this film is not exactly great. Cameron Diaz tries her hardest but her character is very little for a character to do and she just ends up a serious of clich√©s. Penelope Cruz's character can't seem to match up to her one in the original and just leaves the viewer baffled as to what all the fuss is about. Worst of all however is Tom Cruise himself. I'm not sure if this is just a personal problem I have with Cruise or not. I enjoyed him in Magnolia but everything else he's been in has just annoyed me. He's excellent at playing the cocky spoilt rich kid role that he's been perfecting all his career but when his character takes a dark turn Cruise just doesn't have the chops to pull it off. His brooding in the interrogation scenes is almost unwatchable.Worst of all, however, is the dialogue. It is clunky and is almost embarrassing when it's being spoken. See for example the attempts to explain the film at the end. It is one of the most boring ways possible to finish a film just by having a character you have barely met lifelessly explain it all. Line after line of it is spewed out by the actors but it never really seems to be going anyone.This is a great concept for a film and was done exquisitely well .... in the original. For anyone interested in the film I'd recommend the original by far.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Exquisite.,"Considering director of photography John Toll is the co-cinematographer for Lana Wachowski's upcoming ""The Matrix: Resurrections"" project, funnily enough, it's quite coincidental how this underrated gem from 2001 feels very much like a spiritual accompaniment, borne directly from the inspiration triggered by the Wachowski Sister's original 1999 sci-fi masterpiece - almost as though it was designed to act as his early audition tape to eventually helm the iconic franchise - & visual evidence for any doubters who were still concerned, regarding his suitability / eligibility / talent behind the camera (think Spike Jonze's ""Her"" meets ""The Matrix""); ""Vanilla Sky"" is the kind of endearing tale you rarely see being told these days by any current production company or filmmaker (very of its time), imbued with a real beating heart you can feel reverberating throughout; bold, soulful & deeply sentimental, I thought it was extraordinarily truthful. There's an unexpectedly charming warmth, capturing the personality housed within the project - spilling out on to every frame of the screen in gorgeously lit, soft pastel colours (the palette here is stunning), realised & measured beautifully by the meticulous camera department who do such an exemplary job reflecting the humanity of the story authentically. It's unashamedly devoid of cynicism, philosophical, evocative & audacious. Left quite an impact.Additionally, it easily features one of the greatest & most honest performances I've ever seen Tom Cruise give in his entire career, so it's hard not to be impressed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Great humor, excellent cast... and more than a bit disturbing.","This is a very trippy movie, and the less you know about the plot going into the theater, the stronger it's effect will be.  It's one of those Sixth Sense/ Usual Suspects/ Devil's Advocate ""what-the-heck-is-going-on"" types. The difference is, Vanilla Sky doesn't just throw out clues as to what's going on... it throws out red herrings, too.  And then --just to keep you questioning what you see even more-- tells the majority of the story in flashbacks & dream sequences.Don't be surprised if Cameron Diaz ends up getting an Oscar nomination for her role as ""the saddest girl ever to hold a martini.""  Aside from Being John Malkovich, this is her best role yet.Tom Cruise's performance reminded me strongly of his role in Jerry Maguire (another Cameron Crowe movie).  His character is not used to caring for anyone but himself, and once again his self-centered lifestyle ends up inflicting serious emotional damage to those who love him.  Instead of yelling ""show me the money"", this time he's yelling something else... but telling what it is would ruin the surprise. ;0)Lots of comedy and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers.  Jason Lee seemed to get the bulk of the funny bits, but Cruise gets in his share of memorable zingers, too.I gave it a 9, because I haven't seen a movie this good for several months, but it wasn't quite perfect.  The plot seemed to drag on unnecessarily just a little near the end (teasing the audience before the conclusion, perhaps?), and that kept me from gracing it with a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Good brain food,"Tom Cruise gets on my nerves with his preachy self, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he is a pretty good actor and in this film he shines. Have not seen the Spanish film ""Open Your Eyes"" of which this is a remake, but this one was good enough for me to want to see it as well. Is it a love story? Not really, a sci-fi? Not really, a drama? kinda sorta, but really it's all of the above and shouldn't be categorized.The story although seemingly convoluted at first, stretches your mind and starts to make more sense as you realize Cruises' affliction is causing him some heavy head trips. Cruise holds his own as the central character carrying quite an acting burden as a self centered but likable rich boy, a total victim of circumstance, and a love smitten puppy to the amazingly attractive Penelope Cruz.Cameron Diaz has always been a favorite of mine: expressive and playful with an edge, and here she excels in the role. Penelope Cruz actually is her perfect antithesis: secure, natural, grounded, and utterly irresistible, which gives her enough power to convince us that even studly Tom Cruise had met his match.Enough said, can't say too much, but the story concept is very interesting and although at first I probably wouldn't have rented this film even upon recommendation, I am glad that I experienced it.

The movie is about the mind trying to make it alright again.

Interesting Copy,"I have no problem with remakes like Ocean's Eleven as they update old ideas. It is a little harder to accept Hollywood remakes of recent, successful foreign movies. The original is Abre los Ojos, which was made in 1997. What Hollywood does in these cases is a common phenomenon, popularly referred to as theft. That aside, let's concentrate on the movie as it turned out.Many confusing films have popped up after The Sixth Sense. This is certainly one of them and I have heard many complaints that people left the theatres puzzled. This should, however, not be necessary as I think the plot is very well explained in the end. I even feel a little too much may have been explained, but it is still of the more intelligent sorts of movies. It is highly entertaining and Crowe is a master of portraying warmth and he shows this particularly well in the ending. The problem with the film is that it is originally a Spanish movie. Latino countries often embrace the incredible and the mystical in their movies, and it somehow works better when they make these movies. Here, it feels sort of weird.Cruise has long ago become a mature and excellent actor. His character in Vanilla Sky is almost as written by Bret Easton Ellis. Pay particular attention to when he is introduced to his new mask by the medical team. The flaw, if I can call it that, with his character is his choice of women. I am skeptical to any person who would choose Pen√©lope Cruz over Cameron Diaz, although that is what Cruise did in real life. Choosing her over Nicole Kidman is not much better though. ;-) Also, Jason Lee and Kurt Russell make good impressions.This is a high adrenaline movie with excellent music, and if you aren't tired of the Sixth Sense effect yet, this is not a bad bet.PS! The introductory scene with Tom Cruise in a completely empty Times Square is not only impressive, it is also quite real.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
It should've been shorter,"It looks like we have another case where the people liked it more than the critics. I guess I'm probably on neither side and I'm just going to say that this movie was okay. There was one thing that I really felt weighed it down. It was too long. There was a time where he took off his mask that I seriously thought the movie would end there. Instead, it kept going! This was a DVD given by a friend for a birthday present. This may be the last movie I ever watch before getting a Netflix account. This movie was perfectly passable. I admit that it got a little predictable. I knew it was going to be that there were dreams involved.It was probably for the best I had no clue what this movie was about. It features Tom Cruise's character as a rich guy who finds a girlfriend and then his ex tries to kill him. Yeah, I didn't see that coming. He survives, but is left disfigured and tries to adjust to life this way. It wasn't that hard to follow but it certainly got weirder as it went on. The acting is pretty good, but I guess it's just not quite the movie for me. I guess it might be because I just saw the ""Agents Of Shield"" episode ""Self Control"" that I saw a much better story of people in a dreamlike state. **1/2",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
One of my favourite movies of all time,"I just saw this film again on TV a few days ago. It had been years since I saw it last and I forgot just how much I love this movie. It compelled me to do some googling about it and I'm quite surprised by the mixed reviews it's received by critics and the IMDb community. I don't know how anyone could not love this film. I think the bad reviews must come from those that don't understand the movie (and yes, the plot does get a bit confusing). I won't spoil the story for anyone who hasn't seen it, because it really is that good and has one hell of a twist.This really is an underrated cinematic gem. It's a great psychological thriller with a dash of science fiction, but at its heart it's a touching love story. Whenever I watch this film it churns up so many emotions in me. It's a tragic love story, both sad and uplifting. It's the story of a man who has to learn the hard way, the value of life.This is an incredible film and I recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A breath of fresh air,"wow! I know there will be many who disagree with my views on this movie, but there are also many who will agree.Vanilla Sky is just fantastic.  It has a quite original twist than most movies around.  Because of this twist, it is one of those great movies such as 'the Sixth Sense' and 'Arlington Road' which after watching it, you feel as though you HAVE to see it again, now that you know what is really happening throughout the film.  Without spoiling it too much for others who haven't seen it, there is a certain feature in the plot which is shown throughout many times and you don't realise just how important it is until the end.  Vanilla Sky is also the only film which i have seen twice at the cinema.On another note, i have never thought too highly of Tom Cruise before, and never considered him a good actor.

Strange but very good  7/10,"Once in a while, i see a movie that slowly sneaks by brain out of my head, proceeds to kick, punch and elbow drop it for a couple of hours and the put it back in, upside down and inside it. Memento did it. The Matrix did it. And now Vanilla Sky has done it.I used to not like Tom Cruise very much. He was always the pretty boy hero type that never interested me. But the last four movies i have seen featuring him have really change my mind, including Collateral (his best work), A Few Good Men (i know it's old but i just saw it recently), The Last Samurai, and Vanilla Sky. He really has become one of the best actors today.As for the movie itself, it is filled with thrills, sex, comedy, twists, and uhh sex. Speaking of sex, it also features two extremely hot women with great supporting roles in Cameron Diaz and Penelople Cruz. The ending really made the whole film click. Some parts of the movie were a bit confusing and the beginning is a little slow, but as a whole the movie is really worth a look. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A painful waste of time.,"There were lots of these movies through the 90s - Groundhog Day, Strange Days, The Truman Show, The Matrix, Pleasantville, Memento and others, using Film as a metaphor for an illusory life. I liked most of them... but found this late arrival relentlessly contrived, pretentious, narcissistic, vacuous, tedious...It would have been better if they'd just played it all out in front of a big mirror as home entertainment, with loads of breaks for self-congratulation. In fact, most of the time, looking at the screen was like staring cringefully at the hammy acting, lousy direction and terrible script through a two-way mirror. Why did all these sad characters have to rope in a cinema audience to convince themselves how hip and clever they were? I thought Tarantino was the ne plus ultra of pretentious narcissism. This runs him pretty close, without the art.I guess you'd call this self-conscious tripe 'postmodern'. It's basically a very old genre - as old as the illusion of moving pictures themselves. There are great German Expressionist examples, like Nosferatu - but my all-time favourite is Jacques Rivette's C√©line et Julie vont en Bateau (1974). It is not 10, but a thousand times better than this embarrassing dross, and infinitely more engaging, imaginative and playful. See it instead.

Not Nearly As Good As Open Your Eyes,"I saw Vanilla Sky when it was first released in 2001 and then again on DVD about a month ago. In reading reviews on IMDb I discovered that it was a remake of a Spanish movie, Open You Eyes, and so I ordered it from Netflix as well. Penelope Cruz is the only cast member in both versions. She plays the role of Sofia and does a masterful job. The story is almost exactly the same scene by scene and even in dialogue.But, the ALMOST is significant.When I saw Vanilla Sky, I thought it was pretty good. I did think that it left too much unresolved and an extra scene (which I didn't know was extra at the time), further clouded the resolution with no apparent value to the movie.Ambiguity isn't always bad in a story, but I felt that the resolution in Open Your Eyes was exactly what was appropriate for the movie. I also felt that the scenery-chewing that Tom Cruise did in several scenes of the American version actually detracted from the feel of the story line.There is a bar scene that is almost identical, word for word, in the two films. The only difference is the tone and body language of the main character and the bartender, which makes the Vanilla Sky version quite confrontational while in the Spanish version the scene plays as a simple faux pas on the part of the bartender that is quickly resolved. Again, I thought the confrontation was unnecessary and, I would hope, unrealistic.In general, I think the American version suffers from inferior direction and poorer acting. Penelope Cruz is excellent in both. Cruise and Kurt Russell seem to have decided that their roles needed to big bigger and more emotional. They were wrong.If you are really interested in film making, I suggest you watch both and see how seemingly small changes can change the ""feel"" of a movie. Otherwise, I recommend Open Your Eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Tom,"Unlike David Lynch's mesmerizing, surreal ""Mulholland Falls,"" everything gets explained at the end.

""Vanilla Sky,"" alas, held no shocks or surprises for me, having recently seen the original. One change he does make is to humanize the Cameron Diaz character, who was a scary femme fatale in Amenabar's version. This is consistent with Crowe's kinder, gentler sensibility, but it's a mistake.

If one more user implies that I just 'don't get' this movie...,"Let's get one thing straight here; this film was made for Tom Cruise's ego. They spent a lot of money on it, pulled in an acclaimed director, and even photocopied an English translation of a previously acclaimed film's script. It couldn't fail could it?Well it did.  There are NO brilliant social observations in this movie, the whole life extension thing was NOT a vehicle for the people behind this film to display some sort of deeper meaning or commentary about society (it was just a failed plot device), and all it managed to do was lower Cruise and Crowe's standing in the eyes of many critics, both professional and amateur, all over the world.Cruise has shown many times that he can act, for examples just see 'Born on the Fourth of July' or 'Magnolia' and Crowe can most certainly piece together a worthwhile film, i.e. 'Almost Famous,' but both should walk off with their tails between their legs after this one.The 'suprise' ending, which some have even compared to the one in 'the Sixth Sense,' is just a ridiculous.  The ending in M. Night Shyamalan's film was signposted throughout the film and relied on clever camera work, scripting, and editing to hide the secret.  It was done in a clever fashion and all fitted in quite neatly. THIS film just added a completely contrived and stupid ending without giving any sort of hint as to what might happen earlier (unless you count the constant references to that snap frozen dog). You could put the exact same ending on a film about the life of Martin Luther King and it would fit just as well as it does in this one.Now you may have noticed that it's the ending that I am complaining about in particular. In all honesty, the first hour or so of the film is an effective scene setter.  Yes, Cruise only shows one emotion before the accident and another vaguely modified one afterwards, but Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell offer impressive performances and it often feels as though Vanilla Sky is just on the verge of blowing your mind and becoming film of the year. Then comes the ending.Yes, a few good performances and a good first hour might seem to be justification for giving the film some credit (at least more than I'm about to give it) but that only adds insult to injury when the aforementioned STUPID second half kicks in.  Don't worry if you didn't like this film while others you know loved it and claim that any smart person would like it; you are right.  They have just been caught up in the pretentiousness that this film carries with it from start to finish. The fact the IMDB users have given this drivel such a high score just proves the phrase 'there's no accounting for taste.'3/10 Tops.  Maybe less, but Diaz and Russell and the impressive start give it SOME credence.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Underrated masterpiece,One of the most underrated films. It's either you love it because you see it as a masterpiece or you are lazy to make effort understand and appreciate it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A beautiful film,"This is a movie I saw a long time ago, and recently visited after forgetting basically everything about it. And I guess my maturation since I originally saw it really did wonders, because this movie gripped me like few others do. I'd say it's probably my second favorite movie of all time, right behind Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. The casting is perfect, and the characters are very interesting and believable as human beings. The music is what really grips me. Every song fits perfectly with the scene (except the REM song at the beginning when Cruise and Lee are in the car). The pacing is brilliant, never revealing too much too soon and never having a dull moment either. I have a hard time watching this movie without crying because it just teaches the viewer (assuming they are mature enough to get what this movie is really about) so much about life, how short it is, and how everything in life is sweeter if you've had the hard things to through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The Anti-Shrek of our times,"Despite protestations mid way through the film the big message that you take home with your popcorn box is that beautiful = good, ugly = sad and mad!! A message that narcisistic egomaniacs obsessed with the mirror have some sort of right to longevity. I wriggled first with discomfort over the nasty taste this was giving me and rising to a full blown mouth of bile over the ""twist"".The clunking metaphors were almost to much to bear (mask on back of head etc) and a very detailed explanation of David's true life was something out of a VERY bad SciFi short. And as for the disfigurements of Cruise (""amazing"" prostehetics) which were to haunt David through his life and dreams - I think I've had worst shaving cuts!The leads were perfunctory in there acting. Diaz looked better in Shrek, Cruise gunning for ""can't act but sure can grin"" stardom and Cruz, though undoubtably stunning, twitched her way through her lines with the manner of a lost tourist in Times square struggling to understand a word of a new and lucrative language.I really wish they would have turned into ogres and got down with rest of us uglies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Kubrick would have liked this!,"Not since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, has a film generated such emotion (both on and off screen). It actually draws parallels with that film, amongst so many others, but we will get to that later! Curiously, it has attracted much the same critical disapproval as Kubrick's work. Seen by many as ""boring,"" ""self-indulgent"" and ""convoluted,""  it is none of these things. It IS however an unapproachably brilliant work of art, from my viewpoint at least perhaps the greatest film ever made and as close to 2001 in depth and visual brilliance as anyone is ever going to get! Cameron Crowe has not ""done"" it for me before, and I really couldn't care if he never ""does it"" again. Kubrickian in stature and mystique he isn't, more like the neighbor you never really got into, and whom you might stumble across in the homewares aisle in your local S-Mart. What he has achieved with VANILLA SKY however is mind-numbing greatness, to which so many people have contributed their very souls.To try to summarise or come up with an encompassing precis of this flick is to undervalue if not trivialise a masterpiece. Its greatness lies essentially in its opening line ""Open your eyes""...the only problem IS, you need to have SEEN the film to realise the staggering implications of what you are hearing. OPEN YOUR EYES of course was the original Spanish film from masterful newcomer Alejandro Amenaber who scaled the heights in Hollywood with this year's THE OTHERS. Rather than identify the film in question, aware viewers may well feel a sense of deja vu here, recalling to mind the line ""Open your mind...open your mind"" which was surely a precursor, if not the inspiration behind both films. Functioning along multiple awareness channels throughout its 153 minute run-time, VANILLA SKY is alternately, intellectually challenging and emotionally involving. Whether you view it as a thriller, a black comedy, outrageous sci-fi or even JERRY MAGUIRE on acid, this is pure brain-drain, a ""fix"" for the fanciful!The opening scenes, as Cruise finds himself in a totally deserted Times Square, seemingly in ""virtual"" impossibility sets the viewer up for what is to follow - a mind-trip through hell and beyond the infinite, literally!!! Think MATRIX, JACOBS LADDER, THE SIXTH SENSE, FIGHT CLUB and one other that I shall sensibly refrain from nominating and yes, they are ALL here, but still the mystery remains!Tom Cruise as millionaire playboy David Aames who inherits 51% controlling interest in his father's publishing empire, is a lost soul. Trouble is, right now he doesn't realise HOW lost! That this is the performance of his career is without question - its the performance of ANYONE's career! Running the gamut of experiences, from smartass yuppie to emotionally decimated and disfigured Joe Blow, the film orbits his character as surely as the planets in our solar system. As his legal advisor, Kurt Russell gives HIS greatest performance too, aided as it is by a script of sheer genius. Cameron Diaz, playing his long-suffering and heartbroken lover of convenience Julie Gianni, turns in one awesomely vivid performance, one that can only end in tragedy - though DOES it? You can never assume that what you see was actually what you think you saw!As for Penelope Cruz, reprising her role as Sophia Serrano in OPEN YOUR EYES, she really is a cutie. The chemistry between her and Cruise is just so obvious and up there for all to see. It is easy to see what Cruise could see in HER that Nicole Kidman could never exude in three lifetimes... at least, I can see it!Like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the last quarter of an hour will either blow your mind or leave you cold, wondering ""Hmm what was all that about?"" Anyone NOT moved by the Gregory Peck/Bob Dylan revelations (this will make sense ONLY if you have seen this flick) should never have been watching this film in the first place, while the very last ten seconds of VANILLA SKY must wring and hang out to dry, whatever emotions the aware viewer has left, after this movie experience of a lifetime.Yeah, I liked it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"Great film, great soundtrack!","This film ticks all my boxes. It has great music, great acting, a beautiful twisted plot with highs, lows, and intrigue throughout. The first time I saw this film I watched it from mid-point and got drawn in. If a film can do this then you know it's a keeper.Not being a Tom cruise fan myself automatically makes me sceptical about films with him starring; however this film suits his acting style perfectly. In other words you love to hate him. The plot is clever and well thought out. You do have to pay attention through the film to make sure you stay on track. The love story is good and not over the top, and you feel real emotion throughout the film. Cameron Diaz also fits her character well and it's nice to see her play a straight role rather than a comedy. There are some high powered emotional scenes with language that will shock you but also draw you in.One of the reasons I love this film is the soundtrack. The music in any film can literally make or break it for me. This film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The music fills you with emotion and I found myself buying many of the tracks from the film after I watched it.The ending really shows how clever it is, leaving you with a satisfied warm feeling inside. All in all I highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
I knew people would like this.,"Vanilla Sky was crap. Occasionally it did threaten to be remotely interesting, but on each occasion it was soon brought to a shuddering halt.I detest braindead Hollywood action films, exploding cars, unnecessary sex or violence. Likewise, I enjoy a good thinking film open to interpretation. So reading these reviews I should of enjoyed this film. Wrong.It was awful. I had no problem following it or understanding the plot ""getting it"" as many have said. It was just painfully dull & went against everything that good cinema is about. Dreams are difficult to effectively insert into films at the best of times but it was done terribly here.Interpretations are all well & good, but I'd imagine no 2 people who even worked on this film would share a view exactly what went on. It asked some interesting questions & created some Matrix style ideas. Unfortunately, none of them were fully executed & you end up with more questions than answers.Maybe it was just the whole subject. This wasn't the film I set out to see nor had any idea it was a remake, but I get the feeling I won't enjoy the original, nor, heaven forbid, any future similar films.I gave it an hour & a half of solid concentration but then lost the will to live. I counted all 88 folds in the curtain, then double checked it, counted ceiling tiles and shattered my recored of 'amount of times I looked at a watch during 1 film'.

Cameron Crowe Please More Like This,"This is Cameron Crowe at his utmost. Why genius like this goes untapped; I will never know. This movie is worth watching just for the incredible filming of it.

A Perfect Sci-fi Romance Movie,"Vanilla Sky is a very good sci-fi psychological romance movie. At first sight it might seem boring and usual romantic melodrama. But when you watch by OPENING YOUR EYES, it will become interesting.

The makers could have avoided cringe at the beginning.

Tom Cruise at his best!,"People who say things like Tom Cruise cannot act, he's just a star, or people who outright discredit his acting abilities should see this movie at least once to get to know this man's range as an actor, which has always been downplayed as well as overshadowed by one, his superstardom and two, audience's (as well as critics' blatant ignorance).I have seen dozens of Cruise's films to date, and this is probably one of, if not the best, work of his so far. Cruise is absolutely incredible here, and so was the writing, which had me second-guessing till the end. I adored how the storyline constantly posed questions and raised doubts over the legitimacy of anything and everything transpiring onscreen.Moreover, I love how it kept me on my toes until the credits rolled. It is an excellent piece of screenwriting complemented by a competent set of performances, particularly from our lead character.P. S. Pen√©lope Cruz looked an absolute dream here (no pun intended)! I must explore more of her works.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
We can remember it for you wholesale (dvd),"This movie has flavor of this excellent story of my favorite writer, PKD, in the sense that we can't distinguish the reality from the imagination. We can also find the same idea to buy memories and have the tech support to come to help. In addition, the multiple ideal lover is a thematic very Dickien as well.This part gives breath to a movie that was rather a bit dull and dragging: the new Quasimodo life of a rich, egoist playboy is laughable: if the biggest challenge he has to face now is to go out and his biggest fear is that his lover would reject his disfigured, well, he knows nothing about life or love as well. As Penelope says, he really has to ""abre los oyos"".Maybe he deserves his fate after having ""stolen"" the friend of his best friend. But as i done that myself, i think that no red line is crossed because it's among friends not married couples. Moreover, loves needs courage and implies a connection that needs two people to exist, (except maybe in this movie).This fourth aspect of the movie, love, touched me a lot: This movie was simply the one that gets me into following Penelope's filmography: i remember to have just been struck by the trailer, with her cute accent, her smile, the slam of the door and the song. I always thought it was McCartney but i was surprised to learn that it's actually from his rival, Peter Gabriel and it's called ""Solsburry Hill"". For me, this ""electrical meeting"" ranks among the best scene of that kind in movies: the only other examples that come to my mind is ""Lost Highway"" with ""Magic Moment"" (that is a bit alike) or ""Bluest eyes of Texas"" in ""Boys don't cry"". Well, Penelope did such a great performance that she has added at least one more fan with this movie.Actually, I know that this movie is a remake of a Spanish film and as it stars luckily Penelope, i will meet you tomorrow after watching it !

Tom Cruise the Mysterious One,"Vanilla Sky is a unique and great movie. It makes you think and wonder what has really happened to the protagonist (David Aames), and whether the entire movie is based on his dreams, or not? Tom Cruise was terrific when he portrayed David Aames, a wealthy playboy who doesn't know how to keep his promises, especially when it comes to having sex with Julia whom he doesn't love. During his birthday party, David meets the lovely Sophia who captures his heart despite being his best friend's new girlfriend. He soon finds himself drawn to her and in love at the same time. But everything ends tragically for David when Julie takes him for drive in her car and attempts to kill him as a punishment for his disloyalty towards her. She dies in the accident that leaves him with a disfigured face and in a coma for three weeks. In my humble opinion, I think that David's dilemma, as well as his love affair with Sophia both change him emotionally as he tries to overcome all the errors that he made in his lifetime. Finally, Vanilla Sky is a combination of science-fiction, thriller, mystery and romance for those who like to understand movies from a different point of view.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The talented Mr. Crowe.,"Man oh man.  Leave it to Cameron Crowe.  Last year he directed the most whimsical film which was also one of the best movies ever made, (ALMOST FAMOUS).  Now he's directed one of the most thought provoking films ever made, which could also just as well be one of the best films this year, VANILLA SKY.  This is a film that will have you think about what you just saw and the more you take the film apart, the more meaning there is behind the film.  This isn't the same style of Cameron Crowe who directed the crowd pleasing, JERRY MAGUIRE.  This is more like the nightmare of Jerry Maguire. David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call ""the Seven Dwarfs.""  He is despised by the members as being another ""rich kid who got daddy's business"" which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.      When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was. VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller. The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise. Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture. I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees ""Porpoise Song (Theme From Head)"" being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century. Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults. VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.  VANILLA SKY also proves that Cameron Crowe doesn't have to do only romantic comedies to show that he's a brilliant filmmaker, he can do thrillers with a stroke of genius.  For those who like film with intelligence and wit, then don't miss VANILLA SKY, one of, if not the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Had to say something after so long,"I came to Vanilla Sky from the original Abre los Ojos that I chanced across late one night on UK TV. Since then I've never watched the original again (not for any reason other than I've just not got round to it) but have seen Vanilla Sky many times. It really is a bittersweet film evoking a range of emotions and leaves me full of both joy and sadness in equal measures at its end. It really is a film that rewards re-watching to see the many layers and to help understand why there are so many 'theories' about what's going on other than what you see on the screen before you. I've never understood the hate this film gets, other than it's a 'Tom Cruise' film and the negativity that seems to engender. and I've recommended it many times to friends.

A List of Over-Rated Opinions Elaborately Explained.,"I had high hopes for this film. Prior to watching, I had heard good things about it, and had also been informed, that there was a particularly clever and well-thought out twist awaiting the eager viewer at the end of the film. Sadly, for me, this was not so.Getting the criticism out of the way first, which'll provide me the opportunity to leave this review on a high note... Firstly, starting from the very beginning. I was quite disappointed with the opening. I watched this on Channel4, and stupidly, listening to the pre-film clip featuring a bunch of taxis in New York, I heard the presenter explain that next film is Vanilla Sky, which has one of the best opening sequences in any film. This got me on the edge of my seat, and why not? Television cannot be wrong right? (Apologies for the over-using the sarcasm) The opening sequence was good in what it was meant to be. But i was disappointed in it's choice of song. I'm an avid fan of Radiohead, and Everything In Its Right Place is one of my favourite songs, but for me, the song was unable to compliment the sequence, and the two juxtaposed each other. (However, in a sense, this can be viewed less as a criticism, and more as a praise, as the song itself is about juxtaposition.) Moving swiftly on, and away from the film's opening and going right into the deep end. (Metaphorically speaking, though it's not a particularly good one) The ending featured a twist (Which i shall not give away) which for one, appalled me. It went against everything i was ever taught in primary school. In basic learning! There are many other ways you could have ended the film, whilst retaining it's prominent themes. But this, did not, and i was appallingly disappointed.Now for the bit people love, as lovers of film hate reading criticism of films they like (Hell, do people ever give proper deserved ratings out of 10 any more?) There were positive parts to the film. For one, (Although i wasn't impressed with the choice in the opening scene) The soundtrack for this film is brilliant. Every song chosen (apart from the first one) are brilliant in complimenting the film, and matching to the vivid imagery displayed. I may not be tempted to buy the film, but i am very tempted to buy the soundtrack Another strong praise is actually Tom Cruise, who i take my hat off to, if i wore a hat, which i do, if you count a woolly winter hat as one, but i'm not wearing it now, so i shall only metaphorically take it off. Cruise, who is an actor i have little respect for, shines through in brilliant form in this film. He is supported by a very strong supporting cast of Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, who provide mystery within Cruise's character's life, which for me was poorly summed up. For the people who say Cruise cannot act, this is a prime example of how he 'can' act. Another thing i liked within this film, was a small subtle thing. The references to French New Wave. By law, i'm supposed to hate French New Wave, having been forced to study it in my Film Studies classes, but oddly, i like the films, and it was amusing to spot posters of famous films like Breathless within this film. Last point i shall make, as no doubt, anyone who has had the capacity to read this far is probably bored out of their skull, and is wishing they had strayed over to the message boards to find posts 'not-by-me' (Which sadly, won't work either, as i've been vividly expressing the parts i dislike about this film) The other thing i loved was Mis-En-Scene, which ties in with my last praise for the film. There were some beautiful shots within this film, and although i may not have liked the concept of the ending sequence, i certainly loved the look of it. The beautiful sky, with it's rich colours. It was simply just beautiful to look at.Too sum up my elaborately labelled points which hold absolutely no relevance to anything whatsoever. This film for me, despite having it's good points, is simply average. Yes, i may have loved some parts, but there are a thousand other films which i like for the same reasons, and more! For me, this film just could not live up to it's terrible conclusion, and what might be unfair to describe as, but i'll say it anyway, over-rated beginning. Certainly watch this film, I'm never one to say what you should watch and what you shouldn't. But it's not a film i'll be re-watching in a hurry.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A twist without a plot,"""Vanilla Sky"" is not an easy film to like, an art film disguised as an event film. I'd argue that a project like this is the sort of thing that SHOULD be what we consider an 'event,' because it's actually interesting. Whatever your opinion of this film is, it's worth a discussion.Being a star is about many things--recognizability, mystery, attraction, but probably most of all, trust.  That is, audiences feel 'safe' going to a Tom Cruise film--any Tom Cruise film. When will people ever learn? Consider three of Cruise's last four films, ""Magnolia,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" and now ""Vanilla Sky."" None of the trio are exactly audience pleasers (personally, I hated ""Mission: Impossible 2""). They're odd, intricate pieces featuring odd, intricate characters. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Sky"" comes wrapped in a nice package. The former: Stanley Kubrick's last film and another pairing of wife Nicole Kidman; the latter: Camerons Crowe and Diaz, plus the (arguably) rising Penelope Cruz. With this kind of star power, many filmgoers willingly enter ""Sky"" knowing next to nothing about what they're in for. They're usually the first ones to hurl their super-size buckets of popcorn at the screen in anguish halfway through.No popcorn became airborne at the screening I attended. There was, however, a couple near me who insisted on talking to each other through the entire second half of the movie. Normally this would annoy me a great deal. 'This better start making sense real fast,' the girl would say to her companion. He would try to explain what was going on perhaps not realizing we could hear every word of it. In this particular instance, I can't say I blame this girl, whoever she was. Personally, I've never asked myself 'what the heck is going on?' more in a film than I did during ""Vanilla Sky."" The only incentive to keep watching was Cruise, who gives one of his best performances. As for the story, all is revealed eventually, but it takes a major test of patience to get there.This is the point for me where having seen Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"" would have been helpful, but I'll do my best. Having seen his really, really great film ""The Others,"" however, will do for now. It provides the example I need to illustrate my point. ""Others"" is recognizable as a ghost story and makes sense, whether you know what's REALLY going on or not. You understand the themes that are being presented. Depending on how observant you are, you may even be able to predict the ending before Amenabar pulls the rug out from under you.Based on Amanabar's own criteria, ""Vanilla Sky"" stinks. People watch movies to be entertained, to see a story, for two hours give or take. They don't go to have nonsense hurled at them for two hours and then have that nonsense explained to them for the last fifteen minutes in a bunch of exposition by talking heads. There's no rug to pull out because Crowe forgets to even put one under you. The only possibility of enjoying this would be on a second viewing. That should never be the case. Of course, next I'll actually see the film ""Sky"" is based on, which supposedly is all but a carbon copy of it, and I like it. No matter how similar the two films are, they are still two different films, made in different countries by different directors, with different actors (except Cruz).Wanting to make an avant-garde, thinking piece is noble, but Crowe, who had always been reliable, bricks this one.

Casting comments,"To anyone who says that Cruise was miscast in this role, I strongly disagree. It was his stereotypical and flashy good looks that made this role so right for him. It strengthens the story of a man who has a perfect life taken away from him. To see Cruise vulnerable and broken was refreshing, and i believe he portrayed this character very well....But to offer a different role that was miscast, Sophia. I don't see much beauty and attraction in Penelope Cruz, and at the risk of sounding shallow, if you are going to make a story about a man who is driven by infatuation of a women to , ultimately, his death..make the chick hot...some may disagree with that but that's how i saw it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller","VANILLA SKY, in my opinion, is a thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller. I thought that Sofia (Pen√©lope Cruz) and Julie (Cameron Diaz) were both very beautiful women... especially in the fancy dresses they wore at David's (Tom Cruise) party. As a matter of fact, all of the costumes were very well-designed. Also, after David's face had been disfigured, it was very hard to tell what was real and what was fake. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Everyone involved in this film deserves a Golden Globe."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, or Cameron Diaz, I highly recommend this thrilling, romantic, and heart-warming romantic thriller, that is, if you haven't seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Glimpse of Insanity -- 8 (Very good),"I was surprised by Last Samurai, hugely disappointed by Collateral, but was still in the video stores looking for more Tom Cruise. What's wrong with me? Have I turned into a fanatical Tom Cruise stalker in the past few months? Well, the last time I checked I have yet to start dotting my I's with hearts, so I should be in the clear. No, rather I think that since the days of Cocktail and Days of Thunder, Tom Cruise has chosen better and better work for himself with each project he commits to. Ever since Magnolia my respect for this internationally renowned mega-star has consistently increased movie by movie, although the overall quality of the movie sans Cruise still remains a crap-shoot. Take, for example, the OPEN YOUR EYES Americanized remake, VANILLA SKY.I started watching VANILLA SKY with my girlfriend, and about thirty minutes into the movie I started looking at my watch wishing it to be over. The Cruise, Cruz, Diaz, Lee love quadrangle starts of ordinary as hell, and I was mumbling to myself, oh great, another plastic family feud flick. Why didn't I just watch Friends instead, saving myself from this boredom.At the thirty minute mark, Cameron Diaz snaps like a flaky twig and drives Cruise and herself off a bridge. In sixty seconds the Friends-fest turns into a psychotic nightmare, and from there on out, VANILLA SKY runs its course as deranged as a Cronenberg film to the end in this grotesquely beautiful film.Anyone who's ever felt confined knows what it's like to hear things that aren't there, to believe in conspiracies, and to have waking life haunted by self-generated fiction. Cruise starts to lose his mind, no longer sure whether Cruz is Diaz or whether Cruise ever knew Cruz to begin with. VANILLA SKY portrays the insanity with simple and editing, paying homage to Bergman's Persona. My girlfriend and I took a cigarette break two-thirds into the movie, and she admitted that she was beginning to feel a little crazy herself. It's okay, don't worry. Sometimes these movies get to you.I've been trying to figure out why it isn't as popular as other Cruise movies, and I'm beginning to think that Cameron Crowe probably intended to fool the movie-going public around the world. Please imagine with me the following scenario. Nothing sexy is playing over the weekend, so you bring your family to VANILLA SKY since it has Cameron Diaz and since it might be like the Mask that your family loved so much. After going through psychotic hell and back, you storm out of the theaters saying, honestly, I don't know what's happening to America these days, but I'm going to write the mayor about this god forsaken vanilla trash. It's those crazy communist bastards in Hollywood destroying this country, you know. Our taxes used to go to decent, American Tom Cruise movies that make you feel good and sure of yourself. Now all you got is What, honey? Crazy? No, I'm not crazy, you're the one with the hippie parents! C'Mon kids, get into the freaking car! I'm cold.I can't comment on OPEN YOUR EYES since I haven't seen it.You know, the next Cruise movie should be a martial arts flick with Keanu Reeves Hong Kong style. I think that would be cool.I cannot remember which girlfriend.JYJimboduck-dot-com",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This is the second worst film I have ever seen.,"'Vanilla Sky' is awful.  It is the second worst film that I have ever had the misfortune of viewing.  'Mulholland Dr.' is the absolute worst, but I don't know, it comes pretty close.It is so weird how I dislike this film, yet I love Cameron Crowe's previous film, 'Almost Famous' so much.  'Almost Famous' is one of my favorite films of all time.  So, what was Crowe's problem here?  I have no idea, but his direction of this project is so bad that it's a wonder if he finds work after this.Tom Cruise, what were you thinking?  Oh, I just adore Cruise, but it really hurts that he would go out and pick this dud when he could have had the pick of ANY film in the world.  I think that he is a terrific actor, and his looks don't hurt, of course, but his acting was so....dull in 'Vanilla Sky.' For some unknown reason, he managed to get well over $20 million here, but for what exactly?  Cameron Diaz was just okay.  I don't understand how she got the kind of (rave) reviews she got.  How did she get a Golden Globe nomination?  Everyone acts as if she was the main character in this film, when really she didn't even have that big of a part.  Seriously, her performance was overrated, overrated, overrated!  Pen√©lope Cruz.  What can I say except that she is the worst actress ever.  Well, I suppose if you're out to capture a terrible movie, you better go out and hire the worst actress in the industry.  Not only is she hard to understand her with the darn accent and all, but....she can't act!  It's as plain and simple as that.  She acts as if she's the best thing in the picture.  I hate to use this saying because even I hate it, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Oh, I like Jason Lee.  It's a shame that he had such a small part.  Kurt Russell must have been in dire need of work when he signed on to do this film.  This cast is one of the most terrible ones that I have ever seen.  Again, why'd you do it Tom!?This plot is so out there.  It is way too out there.  The film was all fine and everything up until the car accident.  After that, it was complete chaos and confusion.  'Vanilla Sky' continued on and it seemed okay, I suppose, but then when the whole thing is explained and 'cleared up', it just gets messed up again (if that makes any sense).The writing was BORING!  I couldn't even follow half of the script mainly because I didn't want to.  The whole film just seemed so pointless.There were two things in this film that I actually did like.  One, Jason Lee manages to show up.  I loved him in 'Almost Famous' and it was a pleasure to see him again, no matter how minor his role was.  Two, I really liked the famous Times Square scene.  It was different and very cool.  Come on, what other film could have pulled that stunt off?There's nothing worse than a movie that ends too quickly, leaving a lot to the imagination.  And that's exactly what 'Vanilla Sky' did.  It ended at the drop of a hat and I was actually left staring at the TV screen wondering if something else would pop back up.  You know, to clarify some things. Yeah, it didn't.So, the script was meant to...well, I don't really know what it was meant to do.  Maybe its goal was to help people get a good night's rest.  I don't know!  Tom Cruise is a good actor but fails to deliver an even half decent performance.  Two other good things slip onto the screen, but Pen√©lope Cruz and that retarded mask that Cruise wears for most of the film, manage to completely ruin the film all together.  'Vanilla Sky' gets a big old '1' out of me.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Devastating un many ways,"Even though I'm aware that the original ""Abre los ojos"" is regarded as the best version, the truth is that I couldn't connect with its characters as deep as i did with Vanilla Sky.

This movie is so full of crap, it actually makes me angry just thinking about it. Who knows what the hell it's meant to be about? Seems to me it was all about Tom Cruise wanting to star in a supposedly deep, quirky movie. But it's rubbish. And, quite annoyingly, everyone mumbles all the way through it.

Are you ready to give up vanilla sky?,"Hollywood remakes of good films from other countries are quite familiar. Reinterpretation of original paintings with their adaptation to American culture is often very worthy. In addition, there is a much higher chance that much more people will see the American version, because this is how the film industry develops. American films are the most popular on the planet. However, sometimes it is quite difficult to surpass the original paintings and convey the energy of the film as it is in the original picture.The Hollywood remake of the good film ""Open your Eyes"" by Alejandro Amenabar became one of the brightest representatives of a successful film, which, in my opinion, not only preserved the entire palette of colors of the original work, but also was able to competently multiply them, to focus on those places that improved the perception of the whole story and made the world of ""Vanilla Sky"" even more brighter. The work of director Cameron Crowe makes you follow the events with unprecedented tension.The picture introduces us to the energetic handsome David performed by Tom Cruise. He is doing quite well in life, he is the heir to a successful parent industry, is popular with girls, he has a best friend. A chance meeting turns his life upside down when he meets the modest and charming beauty Sofia, played by Penelope Cruz. Does it sound like the beginning of some romantic comedy? Take your time. This film will literally send you on an unexpected adventure in a matter of minutes, where with each new scene you will plunge into the complex world of the main character and the people around him.The story is so extraordinary that soon you catch yourself thinking that everything is not just like that, but the intricate interweaving of human destinies and the clash of heroes will make you try to understand until the very end what happened there, at the very beginning of the film, that the events went exactly this scenario.The world that Director Crowe gave us is literally filled with multifaceted references to cultural phenomena. Attentive viewers will begin to notice them even by the middle of the film, perhaps even frown, realizing that this or that frame, fact, music is supposedly known to him. But don't worry, by the end of the picture everything will begin to form into an understandable picture, which will make you smile slightly and probably with sadness when you put together everything that happened on the screen. I dare not reveal the details, you will see everything for yourself. The brighter your feelings will be.""Vanilla Sky"" has become a kind of quintessence of visual and audio series, which generate a certain melancholy when viewed. The fantastic and sometimes extraordinary presentation of the material makes you literally fall into the oppressive world of the main character David, which gets more and more bogged down in his problems. This is understandable. When you seem to have everything you want, and then you realize what true love is, you suddenly rethink your world. But when you lose all this, you really find yourself in some kind of prostration, because the world will not be the same anymore.The feeling in the final is difficult to convey. Heaviness and sadness, a feeling of hopelessness. The hero faces a choice, but, as for me, any of the options is somehow a loser. Any of the finals is somehow winning. It depends on who and how they treat him. ""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie with a capital letter. A gorgeous story, a bright world, great acting. Thanks to the high-quality production, visual and audio components, this work has become a very important event in the world of cinema. And I strongly advise you to see this movie.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
It's a wide mix of different genres.,"This criminally underrated gem got sour reviews because most viewers were expecting a typical romantic comedy with Tom Cruise and ended up getting something completely different. Instead of a story about a wealthy arrogant man who lost it all and has to learn humility, it shifts in a completely different direction ever so slowly. It's hard to follow and its numerous twists will hit you like a bullet, but the volatility of this movie makes it a complete joy.Vanilla Sky is one of the most ambitious mix of genres you could possibly imagine: romance, drama, thriller, mind-bender, sci-fi and others. It's colorful, beautiful, a little disturbing and above all, it's deeply fascinating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky -- AWFUL!,"I was very disappointed with Vanilla Sky -- especially since one of my favorite actors (Tom Cruise) was starring in it.

Another great Crowe film definitely worth catching in the theatre...,"Cameron Crowe has delivered us another amazing film. This is very close to being his best one yet. With incredible performances from Tom Cruise and Kurt Russell and solid support from Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee, the casting couldn't have been better. You can also almost see the true-life romance unfold between Cruise and co-star Penelope Cruz. Actually an adaptation of the 1997 Spanish film ""Abre los Ojos"", this ""Americanized"" version is even more interesting in the original. Tom Cruise is surprisingly believable as a disfigured man who has trouble deciphering what is or is not real. The film takes the viewer on a roller coaster ride that never really slows down in its 2 1/2 hour run. It has moments that might be hard for many to follow and also leaves you to draw your own conclusions, which might drive some people crazy. It never really follows the structure of a standard ""multiplex"" film, which is also why it is so enjoyable and refreshing. Crowe has shown us how he can shine commercially with ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Say Anything"", but has really gone out on a limb with this one. Some might compare it to ""Magnolia"", which isn't such a bad thing, but it is a little confusing at times. The ending is also a little strange and will sit well with some and not others. Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, which works along with the film in a way the only a few others, like Paul Thomas Anderson, have done in the past. Some of the haunting and beautiful images are intensified by the importance of the music in the scene. This one is definitely worth checking out in the theatre if you're going to see it at all. For fans of Cameron Crowe, this will be well worth it for you. For everyone else, it is important to remember to keep an open mind when seeing this. The film is definitely well made; it's just not the typical flashy blockbuster Tom Cruise fans may have come to expect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Interesting premise... weak execution,"This film is at its heart a thriller. The question that nags at you from halfway through the movie is, ""What the heck is going on here?"" No, I didn't see the ending coming, so on that level it worked for me as a puzzlebox of a movie.Nonetheless, in my books a thriller has to have four things going for it before it rates:1. You can't see what's coming from a mile away. In this sense, Vanilla Sky was fine. I see that one or two people here had the ending pegged, but I sure didn't.2. Once you know how things end up, you should be kicking yourself because you ""should have figured it out."" Again, Vanilla Sky delivers: there are enough clues throughout the film (over and over and over) that I should have clued in. However, the clues seem unconnected to the story, so I took the bait didn't make the connection. Two good marks for Vanilla Sky.3. There should be a credible, interesting alternative explanation. Here I found the film a letdown. What's the alternative explanation? That he's going crackers? This didn't hold my interest long. As such, I found the film turned into a long series of weird events that I couldn't make sense of... until the end. Fun thrillers are fun when you think you have it figured out except for one or two nagging inconsistencies... and then you find out you've been led down the garden path. I spent a third of Vanilla Sky either not knowing what was going on or not caring, until I finally found out in the last ten minutes. Not very satisfying.4. You have to care about what happens to the characters. I think that this is Vanilla Sky's biggest failing. I must say up front that I've never seen a Tom Cruise movie before. I know: hard to believe; where have I been? Regardless, I found it hard to get interested in his character, because I couldn't figure out what he was feeling throughout the beginning of the film. I took away the impression that he has only five facial expressions: toothy smile, pouty look, angry frown (pouty look without lip extended), ""that look"" he gives the women that makes them swoon, and quizzical frown. This last one appears much of the time throughout Vanilla Sky, and it simply wasn't enough for me to connect to the character. As such, I had trouble caring about what was happening to him near the end. Tom Cruise spends part of this movie wearing a mask, and oddly enough I found him a better actor with it on: he displays more emotion with his voice and his body movements than with his face.Overall rating: Rent this one. There is nothing in it that requires the big screen and it isn't worth the big ticket entry price, unless you love Tom Cruise or, like my wife, you have vertigo and want to sit in the front row and have your stomach do flips during the New York flyover scenes.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I didn't *completely* hate it.,"First of all let me say I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe (the film's screenwriter/director).  I loved Say Anything, Singles, Almost Famous, and even Jerry Maguire and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  However, Vanilla Sky is so completely different from all of Crowe''s other movies that by the end it was just plain vanilla. My main complaints?  1) the script.  Bad dialogue, for one.  The script although not particularly stellar in the first half of the movie, waxed cheesy, sci-fi, and flat l towards the end, and elements of ""A.I."" and ""Memento"" (the latter of which I loved) took over in what many people, including me, were anticipating to be a much more traditional love story.  2) NO character development.  I particularly don't like new characters being introduced near the film's end, especially ones who offer a weak explanation of the movie's deep, profound, spiritual meaning.  Blech.  3) Length.  I frequently find exceptions to my personal rule that if a movie takes more than 2 hours to tell its story then it's way too long, but I was ready for this to be over about an hour before it ended. I did love certain scenes, including the beginning and ending sequences, the soundtrack was incredible, and certain shots make me want to go back and more closely examine the film.  for some movies, I would do this.  But I don't care about the characters at all, and found the movie to be grasping at straws seeking profundity, so at this point i don't care to waste my time and money again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Tom Cruise character is great, but he is a complete mess. Dealing with a large corporation and the evil they did to him made his character worse then what it had to be.

I was ready to give up on the movie 20 minutes in. Gave it a chance, and it was worth it.

I should have stayed in bed,"I was persuaded, against my wishes, to leave my comfy flat to go see this film.  I wish I had stayed in bed now.Not that this starts off as a bad film.

Ok, it's not THAT bad but I still feel like I should be compensated for sitting all the way through this soul-less exercise in vanity.Yes, the opening dream sequence is very good and eerie.  Yes Cameron Diaz is excellent as the bitter and consequently twisted Julie, even Penelope Cruz does the cute little girlie act rather well.  Tom Cruise does Tom Cruise and Jason Lee does his patented 'token best friend' gig.  But, silly me thought there might be a point to the film.  Maybe a comment on the futility of a playboy lifestyle, a reflection on the consequences of badly treating another person for your own selfish whims.  I thought the sheer eighties shallow Yuppiness of Tom Cruise's character would have some reason.

"Its 'mind-bending','confusing' reputation is overrated, and stated by movie and book neophytes","I waited until the DVD came out.  It was alright.  Don't understand the enormous reputation is amassed as being tricky, and how people were having discussions about what really happened.  They explain it in the end. Flat out.  Mid way, after the accident after he emerges, Cruz stays with his friend, he cant get over it, he'd rather die, and he decides to go into cryogenic dream sleep, but the computer system controlling his cryogenic dreams f**ks up, and the second half of the movie is a convoluted nightmare. What the hell is so confusing when you are done seeing the movie?  Who are these people confused? Stoners? Simpletons?  I then listened to the DVD commentary.  Crowe says it plays straight.  the second half was a dream, he wakes up in the end 150 years in the future.  It is another actress's voice that tells him to open his eyes.  Some random nurse awakening him.Yes offense meant.  This is not at all in league of Usual Suspects, or anything. I am not trashing it, but it has no meaning.  Its just a story that doesnt explain itself until the end. It doesn't discuss the merits / drawbacks of lucid dreaming vs living in reality.  That would be a 'deep movie'.

"Just because a movie is completely confusing, doens't make it intellectual.","Great acting, casting, cinematography, and directing.  Terribly unbelievable story which leaves you jaded in the end.  Still worth seeing though for the above inclusions.  Some poeple just assume because they're was a twist ending, then it was an intellectual movie.  The movie fails if you're not at least given subtle hints to the motivation of the characters.  I never was a big fan of things then ended in someone waking up from a dream.

It Was...OK,"This was not the worst film I have ever seen, although I would not recommend it to just anyone. At first I was distracted by the camera tricks the director used to make Cameron Diaz (who is at least 5'8"" tall) look similar in height to Tom Cruise, but once the story got going it didn't seem so prominent. Overall all of the actors did a good job with their roles. Penelope Cruz was not nearly as distracting as she is in other films I've seen her in. The writing wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst I've ever heard either. The most impressive part of the film was the cinematography - the visuals were colorful and very pretty.As far as the plot, other posters have commented that if you ""get"" the film you will really appreciate it. I ""got"" this film, but I am not satisfied with the story. I feel that the territory this film explores has been covered with greater success by any number of ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. For most of the film I was confused (and not in a good, David Lynch way) but once I understood what was going on the whole thing seemed pretty flat, all of the supposed twists and turns easily explained away. I gave this film 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Tom Cruses It,"Seen this film about 10 times. Love it everytime I put it on. Definitely Tom Cruse's most underrated film. Excellent acting from him.. its kinda beautiful, very dark and sad at the same time. A fantastic different story, a one off, I've never seen another film quite like this one. I really should give the book ago but like most people films are easy, books always seems like a no need. This film is in my top 20 it's a film I can put on when I'm flicking through Netflix or Amazon when I cant really find another film to watch.

David Lynch must be ashamed.,"Has one ever watched a movie, and found it to be totally unredeeming? I have, and this movie is called Vanilla Sky. I have never encountered a film that adds more and more unintelligble storyline, without solving anything.  There is no point.  What the viewer is left with, is some heavyhanded attempt( cyrogenics ) to unravel the gordian knot of story line.  What has the viewer learned; that David was having a lucid dream, and he became a murderous schizophrenic- or that he found true love through a programmed dream?  Why did the story need the cyrogenic twist?  Wasnt the belief it might be a dream, or a nightmare- good enough? How can so many talented people- put out such trash?",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Neverending nightmare,"Truly one of the worst films of all time. How did it happen? Too many egos at work and too many yes men. Cruise's love of twists goes into over-drive as does Crowe's over-indulgent use of music. Just when I thought the end was finally coming, there was another twist. And another. But I was beyond caring. In the end, I was wishing for Cameron Diaz (the only good thing in it) to drive the entire cast and crew over the bridge.

Matrix meets Fatal Attraction,"Very good thriller with very good production quality although the movie lacks originality and a better flow for it to be a classic.The last 20 minutes or so of the movie was too out of place although still thrilling.The genre just changed at those last scenes too drastically like watching Gene Kelly dancing in the rain one moment,then the next moment we see Gene dancing on planet Tatooine.Mind boggling and intriguing but a little on the cheating side.Great soundtrack and the directing was great.If you like suspense thrillers and are a fan of th lead actors,go see this one even if you know the ending......",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"It's just a copy... with the same main actress, the same plot....","Perhaps the movie is good for the people didn't watch the original movie, but come on, I've never say 'Oh my god, this is an excellent movie...' without seen the original if I know that. I mean this is a REMAKE from an Amenabar film called 'Abre los ojos' so it has no merit for the creators of Vanilla Sky. And Amenabar is not just a whore in the film industry. He writes, compose music (rememeber The Others) and do a hard working in every movie he makes so I think the merit of this great plot is for Amenabar. Well I know it probably sounds weird, but I personally think that Hollywood 'buy' the rights of some good foreign films and make them 'originals from Hollywood' but they really aren't because they don't have too much good ideas or they are exhausted... don't know.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Finally a different movie,"I wanted to watch a movie that was very deep, abstract, existential, and philosophical but I couldn't find any other movies that fits into my category other than Fight Club. But when I heard that Vanilla Sky has a lot of philosophical themes I was curious enough to watch it. I burrowed this movie from block buster and saw it and I have to say that I really liked the movie. I didn't exactly understand why there were a lot of negative reviews because I thought vanilla sky was 10 times better than any average Hollywood movies. However I understand that people are not very favorable of movies without a solid conclusion, but in favor of the movie I argue that most movies these days have solid conclusions and majority of those conclusions are very unoriginal, corny, and extremely ... ""Hollywood"". Vanilla Sky ends in a way that makes the audience guess or think what the main character chose: A real life or a life of dreams. Most movie-watchers have the tendency to watch movies that requires no philosophical inquiry and would rather watch movies that are usually simple and predictable. What I'm exactly arguing for is that Vanilla Sky is one of those few movies that are actually different in a positive sense. If one simply looks at the plot of Vanilla Sky then you can't exactly appreciate it because you're excluding the idea or the theme. The theme is hard to describe because unlike most movies it's not very tangible; It's hard to grasp it all at once, you actually have to see the movie to understand what I mean. Well I explained why I found the movie significant to me, but I'll also explain why I didn't give a perfect rating. For me personally the twist in the movie didn't seem entirely realistic, it was rather some-what out of place. However the twist was necessary to convey the theme but such ""necessary evil"" has partially ruined the movie. This is probably why most reviewers disliked it, which I could understand, but as I said before the twist seemed necessary to convey the theme. A similar movie called Forgotten was even worse, the way the twist worked made it worse than the plot-twist in vanilla sky. In Vanilla sky they had a plot-twist that seemed more possible, in Forgotten the twist is a mixture of possibility and impossibility. The twist was more like one of those UFO conspiracy theories you hear now and then, which I found to be very corny. So basically yes you'll find a ridiculous plot twist in Vanilla Sky but it isn't as bad as the plot twist in other movies, Vanilla Sky uses a plot twist that is necessary to convey it's theme and I don't know any other better ways to convey the theme. It's not the best way, I admit, but what counts is that it works. Well In conclusion I have to say that I enjoyed Vanilla Sky and I enjoyed the humor and romance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Simply amazing,"I went into the movie expecting a drama/romance. Instead I got an incredibly deep psychological thriller/drama with one of the coolest twists and the best ending ever. Well, maybe not the best, but it was REALLY good. The acting is great, on everyone's part. Cruise is great, Diaz is good in her little part, and Cruz does a great job or portraying a ""true lover"". I'm still in awe of the quality of the movie. It will make you feel happy and then sad, jump for joy or just cry tears of happiness. Be warned, the movie is not for children. Lots of language and a pretty intense and disturbing scene near the end. But still, go watch it now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"They should have called this ""Vanilla Pudding""","They should have called this ""Vanilla Pudding"" for all the sense it made to the poor souls who sat through this.

For those of you who dote on Cruise, remember that he's a ""movie star"" and not an ""actor"" so watching him just eat up the scenery is a painful experience...even on fast forward.

Fascinating film with so many layers,"Maybe I am just easily influenced, but I can't get this haunting film out of my mind.  I found it a mind-blowing experience.

Memorable dialogue and music.  After watching the film, I felt like running out to buy the soundtrack!  Peter Gabriel's Solsbury Hill never sounded so good and even The Beach Boys Good Vibrations took on a new lease of life.All the leads are excellent, but Tom Cruise gives a tour de force performance. I became completely caught up in his anguish and confusion.Watch out for the Times Square sequence at the beginning of the film.  It was an unnerving experience for both Tom Cruise and myself and gave a good foretaste of the suspense and mystery to follow.I have watched the film three times so far, and am still finding new things in it.

Battlefield Vanilla?,"First, I'm a huge fan of Cameron Crowe's movies and thought that the retrospective ""Almost Famous"" was just a sign for even better things to come.I was wrong.Vanilla Sky is a perfect example of just how desperate Hollywood is for a suitable movie script. Unfortunately, they are using an ultra-talented film maker to display this dreck of a script.Cameron Crowe, if you are reading this, get back to the golden path you jumped off of too quickly. Get back to the characters that were enjoyable to watch, observe and like.Don't get me wrong, the acting was phenominal, but what was lacking was the COMMON SENSE to avoid listening to Tom Cruise's beliefs of Scientology being evoked in the script. It smacked of the John Travolta/Stinker of the Year-Battlefield Earth which tried to do the same and wasted a great cast while doing it.Yes, the main character needed to be ""cleansed"" of all of the nasty money and beautiful women that were ruining his life, and start anew. I felt like the entire movie was a audit of the main characters life. The only thing missing was two cans attached to E-meter for the audience to hold on to.I'm going to go now and plug in Citizen Kane into the DVD. Now that is a movie, and hopefully it will make me forget of the nine hard earned dollars I just wasted.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Wonderful,This is so sad and so hard to watch. It shows us what a HUGE role vanity plays in our life. God some of the scenes are so hard to watch. They feel so real. You can Feel David's pain. Its perfect. I think the scenes when he is alone in his apartment are the best. You can just see the paon and humility and Rejection he feels. He cant even function in society. The people are just SO rude to him because of his looks? Its pathetic how much weight we put on the way someone looks. It leaves me always feeling as if I've just had a catharsis. Life is so fragile and short and it just makes you question what really matters. I think the imagery Crowe uses is amazing. The scenes in the park at fall? The music fits every scene perfectly.

You are not alone.,"""How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory. And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity? What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream? Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality. It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz."" (Courtesy of ""jhclues"". Salem, Oregon.)Above commentary excerpt were quoted from an IMDB user. As it somehow offered a better description of 'Vanilla Sky' than anything I could capably come up with, I decided to preface it to my very personal thoughts on a movie which has catapulted itself to be my all-time favourite film.I was overwhelmed with an inexplicable epiphany as I followed the journey of David Aames. With each passing scene, it became alarmingly clear to me that someone out there had an uncanny empathy and intuitive understanding of a particular state of mind. A state of mind that might be momentarily experienced by us all at some points of our life. But that it cut right through me. For, with tears and fears, I have been experiencing what David Aames experienced, for the past twelve years.....No. I am not a deranged schizonerd delighting in psycho babble(thank you very much). But I knew there and then that I am not alone in my 'struggles' and I do not need to be afraid anymore. That somehow, in the process of watching this life affirming film, 'David Aames' has reached out to all the 'Davids' of the world(and you will know who you are).Through it, we are offered an alternative. That is, to take comfort in our experiences and to know that we are free to decide ""whether our glass is half empty or half full?"" And with that realisation, I achieved closure. I was vindicated. And I hope you too will find your way.I do not expect most people to understand what I am trying to say so far, as this personal piece is written with an expressed intention not to reveal vital plot revelation within this mind bending yet spiritually relevant film.But for those who have seen 'Vanilla Sky', if you are experiencing(in whatever doses) what David Aames experienced, do not fear this unknown realm of mindscapes for it is an opportunity for you to free your mind. Take control and despair not. For you are not alone.If you are willing, open your eyes.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I wanna go there when I travel to New York, like doing a ""Vanilla Sky Tour"". In DVD version Cameron Crowe comments the movie.

this is irritating....,"Vanilla Sky is a very irritating film. You know sometimes you see a film that is so bad that you become embarrassed to watch, because you know that your smarter, better self is dissapointed in what your doing? This is the kind of film.Tom Cruise, well, after seeing him reinvent himself and go for interesting roles (Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia), he has now gone back to formula, playing shallow yuppie, spoiled upper class, Hollywood bird magnet brat (himself?) and obviously this is the intention, no fault of the 'Cruiser', its Cameron Crowes' (writer/ director) for having such a bland view on relationships and the even more irritating Penolope Cruz, whom you want to place faeces on her head and smack more than you'd like to make love to.The love affair between the two, the 'chemistry', is like a really, really disturbing horror film, that can take a while for the after effects to heal and natural, healthy sleep to reinhabit itself and overcome the trauma. It is so unremmitingly shallow (like episode of Freinds' without the canned laughter) and makes a shambles of superior (I'm talking 'God Like' proportions) remake Open Your Eyes that approached its themes with more depth and panache (don't they always).For 'cake and wine' fanatics and fans of the 'pyjama with popcorn party' only, and for them they are bound to say, 'wow, wasn't that deep? good but a bit weird at the end, don't you think? but what does it all mean? did he really do this?' e.t.c.

It is a pseudo art film, so disjointed, it is barely coherent. As for the idea of the film...interesting to a point-but remember that is only an idea.  An idea should not carry an entire film-thus I can spew out words such as: gimmicky and pretentious. As for the pop culture references, does the word subtly mean anything? What was the point Cameron Crowe was trying to make?  That we live in a world over run by products, or products over rule us or products over rule our main character.  That nonsense was completely extraneous to the barely visible story. As for the ending...OH MY GOD!!!  Here's an idea: lets make a film that is incomprehensible and pass it off as a thinking film.  Nothing in this film has to though about-it doesn't cohere to anything.  The ending sums up the entire barrage of sequences that make up 3/4 of the film.  So what is there to think about?

The subconscious mind is a terrible thing to waste...,"An elongated, overproduced ""Twilight Zone"" episode, written and directed by Cameron Crowe, starring Tom Cruise as a magazine publishing mogul in New York City who is having a hard time distinguishing reality from his dreams; soon, he finds himself imprisoned, masked, and talking to a doctor about a murder he has apparently committed. Proving that the greatest asset a film can have is a strong screenplay, ""Vanilla Sky"" is a series of half-hearted whims and self-indulgent larks. The shards of reality and non-reality, interpolated in rapid succession, aren't so much truthful glimpses into our hero's psyche as they are Crowe's cocky idea of a mind-screw. Americanizing the 1997 Spanish-language film ""Abre Los Ojos"", Crowe is like a jovial rich kid messing with the switches until his film becomes the equivalent of a joy-buzzer. It's both a curious paean to popular culture and the (would-be) ultimate brain-gasm.

Something to make you think,"This is probably one of the most underrated films I've ever come across and I never know why.It's without doubt one of the best performances tom cruise has ever done in a film, and the supporting cast (Cameron Diaz, Jason Lee etc) only add to the emotional impact of this film.The first time I saw it was on TV, and at first, I wasn't that impressed. But then, I took the time to watch it and found myself absorbed in a brilliant story that you cared about in so many ways. When a film feels as personal as this, when you feel like it belongs to because of how you see it, thats when you get great movies.And that's what vanilla sky does, it leaves an impression that doesn't go away. And that's why I like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Snoozerama,I took about seven attempts on DVD to watch this pretentious load of tripe!This movie is all style and no substance. It is a mad rollercoaster ride of image and boredom. The whole thing baffled me even after the director's explanation on The DVD and I would say I am fairly intelligent.It is only worth watching for the babetastic Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz and also for the great soundtrack,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky is nothing more than a copy,"This movie is nothing more than a copy of a great Spanish movie called ""Open Your Eyes"". Even film angles are the same and all the characters look exact same. Only difference is that credits goes to Hollowood instead of the ones they should belong to. Movie also takes place in New York, what is totally irrelevant to the plot or to the message of the film.It is obvious that this movie was built only in purpose of money making, because there are no new scenes or anything that is different to the original picture. This movie is only a little bit shorter and the ending is more naive than it should be.My opinion is that this movie should not have ever seen the daylight and I wish people would watch the original instead of this one!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Ahh, Look at all the lovely people","Greetings again from the darkness.  OK so we had to wait 11 and a half months for the interesting movies of 2001. I saw ""Vanilla Sky"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" over a 4 day span and sit here truly satisfied in my movie going for the first time in more than a year.  At times, ""Vanilla Sky"" feels like you are on the runway at a super model convention, but the beauty of the actors does not take away from the tangled web that the screenplay weaves.  I was enthralled by the twists and turns of this wild ride.  Some twists were easier to spot than others, but the recent wave of ""Sixth Sense"" wannabe's are put to shame by Cameron Crowe.  Not being a huge fan of Cruise, Cruz or Diaz, it took a remarkable story line to keep me there.  Some nice support work from many, especially Kurt Russell, who looks solidly middle aged for the first time on the big screen.  Cameron Crowe is now a top draw for me.  If he is involved, I am headed to the theatre. He knows a good story and is amazing in his ability to create believable scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
makes me want to jump off something.,"Ok Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, hmm what can I say to be fair.  Ok the soundtrack was weird the plotline was interesting the screen play was jumpy. The only way this movie could be better seriously is if David Hasselhoff played the lead.  Then when one goes in thinks the movie is trash they don't walk away disappointed.

The Iceman Cometh,"The less read about this vanity project, before you watch it, the better (provided you haven't seen the original, acknowledged to be superior 1997 ""Abre los ojos"" aka ""Open Your Eyes""). The main problem is that young, handsome, and wealthy Tom Cruise (as David Aames)'s ""David"" is neither likable nor engagingly unlikable. Mr. Cruise has good taste in women, like precious Pen√©lope Cruz (as Sofia) and jealous Cameron Diaz (as Julie Gianni); but, the movie isn't very sexy. Ms. Cruz played the same role in the original, sexier film (with Eduardo Noriega). Ms. Diaz and Jason Lee (as Brian Shelby) are most enjoyable, in supporting roles. Cinematographer John Toll is also outstanding. Cruise and director Cameron Crowe have excellent taste in music; they take an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach to the soundtrack by sampling The Beatles' obscure ""Revolution 9"", without the screaming Yoko. It's a ""Revolution of the mind"".***** Vanilla Sky (2001) Cameron Crowe ~ Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Cameron Diaz",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A personal favorite despite its flaws,"You could say this movie has many weaknesses such as some corny dialogues, clich√©s and perhaps too much focus on the narcissist main character, but it's full of emotions and explores very well the world of dreams. It has so many subliminal messages and cultural references that it creates a very rich world that it's easy to connect to. All the performances are great. I've seen the original Spanish film by Alejandro Amen√°bar and I love it, too, despite they both share similar flaws, but I feel the much smaller budget somehow limited the potential of the story and especially its design. The scene of ""Vanilla Sky"" in Times Square is really powerful and unique. Setting it in New York during autumn and winter along all the art design makes for many beautiful scenes. It also has probably one of the best soundtracks: Radiohead, R. E. M., The Beach Boys, Peter Gabriel, Jeff Buckley, Sigur R√≥s and more, but I agree the music doesn't always work in every scene and sometimes it doesn't even have the right treatment. It's true that everything can be justified in this world of dreams, anything is possible, but when the movie tries so hard to solve itself and follow a story it loses many of its subtleties. It mixes genres badly, goes from drama to thriller with a lot of madness and begins explaining too much. This is where most of the secondary characters fall apart like figments of the protagonist's imagination, and it's true that's probably the only way it could be since he didn't get to know them much in real life, even his best friend, but maybe they could have come out stronger as representations of other people in his life and he could have dealt with older traumas or experiences, not just a constant loop of his last days alive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A mind warping experience,"Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, `Abre los ojos' (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience. Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  However, for the majority the response will be, `Huh?'  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.  If you think you can figure it out, you're dreaming.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
One of the finest movies ever made that  few know about,"If you are disenchanted with the movie industry these days for the lack of quality, you are not alone. If you want to see a relatively new movie that delivers on many levels, Vanilla Sky is a leading candidate. I will spare the details of the plot, but will give you a primer on how to appreciate this fine work of art to enhance your movie-watching experience.To begin, the allusion to impressionistic art is not a coincidence. The art of impressionism embodies a whole set of socio-historical ideas that add depth to the movie. The beautiful ""Monet-like"" skies represents a disillusion with realism and an erasure of memory, evident in the visual display of distortion and haziness in many impressionist paintings. The scene in which these impressionistic skies appear reveal the emotional torment of the past as well as the desire to distort or rewrite it. This makes the main character's initial starting point as a wealthy playboy instead of a pauper essential in framing the movie's plot twist.In addition to its crafty and artistic themes, the movie has a strong soundtrack that is both enjoyable and fun, but very appropriate for the scenes. Despite the lack of dynamic characters in this movie, with the main character being the only one although he too is rather static, the movie delivers a revelation that can only be appreciated with more than one viewing. It is through this second or third viewing that you pinpoint the scenes in which the main character has revelations about the nature of his reality and realizes whether or not he is dreaming. Through these scenes do you see his transformation. Simultaneously, through these scenes do you as the audience vicariously experience this change.This movie is not about character development, it is about audience awareness of reality and fantasy. Will you be able to tell if a painting is impressionistic or a realistic landscape painting from afar? Probably not. Will you be able to discern a real scene from a dream in this movie without well-marked cues? It's unlikely. It is through careful analysis will one be able to determine the true nature of the scene, real or fantasy, and the depth of the audience's understanding alone will add depth (and appreciation) to this masterpiece. These visual cues will be revealed within the movie, but you will realize that your ability to distinguish between what's real and what's not is the driving force of the movie apart from the beautiful imagery and iconography.The Great Gatsby was not considered to be a ""Great American Novel"" immediately after its release. It took a decade for the novel to be rediscovered and then catapulted into its deserving place today as an icon of American literature. I make no qualms about my desire to have this movie also be catapulted into its place among the greatest movies of all time as well. In the midst of the terribly banal climate of movies today, I hope my post will motivate some more attention for this great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A great psychological movie.,"This was a thoroughly enjoying movie. I can understand how some people did not like this movie, probably the actors or that it is a real thinking movie with some twists that you have to pay attention to. This movie is a mix between a mystery, adventure and a romantic comedy and just a good all around story. The Tom Cruise character is a man that have everything anyone could ever want and more, he ends up loosing it and then gets a second chance with a catch. In the end facing all his demons and the full scope of all that is happening around him forces him to choose simplicity and reality. So that finally he can find the one thing he could never really get and thats happiness. As far as story lines go Tom basically inherits his dads company and has a 51% stake in the company. Since the board does not think he deserves the company he is constantly ad odds with them and himself living a meaningless life with a shallow Cameron Diaz. At his birthday party he meets Penelope Cruz who he instantly falls for. The morning after the part he ends up making a decision that will change his life forever and he soon finds out there is no going back. Tom Cruise does a fabulous job in this movie showing that he does have some range and seems that he has possibly been type-casted and should be given a more variety of roles after this. Penelope Cruz does a outstanding job playing the object of Toms affection. She brings a alluring innocence to the role that complements her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible, yet lacking any sense of mystery. Cameron Crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors and does a great job with Cruz. Cameron Diaz looks better then ever sizzles on screen. Make no mistake she delivers a complete package performance with her character. Her performance can be measured by having just a limited time on screen still leaves unforgettable performance. Half way through the movie really starts to question your sense of existence, but by the end all will be revealed. It is definitely wild, reality bending entertaining experience.

the lighting and the image made the movie perfect,"O.k, so it was probably not the best movie in the world. But it was that kind of movie with good looking people or people aspiring to good looks that I would like. Basically, I'm not here to praise nor to criticize. ""Vanilla Sky"" is a good movie within reason, it's romance with a twist and going to another point and direction towards the end. What sets it apart is the image. If it cost a lot of money, most of it must have went to the lights department. The guys are amazing. They use the perfect mix of shadows and contrasts and I've rarely seen movies with such photography. Some of the scenes are poetry in motion, others are playing with different surfaces, from leaves to mirrors. The scenes shot at night time have walls reflecting light polls and the bed scenes take good care at playing with the sun and making the faces seem sweet and peaceful. There is a lot of communicating through lights in the movie. The pictures and the rest of the art used as crops are also well chosen. Going right back to the lights, I'd say I've rarely seen such care for every little detail. It really adds a lot to the human side of perceiving the movie as a whole and at the same time, it doesn't take the spotlight.I mean, it enhances the movie's beauty but it doesn't catch all the attention for itself. Really, if you get to watch the movie, pay a closer look to the details and you will see what I am talking about.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Jerry Maguire's Life Extension,"This was a silly remake of Amenabar's brilliant masterpiece ""Abre Los Ojos"", complete with all the cocky, clich√© ""Sho Me da Money""-type lines so famous in Jerry Maguire. I have nothing against Jerry Maguire (it's a great movie) but this remake is so overproduced, it could only be American. Even Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee's performances were....well, silly.Admittedly, the story paralleled the original. However, as with everything else done in America, it had to be done in a $$$Grande$$$$ fashion and in doing so it lost a lot from the Spanish version to the American version.My advice, watch the original to see a truly good movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Tom Cruise like we don't see him enough,"I'm always on the lookout for the not so average movie. I don't mean things like horror movies with so much gore and blood that it makes it almost impossible to watch, I mean movies that try to be original and which don't seem like you've seen them already 25 times before, even though it's the first time you've seen this movie. Well, Vanilla Sky is such a movie.David Aames (Tom Cruise) is a very popular magazine publisher from New York City. He takes everything for granted: his wealth, his publishing company, his good looks, and most of all his relationships. He's a playboy who spends a passionate night with Julie (Cameron Diaz), ""a friend he sometimes sleeps with,"" and a night with Sofia (Pen√©lope Cruz), a beautiful and smart dancer with a Spanish accent. But than he gets all kinds of strange dreams which may reveal something very important about him, something he never knew...Of course this isn't exactly the easiest of all movies and yes it is quite surprising. Surprising, not only because you get to see Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise in a role you wouldn't exactly expect from them, but also because of the ending. People who prefer easier movies probably don't like this one, but people who are used to watch alternative and European movies, will almost certainly love it.I guess that the main problem which this movie may encounter is the fact that it is a remake of a Spanish movie and only therefore will not be liked by many people on this site. This movie was based on ""Abre Los Ojos"" (or ""Open your Eyes"" in English). Personally I don't really care about the fact if this is a remake or not, but I know that many people do. I guess that's why it doesn't get a very high score, which is too bad really. Personally I give it at least a 7.5/10 perhaps even an 8/10.

"Ponderous, pretentious failure","Tom Cruise is very good, as are several of the other actors (Russell, Diaz, Cruz), but Cameron Crowe fails to create any sense of excitement.  The pacing is extremely slow, with long pauses between lines of dialog, and slow pacing of movement and action within the scenes.  Also, the story shuttles back and forth between what may be dream and what may be reality so often that after a while, the audience simply ceases to care whether what they're watching is ""real"" or not.The idea is hardly original.  Yes, this is a remake, but the basic ideas of the story go back to 1940s pulp magazines, where they were usually developed in a more compelling and exciting fashion.Crowe wanted to call the far superior ""Almost Famous"" ""Vanilla Sky,"" which indicates just how meaningless the title is.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Vanilla Sky: 8/10,"Vanilla Sky takes you on a ride that may look like other mind-benders like Mulholland Drive and Solaris, but this one tries to give you answers. The beginning may be slow, but soon you'll be on the ride of your life.Tom Cruise is David Aames, multimillionaire playboy. He inherited three magazines from his late father, and lives the high life. He's friends with Brian (Jason Lee) and keeps up a strictly play relationship with Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz). Soon, however, Brian introduces Sofia (Penelope Cruz) to David, and Julie's upset, so what's to do? Drive off a bridge and kill herself, while just injuring David. His life, however, becomes a mix of reality and imagination, between dreams and actual happenings.If you want a light, easygoing, crowd pleasing flick that gives you all the answers and wraps the ending in a nice little package with a bow and express ships it to your heart, don't look here. If, however, you want an intellectual film that's both straightforward and confusing, this is a good movie. From swift camera movements to perfect modern music, this movie has it all.Tom Cruise (who, when in his mask and for a lot of the film, reminded me of Kevin Bacon in Hollow Man) did a good job of being a cocky millionaire who gets everything. Of course, to do that, he doesn't have to act much. Cruz, who starred in the original Abre Los Ojos, which this is a remake of, also worked well and had chemistry with Cruise. Diaz, although her part was small, did the best she could do, which was a lot. Kurt Russell, who plays a shrink, did a great job, too, but I wish he was billed before Diaz, because he had more screen time.I really wish I had more to say about Vanilla Sky, but there isn't. I found myself liking this experience more each minute. It did start off slowly, but soon gained pace. I do wish, however, that I could more easily tell between David's dreams and reality. Besides that, it was a very good movie.My rating: 8/10Rated R for sexuality and strong language.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Cruise still has to grow up.,"I think that Tom Cruise still makes (Produces) movies for teenagers. He still doesn't know how to do films for people who have lived enough.He should try not to think too much and leave the script and ideas to others.The changes from Abre Los Ojos in Vanilla Sky seems to be made by a teenager playing to be a director. It looks like somebody who hasn't live a real life and is always living in a movie. A person who can not stop and live the life.Abre los ojos is a better film because is more credible, it's more real and logical than Vanilla Sky. Although Vanilla Sky maybe is a better piece of entertainment for people as much younger better.Tom, you don't have to think too much. Relax. Be happy.

A very dull movie...,"I thought this was a terrible movie. Clunky script, actors bouncing performances off of each other, sloooow pacing and the obligatory `twist' at the end (for those that last that long). By the time the `explanation' came around I'd long since given up caring about ANY of the characters and whether they were real, unreal, alive, dead, dreaming, conscious or unconscious.Crowe's too workmanlike a director to be able to invest the movie with any sense of the strange or the surreal. The characters exist in separate vacuums, talking TO each other but failing to connect. Penelope Cruz's performance is a big disappointment. In exactly the same way that Renee Zellweger's `cute' mannerisms eventually grate in `Jerry Maguire', so too do Cruz's `winsome' tics grate here.Crowe also indulges himself again regarding pop songs on the soundtrack. He's starting to use them to do the work that the script, camera and actors should. The scene with ""Good Vibrations"" is a case in point, the song completely undercuts what is happening up there on the screen.If you looking for a movie that REALLY provokes, that truly deals with the nature of whether what you're seeing is real or not, then go see ""Memento"" and/or ""Mulholland Drive"".",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Crowe's Stylistic Apex,"It begins with sweeping overhead shots of a New York City slowly succumbing to the chill of late fall. As the camera moves closer, it seems to blink and on the soundtrack we hear the first dialog of the film. ""Open your eyes"" followed by the foreboding tones of Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place.The opening of Vanilla Sky immediately begins to separate itself from every film in Cameron Crowe's cannon. This is a film of delicate construction and careful planning.The setup is simple enough: young playboy David Aames (Tom Cruise) is on top of the world. He has inherited control of all three of his father's magazines, and all the other ""keys to the kingdom"". David can have any woman he wants, including his personal friend with ""benefits"" Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz), however he is caught off guard when he meets Sofia (Penelope Cruz). They spark an immediate bond and spend the night having a deep conversation like only Crowe can write. (Of course this is set to the tune of Solsbury Hill.) This sparks jealousy in Julie, who in a single action sends the film through the looking glass and into a world of murder, dreams and psychedelia.Vanilla Sky was initially released in 2001, a very good year for the certain type of film that requires numerous viewings to unwrap and dissect the riddles they present. In a single year we had Nolan's Memento, Kelly's Donnie Darko and this film. The former two films have gained a substantial cult following (#28 and #124 on IMDb's Top 250 respectively) however, Vanilla Sky remains the best and most undervalued film of that trio.The film is Crowe's first true directorial triumph, not his best film but his most stylistically advanced and intoxicating. In Vanilla Sky Crowe brings a mash of pop culture as signposts within the film. Keep an eye out for tiny details such as programs on T.V. or ringtones of a phone. He designs shots to subconsciously resemble classic images. However, this visual growth doesn't undercut the reliables in Crowe's bag of tricks. Vanilla Sky includes every Crowe staple: dialog that seems to immediately enter the lexicon, carefully drawn characters, subtle character driven humor and of course the achingly perfect soundtrack. Yet, I view as completely reliant on Crowe's previous film, Almost Famous. With that film Crowe sharpened his production values only to unleash them at their apex here. In Famous Crowe mastered the art of clear storytelling, allowing him to play with the structure of the medium with Vanilla Sky.The performances are also of a higher level. Cruise sheds all of his Maguire-tics to create a character that begins with all the answers and by the end has none of them left. Diaz brings a fierce believability to her role. And perhaps most surprisingly, Kurt Russell (as David's shrink) brings his uniquely human charm to a role that will be perceived in new ways by the end credits.Although only seven years old, Vanilla Sky has emerged in my mind as a great film of many layers. I've seen it countless times, yet with each viewing it continues to reveal further depths. I fear it may forever remain a mystery; however I am confident that it will stay an intricate and confounding masterwork.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"A frustrating, mind-blowing film.","VANILLA SKY is the kind of movie where you are never sure of what you just saw. The earlier MEMENTO did a great job at forging a reality where nothing is what it seems. Director Cameron Crowe is just trying to piggy back on the success of MEMENTO and his earlier works with the American version of ""Abre Los Ojos"".Tom Cruise is David Aames, a man whose life is shattered after an encounter with a deranged lover (Cameron Diaz). As the pieces of David's life begin to come together, he is drawn into a nightmare world of violence and self-discovery. The supporting cast includes Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, Johnny Galecki, Kurt Russel and the immensely annoying Noah Taylor.The film manages to entertain and confuse both at the same time. By making a sci-fi world almost more confusing than MEMENTO, we become one with David and get an understanding of how he must feel. By all the raving reviews that the critics gave this film, you would think that it would have gotten nominated for some Academy Awards. But, as far as I know, it didn't.

"Looks good, but very uneven","Tom and Penelope look good, the movie looks very nice (cinematographer John Toll shot Legends of the Fall, LastSamurai), and the film is in some aspects mind bending. It's alsowildly uneven, pushed to the point of confusion, almostpointlessness.I won't recant the plot, you can find enough info of that on your own,but I will say these things without spoiling it. If you watch this film,you're going to have to suspend some belief, and just let it washover you. Also be prepared for a lot of MTV interludes, where theactors in an emotional moment, and right up front on thesoundtrack pops a classic rock song right over everything else.

Errr... yes,"Well, I started to watch this movie, and about ten minutes later found myself playing with the thoughts of slitting my wrists out of boredom. The plot is all over the place, it makes no sense and on top of it, there is no continuity in his car (note the badge on the ferrari).

Beautiful Film,"I remember when this movie came out. For some reason I heard nothing be extremely negative reviews so I never saw it. Six years later I finally found it on TV and decided I'd give it a shot. I'm incredibly thankful that I did, and I don't understand why people had such poor reviews for this movie upon its release. I have since picked up the DVD.There are many complexities and subtle nuances throughout the film, and you might find yourself asking ""what the hell is going on?"" And many people criticize the film for that, but these people are missing the point. This movie is about beauty. And if you get confused, it's OK! That isn't important. A cerebral analysis of this movie is not important (although it lends itself very well to such an analysis if you want).

A Calvin Klein Ad trying to pass as Intellectualism,"Tom Cruise plays the scion of a publishing empire, who supposedly runs 3 magazines when he's not male bonding or bedding supermodels.His character is so fundamentally narcissistic and unsympathetic that I found it impossible to care about him. Cruise spends much of the movie giving his ""Wow, you just blew my mind"" reaction as a way of indelicately telling the audience what a ""heavy"" movie this is.I think both the script and the director presupposes that the characters are so attractive that their chemistry will be self-evident. It isn't. Whatever this exercise is trying to say about reality and immortality isn't worth the trip inside these shallow lives.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"""Consequences, David...""","Vanilla Sky is one of my all time favourites for a lot of reasons. After watching it first, it tingled up my spine for a long-long time. I was really deeply affected by it, and the rest of my day was totally different from normal. I had seen such a thing about evaluation of life I have never seen before.The story is really quirky, keeps your mind moving from the first minute to the last one. Apparently, it is found by some of the people, who have seen this film, freak as they had been expecting something utterly different. Personally, I got the point and I am really happy with it. There are some quotes I am really keen on, like ""The sweet is never really sweet without a sour."", or ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around"". Besides, I love the sound editing which conveyed supremely the melancholic atmosphere and ambivalent ardour of Vanilla Sky.After all, without a fine directing (which is not flawless though!) and a superb acting it all would not have been so fantastic. Tom Cruise proved he is not lost, he did a great job just like in Jerry Maguire which is directed by Cameron Crowe as well as Vanilla Sky. Cameron Diaz has never been a favourite actress of mine, sometimes I find her especially annoying but the role as a stalker fits her very well. Penelope Cruz gave an agreeable performance as well, she developed a great character who I could fall in love with too.Anyway, it is a controversial film from many aspects, you will love it or hate it.My rate is 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"Is it a dream, is it reality? Who cares, it sucks.","Absolutely terrible. 3/4 crappy 90s noir, 1/4 crappy 90s Sci Fi, 100% pretentious nonsense.

If I hear ""red dress, strappy shoes"" one more time, I'm gonna barf. Ditto the ""four times"" speech, cute at first, increasingly annoying later. Tom Cruise supposedly goes through some great transformation, but the people in the movie are the only ones who can see it. For the rest of us, he's a shallow dickweed, then a shallow dickweed with a mangled face, then a shallow dickweed with a normal face, but living in some stupid ""dream"" world made up of Crowe's outdated pop references.The whole premise is based on the old, cliched, and utterly boring ""is it real, or is it a dream?"" crapola which has fueled a thousand bad art movies.

one of my favorite movies of recent times...(longish),"I went to see this movie in the theaters expecting a watered down version of Abre los Ojos, little did I know that Cameron Crowe was going to take his version, and inject so much life and humanity into it! To say I was pleasantly surprised is the understatement of the year! I plainly fell in LOVE with this movie, even more when it was finally released on DVD, and I got to see Crowe's commentary and just hear him express all the things unsaid in the actual feature.I am a big fan of audio commentaries, specially by directors who LOVE their craft. Cameron Crowe is one of those directors. The audio commentaries for Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky are amongst the best ive ever had the pleasure of listening in to.Cameron Crowe has said in interviews that Alejandro's take on both movies was this :  He thought the movie was like two brothers: one that was into opera and one that was into rock n roll. That was my dream that you could watch both movies and see some similarities and see that we took some different paths too.People tend to get mad because the movie gives away the whole plot device in the end, but those who do, arent really ""getting"" what the movie is *really* about. The Sci-fi plot devices in the movie are really just a means to an end, the *real* meat and potatos of the movie's message is within the relationship of David and Sofia, and in my opinion, this was much better developed (as were most of the characters) in Vanilla Sky than in Abre..., where the characters felt a bit one dimensioned, at least compared to their counterparts in Vanilla Sky. (specially the best friend character, which Jason Lee played to perfection, that character was pretty much one dimensional in Abre...)To put a wrap to it: If you saw this movie and hated it, see it again, try with an open mind. If you enjoyed it, see it again with the Director's comentary on, its WELL worth it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The delight is in the unexpected,"To me this film comes as close to perfection as it gets for a modern film.It has all the great elements that could make a movie both entertaining and thought-provoking - sex, love, morality, questioning reality, hip soundtrack, great scenes and twist after twist.Cruise and Cruz are just wonderful together - and their on-screen chemistry is palpable, perhaps because of how it is off-screen. Diaz is excellently despicable, while Russell puts on a remarkably composed and competent performance for him.Great direction, cinematography and location work (an autumn NY looks just great) add a further dimension to a film that could already stand up on plot alone.I can see why this film created a divergence in opinion. If you're expecting a simple love story or a contemporary fashion film, you will be shocked and confused. Go into it with a completely open mind and you will be thrilled and awed - it doesn't get better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"I tuned in to see this movie on Showtime just to see Penelope Cruz. She's very beautiful as everyone probably knows. I was shocked by the vulgar language in this film. Especially between Tom Cruise's and Cameron Diaz's characters. It was too much for me. I would not have wanted to watch this movie with anyone. It would have been embarrassing to say the least. I did not identify with, or care about any of the characters either. Cheap dialog sprinkled with platitudes. It seems like Cameron Crowe was trying to copy 'Total Recall' or something. It was also very hard to follow. If I had paid to see this, I would have wrote a really bad review. What a waste of time.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"I'm the guy that usually loves these movies, but...","This movie got a received of gushing and a lot of hate-comments, but I found myself somewhere in between.The characters and dialog were very entertaining, but not clever; which is only bad because it tried to be.  The movie tried to present itself as a surreal, magical view on...whatever, but goes on too long to be fun when its mysteries are revealed.  By the time the story starts explaining itself, the viewer has already imagined many more interesting finales, thus neutering the wonder.Leave it to my fellow New Yorkers' extensive groaning on the way out of the theater to fund the above research.  But back to the positive stuff- good acting, great characters, neat concept; and as an added bonus, bless the editors for not tastelessly tearing out images of the World Trade Towers like every other movie.Now, if only I got to write the last 40 minutes, it would have been perfect!",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Hmm...,"When a film starts how Vanilla Sky does, a dream sequence followed by a relatively routine day of what seems like the 'typical Tom Cruise character', then out of the blue we cut to Cruise being interrogated about a murder, some strange mask covering his face... I generally sit up and take notice!Unfortunately somewhere a little bit down the track it goes a bit astray - can't really pinpoint one exact scene or moment when it happens, but for some reason I started caring less and less what was going to happen.A big part of it is the heavy-handedness - it's over-long and certain scenes are dragged out to painful lengths. The music is pretty good (Radiohead's 'Everything In Its Right Place' is perfect for the opening scene) but overused - it seems that every minute there's another song playing. I know Crowe likes music but try to keep it subtle.The cast does a good enough job, but I think Cruise has it tough - he's just not convincing enough, he's kind of playing himself half the time, then hamming it up the rest of the time. Diaz, Cruz and Russell are OK, I like Lee but the part's not right for him. And Noah Taylor is almost the downfall of the entire film for me. He was just so stilted, but his character was so important to the last twenty minutes or so, he made me want to switch it off. Then again I was losing interest by then.Basically, there's more twists here than I can readily recall in any film - enough to keep you vaguely entertained for 136 minutes. But at the end I wondered whether it was really all worth it. I haven't seen the original but I imagine it's better, well at least more succinct at about 20 minutes shorter.It's certainly interesting, but ultimately long-winded and clunky...",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky,"I agree with ""clues"" from Oregon that Vanilla Sky is a brilliant movie, ahead of its time I guess, (which might explain the less than enthusiastic response from audiences), and I also agree that it is Tom Cruise's best work to date.Another movie that illuminates some of the concepts that are explored in Vanilla Sky (altered states of consciousness, perceptions, reality etc.) is ""What the Bleep to you Know,"" starring Marlee Matlin.

Vanilla Smug ...or....Cocktail Meets Donnie Darko,"..sorry..just can't get past Tom Cruise..it's hard not to bail out of this one during the first hour or so, when every line of dialog is smug, contrived, and designed solely to prop up Cruises character as God's gift to women...oh hell..to ALL of us mere mortals..he's SO good looking..SO clever..SO smart..SO Tom Cruise.The movie DOES get more interesting in an other-worldly/ Donnie Darko kinda way, except then you have to deal with Cruise chewing up the scenery in an over-acting tour de force.See where I'm going here?? This would have been a better movie without Tom Cruise...in my humble opinion, ""understating"" always beats ""overacting"", something beyond Cruises comprehension, based on his body of work. Tom Cruise is a generally lousy actor who is ALWAYS playing ""Tom Cruise"" on and off the camera, and to give him his props, he is a very successful ""personality"" (but so too is Paris Hilton...). ....gotta go..renting COCKTAIL again tonite..kinda like a bad car crash, you just can't look away...poor Tom Cruise-as-COCKTAIL bartender, he just CAN'T even wander into a 7-11 without every member of the female gender-clerks, shoppers, vendors, nuns, whatever... shimmying out of their panty hose!!!

"Almost identical copy of ABRE LOS OJOS, but better and more efficient","I had extremely bad feedback from friends and critics about this film, so I watched it without any high expectations. I normally don't like Hollywood remakes, nor am I a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I have to say, I really liked this movie. It is haunting and beautiful, and after seeing the original ABRE LOS OJOS, it is clear to me that Crowe did a great job. The original is far less efficient than the remake, and believe it or not, I found VANILLA SKY to be less melodramatic. Also, Pen√©lope Cruz's character is more present and complex in VANILLA SKY. The photography is breathtaking and I loved the music (although it does seem as if Cameron Crowe just threw in all his favorite songs on a CD and pressed 'shuffle'... it's more of a playlist than a real score).This said, VANILLA SKY is not to be missed. You can question the relevance of making the same movie twice (it's almost a shot by shot copy of the original, and many lines are the same), but to me VANILLA SKY is a great improvement over ABRE LOS OJOS. The only element that remains as flawed as in the original, is the vacuous and insignificant character of the best friend (Jason Lee/Fele Mart√≠nez).I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Great car crash,"This movie made more sense to me because I had seen the Spanish film, Open Your Eyes, that Vanilla Sky was based on. It followed Open Your Eyes pretty closely. Of course, one major difference was this was set in New York City. Also, I was expecting Tom Cruise to look more disfigured because in the original the Spanish guy's scars were a lot worse.  Penelope Cruz was pretty much the same in this as in the original.   I liked the car crash scene the best because Cameron Diaz really starts to sound crazy during it.  Tom should have just jumped out of the car when it was obvious she was turning psychotic.I still can't decide if I like the ending.  I mean, when you think about it, it does make sense.  But, also seems like an easy way out to explain a lot of things that don't make sense, such as Cameron Diaz showing up after she's died.  Is Tom really crazy and seeing things or is Sofia all a figment of his mind? Is it all a dream?FINAL VERDICT: If you are a Tom Cruise fan, then you will like this because he is really cute in this role.  The movie is OK, but it is not really a murder mystery, so don't be misled.  I recommend it if you are looking for a movie that is a little sci-fi and different from a lot of films out there. Just remember you have to pay attention throughout to get the ending.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

After watching 'Vanilla Sky' I rented the original Spanish version and I think it is unfair to compare the two because they are very different movies aiming for different end results. Cameron Crowe has taken the story of the original and made his own movie, and in my mind it works far better than any other attempts at crossing Sci-fi with a love story that I have seen (for example: 'Solaris' and 'The Butterfly effect').

Brilliant and Beautiful,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to seeing this film, because I did enjoy Cameron Crowe's previous films, especially Almost Famous, a film that was created back to back with this one.I expected that this would be a great film, because Cameron has a great sense of beauty in his portrayal of human emotions, but i had no idea of the depth of his ideals of love, emotion, consiquence, etc.This film works on so many levels.  It is a psychological thriller, science fiction, drama, etc.  Every moment you think you have figured it out, it's compleatly different than what you expected.  Plus, this is another film where cameron's uncanny ability to convey an emotion shines through, with the help of some great acting.Beyond its content depth, it has spectacular visuals.  The whole film has a David Lynch-like dream quality to it.  His immense love of music also shows.  His blending of Nancy Wilson's (his wife/ ex heart guitarist) compositions and the intense visuals flow together beautifully.For me, the best thing about the movie is how it draws you in.  You compleatly forget about your own life because you are so overwhelmed with his.  When it ended, i was amazed at the fact that i was still sitting in my apartment.  Anyway.....wether or not you agree with Cameron's views on life, love, etc is beside the point.  I think it is a man trying to share his views and ideals, and leave them for you to think about, he's not trying to push anything on you, and i think the film is worth seeing for all these reasons.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"""Abre los ojos"" for dummies.","Though Vanilla Sky is not a bad movie per se, it is on the other hand a terrible remake of a great movie. We can see how Crowe tried to stick to Amen√°bar's screenplay scene by scene, how he tried to make an identical movie but shot in the U.S. with Hollywood stars. A pointless idea to start with, but never mind. We also can see how Crowe got lost pretty soon.The characters lost their depth and complexity. They all come out with one trait only. Crowe succeeded in making the originally charming and fascinating girls look like teenage cheerleaders. Don't even get me started on the male characters. The dialogues lost their sharpness and delicacy ; the original meaningful calm scenes and silences were replaced by hysterical shouting, maybe to make it easier to the public to understand when someone is not happy. The relationship between the characters has also been damaged. This comes first as a result of the simplified-minded characters, but also as facts : for example, Crowe unbalances the forces between the two main male characters who were originally childhood friends by making one the employee of the other.But, well, the original genius plot stays, and I can see why so many people loved that film. Nevertheless I think many of those people would change their mind if they watched the original ""Abre los ojos"" masterpiece.

great bizarre entertaining movie.,"i thought this movie was excellent. the scenery was great and the acting was terrific. including star performances from tom cruise, penelope cruise and cameron diaz, who is sexy and very real in this flick. the mixture of the story and characters makes this a movie worth seeing. bizarre story line keeps you guessing and entertained, with tremendous sexual tension between cameron and cruise. and penelope cruise is also overpowering in her role.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

1 1/2 stars,"On the bright side, Cameron Crowe can take solace in the fact that thanks to Rush Hour 2, Tomb Raider, and Swordfish, Vanilla Sky is safe from being the worst film of its year. I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe and intrigued by Paul McCartney's title song, I thought this could be good but I was let down. The film stars Tom Cruise as...um, I don't remember the guy's name but it's really not important, Tom Cruise basically plays the same guy he always plays. The chief characteristics of the basic Tom Cruise character is he's 1) God's gift to women 2) Bold and very confident and 3) Has a chip on his shoulder, often something to do with a deceased father figure. Given the right plot, Tom Cruise can usually work well because the character progresses and usually brings the cockiness down to Earth while overcoming that chip on his shoulder, and we often root for him through the whole process because of attribute #1, woman find him good-looking and guys generally think he's pretty cool.The problem is that there really isn't much of a plot here, so the movie is just on pretty faulty ground with Cruise as the protagonist, and the film eventually falls flat. The movie starts out pretty normal, Cruise wakes up next to Cameron Diaz, a friend who sleeps with him, and goes to work as a business executive, where has to deal with the board that co-owns the company and don't think that Cruise is as qualified as the company's former owner, his father (that's attribute #3). Cruise than goes to a party and falls in love with Penelope Cruz, who's not as easy to get into bed as Cameron Diaz. Yes, Cruise forms a solid friendship with her and is enthusiastic about meeting her cause, as I said he's in love. Then, Cruise is driving around with Cameron Diaz and she bursts with rage over being used by him, and she drives the car over a bridge. Yep, that kind of threw you for a loop, if you were hearing about the storyline for the first time, didn't it?The real plot kind of gets underway here, but as I said, it's not much of a plot, at least in my opinion. Tom Cruise survives the crash but he's pretty badly injured, that's about the basics. Past that, things are going on in the storyline but not in any real discernable order, and reality just kind of becomes blurred. I won't give away too much, but if you stick with the movie, towards the end, things got a little easier to figure out. However, there's a lot of screentime here, where nothing's really even that easy to understand or that watchable. Also, the film has a sort of dark and depressing tone, and since the darkness didn't really serve any function, i thought that brought down the movie.One of the bright spots of the movie, however, was Penelope Cruz. She really lit up the screen and it was easy to see why Tom Cruise was falling in love with her.Past that, the other characters serve little purpose. Cameron Diaz is basically there to hammer in attribute #1 of Cruise's character, because she's very hot herself and her willingness to have sex with him without strings just so she can get closer to him. It makes her a really degrading person, but it makes it easier for Cruise to convince us that his character in this movie is God's gift to women. Jason Lee plays Cruise's best friend and helps develop attribute #2, Cruise's confidence. Because Lee's a complete pushover and clearly is the more subservient one in their friendship, considering how he give up Penelope Cruise for her, how could Cruise not be confident?             In short, this was an admirable experiment for Cameron Crowe, I still like his stuff, I even liked some of his small touches, but a lot of the things in the movie just didn't work at all for me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This is a revolution of the mind...,"I saw ""Vanilla Sky"" in theaters in 2001, and at the time pegged it as an ordinary film which was equally interesting as it was perplexing to follow. I purchased the DVD and watched it a few more times, to which it then became my favorite film.Characters were played superbly, notably Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) and Thomas Tipp (Timothy Spall), who put foreword such a feeling of friendship towards a man with seemingly no friends. Cameron Diaz acts and amazing role as Julie Gianni, inciting one to almost despise Cameron for her less than noble actions as Julie. Only the part of Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell) made me feel as if it were lacking due to forced development and seeming one-dimensionality (Although it could be attributed to his main character flaw revealed at the end).Despite many other reviews, I found the soundtrack not at all obtrusive or overdone as some may claim, but quite essential to the emotional flow of ""Vanilla Sky"". Every musical tone perfectly fitting the scene, even though it may seem absurd to use at face value. Perfect example being ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys when it is used, ordinarily an upbeat party tune, now portraying panic and revelation.Central to the movie is the questioning of what really matters in life. What is happiness? David's struggle is truly an emotional experience once everything is displayed to the audience.If you are someone who does not like to think deeply about a movie, get lost very easily in a story or have attention deficit, please stay away from ""Vanilla Sky"". Otherwise, watch ""Vanilla Sky"" with an open mind and be ready to take it's windy road to a satisfying conclusion to which you can pick up new things every viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"An unnecessary, absurd remake of a unique film.","What's the point in making what is already made? The differences between ""Vanilla sky"" and ""abre los ojos"" are pure cosmetic: the underlying story is exactly the same. And the atmospheric soundtrack of the original film is infinitely better than the impersonal list of pop hits that can be heard in the Crowe's film.This film is a waste of resources. A movie can be based on another one, as long as introduces new elements that expands the previous film. This is not the case. This version follows the original in each sequence.

It's sort of peacefully depressing in a happy way. (?figure that out?) I've seen it three times and i'll still probably watch it again.

Cruise is really good as the rich heir and is ably supported by Cruz, Diaz and Kurt Russell who turns up as his psychiatrist.

Unbelievably inspiring,"I cannot believe that i haven't watched this before, but now was the perfect time to see the movie for me, so the review might be slightly overwhelmed.I clearly see three different parts of the movie which are in one time interconnected and disconnected. One is happy and carefree life of young, beautiful and successful, other one is nightmare of nightmares, which in comparison with first one becomes even more tough. The third one, the ending - is nothing to be expected and it leaves the viewer in total harmony, while the movie itself is quite disturbing.Acting is brilliant, you can clearly see emotions and live through them through out the movie.The last but not least is that words and phrases in the movie, especially in the ending are so finely sharped that you can use them to live a life worth living.High recommendation, probably for watching alone or in a small quiet company.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Wish i could get amnesia to watch this film for the first time again!,"I remember sitting in a cinema getting goosebumps when penelope cruz whispers ""open your eyes"" at the beginning of this movie. I must be honest, I'd seen trailers and thought it looked great but I never would have guessed what the film had in store for me. Like the first flash forward to Tom Cruise in a cell talking about a murder he had supposedly commited, just completely rattled and excited me. Upon watching this film time and time (and time) again on DVD I still believe it to be the best example of how a film should be made. How Cameron Crowe weaved this story from scene to scene, from dream to nightmare to reality is truly remarkable. Tom Cruise at his very best (even though he has been at his best in several other films ie. Magnolia, Jerry Maguire), more so than usual, so open and completely stripped of ego, his performance as David Aames is just magnetic and astonishing to watch. Support (although they all hold the pieces together so perfectly) from Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and Timothy Spall (all already proven to be great actors) just shine. So convincing, so cleverly woven, so intricate i honestly cant say enough, the cast support in this movie warrants recognition, absolutely perfect. In short this movie IS perfection, although i would have liked to see more on the DVD.

Outstanding,"Probably one of the most criminally underrated films of all time, Vanilla Sky is beyond any doubt a great movie, and a truly original exploration of life, death, love, dreams and reality. Much like the American version of ""The Office"", it is that rare creation that steps out of the shadow of its predecessor and takes on a life all its own. This is largely thanks to writer / director Cameron Crowe, who has managed to pull off something very unlikely ‚Äì a remake that is superior to the original.Based on the cult film Abre Los Ojos by Alejandro Amen√°bar, ""Sky"" has little in common with the lackluster carbon copies Hollywood usually churns out when remaking foreign movies. It is obvious that a lot of care went into the making of ""Sky"", and my impression is that Crowe found true inspiration in Amen√°bar's movie and strongly wanted to tell the story in his own words. While Crowe doesn't stray very far from the source material, to the point of some scenes being almost identical to those of the original, he has added a myriad of his own creative influences and personal touches, creating a true cinematic experience that is captivating and memorable in its own right. Despite the similarities, ""Sky"" stands on its own.The film's most striking quality is the use of music and sound, both of which are superb. Crowe has picked out a selection of popular tracks of various genres and found unexpected, yet pitch-perfect, moments to unleash them. Key scenes will make you listen to songs by Joan Osbourne, Underworld, Todd Rundgren, The Beach Boys, Freur and Sigur R√≥s in a whole new way. And Radiohead has seldom sounded better than in the opening scenes. This is one of those films where, if nothing else, the soundtrack alone would make the whole production worthwhile. The music and sound create a distinct and difficult-to-explain atmosphere, one that is unique to this film. You have to see it to understand.The casting is nothing short of genius. In four of the five main parts, it seems like every actor was born for their role. Cruise as the man who has it all, but falls victim to his own vain selfishness. Lee as his best friend, charming but maybe not who he appears to be. Russell as the humble father figure. And Diaz, who shows a whole new side of herself and stands for some of the film's more disturbing moments. The weak link is Cruz as the love interest. Her flawlessness becomes overbearing at times, although this could have more to do with how her character is written than the actress herself.It is a film with a twist ending, but it doesn't rely on this twist to work. In fact, knowing the twist beforehand, or re-watching the film knowing how it will end, in no way takes away from the experience. This is because the film is so solidly constructed, so well acted, and set to such an incredible soundtrack. The final elevator scenes have, at least for me, lost none of their beauty, even though I know the script almost word for word and there are no surprises left.Vanilla Sky is romantic and sad, sometimes horrifying and other times beautiful. It is easily a career high-point for all involved. A must-see.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

About the best thing that can be said of it is that it has a pretty good title song, which brought Paul McCartney an Oscar nomination.Diaz generated quite a bit of Oscar buzz herself at the time, but for once the Academy made a wise decision and left her off the short list.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky - every time I watch it I see something else I've missed before.,"Tom Cruise is not my favourite actor by any means but I was so impressed with this film that I went to see it twice in one week (and enjoyed it more the second time than the first). It's such a multi-layered story that none of the people I know who have seen it can agree on what it's central message is - or whether Tom Cruise's character is experiencing a dream within a dream. This is backed up by the other reviews I've read none of which seems to be reviewing the Vanilla Sky I went to see. In my opinion, it's a life lesson about the fact that unless you've had it sour in your life, you'll never be able to appreciate the sweet. So instead of regretting the rough times in our lives, we should realise it's these bad experiences that make us appreciate the good times even more when they come along.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

High points are the love scenes between Tom Cruise & Penelope Cruz as well as Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz. Trouble is, for 1/3 of the film Tom Cruise wears a mask, and for another 1/3 his face is horribly disfigured.The directing and acting are quite adequate, but not inspired. While VANILLA SKY is long and plodding, its real problem is not in the execution, but with the script. The premise is so far-fetched it's worthless. VANILLA SKY is made up of flash forwards, flashbacks and dream sequences. It resembles LSD trip films of the '60s. The mix is so confusing it's not possible to tell the real from the dreams. But maybe that's the idea. I had no idea where this film was heading until it arrived.

He is simply amazing.Some opinionist on here say this is nothing more than a sixth sense rip-off much like Kevin Smith stated. While The Sixth Sense had its one twist, I was not compelled to watch it over and over.

dream in the wintertime,"On my review about ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997), I regarded ""Vanilla Sky"" as a poor and pointless remake. Well, I watched ""Vanilla Sky"" a few days ago and I wasn't wrong at all.""Vanilla Sky is a remake that suffers of the comparison with the movie by Alejandro Amenabar. First of all, Cameron Crowe seems to like music very much (at a time, he used to be a journalist for ""Rolling Stone). But why did he overload his film with so much music? ""Vanilla Sky"" is a movie spoiled by an overwhelming music. Due to this, the movie looks like a huge clip. It's not that the music is bad but the chosen songs suit badly to a movie with a rather dramatic story. It also often plays a decorative role. It means that it appears in several sequences where it wasn't necessary at all. And the chosen songs are sometimes incompatible with the feeling of a few sequences. For example, when Tom Cruise is in the building of the ""Life Extension"" firm and he's yelling: ""I want to wake up!"", you hear in the background ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys. Is it really the song you can think about when you're in an anguished situation?On another hand, ""Vanilla Sky"" is supposed to be a thriller and however, you don't feel that you deal with a thriller. Unlike Amenabar, Crowe doesn't manage in introducing a lasting suspense and anxiety feeling during the movie. Neither, does he succeed in increasing the spectator's curiosity. The omnipresence of the music has got something to do with it. Moreover, Tom Cruise's ""broken face"" after the car crash isn't as repulsive as Noriega's one in ""Abre Los Ojos"".This is also a movie that seriously lacks of rhythm, especially near the end. Besides, the end of the movie turns out to be disappointing because the conclusion of the plot isn't clearly explained.As it was supposed, there's a problem as far as the performance is concerned. ""Abre Los Ojos"" was a brilliant movie because Amenabar directed very well his actors and they weren't famous. So it made the story more credible. Here, Tom Cruise is too famous and you aren't used in seeing Cameron Diaz in a bad role. As for Kurt Russell, he's very colorless in the role of the analyst if you compare him to Pedro Miguela Martinez. It's the same thing for Noah Taylor who can't hold a candle to G√©rard Barray.A flat remake. At a pinch, can you save beautiful pictures of ""a vanilla sky"" and if the movie disappointed you a lot, there's always the soundtrack.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Vanilla sky or Abre los ojos : great Science Fiction Psychological Thriller,"VANILLA SKYWhichever you chose to watch, the original ""Abre los ojos"" or the Hollywood remake ""Vanilla Sky"", this is a great Science Fiction Psychological Thriller and if you like this genre, the first time you watch it you'll often be on the edge of your seat with your eyes glued to the screen waiting for something unexpected to happen: and it will.Vanilla sky (2001) and Abre los ojos (1997).While most people rate the original ""Abre los Ojos"" as a being a better film than the American remake ""Vanilla Sky"", both movies have their pros and cons in spite of being nearly identical in the plot. Abre Los Ojos feels more natural, more realistic, and has that plain, gritty feel of many European movies. The characters feel more real, but the cinematography is also less spectacular than in Vanilla sky.Vanilla sky while containing plenty of drama and thriller elements, has also more space for humor and playful synergy between the characters. The overall feeling is that you are in a Hollywood fantasy. This lends a lightness to the movie that Abres los Ojos doesn't have. This is also a reason why people might like it less than the original: Abres Los Ojos sticks to the drama, to the story, and the interaction between actors is nearly always serious: the filmmaker wants you to believe this is actually all happening and it's no joke. The acting is in any case good in both movies. Whichever movie you chose to watch first is going to diminish the experience of watching the other version.

This movie makes no sense!,At the end of this movie you just stand up from the couch really confused. It's not because you didn't get the plot it's just that it looks like the plot was written by a crazy man who didn't know the difference between reality and dreams.This movie starts out OK but gets more and more twisted the longer you watch it. This constant changing between reality and dream doesn't function very well when you never know which is what and it constantly changes so the reality isn't so real anymore. The whole concept of this plot is so far fetched that an ordinary mind can never buy it. Instead it makes you feel a little crazy when figuring out what it's about.It's not just the plot thats wrong but it's incredibly boring too. I fell asleep twice before I could finish it. It is 136 minuets but should be around 90 minuets since there's nothing important happening except a few things. I'm not saying I can't handle long movies because most of my favorites are 2-3 hours.The acting in this movie is not bad. Tom Cruise acts very well specially in the motional scenes. But it needs a bit more than a good acting to make this movie worth watching.Overall this is the worst movie I've ever seen. A lot of people I know fully agree with that statement. I find it strange to see that this movie is not on the bottom 250. Maybe it's just that the people around me have different opinions than most other people. But remember that this is only my opinion and although it's hard with this one I respect other opinions as well.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Impressionist Filmmaking--Nicely Done!,"It does seem like this film is polarizing us.  You either love it or hate it.  I loved it.I agree with the comment(s) that said, you just gotta ""feel"" this one.Also, early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet--an impressionist painter.  Monet's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess, but from a distance, you can tell what the subject is.  Cruise mentions that the painting has a ""vanilla sky"".  I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer.  This movie is like that impressionist painting.  It's impressionist filmmaking!  And it's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting.This is not your typical linear plot.  It requires more thought.  There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no, you're not always going to be sure what's going on. But at the end, all is explained.You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it.  After it ends is when you should think about it.  If you try to figure it out as it's unfolding, you will overwhelm yourself.  Just let it happen...""go"" with it...keep an open mind.  Remember what you see and save the analysis for later.I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique, wildly creative, and spellbinding.But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it. It appeals to a certain taste.  If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thought-provoking, challenging, spiritual movies, then see it.  If you prefer something a little lighter, then skip it.But if you DO like what I described, then you will surely enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Cannot be summarized in one sentence.....,"So much has been written about this film and I must say if forced to pick an all time favorite this would be it for me. Some call it confusing and it can be. I find it particularly interesting that the filmmaker, Cameron Crowe, apparently allows the audience to have their own interpretation of the film. All I can say is if you've only seen it once you've missed a lot. Some have said that the film reveals something different every time they watch it. Is the ENTIRE FILM a dream or not? The tech support character refers to a ""splice"" as to where he chose the ""lucid dream"" to begin but who knows??? Perhaps that is a dream too. Definitely a film to be watched again and again.

A cinematic master piece both thought provoking and innovative.,"This movie is simply 'great' and shows Tom Cruise to be a much more credible actor than hes given credit for. In addition Cruz and Russell give great performances. The movie itself gives an immaculate look at modern day society and its obsessions, greed and vanity. Moreover Vanilla Sky is captivating and intriguing and will therefore have you and you're friends discussing the film long after the closing credits. The film is a 'must-see' and consequently i am bewildered by the negative press the film has obtained, most notoriously here in the UK. The movie's admittedly a lot darker and complex than your usual Tom Cruise blockbuster, but surely we should applaud this? Having read some of the comments about this film, it only increases my negative stereotype of the general public. God forbid an actor such as Tom Cruise should try something different in his career. Thus my only conclusion is, by putting Cruise on the poster (attracting teenage girls) the film's attracted a certain kind of audience, one with the lack of intelligence to enjoy a clever remarkable film for its own merits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
An awful remake of an awful movie.  Cameron Crowe should be ashamed of himself.,"Well, where do I start? Okay, for starters, how about that the original film ""Open Your Eyes"" by Alejandro Amenabar was an extremely pretentious, poorly shot, and deliberately confusing (even to the director himself) art film.  Now, I have nothing against art films, if there made with style and that style is backed up with substance.  But ""Open Your Eyes""  tries to be all of that, and fails by trying to be clever.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Penelope Cruz is in both films. But this review is not about ""Open Your Eyes."" Cameron Crowe had just won on oscar for what I felt was the best film of 2000, ""Almost Famous.""  His other films, ""Say Anything"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (which he scripted, but didn't direct), ""Jerry Maguire"", and ""Singles""  are all very intelligent, witty films about dating and growing up.  So, now Crowe decides to move out of the genre which he knows so well and make an art film.  Fine, Paul Thomas Anderson did it with ""Magnolia"" and did a bang up job.  So with that, I'll tell you that I was looking forward immensely to Vanilla Sky (I watched ""Open Your Eyes"" after ""Vanilla Sky"").My high expectations were dashed to pieces with this incomprehensible plot and blatant symbolism which doesn't really make sense.The story (if you can call it that) involves Tom Cruise as a vain daddy's boy, whose parents die, he inherents their thriving company and he basically makes a living making an ass out of himself.  He's sleeping with Cameron Diaz, ditches her for Penelope Cruz (who after this and Captain Corelli's Mandolin, should be deported), and then wonders why Diaz drives them both off the road in a spectacularly silly slow-motion car wreck.  The rest of the film has Cruise (now disfigured) trying to win back Cruz ... Then everything is summed up nicely at the end in an elaborate denouement which Crowe (or Amenabar) pulls out of his ass.I'm not really sure who's to blame for this crap, Crowe, Amenabar, or Cruise for convincing Crowe to remake the film.It's themes could have made a good movie.  It has shades of better films (""Waking Life"", ""Dark City"", Cruise's own ""Eyes Wide Shut"") but instead it takes all of its ideas and intentions and makes... no sense at all.Cameron Crowe, please make another coming of age movie! That's what you're good at!-Scott Gingold - 12/01",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Extremely good movie,"I saw the original ""Open Your Eyes"" in summer of 2000 (see my review of that). I remember when I heard that Tom Cruise was going to redo it, I was hoping he'd be able to make it at least as good.This movie exceeded my expectations. Why? Because it was basically a re-shoot in English of an uncommonly good film.The audience in the screening I just watched was unusually silent. Many people may have been wondering what was going on, trying to work through the plot twists. From the opening scene until very near the end, it's not entirely clear why things are happening, but the final scenes DO wrap it up. You get a very satisfying sense of ""I didn't see that coming, but I like it"".There is a percentage of people who will simply never get this movie. They will think it's stupid, pointless, long, and boring. Then there are the people who will recognize it for what it is: a brilliant concept, exceptionally scripted, well shot, and this time there's a soundtrack to enjoy.If you let yourself get immersed in the characters, you may even be surprised at the depth of emotion their fates will evoke.If your IQ is over 100 (the ""average""), then I predict you will enjoy this movie. If not, send your cat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
thank u but NO!,"Having seen the original ""Abre los ojos"", I decided to go and see ""Vanilla Sky"" mostly out of curiosity and I wanted to compare Amenabar and Cruise's version. When I came out of the cinema, I honestly regretted seeing this terrible film! Tom Cruise absolutely DESTROYED the film, changed things.. One important change for example was making Diaz looking like a hysterical bimbo whereas Nuria at the original film was a mysterious woman. Anyway, see ""Abre los ojos"" and then ""Vanilla Sky"" and you will understand what I am talking about. WASTE of time and money!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Great Film,"During the film most of the people around me looked baffled and some people even left the movie well before it ended.  Some people just don't get it, Cameron Crowe is a brilliant director, and I knew there was a bigger picture. The movie kept me very interested, with each scene I was trying to paste the movie together, and with each scene it seemed I came to a diffrent conclusion as to what was really happening.  The ending explained a lot of what I already had figured out byt hat point so it made the ending feel a bit too long.  I think the film would have been better without the ""walkthrough of the plot"" ending.  Those that needed it to understand the plot probably were those that left the theatre early or those that looked confused throughout, but those are the people that had already made up their minds that the movie was horrible.  All together I loved the film, it kept me thinking for a while after I had left the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Extremely underrated!,"Cameron Crowe's revisiting of 'Abre Los Ojos' is a breathtaking. It left my on the edge of my seat as I questioned my own sense of reality. It is not only beautifully filmed, but Cruise, Cruz, and Diaz give the performances of their careers. I believe many of those people who have given this movie a poor grade just don't have patience for a movie that requires a little grey matter. Misleading previews are probably to blame for disappointing a lot of people. 'Vanilla Sky' is definately in my to 50 movies(If not 30...). To all the naysayers, please, try watching the movie again, but this time I suggest that you mmm.... Open Your Eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
eye opening ten,"Lately each time that I open the eyes of my intellect, I keepreturning to the scene in Lord of the Flies when the  ChristlikeSimon, who has seen both the pig and the parachutist with hiswide opened eyes, returns to his tribe mates to warn them aboutthe dangers of self-deception. This scene underlines a prevalenttheme in Golding's novel, namely that we live our lives believing inlies and when someone tries to enlighten us, we destroy themfirst;  worry about them eventually; and revere them finally.Obviously, like all men I possess a vast compendium ofself-deception. I prefer having my biases reinforced, thank you verymuch, which is exactly what happened on the majority of initialreviews to Vanilla Sky. The majority of critics were underwhelmedand since I was passing through a particularly intense phase ofanti-Tom Cruiseism (based primarily on resentment, jealousy,and siding with Nicole), I was relieved at the lukewarm criticalreception. I dismissed the film. I figured someday I'd catch it onHBO for free. Maybe.A friend of mine kept telling me that I should see Vanilla Sky, that Iwould love it. I kept saying `mmmmkay' which means `Look,you're either a Tom Cruise-aholic or a Cameron Crowe freak andsince I'm neither (which means I'm smarter and more sophisticated than you) I'll see it someday but in the meantimeplease shut up and go away'Finally last week, my friend went out and bought the DVD versionof Sky, came to my office, handed me the disc with a little note`enjoy and return ASAP'.I had run out of excuses.I came home put the DVD into the player, turned it on and almostimmediately my eyes were opened. Not only did I love the moviebut my wife loved the flick as much as I which has happened ononly two other memorable occasions namely Glory and Titanic.And she has more resentment for Cruise than I do as shedetested not only Eyes Wide Shut but also and both MissionImpossibles whereas I was merely disappointed by them.Perhaps it's the fact that my wife and I `survived' a near-deathexperience in an automobile accident and to this day we have acertain amount of question as whether or not we are actually alive.Since I am typing this and you are reading it, does that mean weare both alive you and I or.....well, let's not go there.Supposedly death dreams begin at the point of dying, they arelucid and time is altered within them. The old `my life flashed infront of me syndrome'which as Woody Allen once observed `itwasn't even my life' but is in fact a synthesis of the actualities andself-deceptions that make up  our deranged recollection of mortalexperience.In other words Vanilla Sky resonated with us on all cylinders butthen of course, we're.......let's not go there.Later that night as I was turning off the light after an hour ofdiscussing the film with my partner, a contented silence filled theroom, the silence that happens in the wake of a great movie.

"great ""thinking"" movie","The first time that I saw Vanilla Sky I was dragged by my girlfriend and thought it would be a sappy love flick.  To my surprise, this was not true at all. Vanilla Sky is by far my favorite movie of all time and I have seen a very large amount of movies that one might consider great. Vanilla Sky takes the cake in my list. As I read other people's comments I couldn't help but think that maybe people dislike it because they don't understand it. People today want everything hand fed to them in a movie with a big explosion at the end or the bad guy being caught. This is not the movie for that type of movie lover. This is a great movie if you love to think long after the film is over. Only after you have seen it and understand it can you truly enjoy it.

"Confusing, not weird","I think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of Tom Cruise's weird movies (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut) but Vanilla Sky is definitely its own movie. Many people said it was weird; it wasn't. It was different and confusing but not weird. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Different is The Truman Show. Confusing is The Matrix or The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. THAT'S the point. That's where the so-called ""weirdness"" that turned critics away came in. If they had bothered to ""open [their] eyes"" as the original 1997 Spanish movie, they would have seen that. And if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the ""feel"" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. With songs like The Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly ""right"" feel. A wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, Vanilla Sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent.

I don't get it.,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made in the history of making movies. I don't like Tom Cruise but when he does a good film (The Last samurai, Minority Report) I give him credit. But this movie was horrid. They want people to love it because it made us think, well the entire time I was thinking when will this movie end. As far as acting, the cast was fine, but to me the plot was not there. There was no character development. We see the main character go through some hard times but he never changes. I am a huge Kurt Russell fan and in this movie, again like all the other actors he did a good job but, the fact that he signed on to do this movie makes me want to vomit. So if all you want to see is good acting fine, go ahead and watch this movie. But, if you want to see a plot or some character development you will not get it in this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This movie doesn't live up to the trailers....,"I hate to say this, but this could have been a good movie.  All great movies that shock in the end give some sort of hint throughout the movie that allows the viewer to formulate a hypothesis as to what is happening.  Not this movie.  It starts out great, then tragedy strikes, then the movie descends into chaos, and then an explanation of the chaos.  I actually thought that Tom Cruise's character was going crazy.  This is a viable and sound explanation, for there are many people that go crazy and hallucinate. I thought that it was a true portrait of insanity.  I could have lived with that explanation.  However, the ending was far worse.  I won't spoil it for you, but if you want to save some money, ask someone, and you'll see what I am talking about.  Don't see this film.

Tom Cruise _IS_ the Amercan Alain Delon,"An interesting film that portrays the struggles of the idealistic young Mr. Cruise, who is challenged to employ his idealism in the service of the Japanese war effort in WW II. A key aspect of this struggle is the protagonist's struggle within himself. Tom Cruise, the young man, seeks to humanize the brutal conditions at a mining operation in Manchester. Further complicating matters is the profound sense of national prejudice that shapes the relationships between the various characters. To the workers & Welsh prisoners, regardless of his professed ideals, Cruise is America and therefore an oppressor. Although Cruise tries to win their trust, his own frustration enables him to strike a young Welsh helper, reinforcing the image of the brutal America. This weakness is a key underlying theme. Even late in the film, when he takes a very brave stand against some executions, his effort is a bit late and his stand is successful only when the Welsh prisoners take up the protest. He struggles because her fears he cannot live up to the ideals he expresses.Cruise is also confronted with the another irony. Although he opposes the war, he has chosen a route of avoidance rather than resistance. This is emphasized early in the film during an evening with a friend (Penelopy Cruise) who is about to be inducted. She comments that, although they opposed the war, neither of them was brave enough to face the penalty for resistance of life imprisonment. Shortly thereafter, he takes the mine job to get a military exemption. Yet, if he is successful, the production improvements in the mine only fuel the American War Machine.A valuable film because it explores areas of the Penelope's bodice(Although smaller in size than, say, Christina Applegate's twin patronizers). Also an interesting observation in the danger of half-measures when taking a moral stance. Cruise is ultimately confronted with the fact that you cannot avoid the war, only oppose it or aid it. I look forward to viewing the next film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Cameron Crowe's tantalizing film sticks with you.,"VANILLA SKY (2001) Rating: 9/10Before seeing this movie you need to bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a friend if someone's handy. You will need all four - the latter is critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice cafe mocha after the show.It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie. It demands to be watched ""Closely!"" Open your eyes... (where'd I here that?) Now there's nothing wrong with fun fare of, say Charlie's Angels and Shrek. To all flicks, a purpose. Those are frolicks. This one is more comparable to a philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience. Each has entertainment value. This one simply demands your full attention to ""get it"".The movie is very different from what the commercials make it out to be. It turns out to be more of a fantasy film actually. And it is a ""thinking"" film that made me want to talk about afterwards, which is always cool with me. There are also lots of humor and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers. Jason Lee seemed to get the bulk of the funny bits (as always), but Tom Cruise gets in his share of memorable zingers, too.Having said that, I think a lot of what makes this a success in my book are the five great performances by the leads. Tom Cruise is at his charismatic best, and Penelope Cruz is more lovable than in any other movie I've seen her in. The two of them have palpable chemistry, I have no trouble believing that the sparks continued long after Cameron Crowe yelled ""Cut!"" Jason Lee is, not surprisingly, perfectly cast, having mastered the art of playing the smart-ass best friend in Kevin Smith's flicks. The real surprise is Cameron Diaz. I've adored her ever since she first entered that bank in 1994s The Mask. She then proved surprisingly game in There's Something About Mary, and she revealed an edgier side of her acting in Being John Malkovich, but this (for lack of a better term) psycho bitch turn is still quite shocking! I'll never see her as a harmless blonde sweetie ever again! Cruise also does some of his most interesting acting when events spin out of control, showing a much darker side of himself. As in Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, I think the fact that we're used to seeing him as such a successful stud makes his breakdown even more affecting.Behind the camera, Cameron Crowe is as ""on"" as he's never been. With the help of cinematographer John Toll and his wife Nancy Wilson doing the score, he crafts a constantly stimulating succession of sounds and visuals, sometimes to rivetingly surreal effect. Plenty of scenes are still haunting me, from the Times Square opening to the breathtaking finale, through countless other great moments. And what about the soundtrack! A former Rolling Stone writer, Crowe always puts together bitching soundtracks for his movies. Think of the use of ""In Your Eyes"" in Say Anything, of ""Free falling"" in Jerry Maguire, the Seattle grunge in Singles, or the Led Zeppelin tunes in Almost Famous. Now in Vanilla Sky, we can hear such great artists as Radiohead, REM, the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel, all used to near perfection. I mean, some will disagree, but I found the ""Good Vibrations"" music cue just priceless, I had ""Solsbury Hill"" caught in my head for the whole day and even Joan Osborne's ""One of us"" took on creepy undertones!Vanilla Sky explores some very intriguing territory, which will confuse the hell out of a lot of people, but give it time, there is a point and some sense to make off it all in the end. Some might argue that it's better to leave things unexplained than to tie everything up, but in this particular case, I thought the exposition served its purpose, and as delivered by Noah Taylor (""Tech support!"") and Tilda Swinton, it doesn't feel tedious. And then, the movie reaches a payoff. To reverse one of the film's leitmotiv, since you got more into the sweet early scenes, the sour elements hit even harder, and when you don't expect it no more, ""sweetness follows"" and you leave the theater still on a high, wondering what it is that would make you most happy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I can't believe that Cameron Diaz impressed some people with this performance.  She never could act and used to be amusingly cute, but that's over for her.  She'll gladly muck up the screen in big-budget trash like Cruise has, although he was good in Magnolia and Rain Man.Who enjoys this kind of tripe?

Wonderful! Just keep Cruise out of the way,"One of the inexplicably underrated movies. Based on the ratings and reviews, I started watching Vanilla Sky reluctantly knowing that I would definitely be disappointed. However, and to my surprise, I was totally awestruck by the smart, dreamy story, the brilliant direction, and the out-of-this-world cinematography.The only letdown though (and the reason behind the two missing stars in the rating) is Tom Cruise's stagy performance. He completely missed out on the soul of the character he is impersonating and turned it into a phony. I understand that David Aames is supposed to be shallow and irresponsible and that the movie is his journey towards self-realization and maturity. The point is that Cruise's overtly theatrical performance and overacting (to stress the character's clumsiness) detached me and kept reminding me that I'm watching a movie.Still I have to watch the allegedly superior Spanish original (Abre Los Ojos) to make a better judgment, but I think Cameron Crowe did a wonderful job adapting this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Weak Twilight Zone episode spread over 2 hours,"I'd heard mainly negative criticism about this film and my expectations were low, so perhaps I could be pleasantly surprised, unfortunately not.First of all, the story is very weak.  I generally like these type of films, `Welcome to Blood City', being a great example.  Question who we are, our place in the universe and our perceptions of the world are all interesting themes.  The problem is the story is quite simplistic and is presented in an annoying disjointed manner.  I know this was done deliberately, but spread over 2 hour +, this can get very annoying.  The filmmakers really needed to make the collapse of the VR much more gradual and subtle leading up to a crescendo, but atlas it was a mixed mess.On story and presentation, maybe the film would have got a 5 or 6/10 from me.  After watching probably one of the worst actors in Hollywood (Mr Cruise, in case I needed to clarify) present one of the most obnoxious uninteresting characters I have ever seen, what's with this stupid boyish grin the whole time.  Add Penelope Cruz, who was almost as bad, then you have no believability and no chemistry whatsoever.  Jason Lee, was also very unconvincing as 'the friend' which Cruise treated like crap.  Actually Jason Lee repeated his performance in `Almost Famous', yet another poor effort from Mr Crowe.Thirdly the length of the film, shorten it for God's sake, a plot this weak, doesn't need 2+ hours to send people to sleep, it could do it in 80 minutes.It's a shame about Mr Crowe, Jerry Maguire was excellent, IMO, but I recently saw Almost Famous and Singles, both were very poor, the only redeeming feature was that Singles had the best band in the world playing on the soundtrack (Pearl Jam, which I'm sure you already knew).3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Nowhere as good as the original.,"This is a remake of a Spanish film(which also happened to star Penelope Cruz). Boy, talk about a downturn. The original Spanish film is fantastic. Now Cameron Crowe comes along, changes the setting from Spain to New York and casts a bunch of A list pretty people headlined by Tommy Cruise. Remaking should come with a tagline: Better to watch the original. I hated this film which I felt was a mashup of a thoughtful story into pop culture footnotes.

Do not take a date,"This is not erotic but a real turn off.  The crude dialogue is more like a health class.

I saw no chemistry either, but there were some twists and turns. It was really grim at times.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Who knew Cameron Crowe could make such a terrible movie?,"While watching ""Vanilla Sky"", you get the sense that you are seeing the efforts of a man who is trying his best but quite frankly, has no damn idea what he is doing.  There is no flow, and the wierdness just piles up without any resonance or ""holy shit""-can't believe I saw that! quality----it's amazing how boring most of the movie is.  So basically, we have an overlong movie about a man (Cruise's worst performance to date) whose reality becomes more warped and his life unravels only to have it all explained with the GOOFIEST damn ending anyone has ever seen.  It is hard not to simply shake your head in disbelief that you are actually watching a movie THIS bad. The only saving grace of this movie is Kurt Russell's best performance and perhaps John Toll's ethereal cinematography.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

The music makes also a big deal in this movie because it fits in so well, that you feel how their emotions really are. If you haven't seen this movie, you really have something to look forward to.

what a wonderful film,"I was skeptical when I saw this movie.  I honestly didn't believe I would like it after hearing so many bad things about it.  The writing/dialogue was incredible.  Tom Cruise has never been better.  He was able to show much more range in this movie than he has in a long time.  We're able to see why everyone thinks so highly of him as an actor.  Cruz's acting was ok at first, and got better as the film went on.  Diaz was pretty good as well. I'm unsure of why people can't figure out the ending of this film.  It is completely obvious...I mean, this is no Muholland Falls where you have to keep guessing.  The answers are right in front of you.

Vanilla Sky= My favourite Movie,"The first thing i'd like to say is i like the movie very much and is among my favourite movie list. The movie contained so many different genres which gave the movie an edge but at the same time left a lot of people confused and not really understanding the movie. I find its not always about understanding the movie but merely falling under its charm and imagination. Not many movies i can think of are like Vanilla sky so i deem it unique.Tom cruise is a great actor who shows his skills very well this movie. H plays similar roles in other movie but this Character he plays ""David Aames"" has a twist which adds to the whole feel of the movie.Final CommentsWatch the movie , love the movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
one watcher's perspective...,"... it was with a sense of anticipation that i settled in to my seat to see Vanilla Sky. whilst appreciating Cameron Crowe's earlier films for the watchable enterprises that they have been, i had never found myself as being particularly emotionally drawn to them; previous dialogue had a tendency for mawkish sentimentality (almost famous), and occasional over repetition ( jerry macguire). also, in many of his films, the director has a tendency to become bogged down in the semi-autobiographical nature of his works - note the fawning self-appreciation of his younger self in almost famous, or the ridiculous amount of time that kate hudson spends enigmatically staring into the camera!!it was with a pleasant sense of surprise then, that i found vanilla sky to be one of the most emotionally affecting films that i have seen for a long time. the director manages to accurately convey on screen a real sense of tom cruise and penelope cruz actually falling in love. this is not done with undue sentimentalisation, but through heavy focus on music and its nostalgic qualities, as well as standing back from the viewer, rather than ramming sentiment down their throat. performances are excellent throughout, even from cruise, who manages to downplay his role effectively for the most part. diaz, on the other hand, looks as good as ever on screen (i.e. unbelievably beautiful!!), and puts in a good performance to boot. cruz is warmer and more beguiling than i had anticipated, and as mentioned, her and cruise fall in love extremely convincingly (and we all know why that is)!!the soundtrack is another absolute highlight of the film and conveys its emotional highs and lows brilliantly. icelandic band sigur ros are the undisputed highlights, and if their song at the films denoument doesn't fill your eyes with tears, then you really need a new record collection.this film WILL affect you unless you have never known what it is like to fall in love, in which case, i suggest you trade in your heart of stone for another one. ask cameron crowe to give you a hand.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Being brutally honest,"Vanilla Sky is 2hours and 26 minutes of wasted film. It is unfortunate Amercia's #1 box office draw and acclaimed director Cameron Crowe couldn't put together a better film. I can't help but remember the last time Tom Cruise fell in a love with a co star, a bad film was the end result. Nicole Kidman was the actress and Far and Away was the very forgetteable film. Almost ten years later a new love blossoms and a bad film is the end result.This film is has very confusing themes, Fatal Attraction meets Memento meets Jacob's Ladder. Director Crowe attempts at the very last minute to bring everything together, but ion the meantime leaves the viewer bewildered and lost. All of the actors turn in good performances, but the writing and direction fall way short. The film never hits it's stride and seems clumsy from the start. The soundtrack is one of the promising elements of this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

The best film of 2001,"This is a movie that will make you feel brain-fried after one viewing of it. I think this is the best film that Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe have both made.  The movie contains excellent dialogue, ravishing cinematography, subtle comedy, and a great deal of intellectual ideas on dreams.  ""Vanilla Sky"" reminds a little of the lesser known ""The Thirteenth Floor"" in the idea of distinguishing what is real and was it unreal.  Cameron Crowe took a chance on directing a movie that crosses several different genres and it has paid off.  Tom Cruise is excellent as the facially-deformed David Aames. Kurt Russell did well as Dave's psychoanalyst.  Jason Lee made a surprising performance as Dave's best friend.  The best performance in the entire movie IMHO is Penelope Cruz as Sofia (she did well in certain serious and certain funny moments).  Cameron Diaz was great as the sweet-covered but sour-centered Julie.  Overall, this is one of the best multi-genre movies ever made and one of my all-time favorites.10 out of 10.  This is best film of 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This movie was great,I really like this movie. I know a lot of people who didn't like it but the main reason was because they didn't understand it at all. I especially like after the third time I watched it since I understood it completely. When you understand all the events in this movie you maybe have a chance of liking it more. The music was great in fact I bought the soundtrack it's really good. The actors are also good in the movie but the thing that impressed me the most has to be the images and the visual aspect. The setting is wonderful and I also like the story.

Amazing film!! One of the bets mind bender's since The Matrix,"This movie was allot of things to me. It was strangely beautiful, oddly touching. Complex, brilliant, stunning , grand, outrageously entertaining; need I go on? Vanilla Sky was a movie at first I didn't think I would like but after awhile I saw that there was more too it than meet's the eye. It was a very touching movie in an odd sense it shows you the trails and tribulations of a man trying to grasp whether or not his world is real or a dream.There are things in life we don't quite understand and there are things we do, this film explores the latter it explores the perception that our world does sometimes seem like a dream and that things we do and things we don't can effect the realm of our imagination and the realm of our life. This movie doves deep into the physic of the human mind and it plucks at every sense and every feeling to provoke the main stimulus of our mind and it does it so well with such style and artistic beauty, It's a quintessential movie that mus be seen with an open mind and heart to fully comprehend the complex nature of it's story and it's deeper underlined meaning that is unearthed as the story moves along. It's astoundingly well made and crafted and is something that is going to become a classic as time goes on.Tom Cruise(who was utterly fantastic here.) delivers one of his most potent and brilliant performances as wealthy playboy David Aames, Jr. an successful publisher who finds his whole life turned upside down. Kurt Russell does as just a good job as Cruise in his forceful performance as the compassionate psychiatrist who becomes a father figure to Cruise and brings Cruise's character out of his dark place. It's a great father son type of relationship to see unfold on screen. Penelope Cruz does amazing here she's so graceful and beautiful and is something amazing to watch on screen, she's fantastic! But the real weak point in this film was Cameron Diaz, her performance was so annoying and bland that when she died you showed no pity what so ever. But besides that the rest of the cast holds up very nicely and does a fantastic job.This movie is a mind bending, melting pot of a film it's meant to bring out the most elated feeling of power and sorrow from the deepest part's of your mind. It's a film you can't miss at all it's amazing, breath taking, dark and so entertaining to watch. Vanilla Sky is a shoot out the lights , blow your hair back, mind blowing experience you have just got to see. All in all Vanilla Sky is a wild trip you'll want to take.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Amazing,"This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. So many twists in turns, I was shocked when I finally reached the end. I personally don't think there's a better Tom Cruise movie than this. His acting was unmatched and he has perfect chemistry with Penelope Cruz. The whole thing kind of reminded me of an episode from the show 'Black Mirror', but on steroids. The futuristic aspects in a retro time period wowed me. Let's just say vanilla skies will most definitely keep you on your toes. I recommend this film to anyone who is into subtle sci-fi thrillers as well as mysteries. Happy watching!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A film which makes me reconstruct my mind,"About 8 years ago, I saw this film, and it was awful, I stopped watching in 30 Min's, and I told myself, what a film, so bad.

The story line, the performance, the soundtrack. everything inside is great, sweet and sour, never get out of my mind, and it's just so deep in me, I 've been watching this film at least 5 times. every time I watch this, the tastes never change, it's just so classic for me. I understand the people who dislike this film, cause I was one of them, this film seems so disordered, and so confused. But when you really , I mean really get into it, you will understand , it's so deep, deep,and deep. when the whole puzzle solved by the end of the film, just like few people can climb on the top of the mountain. As the same, few people could understand the idea. but it's good, that's all I can say, I few shame to the people say it's a bad one, I totally understand, but I do feel sad to the people, cause they jump the conclusion and most important is , they don't enjoy the film, probably never will understand such a good film like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
More 'Lynchian' than love,"It's hard to imagine that in 2001 a love story starring Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz was actually considered a Box Office failure. But then that's because it wasn't a love story. However, much of the marketing that surrounded it concentrated on the 'relationship aspect' of the film, lulling people into thinking this was what they would be getting. Therefore, by the time they had left the cinema and their heads had stopped spinning, they possibly were among the many who simply described 'Vanilla Sky' as a 'mess.' Yes, the story is centres around a print billionaire (Tom Cruise's) slowly falling in love with a struggling artist (Penelope Cruz) while at the same time trying to fend off his existing lover (Cameron Diaz). So far, nothing particularly out of the ordinary. However, once the film gets going (and I say this referring to much that comes in the second half, as the first half sets everything up without giving too much away as to what's about to come) things start taking a turn for the weird.Dreams are mentioned more than once and that's a good analogy as to how the film progresses. Things happens that appear a little random, leaving the audience to wonder whether there may ever be some form of supernatural influence involved. The story chops and changes and deliberately leaves the viewer feeling pretty disorientated, much like you'd feel upon waking up from a particularly vivid dream. Naturally, this form of story-telling doesn't make for an easy ride when it comes to understanding the narrative. I can see it leaving some people a little confused (it took me a couple of watches to actually 'get' the film entirely!).I mentioned 'Lynchian' in my title. This refers to film-maker David Lynch, who's famous for his weird, surreal, completely NON classic Hollywood narrative way of telling a story. He, like 'Vanilla Sky,' likes to leave a fair element of the story up to the viewers' interpretation, rather than spoon-feeding them every plot point. Therefore, this is most likely a film that you're going to find yourself discussing with friends after a viewing (although, in my opinion, 'Vanilla Sky' actually gives you a lot more answers than the average David Lynch film!).If you know what you're in for I think people who are in the mood for a particularly weird and slightly disturbing type of film will quite enjoy this. You definitely have to be in the mood. I've seen it a fair few times, but, if I'm simply craving car chases and shoot-outs, then this isn't the film I put on. I think if anything sums it up best it's Cameron Diaz's performance in 'Vanilla Sky' - on the surface, sweet and frothy. However, dig deep and you'll find dark and creepy (and that's not an insult - she's really good in this!).",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Vanilla Sky - Totally underrated. It is awesome! Well very good at least.,"I ask the critics who rubbish this movie 'Vanilla Sky', ""Did you really watch it with open eyes?"" It's a genuine masterpiece for its plot, acting, cinematography, direction and use of music. I've watched both movies; the original ""Abre Los Ojos"" was very good, but it has an entirely different feel and isn't as dynamic as Cameron Crowe's remake which makes better use of soundtrack. The concept for me back in 2001 was innovative and still now I find the film entertaining. Everyone is welcome to their opinions but please let's have some honesty. I think the film has suffered because of prejudices towards Mr. Cruise. My favourite actress Cameron Diaz was very convincing and sexy :-) The rest of the cast also made for a good show.

the unhappy consumer,"I'm having difficulty deciding whether to beat my head against the wall or bother to criticize yet another piece of soulless Hollywood entertainment/distraction.  As more of the world sinks into poverty, starvation and despair, and this country rapidly transforms itself into a hyper militarized Rome, what more could we expect from that great engine of propaganda (that Hollywood unwittingly is) than one more slick lifestyles of the rich and famous in search of relief from the tedium of the idle rich.Oh but the world needs entertainment, or is it that the world needs distraction from the evil sheet that's going down.  Bread and circuses didn't hold a candle to video.Oh well on a more specific note this was a mediocrely crafted  psychedelic version of The Game (another waste of time) with a sort of Crowlian twist, and you either see what a sad soulless mess Crowley was or you idolize him as he idolized himself .  Crowley, like Freud, in attempting to kill the mean-spirited Judeo-Christian God only wound up letting his own angry unexamined little psyche take his/her place. Ah but I diverge from the divergence that my subject of deriding this movie, or was it `civilization' is; well, either way they both suffer from the same preoccupation with uber wealth, high-tech toys and the fantasy that science will save us from our own mortality and/or our or society's unethical choices.So, `Turning and turning in the widening gyre....'

"A cinematic gem, and one of the best films of 2001!","This film is a thought provoking, intelligent, and all around amazing experience. It amazes me that this was given a mainstream release by Paramount, and I only wish that they would continue to take more risks like this once in a while, because here, the payoff is beautiful. Tom Cruise delivers one of his best performances to date as David Aames, an egotistical playboy who inherited a fortune from his father, and takes everything in his life for granted, until his life suddenly takes a turn for the bizarre. This film is about one man's journey to redemption through a series of dreams, scientific miracles, and the power of love.I personally believe that this is Cameron Crowe's best, after ALMOST FAMOUS. Why this film did not connect with audiences and critics is the most baffling thing for me to grasp. Cruise totally dives into this role (he also produced the film, which is based on a foreign film, ABRE LOS OJOS), and the rest of the supporting cast is perfect as well. Penelope Cruz will take your breath away with her fully realized performance as Sofia, Jason Lee is amazing as a heartbroken novelist, and Cameron Diaz gives what may be her best performance of all time as lonely, psychotic Juliana. The soundtrack is to die for, and perfectly compliments the mood of the film.This is a beautiful film. It is a celebration of life, and how ""every passing minute is a chance to turn it all around"". I watched this film in theatres years ago, and it made a huge impression on me.

Even Penelope Cruz (who plays the same woman as in the original) appears pale and lifeless in comparison to her great performance in ""Abre Los Ojos"".I can only highly recommend the 1997 original version, which was a great cinematic experience, but in ""Vanilla Sky"", what's left is a soulless print from a Hollywood-copy-shop.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen!,"My husband and I went to see Vanilla Sky tonight and we are completely outraged that we paid $25 after tickets, cokes and popcorn to see this movie.We have watched the promos for this movie and we were very anxious to see it.  It seemed as though it would be a real thriller.  My feeling is that ""they don't make movies like they used to"".  For example, my idea of a great thriller is ""What Lies Beneath"".We both felt that Vanilla Sky was not at all a thriller, as it had been promoted to be.  By watching the promos, we had assumed that it would be something along the lines of ""Diaz fakes her death and 'messes; with Cruise's mind 'from the supposed grave .  Possibly he would be sought after for her murder and he would all the while try to prove to everyone that she was not dead but had actually faked her death to get revenge.""Never has a trailer/promo misrepresented a movie so poorly!!!  While driving home from the theater discussing how terrible this movie was, these are some of the words we used; ""freaky"", ""dark"", ""slow"", ""boring"", and ""so confusing to follow that it was not at all entertaining"".We are sending an e-mail to our friends in hopes that they will not waste their hard earned dollars on this movie.Often, one might judge their desire to see a movie by the actors/actresses who play the leading roles.  That was certainly not true here.  Diaz and Kurt Russell have been very entertaining in many films.

Ultimately it gets explained (and that's all I'll say about that) but that's not enough to really redeem it.  The acting was superb and I think the directing was also good but I think the script left much to be desired.  At least as they decided to film it anyway.  It does have it's moments but not enough to help.  If you must go see it then do it on a matinee or wait until it's on pay per view or rental.,1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Unreal,"I was so impressed with this movie.  It really made you think.  What would happen if you decided to eat breakfast before you left the house or stopped somewhere and ate.  Cameron Crowe is an amazing director who captures human emotion like no one else I've ever seen.  When Tom Cruise first met the other Cruz, that was an amazing scene.  If I didn't know that they were a couple then I would have figured it out in that scene.  A movie like this really makes you think about your life, I haven't seen a lot of movies that can do that.

"Open your eyes, says Mr. Crowe","wow, what a trip that was. I thought VS was a great movie, with lots of twists and turns. And Cruise, what a performance. I don't think he's ever done anything this weird. But as for the naysayers, well . . . let them. This movie is not in any way for those who enjoy a straight-forward plot. When I was leaving, everyone was complaining about the ""plot"" - I won't give it away. Personally, I thought it was great.The only way this is a normal Crowe flick is the messages through the characters. Otherwise, Crowe packs in as many turns as driving up and down Mulholland Drive.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it:  See the original, skip this","Vanilla Sky was a huge disappointment.  Based upon the Spanish film, Open Your Eyes (which was brilliant), Cameron Crowe ruins the movie with hard-pounding music, over-simplification of the plot by taking out any semblance of nuance or thinking on the part of the audience, and idiotic re-writes.  I thought Vanilla Sky was panned because the audiences didn't understand its premise.  Hardly.  Crowe leaves nothing open to interpretation; rather, he spells everything out in black and white and Hollywoodizes the ending.  Everything I loved about Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes), Crowe ruined.  I believed nothing.  Tom Cruise gives one of the worst performances in a decade.  Like Cruise's lack of chemistry with Rene Zellwinger in Jerry Maguire, Cruise has no chemistry with Penelope Cruz, who reprises her role from the Spanish original, in expanded and unnecessary fashion.  Vanilla Sky is a waste of time and money.  I found nothing redeeming about it, other than when it finally ended and the pain of such a bad experience was over.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"An underestimated film that, if understood, is extremely satisfying.","A Bright Vanilla SkyPeople like to dream or even just imagine their perfect life. It is such an intense moment when that happens, that the person can't even realize whether he is dreaming or not. The new Cameron Crowe movie Vanilla Sky shows this fact in a more complicated, but sophisticated way. This movie is a remake of the Spanish movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes) directed by Alejandro Amenabar. It is innovative and existential; it is hard to understand, and that is what intimidated the critics who brought it down.Tom Cruise stars as rich and successful David Aames who unexpectedly finds his true love with a very pleasant Spanish lady. What becomes his problem is the fact that he loves being liked; that is what makes him enter the car of friendly-but-barmy Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who has more than a crush on him. It is just this little mistake that ruins all of David's life. When he realizes that his life completely crumbled, all he wants is to find out one way to fix it all up. The protagonist then has to make it through a series of odd situations, some of which turn out to be just dreams. David's life is now separated into dream and reality, and when those two will end up joining in a `pause mode,' things will become clear to him.Tom Cruise produced this New York-based movie with associate Paula Wagner and writer/director Cameron Crowe (whom he has worked with in Jerry Maguire). Crowe (Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous) changes his style by giving the movie lots of more energy compared to his old works. In the middle of all this desperation, he gives it a little sarcasm making it more controversial. Penelope Cruz plays the girl of David's dreams; she gives a normal performance, nothing special. Instead, with her right energetic performance, Cameron Diaz got nominated for a Golden Globe, but didn't win it. After all the foolish comedies she has done, finally she was chosen to play a more complicated character that reflected all of her talent. Kurt Russell completed a great performance playing David Aames' psychiatrist. He might even get nominated for some award, but his part doesn't give him enough possibilities to react and give more vitality. Tom Cruise didn't do a bad job; he did too many of his ironical laughs while shaking his head. Making himself  `look bad' in this movie, might create an admiring reaction in some people.Vanilla Sky is a pretty disturbing movie while watching it, but not anymore when it has ended. It has been constructed in a way to confuse the spectator; the effect of that, is that once you have understood the whole story, you feel extremely satisfied. That is what the director wanted to accomplish; and he did.Rating: ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Another success for Crowe,"Crowe's follow up to Almost Famous is more ambitious, which probably explains why it is not as tightly woven.  The existential plot, however, provides the viewer with much to think about.  There is so much to ponder in this film, I suggest seeing it a second time. Crowe is a master at screen romance, and it definitely shows in the palpable chemistry between Cruise and Cruz (Crowe said he was delighted that he caught these two falling in love on screen).  The brilliance of the romance leads the plot turn (not to be spoiled by this reviewer) to have an even greater resonance.  A fantastic film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Finally!  A non-medicinal means of inducing sleep.....,"Well, what can I say...I thoroughly disliked this film.  Although an intelligent film (in some respects), I found Tom Cruise to be mis-cast and Penelope Cruz just plain terrible (she really should take some acting lessons).

When one adds the possibility of ""life enhanced lucid dreams"" (I don't want to say any more...), albeit for a price, the openness of modern relation/friendships, and the premise of one's choice future (future choice?), this is a film to be watched more than twice.Complimented with great performances by actors well versed in the craft, Analog and digital selections of visual excellence, and a soundtrack that the ghost of Napster would love.

Her name is Sophia (Penelope Cruz), she is a beautiful dancer. When David meets her, she invites him back to her apartment which leads to him spending the night. By morning, Julie is in front of Sophia's apartment waiting for David. She offers him a ride which he accepts. During the ride, the jealous Julie drives her car off a bridge which ends up leaving her dead and David is left grusomely disfigured. He trys his best to win Sophia back even with being ugly.

"""Vanilla Sky"" or Crowe's ""Abre los ojos"" own interpretation","First of all, I'd like to point out that ""Vanilla Sky"" should be not considered as a straight remake of ""Abre los ojos"", but a film that teach us how to tell the same story in a different way. The Amen√°bar version was darker and more creepy than Crowe's one in all elements: the story hadn't the fairytale atmosphere that ""Vanilla Sky"" has got, the characters were darker and more serious, the shots and lightning were more creepy and so on.That's where ""Vanilla Sky"" had the mistake. People were expecting the dark thriller that was ""Abre los ojos"", but instead of that, the audience recieves an ""americanized"" version, more colorful and beautiful indeed, adding to the story the fairy-tale style that Crowe's has given to the film.Tom Cruise, Pen√©lope Cruz, Jason Lee, Kurt Russel and Cameron Diaz, all of them have incredible performances, better than I expected (I'd probably not say out loud Diaz did a good performance).I only do this comments for that kind of movies that surprise me, or make worth my money spent.

THIS IS A GREAT FILM PEOPLE - WE'RE ALL THE PROOF!,"Ok people I've read many of the theories proposed about this film on the message board. I've seen people heralding the genius of this film and I've seen people professing the pretension of this film.People are unhappy with it, for conflicting reasons. Some people have said that the entire film is too complicated and vague, while others have said that the ending is a sell-out, put on a plate for the viewer and thus compromising its artistic integrity.I would certainly disagree with the latter opinion. I think that the end of the film is unpredictable, original, and damn entertaining. It sheds light on ALL the seemingly inexplicable inconsistancies, which really boil down to the continuous alteration of the reality Dave perceives. It gives the entire course of events a surreal plausibility(if that makes any sense!).And yet, it leaves an element of mystery. The 'open your eyes' line at the end opens up an entirely new can of worms. The 'is he just after opening his eyes to a new dream?' question is provoked. And that is I believe an invitation for the viewer to examine what exactly is so damn irrefutably real about OUR own reality? The cryogenics 'lucid dream' explanation when it comes provides a much more satisfying twist than simply explaining Dave's delusions with psychosis.It is a little far-fetched perhaps, the idea that this type of technology would be accessible, but a little application of imagination and it shouldn't bother even the most ardent of cynics. They are the very people complaining that the viewer is spoonfed by the final ten minutes synopsis of what occured. So can't they use that brain of theirs they so love to use and decide for themselves how this could have been possible?I had heard absolutely no feedback or read any reviews before I went to see this film, and as such, didn't expect much based on the current standard of American movies. It blew me away. The best film I've seen in ages. I've also gathered that by the sheer volume of comments on this message board it provoked a lot of thought in others, displayed either willingly or in the mask of cynicism which (along with attempting to assert yourself to others and compensate for your deficits in other areas) was an indication of the thought-provoking majesty of this great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

It's an answer I would love and hate. The only reason Vanilla Sky isn't going to get a 10 out of 10 is because of the end.

Tom Cruise plays an excellent role as the play boy gone wrong! He pays for the errors of his ways but inside there is the romantic, needy man which keeps him going. Cameron Diaz shines in her psychotic role and Penelope Cruz, taking to one side her 'annoying' accent, makes the film captivating as the 'one'.

Something different...,"This is one of those movies that's difficult to review without giving away the plot.

The story involves elements of romance, morality, murder-mystery, suspense and sci-fi and is generally an entertaining trip.I should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize what's going on.If you enjoy well-acted movies with twists and suspense, and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic Philip K Dick style resolution, then this is a must-see.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Is it perhaps a morality lesson, reminding us that beauty is only skin-deep and that indeed in a charmed life, one might not recognize true happiness?It's all of these and more.

Close Your Eyes,"There's not a lot to say about this film. Really, there isn't. If you don't really understand it, you may call it ""ingeniously provocative"" or ""appealingly philosophical"" or any other term that will make you look intelligent. People look for an explanation and come up with plots so complex that it makes the whole thing look silly. Really silly. The actual clue here, is that there is none.This is art, ladies and gentlemen. Art in disguise, in the world of massive consumption media. It's a composition of ideas interweaving and merging into each other. Just like Monet's painting shown in the picture, featuring the 'vanilla sky', it is an impression of reality. You have to look at it the way you look back at a dream you've just woken up from. Some parts are still clear in your memory, while others have already begun to fade out of your mind. And the whole - well - makes no real sense at all. Or if you believe that dreams have a meaning, it can make any sense you would want it to have.Vanilla Sky is like one of Monet's paintings. When you examine his works at close range, they will look like assemblies of random brush strokes; as if the artist wanted to paint a surreal landscape. However, if you take a few steps back (or like in my case: simply take off your glasses), you will see the colours flow into each other and something will start to take shape inside your own imagination. Something really familiar. Monet wants to depict landscapes; he describes them with colour, so that we can make up their form ourselves.Hold on to that thought, and use it to look at Vanilla Sky. Everything in it has a purpose and yet, nothing has a meaning on its own. See it as a whole, but don't be disappointed if it would turn out that the whole makes no sense to you either. What Vanilla Sky wants to depict is life; it describes it with images, so that we can reflect them on our own lives.It's all about impression.To conclude this review, I'd like to make one last remark. You can't really rate this film. You can't say that it's good, because it is NOT good. And you can't say it's bad either, because in a way, that's what it tries to be. Sweet and sour. What you can do, is decide whether you like it, or not. And to be honest with you, I didn't like it. It did bore me at times and I really don't like to be bored inside a movie theater (especially not when the movie has already started). On the other hand, I don't regret seeing it. Now that the movie is over, I'm starting to appreciate it. It's an attempt of using Hollywood to bring art to the masses, without Hollywood being fully aware of it.Open Your Eyes",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
So - so,"Many people seem to be in love with this movie. I am very hard-pressed to know why. I found it to be a confusing, overrated, over-acted mess of a film.When I saw the words, ""Intellectual"" in some ratings, I was prepared to be challenged in an interesting way. Unfortunately, I wasn't. I thought the movie needed some serious editing.Certainly, the opening sequence, in an unpopulated New York Times Square is fascinating to look at, but the movie never lives up to that for the remainder of the running time. (Which was easily 45 minutes too long.)Maybe they thought that things could be wrapped up in a surprise ending. (Don't worry, I won't expose it here.) I love surprise endings. But, once they get to that portion, Tom Cruise, Kurt Russell, and another actor simply sit and talk about it for minutes on end. I kept thinking, ""GET ON WITH IT, ANYWAY!!""I know that a movie is not working when I find myself looking at my watch and estimating how much is left. I should not have the experience of sitting in a theater and thinking, ""Well, let's see. I'll be out of here in an hour!""A superior film, with an unforgettable surprise ending, was ""Angel Heart"" from 1987 and starred Mickey Roarke and Robert DeNiro. Get that one and blow off ""Vanilla Sky"".My personal rating of ""Vanilla Sky"": *.5 out of ****.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Disturbing; worth watching.,"I'm still trying to sum up how I feel about this movie. I watched it sometime between 2am and 5am today. It's 5pm now. It's been all I can think about since I finished watching it. I'm gravitating around a 7 or 8 out of 10.I'm a woman that doesn't cry at movies. Really! Ok, Beaches had me almost there, but I honestly don't let films manipulate me into crying.This movie disturbed me. When I say disturbed, I mean rattled me out of my conventional thoughts and emotions. At times I felt like my heart was breaking. (I still didn't cry! But it was hard not to.)I hoped when I arrived at work today, someone would have seen this too and I could pass the time discussing it. No such luck. It's nice to come to IMDB and read the other comments. It helps me come to terms with my feelings!And yes, I feel like I need to ""come to terms"" with them.One comment said the dialogue was horrible. Hmm...recently I have criticized other films of the same thing. In this case, I didn't notice the dialogue as bad. Ok, I think back to Kurt Russell's role, and some of his lines weren't stallar. But, I wonder if the character was one-dimensional on purpose? Hmmmm.Another comment on this board said Mulholland Drive was better. Sorry, I didn't like Mulholland Drive. I thought it was a perverted, overly long ""Twilight Zone."" Ok, I ""got"" that movie, but still didn't like it. I ""get"" this one too, um, I think ;) After I saw Mulholland Drive, I wanted those 2 hours of my life back!!! I don't have the same feeling after watching Vanilla Sky.I definitely want to see the original (Spanish) version of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A brave and noble failure,"Here we have a mismatch of director and genre.  Cameron Crowe's warm, offbeat, and well-observed comedies put some pretty interesting characters onscreen who ring true in all sorts of little ways that make us love them or at least sympathize with them (if they are supposed to be badguys, but no one is truly bad in a Cameron Crowe movie).  He has a gift for capturing the innocence of awkwardness and a keen ear for dialogue.  He uses music to rhapsodize his scenes in memorable ways (e.g., ""In Your Eyes"" from ""Say Anything"", ""Tiny Dancer"" from ""Almost Famous"", that lovely Bruce Springsteen song in ""Jerry Maguire"", and the entire ""Singles"" soundtrack).All that said, watching ""Vanilla Sky"" is an uncomfortable experience, and in all the wrong ways.  Crowe proves clumsy when trying to weave an engaging mystery while doing the things he has always done to make a good movie. It's hard to have the warm fuzzies about characters when they're trapped in a trippy world that's hard to understand.  Crowe never seems to get the tone right, although Tom Cruise does all he can to do that tightrope walk between agony and ecstasy and cockiness and vulnerability that he has practically copyrighted.  Jason Lee only adds to the movie's awkwardness by stretching far beyond his range (he really needs to stick to comedy--as a dramatic actor he has two modes:  wise-cracking acerbic smart ass and yelling acerbic smart ass).  Penelope Cruz is just kinda there as the woman Cruise loves, but Cameron Diaz does some fine work in a thankless role of the jilted lover who bobs back and forth between flirtation, sadness, loneliness, desperation, jealousy, and finally rage.""Vanilla Sky"" is the kind of movie that you want to like because of how well it might have worked in different hands (and conversely, for the hands that dared to take it on in a bold step in a new direction career-wise).  In the end, though, it just leaves you feeling cold and like you've gotten nowhere.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Great original idea.,"I just watch Vanilla Sky for the second time.  I am so glad when a movie comes out which isn't the same old crap.  Vanilla Sky was a great original idea which kept you guessing throughout the whole movie.Tom Cruise (shunned from a Best Actor Nomination) does an excellent job in his role as a confused, depressed man on the verge of insanity.  The direction is amazing with the constant flashes and repeating of lines previously heard throughout the movie.  Halfway through the movie you feel like you haven't even watch anything because you are so confused yourself. In this way you are drawn into Tom Cruise's character.Seeing it the second time you pick up on everything, which just makes the movie that much better.9/10I also recommend Memento and Fight Club.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Wonderful,"This was an interesting ride of a film. It brought up questions and the answers are not that easy to come by.The cinematography was excellent and I think that Cameron Crowe is a great film maker.Some people may not understand but it is a thinking movie. It requires the audience to pay attention and look at the small clues, not that they will help you figure out the story, but it will make you feel better at the end when your are able to piece it all together.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Wait for Pay Per View,"Cruise is an excellent actor.  It's just a shame he's chosen poor films lately.  Vanilla Sky is confusing and essentially a waste of time.  The film jumps back and forth to different scenes in an effort to be clever.  This gimmick doesn't work.I had read that the movie had all sorts of twists and turns, so I was prepared to pay attention and really think about what was going on during the course of the 2+ hour film.  After what seemed like forever, I looked my watch and noticed time tick, tick, ticking away while few answers had been given for the nonsense being played out on the screen.  I keep thinking that the movie wasn't going to be long enough to clean up the mess and finally give the audience the final pieces of the puzzle.  It turns out the film didn't need to be any longer, it just needed to be over with because it wasn't going anywhere.Even a highbrow movie needs to make sense when it's all said and done. Maybe it's me, but when the film came to a screeching halt, I couldn't help but think WHAT??!!  Thank goodness for good customer service, I received a refund.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
What the hell? wow!!,"How could you best describe this film? I say highly surreal at times, down right weird and do you know what? it was captivating, I left the cinema screen and since that time the film has stayed in my head. It has a David Lynch and Cronenberg quality about it, in that you never really know what is supposed to be real and what isn't at certain points in the film. All the performances are great, particularly the three leads, Cruise, Cruz and Diaz and for me like many critics the sexy, gorgeous, Cameron Diaz narrowly steals the show. You really must see this film, I love the fact that it has stayed lodged in my brain as I try to work out certain parts of the film. It is really strange, but it is wonderfully shot and excellently acted. Occasionally this film seems like a music video and at other times an advert for a phone company or something, and most of the film I was left with a look of bemusement but in a good way like with films such as Fight Club or Videodrome, just two that come to mind. Where this differs from some others of this sort of confusion based film is that it gives you an answer as to what is going on at the end which you won't see coming until quite close when they hint at it, but then you still are left doubting whats happening thanks to the rest of the movie. I really like this film despite the fact it annoyed the hell out of me, but it did so with good intention unlike some movies that annoy purely because they are bad. I recommend this definately, it stretches the rules of movie making to its limits and leaves you in a daze, some may dislkie this sort of film but I like many love the effect a film like this gives you. I think the director Cameron Crowe achieved what he set out to do, leave the movie in your thoughts long after you've left the screen. This gets an 8/10 it would get a ten but the twist could be seen as perhaps a mixture of ""thats a good one"" and ""yeah right!"" I probably won't see it again until DVD release, I doubt it will have anywhere near the same effect as it did today.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Boy what a ride,"Open your eyes, this was one good movie.  I went to see this film with my wife and we had two completely different takes on it.  I loved it and my wife hated it.  I thought the acting was great, the images were breath taking and the sound track first class.  It was a Indi sci-fi classic, with Tom Cruse in the lead and really good music.  My wife thought it was too long, confusing, and and a waste of time.It must be said that while I love a good Indi film, like say the ""Opposite of Sex"" my wife usually thinks they are too over the top. This film had me going the whole way, first I thought it was a love story, then a murder mystery, then a Psychological thriller, then a sci-fi twister. But the thing I liked most about it was that I could not stop thinking about the film all night.The images were burnt into my head.  When I first saw the pictures of the girl and her mother and father I wondered why the parents had blond hair. Later in the film when things changed I said OK that explains that.  But then in the end I did not know what was real and what was a dream, even the ending. I asked my wife what she thought and she said ""Who cares"".  I felt like telling her ""Open you eyes"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
another masterpiece from a genius at work,"cameron crowe is a genius. he has a way of taking something great and making it exquisite. i saw the original abre los ojos when it came out a few years back and enjoyed it, but crowe turned that film into a great piece of modern cinema. aside from a great cast, including jason lee and cameron diaz, who did a great job, not to mention the beautiful and talented penelope cruz and a usual so-so performance from tom cruise, crowe's attention to detail and passion for film is really what made Vanilla Sky stand out from its predecessor. i have a theory that says cameron crowe could remake a film like glitter into a top notch classic.having seen the original i was not as drawn in by all the twists and surprises, but to those who are new to the story, i think you will really enjoy the thrills it provides. to those like me, who enjoyed the first i also reccommend it. i thought it was much easier to follow in english and whether you think 'thats not how its supposed to be' or 'i remember this part' (i did both), i think youll still enjoy watching a master apprentice at work.open your eyes...",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Hands down worst movie I've ever seen,"When I walked out of the theater after seeing this movie, I was amazed that I had only lost two hours of my life.  It had seemed like a whole lot more. I have to hand it to the movie, though, cause it does try to be all cryptic and philosophical like other ""artsy"" movies, but it is poorly executed. The whole thing comes off as some disastrous emotional roller-coaster, with the light, clear parts being slashed through suddenly and unexpectedly with the darker ""mystery"" parts. It's as if the movie is trying to play itself out with a normal linear plotline and only occasionaly decides to remind us that nope, it's actually an ""artsy"" movie and here, we'll prove that by being all depressing for a little bit...  I would literally have walked out if not for the fact that my ride was actually, for some reason, *enjoying* the movie. The last half hour almost, MAYBE redeemed it in my eyes, but it seems too added-on.  If the entire movie had been done with that lightly sci-fi flavor, then perhaps it would have worked.  As is, though, the ending was just bizarre and unexpected.  This movie has also creeped me out on Cameron Diaz for the rest of time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Unexpected disturbing movie,"Well played, well directed, good scenario... all the ingredients for a good 21st century movie.A really unexpected movie where dream and reality are mixed for the greatest pleasure of the audience.

The plot is well thought and goes beyond the typical thriller story.This movie is for people wanting more than just violence and guns. Be prepared for a bit of thinking and don't expect a ""vegetables watch"" type of movie.The US poster doesn't give justice to the movie and tries to promote Tom Cruise.

And the Razzie goes to...,"""Vanilla sky""! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to announce that I have finally seen the worst movie of my life. I believe, that no other movie that I have seen or will ever see till the day I die, including the porno flicks from Internet, will be as bad as this one. It gets 1 out of 10 points, earned by Penelope Cruise by her smile. The rest should have been:the script - terrible, but with pretensions to be smart,the acting - not worth mentioning,the camera work - amateur,the dialogs - what dialogs?character development - oh, yes, Tom Cruise's hero evolves into... can't remember what, not much different than what he used to be, though.This movie reminded me of an article the ""Popular Science"" ran last month - it was about anti-matter. One of the ways to use anti-matter, is in comics, when the plot is getting too complicated and there is no way out, you set up an ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"", killing everyone, or sending everyone back in time. :-) Well, the end of this movie is rather similar to the ""ANTI-MATTER EXPLOSION"". I won't give it away for the sake of those poor souls who decide to rent this picture, but... Imagine, that you are the director. You have a stupid plot with no reasonable solution, bad acting, terrible camera work, etc., and you want to put an end to it all... What do you do?

Disappointed in Crowe,"1 out of 4Audiences in search of a mind trip filled with mystery and suspense¬Ö  need to see something else.  Vanilla Sky takes you on a mind trip all right, but its ever-changing narrative and uniquely mysterious characters are only contrived elements in a story that lacks focus.  After two hours of questions, the premise of the entire film is summed up in ten minutes of flashbacks and explanation physically ripping the wind out of any hope you may have had for it.Tom Cruise plays David Ames a millionaire magazine publisher with the world at his feet.  Beautiful women want him and success has never come easier. Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) is one of those women but is unwilling to share him with his new love interest, Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz).  Julie causes an accident that leaves David with a mutilated face and ever-present migraines.  His world is falling apart around him and nobody has the answers.Cameron Crowe is generally a brilliant director.  Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous are great rides into the lives of their lead characters¬Ö what makes them laugh and what makes them cry.  That sense of direction is evident in Vanilla Sky but too little emphasis is placed on the relationships.  Instead Crowe focuses on a mystery about murder and betrayal reaching outside of his comfort zone and failing.Some of the performances are good but too many are awful.  Cameron Diaz stretches well in a `Fatal Attraction' evil that transcends her `girl next door' persona and Jason Lee shines as David's best friend and confidant with a quick wit and irascible charm.  Cruise gives us nothing new with his rich kid who can't seem to control his life character and the other Cruz is just downright unwatchable as an unintelligent waif riding on the coattails of everyone she meets.If you're dragged kicking and screaming to this film you had better be prepared to sit through hours of strange and unengaging drama only to find that the wait was never worth it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
More mature than OPEN YOUR EYES,"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more mature and more nuanced. Aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that Crowe has improved on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""fleshed out.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Idyllic voyage through the stuff that movies are all about,"A definite eye-candy, this movie explores a usually closed and difficult theme: the world of dreams. Carrying the plot on his back is Tom Cruise's engaging character, which plays a successful businessman, which can't resist a beautiful woman or an everlasting dream. His life starts being invaded by choices, errors and emotions, until something changes his life. Divided between an irritating but warm-hearted Cruz and a sexy although slightly mad Diaz, he ends up questioning what is this all about when he's charged with murder. But that's the secret of this movie, so just see it: with a soundtrack that's worth the admission alone, and a great performance by Cruise which shuts up those who think he's only an action hero and a pretty face, the movie also displays Cameron Crowe's skill in involving its viewers. And the movie never stops doing so, from start to finish also thanks to the beautiful cinematography by John Toll. Don't let the strange accent of Pen√©lope fool you, this movie requires more than one viewing. And a movie like that is always worth seeing.

A Feast for the Eyes and Soul,"Much like a great painting, I let the experience of this movie wash over me. I took in the breathtaking sights and sounds. It was an assault of a dream. And like a dream it feels exhilarating and frustrating at times. It truly is a film that will displease many a viewer. It takes on elements of romance, character study, dream voyage, and sci-fi. Perhaps a heady mix some would rather not do with. But I loved it. It's a strong, risky performance by Cruise who takes us on a journey through one man's mind and soul as he tries to figure out who he is amidst all the loneliness and confusion. He's a man engulfed in wealth and power who ends up stripped of everything and awash in dream and pop culture. It reminded me of the movie THE GAME by way of WAKING LIFE.

Better off getting teeth pulled,"Tom Cruise is at his best here (which sadly means he is horrible) in this painfully watchable film.  Could this be the worst acted movie of the year? Yes.  Could it be Cameron Crowe still doesn't know how to direct a movie? Yes.  Could you find a more silly movie out there this year? No. What we have here is a sorry remake of a better film.  It goes from being The Game, to Phantom of the Opera, to Total Recall and despite that ambitious combination, it can't pull it off.  The structure is quite laughable, the film could have ended any way and there would be nothing to contradict the finale.  Before he jumps at the end, I wondered when the Klingons would begin landing.  Any film that requires fifteen minutes (FIFTEEN!) to explain itself at the end is a waste of my time.  Fight Club did it in a minute, The Others did it in a minute, The Usual Suspects did it in a minute, The Sixth Sense did it in a minute.  Hell in Empire Strikes Back they didn't waste fifteen minutes on why Darth Vader is Luke's pop.  Why then does VANILLA SKY need fifteen minutes to lay out the logic of the story?  Now theres the really mystery.  They would have been better off with an ambiguous ending, explaining the whole thing merely cheapens   most of the film to ""HA! IT WAS ALL FAKE!"" status and they can't even pull that off like Usual Suspects did.

This is the trip,"Vanilla Sky really blew my head off when I first saw it. If you've seen the cover/poster you'll know what I mean when I tell you I started looking with the idea this was a sort of romantic comedy or something. In the beginning, this seems to be pretty accurate: romantic, oh yeah! You can feel the tension between the Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz... great. The viewer is expected to fall in love with her, and you really do (If I was a woman I'd fancy Tom, I guess)...well, something like that, you know. What happens after the carcrash, when David Aames life takes a turn he looses control over, is unbelievable after the quite romantic start! But its definately GREAT! This way you can really feel the characters... its not just some folks in a strange situation, they come alive...more. Great acting, great story, great REMAKE! It's a remake of 'Abre Les Ojos' ('open your eyes', you'll get along this phrase quite a lot of times watching the movie, so be prepared, for what that might mean...I don't know). Abre Los Ojos, I really want to see it, but they don't have 'm in my local video-rent-thing (I don't know how ya english speeking people call it, pretty clear i think), so too bad, can't compare stuff.

Extremely convoluted and cheesy,"Of course having heard of this film as it reunited Tom Cruise with beloved director Cameron Crowe. With briefly knowing much of this film but remembering it very slightly, and not having watched any trailers prior. As a whole, it's essentially a very cringe and forced romantic comedy with sci-fi and hallucinations/ dream like effects.Everything about the film seems to have several different possible interpretations where things aren't exactly clear in its concept. There is a lot of confusion where we aren't sure what exactly is real and what is a dream or non-reality.The ending reveal wasn't exactly anything memorable as it was drawn out but left us keeping bored. Overall the film was rather generic and simply boring.

"Visually stunning, highly ingenious","The very best thing about this film was that I had somehow managed to avoid seeing any trailers or pre-publicity. So I was expecting some kind of thriller/romance type movie. I was so delighted to be wrong. This was a truly compelling movie. Visually stunning, it still managed to grip both based on plot and character. Replete with plot turns and unexpected developments, there was no way to know what to expect. Cruise, Russell, Diaz and Cruz were all believable in tough situations, and compelling. Crowe combined the best that modern special effects have to offer with some great basic cinematography and direction, including an awe-inspiring beginning in Time Square.Super, fascinating, devious, ingenious, innovative.

"Overwrought, yet oddly compelling","Cameron Crowe has sought to throw his audience a curve ball with Vanilla Sky, a 2 1/2 hour free-for-all illustrating the machinations of a man on the edge of insanity.Is it good?Well, for what it's worth, I really enjoyed the ride.  The visuals are exemplary, the story is taut and keeps you involved.  But I don't know as if I'd recommend it to a friend:  It's not the typical crowd-pleasing movie.Tom Cruise plays...well...the stereotypical Cruise-ian disaffected man of privilege...no casting coup there.  He's good, but his character illicits little sympathy, which is crucial for this movie to work.Penelope Cruz is eye candy;  someday, maybe she'll master the English language and convince us how well she can act:  She's not ""there"" yet.Cameron Diaz gives an almost-Oscar-worthy performance...clearly the best of the bunch, totally convincing as a obsessive boink-on-the-side.Jason Lee gives his best performance thus far...which isn't saying all that much...keep trying, Jason!It sounds like I didn't like this thing, but I actually found it a compelling view...though to be quite honest, much of the plot points were way too similar to ""Mulholland Drive"";  Vanilla Sky seemed to throw in a male protagonist, a slightly-more-coherent storyline, and beautiful visuals to make it a tad different than Lynch's tale.Check it out...you might like it.

Things you will like:Penelope Cruz is, as always, absolutely adorable, and maybe, just maybe, this will finally be that promised film that rockets her to legitimate Hollywood stardom.  But most likely not because the rotten word of mouth from the masses will keep everyone away.Tom Cruise does a fantastic job playing a role that fits him well.Cameron Diaz is funny, desirable, unnerving, and sympathetic all at the same time.The twists and things are well explained by the end, although the one major clue doesn't happen until about two hours in.  Still, the clues along the way should give you some idea of what's going on, maybe.  The final explanation at the end is quite satisfying.Kurt Russell is good, especially at the end.There's a part where you as an audience member are specifically referenced, although it does fall rather flat.It is at times gleefully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Things you will not like:It is at times dreadfully surreal, switching from dreams to reality with little warning.Bloated.  It's over two hours long for no good reason, lots of dead time when you're sitting in your seat trying to will the thing to move like it's a drowned kitten.  You know, maybe that's a good analogy for the movie.  It had some real potential to be a kitten everyone would love, but poor little Cameron Crowe gave it a bath for too long trying to get it all pretty and it just kinda drowned and it's a shame, but that's the way it works.Jason Lee is not at the top of his game, although he does seem to have taken efforts to pluck some of the unibrow.No one who sees it with you will get it.It's not nearly as clever as it (and we, really) would like to think it was supposed to be.The complete shift in gears an hour an a half into the movie is so jarring that it feels like you're trying to teach a teenager how to drive a stick -- mental whiplash is not a pretty thing, although they try to explain it away later.It's just not worth more than two hours of your time.  If it had been shaved to an hour and a half, maybe, if it had put more substantive material into its actual length, maybe, but as it stands it is not worth your time or money from the perspective of entertainment or life education.So if you're intrigued, go see it because nice people won't spoil it for you, but keep those expectations low and go alone.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

The plot takes so many turns it's sometimes hard to keep up, but isn't it better that a movie makes you think rather than not? Cameron Crowe has made his best film here, and it's most likely to be the best film of his career in many years to come. Using colour and some fantastic camera shots, it becomes more of an art piece than just a film. His direction and editing are so tight in some scenes, it's hard not to notice his talent. Check out the scene with tom cruise and noah taylor in the bar. It's perfectly executed. And the finale is positively poetic. Beautiful infact. Everyone here makes an impression. Penelope Cruz i thought did extremely well in a soft role, and tom cruise once again shows us that he can infact act his socks off if he wants to. It's brain numbing, head scratching, wonderfully surreal, disturbing, horrific, romantic, poetic, arty, everything really.

Can movie critics be anymore pretentious?,"Since both Spanish and English version are almost scene-by-scene copies I will be reviewing them as the same movie.
The movie starts as a drama. Third of the way in you find yourself wondering: is this really deep, or is it really shallow. Moving forward, it turns into a sci-fi, kinda.
Then the story becomes needlessly complicated. Its not easy to follow but its no Memento, nor is it The Fifth Element so you end up watching till the end and after a few twists and turns the story unfolds.My opinion is that the first dramatic half is truly shallow and very meh. The second sci-fi half, well they do not explain it that much, but it is also blah. Is this an original movie? Well, the idea of living in a simulation have been discussed before, if that is what the movie was about. Was it? Or was it about falling in ""love"" with someone you really have no clue about? Or is it telling us that if you're a shallow person your mind will play tricks on you if by chance you happen to become frozen in perpetual dreamland - so you need to improve your personality? Who knows.I personally prefer the Spanish storyline, it makes more sense. The English version has better acting and production values, because it was done later. Both had horrible dialogue, with very awkward Spanish humor translated into English somehow.The biggest problem for me is how critics on rotten tomatoes are scoring the Spanish version at 85% but the English one less than half that at 42%, even though it is virtually the same film. Sure the Spanish one was first but as mentioned, it is not really original by its own right. The difference of the scenes, storyline, acting, and language does not justify this big variance. It just goes to show how these critics are a bunch know-it-all parasites. At least here on IMDB the public scores both versions more closely.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I liked the ""father-figure"" Russel too. Although at times you can seem lost in the plot, at the end your questions are answered (or maybe not...) and everything makes sense.

(much) better than average...,"I'm not seeing this film popping up in many ""10 Best"" lists, or in the Golden Globe nominations, for that matter.  Pity...I saw this film last week, and found it nicely exceeded my admittedly low expectations.  In a year where most of the successful blockbusters seemed to be kiddie-fare (""Shrek"", ""Harry Potter""), it was refreshing to see a good, adult movie that didn't have to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer to underline its various plot-points.I liked the challenging nature of the story, and I found I enjoyed it best when I just let it sort of ""wash over me"", instead of trying to analyze every detail and plot point.  And while I wouldn't go so far as to call it profound, it WAS a nifty piece of story-telling.I do have quibbles; the ""elevator"" scene near the end goes into WAY much detail to explain what has happened, and winds up insulting the thoughtful viewer's intelligence when the movie had done such a wonderful job of depending on it up to that point.Even with this, though, I liked and admired Vanilla Sky.  Its labrynthine narrative is a BIG departure for director Cameron Crowe, even with its artistic ambitions manages to be approachable and entertaining.  When my wife and I left the theatre we talked for a good hour or so just trying to piece together exactly what happened.A last note: I've seen some mention of the presence of the World Trade Center twin towers in the background skyline in the rooftop scene at the end.  While this was very much a background detail with NO relevance to the story whatsoever, and while seeing it was a little distracting, I'm glad it was left in.  I'm sure there was much handwringing at Paramount over whether to digitally alter those frames, and the argument could be made that doing so would have been appropriate, but it stands almost as a small, cinematic memorial.  This may well be the last new film we'll see that uses the image of the twin towers as simple buildings, and not as symbols of tragedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"""It's a Wonderful Life"" meets  ""Seconds"" meets ""Coma""","This is painful for me but I'll admit upfront that I haven't seen the original Spanish language film. I'll qualify that by saying I am the type who scoffs at the American re-make of ""The Vanishing"" because it was so inferior to the original.I have a hunch that this movie stayed pretty close to the INTENTION of the original. Considering the lame American re-makes usually focus on the ""gimick"" of the original rather than give you any kind of true cultural filter on an original story this is a good thing. I know what Cameron Crowe meant when he said the film wouldn't leave his mind. I had a similar experience with the Russian film ""Come and See"" (which I recommend highly). I kept telling people about it until I convinced a friend to watch it with me.I won't give away to much of the plot, because this film is truly a story. When I say story, I mean more like a novel than a comic book. I will say that Tom Cruise did a great job in this film. I don't think Cruise gets enough respect for his acting because he is good-looking and he's a nice guy. Often people's talents get overwhelmed by popularity. Think of some of the most popular people at your high school. Just BECAUSE they were popular didn't a certain segment of the class despise them? Being popular didn't prevent anyone from being a good person (In fact, maybe being popular just allows you more leeway to show your true character.) The whole cast performs at a high level. Penelope Cruz is enchantingly cute. Cameron Diaz is horrifically attractive and menacingly flirty. Jason Lee is able to emote subtleties that evade many more well known and well regarded actors. Most importantly Crowe has forged a good story with crisp dialogue and a frustrating yet authentic vagueness of real life. It's all shot in a slick way without looking too much like a commercial yet with a definite emphasis on story-telling. I recommend the movie to those who aren't afraid to look a little inward and ask some big questions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Pathetic,"This is a pathetic movie, for two reasons:a) having seen Amenabar's original ""Abre Los Ojos"" before ""Vanilla Sky"", one can see, after just a few minutes, that the american version just isn't going to reach the depth, simplicity and elegance of the original. This movie falls prey to the temptation of big-star movies where everybody's handsome and apparently dressed by Vogue's fashion coordinators. The story, of course, suffers. It's a pity that 90% of movie-goers will get to know this story as told by Crowe and not by Amenabar.b) Penelope Cruz just isn't a good actress. It's amazing that she'd agree to play the exact same part in the remake. Did she count on nobody knowing Amenaber's version? (Curiously i have to admit that Tom Cruise plays the part with the delicacy and intensity it deserves, and I don't even like him...). It seems as if Crowe bowed before the Cruz-Cruise soap opera and let her do whatever she wanted. Contrast with her part in Almodovar's ""Todo sobre mi madre"", and you'll get a glimpse of what a good director can do even with mediocre actress material.Was this a trade-off between Cruise amd Amenabar?

Tom cruise can't handle the material like Noriega and Cruz's second time through as Sofia lacks the mysteriousness that she had in the Abre los ojos. Cruise almost comes off as a good guy in vanilla sky, where noriega was better at appearing like a spoiled jerk whom the audience didn't really like. It worked better for the story that way.

Wow,"When I decided to see this movie, I didn't know what to make of it as I had no expectations at all. I have not seen the original ""Open Your Eyes"", so fans of that particular flick, please excuse my ignorance.The whole movie starts out interesting enough but then it gets a little bit slow for a while. Things start to get really interesting when Tom Cruise is involved in the car accident caused by Cameron Diaz. From there on, the movie plays like an imotional rollecoaster and gets more intresting all the time. What I really liked was that I, as a viewer, always thought I had it figured out but in the very next second I was proved wrong. The way the movie ends was a surprise to me, yet believable. I loved it.The directing of the movie is excellent, there are lots of memorable scenes in the movie, my favorite three must bee; 1: The Times Square Scene  2: The Car Crash Scene  3: The Rooftop Scene. The opening scene is also very good, backed up by very suiting BGM; ""Everything In it's Right Place"" by Radiohead...perfect. Radiohead may also be heard in the background in the restaurant scene, the also very suiting ""I Might Be Wrong"". The rooftop scene is themed with Sigur Ros's excellent Njosnavelin, also known as the Nothing Song.

"Mysterious, fascinating study of identity and its meaning","It's a shame this movie was released at the time that it was. If it had been at any time other than just on the heels of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's highly public split, there might not have been such a huge holocaust against two of the three main stars of the movie.Essentially, this is a dream-like version of The Matrix. The same themes - that of reality and its fragility, identity and the power of perception - are covered, but they are given far more than the superficial treatment that The Wachowski Brothers gave them in The Matrix.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a person whose life seems to have spiraled downhill since a car accident involving his lover, Julie (given a bit of an edge by Cameron Diaz). It's difficult to sum up the plot of the movie, and what I've just said sounds overly simplistic, but watching the movie yourself will give you a chance to really follow things.As the movie descends into a more and more dream-like state, it becomes increasingly apparent that David's world - which is actually a sort of induced dream in itself - has been affected by his own perceptions, subconscious fears and feelings.While the plot is occasionally difficult to follow, Cameron Crowe has delivered a highly original movie that stresses the control of our own subconscious over how we take in the world. The dream sequences are particularly interesting to watch, and the movie definitely requires a second viewing to take everything in.Try it.

I'll count this one in the annals of such greats as mulholland dr. or lost highway, or donnie darko(different yet still the same in terms of depth).

"""The Game"" - a first draft","I don't know where Cameron Crowe found the nerve to put in the credits ""Written for the screen and directed by Cameron Crowe"" - I mean, ALL he did was translating straight from Spanish the original ! And the truth is, some rewriting - maybe even a lot - or at least a slightly more adventurous adaptation might have served the movie well. True, the whole crippled act by Tom Cruise is quite surprisingly convincing and probably better than in the original, but it doesn't make up for the (unchanged) ridiculous ending - not as convoluted as it's cracked up to be, it just looks like a cheap trick from a scriptwriter who couldn't decide how to tie up the story's loose ends. (By the way, the love story, supposedly central here, is not well served by a total lack of ""onscreen chemistry"" between the Cruizes.) 	So if you want to see a really witty script toss around ""LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriendshipSex"", you're better off with David Fincher's The Game which, when you think about it, has a lot in common with this movie - except that it opposes, to a relatively bland story with a far-fetched, sci-fi-like ending, a mind-blowing story with a remarkably sober ending.

She reeks sensuality, and makes you wish you knew someone like her.Cameron Diaz, where not the person I would pick for raunchy sex scenes and profanity, was convincing in her portrayal of a ""stalker in love.""One thing I didn't care for was a sex scene towards the end that was a little too long and disturbing for my tastes, it added to the plot, but it wasn't necessary to shoot it like that.One more thing, I don't think you have to be the intellectual that many people are claiming to be that ""got"" the movie, I think that is a snobby thing to say, but you DO have to pay attention.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Felt Cheated at the end,"Without a doubt,  the worst Tom Cruise movie ever.  The only thing saving this movie were the performances given by Tom and Cameron Diaz. I was on the verge of a deep, restful sleep right up until the middle of the movie, and the ending was a complete letdown.  * 1/2 out of *****",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Am I dreaming?,"This film left me amazed. I really don't want to give an ounce of the movie away because the less you know going in the more you'll get from it. The performances were strong and Cameron Crowe pulled the strings wonderfully. There were times this movie was a still as a Minnesota lake and others when it was as rough as the Hawaiian surf, and the directing was seamless.I have to say I am shocked that so many IMDb uses are complaining about ""Vanilla Sky"" being frustrating and overly complicated and leaving audiences unfulfilled. While ""Vanilla Sky"" is certainly full of twists and turns and makes you think a great deal, it's about 100 times less taxing than ""Memento,"" which I consider one of the best movies of the last 10 years.I have yet to see original, foreign version of this movie, but I certainly look forward to doing so. Again, there are those who are bitching and moaning about this version paling in comparison to the original. It seems to me that the screenplay is strong enough that both versions can have their own merits.I gave it 9 out of 10 ... a borderline Oscar nomination. Wouldn't be surprised to see it get one, wouldn't be shocked if it didn't. But if you like movies that stick in your head beyond the time you're in the theater (unlike Ocean's 11, which was enjoyable, but out of the mind by the time I turned the ignition going home) you'll get your money's worth. Trust me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Challenging but intriguing,"I found this movie to be in turn challenging, frustrating and intriguing. I did feel manipulated by the director, Cameron Crowe, but that is his job. Tom Cruise did a solid job as David Aames, not quite as good as in Minority Report.  Penelope Cruz showed limited range, but did have good chemistry with Tom (which later continued offscreen.)  Jason Lee was excellent as David's best friend, as was Cameron Diaz as his sometime lover Julie. Kurt Russell was fair as David's psychiatrist. I found the ending a little too tidy.  Maybe I should see it again to truly judge it.  I would have rather have solved the mystery through the story. The use of music was effective for the most part. The eclectic soundtrack mirrored Cruise's confusion. I was disturbed by the characters' lack of spiritual awareness.  There was no questioning of God by David at any time during his ordeal. That just accentuated his superficiality.  Sophia, meaning ""divine wisdom"" was supposed to fill that void in his life.  That could have been better developed.  The movie could have been edited better, especially in the first half.  I'd say it is most similar to the Matrix and the Sixth Sense, which deal with similar themes of ontology.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Bogs down in its own pretentions...,"If you find inane dialogue witty, if disjointedness is your idea of a film on the cutting edge, if pretentiousness is your cup of tea, I give you VANILLA SKY. This movie bogs down in its own pretentions. Overdone and overlong, this one confounds the viewer to the very end (when the ""cheat"" ending becomes clear). Tom Cruise cruises through this one like a man truly stunned by the hammer, but it's just not enough. Especially given the aforementioned lamebrained dialogue (which is straight out of some dreadful made-for-tv movie). It's just not an engaging film on any level. Much better was JACOB'S LADDER (although that film, too, punked out in the end with a much-used cheat ending that undermined everything that came before).",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Definitely a different movie.....,"I really could not wait to see this film. Tom is always great, (sans Eyes Wide Open), the rest of the cast is great also. I loved the movie Jerry M. (Plain and simply I love movies.) Vanilla Sky has no comparison to plain vanilla anything. It was exhausting both emotionally and mentally. I feel it has entertainment substance, but not at the same level as a typical Hollywood cookie cutter movie. After the movie was over I must admit I was disappointed and speechless. In fact I spoke nothing to my wife until we were out of the theater, and then my first words were `people who take acid should not make movies' , `there should be a law against it somewhere!'. Does anyone remember Funny Farm with Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith-Osborne? In the movie she reviews his horrible script. She said she couldn't keep up with what was going on because of too many flashbacks, several flash forwards and even a couple of flash sideways¬Ö. Well she could have easily been reviewing this movie!! However, for the past 3 days I have mulled the story over and over in my head many times, and believe it or not I feel compelled to recommend this movie. The premise/plot of the movie is awesome.

This movie bends your brain,"I kept looking for a 'jumping-off' point in this film, something that I could start with, but the film kept weaving its strands with a complexity that enthralled me. Even if the ending had been revealed at the beginning of the film, I still would have enjoyed this film. Tom Cruise doesn't possess much range as an actor, but he does manage to display more than usual here. I recommend this film because it is so different, because when you think you've got it figured out, you're still a long ways away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Definitely disturbing and bizarre but good aspects,"It took me a while to understand why those who viewed it before me said Vanilla Sky was bizarre but by the end I totally agreed.The fact that Tom Cruise's character is such an unlikeable guy is a testament to his acting.  His portrayal of a wounded, tormented man was very good.  Cameron Diaz and Jason Lee were also very good.  I loved Kurt Russell as the shrink and found myself rooting for him to make a difference in the film.  Penelope Cruz has some good moments but her speech patterns detract from her lines.  It is not the accent, for I find accents appealing.  She could use a speech therapist to help her change her speech errors!It is not an erotic thriller as it is advertised but rather a very dark, bizarre, somewhat despairing film with some great performances.I do not enjoy foul language or scenes that cause viewers to become voyeurs.   Although the sex scenes are important to the plot they were overdone. I feel conflicted by the  bizarre plot twists and darkness of this film in terms of recommending it to others.  I definitely do not recommend it to anyone under 20.  I do feel some of the performances were worth watching.  Perhaps my conflicts could be soothed if I recommend seeing it only for matinee prices!",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
FLAWED MESS BUT WATCHABLE,"Panned by the critics, but I like Crowe. So I gave it a go. I can see where the critics are coming from. It's overlong, and Cruise is not a sympathetic character.

"An underestimated, fantastic, intelligent movie!","I'm sorry if my english fails sometimes, I'm dutch so forgive me.... Why do I find this movie at the romantic comedy's in my local video shop?

One of the best movies in recent release - trusts the viewer's intelligence,I was pleasantly surprised by the premise and meticulous execution of this gem (although the sound track was a tad too distracting). The plot reminded me of sci-fi great Philip K. Dick's story I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon. To dissect this movie would be to give too much away. I had to watch the movie over again to get the nuances and it was well worth the effort. Hope more intelligent movies such as this one get made.,9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Not quite compelling, but some interesting interpretations of a superior work","This remake of Open Your Eyes is mostly a point-by-point remake of the original film, but a number of changes in characterization and story drive the film to ultimately have a different (and rather confused) message and consequently, not as potent a work in terms of overall storytelling as its Spanish predecessor. It still has some merit in being a little bit of a mind-trip and slight meditations on the variety of themes that it chooses to embrace.The story is again about a handsome young man that has it all. However, it comes crashing down on him when he makes a costly decision and then things start getting weird. Part of the issue that I have with this film is that it really fails to strongly set up (and maintain) a motivation for the protagonist to make the later decisions that he does. While it does have a really good (and different) set-up with the protagonist and his relationship to his successful late father, this gets lost as the film progresses and somewhere in the middle of the film, the protagonist suddenly picks up a rather difficult to believe motivation in ""love"", which is difficult to believe because elements of his original motivation still drive a lot of his decision-making.In the end, this lack of focus on a central theme (or premise) for the film causes it to lose overall thematic coherence, lessening its impact. Director Cameron Crowe does manage to create his own unique take on the look of the film and at times it's quite impressive and unique to his own style. Another thing to note about the film is that it has a wonderful soundtrack. The film is full of great pop-rock-alt music. Unfortunately, the music hardly lets up for very long and gives the drama little room to breath. Furthermore, the mix throws the music up too much in the front and sometimes makes it hard to focus on the film. Never have I so hated the fact that such a great soundtrack was present in the film.On the positive side, the players all inject their characters with interesting performances that differ from the original's characters. The work overall isn't that convincing, especially in creating a dreamlike mood for the various dreams, but that might also be my personal taste for subtlety combined with my general foreknowledge of how the plot's going to play out affecting my perception.In the end, Vanilla Sky does manage to conjure up some interesting images and meditations, but falls short of being compelling. It's biggest weakness is the lack of believable character motivations and a coherent theme and premise to the story. That and the overdone soundtrack. I found Vanilla Sky to be just short of a passable watch in the end and while it might be a decent mind-trip of a film, if you want to choose between this one and the Spanish original, I highly suggest the original, a far more compelling, even if problematic, work. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Always the old styles...,"In the first section, I can see only Tom Cruise playing his old styled roles.  I just wonder how long can Tom keep on make money by his face like this.

This movie was pretty fun for about 45 minutes, but as soon as it ventured into the film noire/sci fi angles, it become trite and boring.

Pretty good but fails to live up to the original,"Most people are probably not aware that this is a remake of the movie ""Abre Los Ojos"". Its not inspired by ""Abre Los Ojos"" it literally is a remake following the plot and original scenes nearly exactly. I am lucky to have read several reviews of Vanilla Sky suggesting to watch the original (which is in Spanish) before Vanilla Sky. I can only agree.In Vanilla Sky Tom Cruise delivers a nice performance. In fact, his performance (aside from a couple things he does in here that are just bizarre) along with the script are what carry the film. However, Eduardo Noriega, the original actor, delivers a better performance. Penelope Cruz actually plays the same character in both movies. However, she is better in the original for a few reasons. One, she gives a more nuanced performance and comes across better in her native tongue, two, she has better chemistry on screen with Eduardo, and three, her character makes more sense playing opposite the rival girl in the original than opposite Cameron Diaz who is a little too charismatic and beautiful to be playing the role of second best.The original also never lapses into mediocrity. However, here there are a number of scenes where the acting or some of the secondary characters wanes. The ending in Vanilla Sky also was shot in a way that unfortunately cheapens and takes away some of the impact of the original script (I don't want to say more and spoil it).In short, I found Vanilla Sky to be an interesting watch especially as I was able to compare it to Abre Los Ojos in every scene. It is understandable that producers would want to bring the story and script of Abre Los Ojos to a more mainstream audience, as it is brilliant, and therefore make Vanilla Sky. However, as often happens with remakes this one lacks the power of the original and I can only really recommend to you to see the original first.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

"Worth watching, but you need a little patience","I just watched this movie for the second time.

Prior to the accident, he's a less humorous version of Jerry Maguire. After the accident, his character, along with the story, is more complex, darker. The makeup job for the ""scary"" version of him was well done.  Cruise does something in his acting that is hard to describe.  His performances are not great in the sense that you immerse yourself in his character and forget the actor (ala Edward Norton).  But at the same time, some of the nuances in his performance are so good that you still admire the overall performance. He's like a classic stage actor that exagerates a bit too much, but there is something interesting about the way he does it, so you still enjoy the performance.  Cameron Diaz doesn't add much to the film until the car ride, where she gets pretty scary.  Penelope Cruz, well, I'm not crazy about her acting, but she does a passable job.  Jason Lee is good as the best friend.You have to listen to this movie closely.

The main hook which really pulled me in was the idea how taking people in your life for granted and not thinking about the consequences of your actions can totally alter your life... and it's one of those things that stick with you after you see the film and get's you thinking - always a good thing in my book.Cruise was extremely believable as the silver-spoon kid who's life disintegrates round him, Cruz a little less so - a bit wooden I thought, but the winning performance for me was put in by Diaz who proves her acting talents far outshine her modelling prowess with every film (okay, mibbe not Charlie's Angels)... she is actually bloody scary in this film... majorly neurtotic, kinda like in 'Very Bad Things' - nuts.The only bad things I have to say about the film is that it perhaps drags on at certain points and doesn't keep the tension of the movie as tight as it should be, and there's a few really twee scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

A thriller that the TV spots said had twists that no one should give away...That got me excited. I like twists, if they are LOGICAL!!! This movie felt like it went to extremes just like A.I.:Artificial Intelligence did. I was hoping for something not so extreme and boring. Something that made sense to the previews. ] In the ads, they make it look like Cameron Diaz is trying to blackmail him into being charged for murder, when that is not how the movie goes at all. It goes to such an extreme, that its hard to sit still. MY Words don't express MY feelings. But I think Variety said it best...""A Crushing Disappointment."" 2/10 is what I give it. And I give it that high of a rating because it piqued my interest once or twice only to be shot down with it CRAP!!!",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Each to his own interpretation,"Its impossible to comment if this is a good movie or not, because it falls under the category of experimentation and phycology. Many have tried to compare this film to 'fight club', but really such comparisons are futile. 'Fight club' is a phycological theme which appeals to the mass. Its action packed and fast. On the other hand this film is an experiment in interpretation. I must say i enjoyed the experience but not all the other people who saw it with me were impressed.I must however say that, although intelligent, the ending just was not in syncrony with the rest of the film - just like the A.I. ending it might have been omitted or diffused somehow!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"A trip for the mind, Crowe pulls of this surreal film","Vanilla Sky is a haunting and beautiful masterpiece from Cameron Crowe. This film was an interesting move for Cruise and Crowe, especially Crowe whose films include Almost Famous and Jerry Maguire. For a movie called Vanilla Sky (which describes how Monet painted his skies) I was expecting a more surreal experience. The dream sequences didn't blend well and can leave the audience scratching their heads. With its large budget they could have taken more use of computer effects to give a truly dreamlike feel. Instead it can feel more like just another murder mystery then the intended journey of the mind. The ending, one of the most hyped parts of the film isn't a new concept and has been used in multiple earlier movies. This doesn't mean I disliked the ending, quite the contrary; it fit the film well and added a whole new dimension to the film. Crowe's look at how pop culture affects our lives and the way it affects our personal views of happiness was masterfully done, especially in the intro of Tom Cruise running through a deserted Time Square. It is impossible to review Vanilla Sky without mentioning the amazing assortment of music laced throughout the film. Each song fits perfectly with each scene whether its Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place or Peter Gabriel's Salisbury Hill. Crowe did an excellent job of choosing a collage of different music, which sets the changing moods of each scene. Was this film as mind blowing as the advertisements say it will be? Not quite. It is hard to advertise this type of film properly. The commercials gave away key parts of the film, which were less effective after seeing them on television a dozen times. Plus the viewer may just ignore the film altogether and not enjoy the ride just waiting for the ending. It is hard for a movie to live up to the hype of (what I believe) is the best movie trailer ever. Not every scene was effective, but Vanilla Sky's concept and attempts to take you somewhere new make it a personal classic. Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The higher you climb...,"Heading into the last third of the movie, Vanilla Sky had plenty going for it.  Consequently, it had plenty at stake and the final third of the film became one of the most frustrating, disappointing and underwhelming finales in memory.  Two glaring complaints:1. The dreamworld/reality plot labyrinth was foolishly summarized like a 3rd-grade book report... twice.2. All that build-up, dreams piled on top of dreams, masquerading as a possible crime story, all the while instructing us not to take everything at face value... and all it amounts to is ____________ ?!!No, I don't want to ruin it for everyone, but its almost as if Cameron Crowe wrote himself into a corner, grabbed the screenwriter's bible on coy-plot-developments-that-can-get-you-out-of-any-jam, and just plugged in the latest in hack sci-fi vision-of-the-future crap.  A note to Crowe:  If your entire film amounts to _________ , make sure you craft it in such a way that we care when we finally do find out.  Or better yet, take advantage of the mesmerizing first 2/3rds by having it all amount to something original and thought provoking.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Was there a time you've had a dream?,"This movie was amazing.  It takes what is seemingly one type of movie and twists itself completely into another genre.  I've seen comments and reviews that ripped this movie and I think to hate this movie, you'd have to either have trouble following it or just be quite sour.

Utter disappointment,"I managed to catch a sneak preview of this film at my university and have to say I was thoroughly unimpressed. Cameron Crowe crafts an enthralling and disturbing first two acts, only to ruin his work with a pathetic cop-out ending. I'm not sure how much Crowe's plot deviates from the foreign language original, but this is a truly disappointing effort from one of the industry's better writer/directors. The film is rendered all the more disappointing when you realize that some truly great dialogue (especially from Jason Lee and Penelope Cruz' characters) was squandered on an utterly forgettable movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Nicely paced thriller; not exactly original,"Overall, I liked this.  It was pretty intelligent most of the time, despite a tendency to talk down to the audience.  Probably the most notable thing about this film is its unyielding romanticism regarding the universe, which is admirable in any film these days.This film owes a LOT, though, to David Lynch.  The plot structure, characters, and thematics felt like they were all ripped from Lynch's films. Crowe not so subtly pulls in elements from Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and the recent Mulholland Drive to tell his story.  This naturally puts Crowe in a harsh light, since his use of the elements is not nearly so masterful as Lynch's.  Instead of a stream of consciousness film about the human condition, we have one that paints itself into a corner and then struggles fervently to get out- although it should be noted that the film DOES succeed, the ending only passes the credibility test by the skin of its teeth.That said, this is worth seeing.  Certainly one of the better films to come out lately.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Be Prepared to Think.,"I like this film because it makes you think. It is in no way a standard feel good film or action flick in the traditional sense. The trailers for the film are rather misleading because none of them mention anything besides the fact that Cruz, Cruise, and Diaz are in it.A lot of critics hated this film because of the plot. Perhaps that's why the studios didn't advertise it. However, judging from the reviews of other people on this site, this film has found an appreciative audience.Vanilla Sky challenges the viewer to figure out what is real and what is not. Its plot is a close cousin of films like Jacobs Ladder, The Others, Mullholand Drive, Fight Club, Lost Highway, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense. All of these films play off the concept of alternate realities. If you like films that make you wonder if you're living a dream, then check out this film.My only personal qualm with the film is that, if you take it literally, you have no reason to fear death and therefore can do horrible things to others, and to yourself, and somehow be a better person because of it. That is... IF you have enough money. I don't think this something the director or writer was purposefully trying to portray, but that's what I got out of the film, among other, less selfish things. All this means that the director didn't have a concise vision for the film.Vanilla sky is a spooky, eerie, thought provoking film. But because of a jumbled vision, the film will not be a classic. It COULD have been better but it's not bad at all. I give it 80% out of 100%. Better than average but not A material.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Worthless if you've seen the original,"It's hard to comment on this adaptation objectively if you've already seen the terrific ""Abre los Ojos.""

Almost a good movie,"This was almost a good movie.  A great cast. Good characters, especially Julie Gianni(Cameron).  But a story that starts out hooking you but starts to wander.

Tom C. did a great job playing a tormented man.The theater was totally silent at the ending. Some shook their heads. Everyone in the movie has been part of better movies.It felt almost as disappointing for the ""meaning of Life"" type ending as the movie ""AI"". It would have been better with a more down to earth, human nature based or sinister ending than the ""message"" given.

A succinct appraisal,"A beautifully crafted film which may leave some with a feeling of unresolve. This is due to the nature of the main character's experiences.  Flitting from supposedly real events to the surreal it truly is a Lucid experience. The plot is hard to unravel at first but later starts to become apparent with a truly superb finale.  Set in New York about a man who has everything, the looks, the wealth, the lifestyle...but is it all as it really appears? Watch and you can decide.A great sound track to add to the impact of the whole experience opening with radioheads superb ""Everything In Its Right Place"" from Kid A, amongst many other gems.Watch out for the opening scene which was actually shot in Time Square, no CGI here!Definetly recommended but not for those who need the plot to be spelled out. Not for dumbheads!!Sit back, relax and enjoy what is most definetly Tom Cruise's best work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Spooky and intriguing,"This one kept me on the edge wondering how it would all get tied together in the end.  It felt like it would leave me with a sense of awe at the solution to the puzzle.  And, BOY, it did not disappoint.  Although for me it tied together well, it is one of those films that allows the viewer the luxury of watching it again and seeing many more layers and possible solutions to the puzzle laid before you.  The acting was great, with the possible exception of Penelope Cruz in a few scenes. (I felt she played a little too much on her foreign intrigue rather than true acting skill in a couple of spots [Just a very few spots]).One of the players that I feel may have gotten overlooked was Cameron Diaz. She was TOTALLY believable, even when she seemed to flip from playful to deadly serious in the blink of an eye--and she did evil very well.  Tom Cruise is one of the most overlooked actors in Hollywood, in my opinion.  He is always solid and is much more than a pretty face.  Unfortunately, he is usually surrounded by bundles of talent (Jerry Maguire, Rainman) and oftens get overlooked.  This is probably his best delivery in his career as of yet. And Jason Lee holds his own.  He is not over-powered by the ""beautiful"" people he is surrounded by.Cameron Crowe is a masterful storyteller, and I am glad he does not just go for the easy quick Hollywood fix.  Too many movies today are just predictable--entertaining the first time you watch, but nothing to go back for later.  Vanilla Sky definitely makes you want to go back for seconds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Astonishingly Bad,"Vanilla Sky is a mess. It's hard to believe a studio would actually let a film like this be made. Not because of how bad it is (bad movies are made all the time) but of how bizzare it is. I watched this film expecting a clever, suspenseful thriller. Was I ever wrong, Vanilla Sky is the bastard offspring of Sci-Fi, Romance, Drama and Arthouse, and instead of revealing bit by bit of the plot, leaving you on the edge of your chair in suspense until the end of the film, it is contrived and ridiculous. Sadly it seems some mistake inane and ridiculous for clever and creative, considering it's 7.0 Imdb rating and $100M box office take. To those, a little advice: Open Your Eyes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
an innovative and refreshingly new idea for a film,"as an avid movie watcher, i've probably seen just about every plot summary known to man kind.  From the traditional hero gets bad guy to the psycho killer melodrama genre, i've probably seen it all.  After watching vanilla sky I would have to say it was one of the most original story lines i've ever seen.  Without giving anything away, i would have to say this was one of Tom C's best and most compelling performances.  For the first time he delves into a more versitile role than the american pop culture icon type roles he is widely known for.  in fact i would say that each cast member holds their own in tying the story together.  despite all these good characteristics i would also like to say that the movie does tend to eek along rather slowly into its climax.  But as a wiser man than myself once said, ""anything thats good is worth waiting for""  and this movie is no exception.  I would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys ensightful movies with good plots.  All in all a complete winner.  8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Crowe succeeds at trying something new,"Writer/Director Cameron Crowe, who gave us such touching films as ""Jerry Maguire"", ""Say Anything"", and ""Almost Famous"" uses his craft at making a brilliant love story and successfully combines it with a psychological thriller in ""Vanilla Sky"".  I just saw this film yesterday, and I am still effected by its twists and turns.  Crowe's direction constantly kept my attention and always had me guessing about what was going to happen next. My only complaint about the film is the ending, which dragged about 20 minutes too long and basically walked the viewer through the previous two hours of the film.  Too much was explained and that took away from the surprise ending.Tom Cruise was also exceptional in the film.  He takes the hopelessness he had as a Vietnam vet in ""Born on the Fourth of July"", combines it with his paranoid character in ""The Firm"", and the smoothness of Maverick in ""Top Gun"", and creates an awesome dynamic character. Supporting actor Jason Lee is lovable as always as Cruise's best friend.Overall, i give the film a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Good but weird,"This film, directed by Cameron Crowe, features Tom Cruise in a challenging role as a cocky rich publisher who gets disfigured in a car crash that kills his sometime lover (Cameron Diaz). After that he slowly starts losing touch with reality in a confusing storyline that eventualy comes together at the end. Cruise is actualy quite good in the film, playing someone who can no longer rely on his looks and charm to get by.. Diaz in a smaller role in also good and Penelope Cruz as the object of Cruise affections for much of the film makes a fairly good impression as well.. though the story keeps shifting and turning, it does eventualy come together in a fairly interesting though out-there way.

So Real....Surreal?!?!,"How can i start to convey the absolute truth about how unbelievably unforgettable this movie is. The writing, screenplay, dialogue and the beautiful cinematography where outstanding, but what really dazzled me was the extreme acting skill that was sieved out by the always excellent Cameron Crowe. I am not going to give away major spoilers, because i think this movie needs to be watched, as it is the only way to understand what was going on. I will give you a premise and a little to how each character contributes to the story.Tom Cruise plays a rich kid playboy who is living the dream. He has sex with Cameron Diaz whenever he wants to but has no intention of having relationship with her. Jason Lee plays his BF and employee. In walks Penelope Cruz who quickly absorbs Cruz with those puppy dog eyes that she does so well. After spending one night together, they part with the intention of nourishes their flourishing friendship. As he leaves her apartment that is when the story unfolds. And that is all I'm saying.Cruise brings his character to life, where you understand exactly what type of personality he is. A sincere man with money as a distraction. Although rich kids who have inherited fortunes as opposed to achieving it, already loses the character some points with the viewership but he played the role so well that he doesn't even drift to the side of irritation. As the events transpire we are swept away on a journey through David Aimes mind. The dream state and reality sweep so comfortably in and out of each other that at one point you don't know what or who to believe, which means we are now experiencing the exact emotions of the main character. A dream in a dream in a dream. You start wondering, ""ok, maybe now we're fine, we're back to earth and then you realize we are deeper now than ever before. The plot is tight and the ending delivers answers to all questions asked in the 2hrs preceding. Penelope Cruz was so ""the girl next door"", the one you'd take home to mum. We feel her love for him, or rather what he wished her love to be, I'm still debating that one with myself.You walk away from this glad yet sad, with a sense of victory but failure as well. These terms might be contradictory, but that is what this movie does, it makes sense of the non-sensical. I suggest this movie to everyone who likes excellent movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Damn Hollywood, damn it to HELL!","Well, I hate hollywood, but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters.  And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good.  i was hoping that they would either keep the original ""Open Your Eyes"" exactly the same, or they would make it their own.  Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.It started out good.  I love Radiohead.  I wish there was more of that. But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys.  Talk about a wide range of suck between.  They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax.  It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT.  At least put some meaning behind the songs.  Kid A = primary.  Whatever.He also did a bang up job with the club scene.  That was cool.  Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance.  As if audiences would get the movie.  The ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. Its as simple as that.  The motivations got all screwed up.  I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations (hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before?) and some of the others.  And I hate Kurt Russell.  Stay overboard.  Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. Eyes Wide Shut]).  And the elevator.  I get it.

I will see you in the next life when we are both cats,"I really liked this movie.

Philosophical and thought provoking,"Watching Vanilla Sky made you think it is mostly about nothing until you see the David Aames, played by Tom Cruise, in a mask talking to the prison psychiatrist, played by Kurt Russell.  Then you wonder what has he done that brings him to this situation.  It does lead you through a convoluted story that sometimes didn't make sense, or where character and their relationships did a flip, until it is revealed at the end.  It makes you to think about one's whole existence and the perception of reality, and which state are we in now.Some of the parts were a little forced upon us, mostly the ending, which is like a Scoby-Doo explain it all type of scenario.  The appearance of the tech support for a few scenes and his explanation of David's ability to change his outcome did not make too much sense since he seem to be telling David outright that his is not living in reality.  And I am not sure how in the world he forget such a shocking experience and did not try to apply it to the tragic experience he was encountering?  Others include the beginning scenes where his company is surviving and thriving for any period of time when it is under the control and management of `I don't care about anything beside having fun' David is a little incredible.  Also, the belief that one is reliving an album cover makes no sense unless one sees it from the camera perspective, which I presume, would arouse suspicion.This movie seems to be Tom Cruise's venue to show his acting ability, where he is pretty much driving the whole movie.  Kurt Russell and his interaction was not convincing enough for me to believe that David was looking at the Doctor as a father figure and the Doctor was providing that back.  And forget Pen√©lope Cruz, her acting ability seems to consist of reciting lines.Cameron Crowe seem to not be able to get himself out of the 60/70's time period.  With these old cars, old music, old album cover, etc.  It is great when the plot revolves around it or when it is set in that time period, but when you see everything revolve around it, it kind of detract from the feel of the movie.A interesting film on lucid dreams is Waking Life, where the subject parallels this film, but with a little more of am I asleep or am I awake question.Overall, a good film, with some quirks, but with lots of thoughts to ponder upon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Penelope Cruz (or should that be Cruise?) is much more convincing actress when speaking in her native tongue.2) In the original, the Tom Cruise charactor (Noriega) is far more badly disfigured by the accident.

I think the ending and explanations were so ""far out"" that it distracted me from the film's moral statement:  live a good life, savor every moment.  Life is beautiful and worth living in its own right.  Living is its own reward.The distraction caused by the ""gee whiz"" sci-fi ending nearly ruins the strongest moment of emotional poignancy.  This is Vanilla Sky's only flaw. For that reason I give it an 8 out of 10.  By the way, I'm an enormous fan of science fiction.

"Imaginative, engrossing and anything but vanilla","This is one of the best examples of a movie where there is one true star. Tom Cruise is SO GOOD in each of the essentially three different roles he plays in this movie.  He is so charismatic and believable that everyone else is truly relegated to co-starring roles.  The movie has the same type of surreal quality as a David Lynch film, but happily, Cameron Crowe doesn't leave you pondering what the heck is going on by the time the film ends. Never would have thought I would have said it, but this is a MUST see, Cruise is terrific!  Colorful, imaginative, interesting, confusing, and all nicely wrapped up at the end.  Absolutely loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Beware of false advertising,"I saw this movie on the basis of an interesting trailer.  In the trailer there was no mention that this was a science fiction movie.  I thought I was watching an intelligent, stylish thriller.  Then in the penultimate reel the film identified itself as science fiction.  Bummer.  I felt cheated, like I was the butt of a joke.  If I had known it was science fiction I would not have bothered with this movie.  I really resent being lured into the theatre with false advertising.  That said, it was, for the most part, well done. What I did NOT like about the movie itself (even accepting that it was the old bait-and-switch ploy) was Penelope Cruz.  Why, when we have so many beautiful and talented actresses in America, do we need to go scrounging around and digging up `actors' who cannot even speak English?  I really cannot stand to listen to her squeezing our language out through her nose. I do no find it in the least bit charming.  Ditch this dame.  Enough.  Marry her off to the Frito bandito where they can jabber to each other all they want and I don't have to listen to it. With that exception, I liked all the performances, even Kurt Russell, who switched on to Robin Williams mode for this movie.  Shame on the producers for advertising this movie falsely. I'll ask more questions before I buy my ticket next time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
The little things...,"I walked into this film with scepticism.

Romance, lust, horror, tragedy, comedy. It's all there and realised superbly.The acting is excellent, the story is intelligent and the direction is tight, but for me the high point was the perfect selection of music for each scene (maybe just because I like Radiohead and REM) which pushes home the true emotion and beauty (sometimes tragic) in this grossly underrated masterpiece.If you haven't seen it do.

Spectacular,"""Vanilla Sky"" is one of the most intelligent, most brilliantly told stories in a long time.Tom Cruise stars as a New York City publicist who is having an affair with Cameron Diaz's character, until the day he meets Sofia, played by Penelope Cruz, and falls in love with her. The next day, he gets in a car accident while in the car with the Cameron Diaz character, and that is when the ingenious story begins.The thing to admire the most about ""Vanilla Sky"" is Cameron Crowe's direction. His last film was last year's superb ""Almost Famous"", in which he proved he knows how to tell a good story. In this film, he uses a different style, mood, and genre. Crowe's direction, Cruise's excellent performance, breathtaking cinematography and an ingenious, original plot make ""Vanilla Sky"" one of the best films in years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I'm trying to 'open my eyes' to Vanilla Sky but I keep on falling a.ZZZZzzzzzzzz!,"Why is it that Hollywood makes a fine mess out foreign films! especially when they are made by a Genius such as Alejandro Amenabar.Instead it was americanised, and trying to have more humour but it does not work - It is a bad remake of Abre los Ojos.Tom Cruise was so annoying and kept on grinning, and acted more like the elephant man, I would not consider him to play a Handsome person, his face was still the same with the scars; what difference does it make? and he raise up his personal case of being approached by a man of LIFE EXTENSION and said ""im straight OK!"", like do we care about personal issues of the Hollywood stars? We just wanted to be entertained!Penelope Cruz looked ill, and anaemic, she is not my favorite Actress but she did not shine like the Original, because Tom would be over-shadowed.

What is worse is that Tom and Penny's love-making scenes are like accidentally walking into you parents- So Cheesy! playing with a mole on her chest???? EVEN THE CAMERA LOOKS AWAY TO THE BED BOARD TO PASS THE TIME! The Movie critics across the Atlantic commented on Tom and Penny's disability to set the scene on fire, like Penny was with the original star, Edwardo Noreiga, as the good-looking playboy - at least they made you feel lonesome.Kurt Russell was a waste of talent.Diaz lacks sympathy as a Psycho b**** from hell, who still confuses herself as a Charlie's angel kicking Tom's butt "" oh! Sorry I thought you were a vandal?"" Why Hollywood must portray people as either the innocent goodies or the neurotic baddies in the plot, or having a moral center?? In Abre los Ojos, Nawja Nimri as Nuria was jilted, and felt used and enraged - so you feel sorry for her! and I cared about all the others in Abre los ojos- it is more Sinister, Violent, intelligent, psychological, and Sexy, even the music is brilliant and I felt like watching it again, so I recommend the SUPERIOR Spanish Original.

A horrible remake,"Several cultural nuances damage this americanized version of Abre Los Ochos beyond all hope.  First, the cast chosen is roughly 10 years too old for their roles.  In the original film, all characters were of the college age. Evidently, preserving this element would have introduced its own problems and cultural nuances.  Younger actors would have had to act a bit more maturely than would be appropriate for their age.

"""Tech Supppppoooorrrrttt!""","Halfway through watching Vanilla Sky, I was willing to let go of the whole damn thing and give up on watching it. The plot jumped from drama to romance to suspense and so on, not giving you too many threads or clues as to what's really going on. Thing is, if you lack the proper patience, you lack the tools to fully realize the masterpiece that director Cameron Crowe has created for us here.Vanilla Sky chronicles the strange events that occur to one David Aames (portrayed accurately by the ever so talented Tom Cruise), a 33 year-old New York playboy, who's lavish lifestyle and reckless behavior is about to take a sudden and extremely violent twist. Aames is the sole inheritor of a publishing company and a real lady's man. After encountering the beautiful Sofia at a party (Penelope Cruz, who also became Cruise's real-life partner for a while at the time this movie hit theaters), David seemingly has a reason to finally settle down and let go of his hectic manners. Unfortunately, that's exactly when reality comes around in the shape of Julie, a hurt and neglected ex-lover who's determined to settle the score with him once and for all ¬ñ thus denying him the chance of love and happiness he took away from her so abruptly. The jaded lover (Cameron Diaz, in an eccentric and unconventional role) takes David on a highway to hell, driving them both into a tragic car accident. When David wakes up, his face is deformed, his ownership of the company is at risk, and he's haunted by whatever has happened to Julie. Our hero has to grow up and adjust to the harsh reality quickly, or else he'll lose what little he has left. However, adapting to the new status isn't as easy as it may seem. Something has changed in his post-accident life, and he can't quite put his finger on it. Whatever it is, it all comes down to the choices he made after the accident, those turns of fate that now come back to haunt him, thrusting his life into a nightmarish reality ¬ñ if, indeed, you can call his existence a realityThroughout the film, Tom Cruise plays the tormented David with such accuracy, you really believe he's going through all these highly surreal events. In the end, without spoiling the film entirely, it's all about the way we handle the choices we make in life, and our never ending pursuit after the things we want the most. It's that bittersweet feeling you can always open your eyes and take the other path in life, that also made me return to this film and watch it over and over again throughout the course of the 5.5 years that went by since I first watched it in theaters.In time, I found many comparisons between the film and the general feel of this decade ¬ñ which Vanilla Sky captures best. When Cruise's David loses his looks and becomes old real fast, it's the filmmaker foreshadowing our need, as a society, to wake up and face our problems instead of running away from them. The mixture of genres also blends well into this theory, as none of us really know how to approach the historical shifts all around us. When David runs through the empty streets and passes the abandoned Times Square, I saw our whole generation seeking for something familiar amidst the cold and aggressive present.Bottom line - after watching hundreds and hundreds of Hollywood products from the 2000's, Vanilla Sky remains one of the most compelling and brilliant films I am yet to have seen this decade. It's an intense and intriguing story from A to Z, which really only makes you understand it completely towards the final quarter of the film, when it shifts into yet another genre - Science Fiction.P.S.: Watch out for one of the most bizarre uses of a Beach Boys song toward the end of the movie, when all things truly go berserk.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
This is the worst movie ever.,"I dont understand what all the hoopla about this movie is.  When will I ever find a movie critic who will tell me the truth?  This move stank.  Stank, it is probably still stinking somewhere right now.  Nothing personal against Tom Cruise and Camron Crowe, Jerry Maguire makes my all time top 10 list at number 10, but what the *^!@ was that.  And I dont want to here how I didnt ""get it""  or wasnt ""smart enough"" that movie was garbage.  Im all in favor of a movie that all comes together in the end and leaves you thinking as you drive home, The Sixth Sense and Fight Club, for example, but I strait up wanted my money back.  Erotic thriller?  Whats erotic about Crowes recent habit of cast tiny chested women in topless roles, Cruz and Hudson.  This movies ending made about as much sense as the monkeys from Planet of the Apes flying in on helicopters to save the day in Black Hawk Down.  Erotic thriller, when?  Why, Why Why.  And I am expecially sorry about Camron Diaz being nominated for a Golden Globe.

boring,"To begin with, to promote a movie for the fact to have shot a scene in an empty times square to me doesn't sound the only content that a movie should contain. You can do that also with CG or other special effect so that didn't impress me much. The whole movie was a stealing from dozens of films. Things I have seem before. IT could be summarize as a movie of a 30 years old crises as well. or the love-film of cruise-cruz. Sorry, that also doeasn't really attract me much to go to see the movie. I went to see the film because I was tricked: the trailer promised a thriller of some kind. The movie was very slow, incredible slow. It could have as well been an episode of the Twilight Hour or something. The plot was simple and didn't really need so much time to display. 30 minutes would have been enough. Cameron Crowe once again revealed that he is not really a skilled director. He just takes here and there, also the mixed filming technique is pretty annoying - you cannot tell what his style his. Beside the movie is made by cinematographer, director of photography, cameramen, set designer. The director is around to coordinate all this, you don't need much to be a director today. SOme new director know a lot of this stuff but sometime it looks like that director means just a name the production company wants to market as much as they can to sell the next movie and the next and the next and so on. Cruz acting, although she wasn't that bad in this film makes me wonder of how does she get in all these movies. I suppose she has a kickass agent because I don't think she is such a good actress as they portrait her in mags (see Blow with JOhnny Depp for instance). About the story of the movie, I haven't seen the original film (and that's another thing that annoys me, it was a movie made in 1997, is that necessary allready to make a remake? Don't hollywood writers have ideas on their own?), but everything was predictable from one scene to another and even often the dialogues were predictable, and I believe that's a very bad thing for a movie which is considered ""brilliant"", ""imaginative"", and so on... If you read the reviews anyway of the film in a few months, finally you will be able to read the real ones where writers will express their opinion finally because right now they are all just promoting the movies... it's marketing and business and I felt in it. Music. All those songs coming here and there... edited just like a music video... I felt like I was watching a promotional film for a CD Compilation sometime. As much as people would say, the songs are connected to the story... well, that's actually cheap... not a big deal if you ask me. It is easy to solve things that way. But on the other hand we all know how it work in the business. Even a non-sense tune recorded as a joke by a band against everything and most of all against ""business"" like the Radiohead tune in the opening scene can be negotiatable. I think that say it all... I worked for one of their videos once. And they were saying at that time - we are not going to do anymore videos!  Yeah right. At leats a different attitude would be more coherent... but that's another story. To end, ""Vanilla Sky""? What's the big deal with the painting and the story really? There wasn't much there either. My advice is to actually avoid this film. It is about time that some directors and production company get turned down. Don't give them your money! Beside, does someone remember ""Almost Famous""? Well, also there the reviews said ""Great"", ""Fantastic"", ""Amazing"" and if you read reviews now the rating has gone much down. Power of media and marketing I suppose. It's not fair, I still believe movies must have a story to tell. Just a few scenes filmed in a spectacular way should be all a movie contains.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Spiritual Evolution? Maybe,"There is a very interesting aspect to the movie that may have been left unnoticed which refers to the fact that Tom Cruise's character may actually have died as a result from suicide, and that all the rest of the story refers to him getting adapted to his condition as a spirit, by trying to get the treatment he would be entitled to in the other dimension or parallel universe if you will. In my very particular way of seeing things, I am led to believing that whatever it was that happened to him was the result of the conditions in which he disembodied. By being deformed he may not have accepted death itself, and in this sense, was around, or even better, just wandering around the world of the living for ages until he was informed he was able to climb up to another level of threshold he was sent to, this being understood as the Suicidal Valley. It might as well be understood that his jump was the moment of evolution of his spirit, despite the fact that he may have been evolved to another level even in the body of a cat, where the whole procedure of spiritual evolution would definitely get its start. OPEN YOUR EYES could be understood as ""Ok! One Hundred and Fifty Years have gone by and you have finally learned its time to move on and reincarnate as cat!

Abomination,"I've seen, and love, the original film Abre los Ojos by Alejandro Amenabar. Having seen it several times, and as an actor, I can comment on how well constructed every moment of the film is.  The story is constructed to keep you constantly wondering what exactly is going on from beginning to end and the acting is so perfect that the performances mimic real life. Unfortunately Vanilla Sky is but a pale reflection of the film it so shamelessly attempts to copy.By taking what is meant to be a convoluted story and overexplaining it, Cameron Crowe dulls the impact significantly and turns it into an almost unintentional comedy.  The concept is far fetched and Amenabar was well aware of that when he wrote Abre los Ojos.  Apparently Crowe felt that the only way to keep an audience interested is by attempting to tie up every loose end to the point where it becomes redundant and completely uninteresting.  We understand what is happening almost an hour before it ends so why must it be consistenly drilled home?Unfortunately the real disappointment is in the performances.  Tom Cruise is no better than a dime store version of the original's Eduardo Noriega and Penelope Cruz lacks any of the charisma she had in the original.  Also, the intentions of all of the actors are so far from how the story is designed that it ruins any impact the film could have had.  The usually excellent Jason Lee was obviously given no direction and flounders aimlessly in his character.  Cameron Diaz is so abominable that she can't, even for a moment, convince me that she is even attempting to stay in character.  Of course the fact that Crowe wrote the characters so lifelessly that they would not have been convincing regardless of who the actors were.In the end I'd highly recommend staying as far from this abomination as possible and watching the far superior Abre los Ojos.  I know this is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back so hopefully you won't have to suffer the same fate.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I found the way she slotted into this odd movie rather interesting and Penelope Cruz's best performance without a doubt. Tom Cruise not so sure about. He did well but it certainly isn't the one they'll be talking about when he dies (which would be Top Gun and Eyes Wide Shut). Since Kurt Russell wasn't in it for very long at all I did find it hard to make a decision as to whether he did well or not but considering he came in and tried to explain everything yet I was still wondering what was happening I'm going to say it was nothing memorable.

A Disapointment,"Being excited once again to catch another Cameron Crowe flic yet again.  The director who brought one of the greatest films of last year into being if not the best (Almost Famous), and the work of Jeremy Macguire, gives us a rework of a Spanish film named Abre Los Ojos (open your eyes).However the results of this work pale in comparison unfortunatly to Crowe's previous glorious shining moments.  This twighlight zone, dreamscape of a film ends up being not a fascinating memorable piece of work, but a tedious exercise.  While everything seems to be there, good casting, good actors, and an intriguing story, it doesn't flow.  It seems very choppy and more distintresting.  Vanilla sky has the unfortunate habit of leaving the viewer stranded, instead of letting them hitch on a more intriguing ride.Basicaly Tom Cruise is a rich kid with an easy life, and easy beautiful woman he lusts after on one side, until he falls for Penelope Cruz when she comes to his birthday party.  As the film progresses we meet more characters, we are subjected to flashbacks, intercutting of scenes in the future, some in the past, all with that twighlight zone feel and leaving you disoriented (I can't describe more without giving away too much).  In reality we as the viewer soon begin to realize that we see is not the whole truth as the film toys with the idea of is this real? or is it imagined?  While this has been done greatly in films this year like Mulholand Drive, and the BRILLIANCE of films like Memento, Vanilla Sky leaves the viewer unwilling to even care.  Too many of the scenes go on for far too long, and I lost interest several times.  Many times I wanted this film just to end.  The film does make sense to me and I don't think a second viewing would add to my experience, if anything the first viewing was more of a chore, its one thing to watch a film and be motivated and be awed on screen, than to sit through a disoriented piece with no connection.Cameron really missed the ball on this one and it's unfortunate.  His touch is there ecspecialy the incorporation of music and scenes (loved the opening scene of empty New York) but in the end this film fails.  So many people in the audience just kept groaning within the last 45 minutes as the scenes and developments kept popping up. I felt their pain..Rating 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Watch Abre Los Ojos instead!!!,"I can find no justification for this remake other than as a trade off for Amenavar to get Cruise to produce The Others. And the story for the Others and Amenavar's track record is so good that I'm sure this wasn't necessary for his jump to ""studio"" flicks. Abre Los Ojos is not some old black and white movie or low production value gerrilla film which could really be rediscovered by the gloss ""contemporary"" hollywood treatment. Abre Los Ojos is fine as it is, more elegant, shocking, and intensely directed than Vanilla Sky and it's not even 5 years old. Come on. I'm sure Crowe might've enjoyed the break from both writing and directing, but his upbeat talents, gracefully evident in  Almost Famous are totally out of place in this work-for-hire remake of what is a dark, current, exhilarating film: Abre los ojos.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

I can't take any movie seriously when cryogenics is a plot device.,"This movie worked best when it was a straight romance.  The only scene that made me smile was after Tom leaves Penelope's apartment and she pounds her fist on her couch and shakes her head; you could feel her excitement.  Every other moment was a miscalculation.  The dialogue was too cute, the scene in the underground club was pointless, plot twists are never fully explained by the fifteen minute coda (who, exactly, did Tom kill, and how does his subconscious play into it?)Crowe tries to attach a message to this movie -- that Tom's character takes his models for human interactions from pop culture.  This message is too crudely put.I was barely into the movie when Tilda Swinton showed up and then it totally derailed for me.

The ""formula"" films that are the ""rage"" of Hollywood run the usual 95 to 110 minutes and they hit the  demographic marks for all the well known reasons.Vanilla Sky does none of this and I want so much to applaud that notion ""but"" in this case it really confuses at first. If the Cruise and Cruz dynamics is not real I can buy the popcorn next time.  She is beautiful and he is .....well even disfigured he looks like a winner.Perhaps there might have been ways to visit ""Abra Los Ojos"" with less license.  If other folk's work is to be emulated, it seems that a holistic view would have been better instead of stealing the star and copping out the ending. Oh well, if there is to be real change in Hollywood toward works that take chances and ask the viewer to engage their mind as well as their emotions, then efforts like Vanilla Sky need to be supported.  So I say go see it. Don't let anyone ""spoil"" it for you before you do, and just let it flow for awhile and it will sort of grow on you. No awards are in order for cast nor others but it is still a brave effort.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

On Another Planet,Whoever made that movie - was not on this planet. Totally weird.  I just will not waste good $ to see rubbish like this again.

"Good theme, good footage, weak film","Vanilla Sky's theme of casual sex gone seriously wrong is the strongest asset of the film.  The film's cinematography is good (abandoned Times Square with all the neon alive is fine and the dizzying heights atop a skyscraper is petrifying). The acting is great as well.

No suspenseful build-up to have a payoff; and the main character's plight was not compelling enough for me to care.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
weak,"this movie reminded me a little of cameron's ""singles""... the start of VS was far more ""romantic comedy"" then the original Spanish movie that it is based on, namely ""abre los ojos""... however, unlike ""singles"", which strode the borderline between schmaltzy rom-com and offbeat comedy drama, ""vanilla sky"" drifts off into a mushy parallel universe where everyone is witty and charming...this blows the second and more challenging portion of the film out of the water... oddly enough, ""singles"" also had a startling change of pace... where that was handled with deft, wrenching brutality, VS flounders and drowns...too light to be a drama, too strange to work as a comedy...it also sports a soundtrack i would normally applaud, with the likes of radiohead and sigur ros (and others)... but the songs would surface in the worst way, only highlighting the dreamy soft spots or the sunny, mellow acoustic strum parts... this heightened the teenage saccharine feel for me... i think our director has become a little sentimental...i guess most people would accuse me of trying to score cool points by recommending the original, but it really is a far better movie... the lead character is more interesting, despite being thoroughly unlikeable... i guess tom didn't want play a part people might despise...oh and cruz phoned in her performance this time around... it's time to ""open your eyes""...",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
1 of 2 greatest love stories ever told,"To me, the two greatest love stories ever told are Vanilla Sky and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. It is odd that I picked two movies that were made so recently, after the year two thousand, but I really think that film making has evolved lately. The good ones are either written in a way that you are more emotionally involved with the characters and plots. Like in Memento, you could actually feel what Guy Pierce's character was going through with his ""condition"". In Vanilla... and Eternal..., you could actually see their pain and the lengths they were going through to try to be with their lovers! Bottom line, Vanilla Sky is not your typical love story or 'chic flick' and if you have no imagination or aren't a hopeless romantic, then do not bother watching it. If you do and you are, you should fall in love with the characters and the story itself. You'll probably end up buying the DVD as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"A very interesting and fascinating film, though the original is better","First, I'd like to mention that since watching this, I have seen Abre Los Ojos(or 'Open Your Eyes', as it's called in English), the film which this is a remake of. Upon comparison, the Spanish original is by far the better film, in my opinion, in that it is more ambiguous and dark, and more of a science fiction piece, less of a drama. I won't claim that this means that this movie is nothing more than a Hollywood version of the original(as some might suspect it is). This does have its own merit, and Crowe does a fairly good job of translating the film without losing the essence. The film is very interesting, as it's based on a pretty old idea in science fiction(which I won't reveal here, as it's impossible to tell it without giving away the twist of the film, thereby pretty much ruining the experience of it), and it utilizes this idea, which is pretty much the main theme of the film(though you don't know this until the very end) very good. The plot is very good, something most people can relate to, and it moves along at an pretty good pace, but on repeated viewings it does get a little boring. The character development is well-handled, you know what you want and need to know about the characters. The acting is all good, there isn't really any of the actors who doesn't do his or her job well. The characters are well-written and credible. I enjoyed the humor in the film, and the well-placed self-irony of Tom Cruise's character in some scenes. There isn't a lot of humor in the film, but the amount there is, is just right, I think. I liked the film for messing with the audience's mind so much. I will, however, agree with those that say that the end explained too much; it didn't leave much room for further analysis, instead it just handed the answers to you on a silver platter. That was a bad decision, definitely, and it was far better in the original, Spanish film. Explaining everything might have opened it up to a broader audience, but dumbing it down like that disappointed a lot of people who could have figured it out by themselves, and should have been given the chance. Alejandro Almenabar is, by far, the superior director, and his version, the original, Abre Los Ojos, is definitely better than this, and more intelligent, less mainstream. I do think Cameron Crowe did a nice job, though. I recommend this to fans of science fiction and drama, who have the patience for it, and the ability to think about what they see, instead of just taking it for being exactly what it seems to be. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Amazing..if you can handle it,"Vanilla Sky, the remake of Spainish film 'Open you eyes', has received some of the most varied reviews of any film I have ever seen. For me, this is a film that requires the audience to actually engage with what is happening on the screen. As with most things in life, if its not understood, it wont be enjoyed, and unfortunately the more negative reviews of this picture appear to come from those who simply didn't understand the film. This is not straight forward, you wont understand it first time around, if you want to be spoon fed then this is not the film for you. But once you begin to gain an understanding of what actually happens you begin to understand the symbolism that it is attempting to convey. Youth, love, hate, work all of the things that effect all of us. Its a story of dreams and how we strive for the perfect world, but reality often doesn't live up to our expectations. And yet it portrays a beautiful vision of youth culture and the ways in which we search for love. Please watch this film, watch it twice watch it a thousand times because each time you do, u understand just a little more and you love it a bit more. Cruise is amazing, I would say one of his best performances alongside Collateral. just watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"A Glossy, Highly Manipulative Mess! 'Abres Los Ojos' Re-do deserved better treatment","Stanley Kubrick worked with Tom Cruise for over two years, to produce the highly anticipated, visually stunning failure, 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Cruise should still have stretch marks from that fiasco. Tom Cruise seems to be a very sincere, and extremely hard-working actor, unfortunately, he must have believed Cameron Crowe could actually make a more superior psychological thriller than Kubrick; which seems kind of silly. 'Vanilla Sky' is an glossy, manipulative, and ultimately insulting attempt to convince viewers, they are actually watching a very cerebral psycho-erotic work of art. Tom Cruise is once again, out of his element, especially during the painfully absurd psycho-cinema portions of this film. Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' was a visually stylish and beguiling film, which made the Tom Cruise character seem more out of place. 'Vanilla Sky' is a handsome film; but the director's sloppy and manipulative antics are so ridiculous, that Tom Cruise looks pretty good in comparison. The other performances were competent, and I agree with those who feel Penelope Cruz was better in the original film. Also, a tighter film edit may have helped this film. 4/10, mainly for poor direction, and Tom's poor judgment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

The supporting cast was also great..Cameron and Penelope were both beautiful and convincing, but I especially thought Kurt Russell's performance was the best acting he has ever did.., was nice to see him in a non-action film for a change.When you combine the best elements of a Mystery, Drama, Thriller and Sci-Fi in one film, add good Directing and great visuals to go with the excellent acting out of a great story,, well you simply can't go wrong..

"Pretty strange, but entertaining and slickly crafted","Cameron Crowe's (originally Alejandro Amenabar's) Vanilla Sky is a film where reality and dreams (er Nightmares) are blended together into a maddening yet almost refreshing look at one man's trip (that would've been a good explanation) through love, death, and other things in life.  This man is played by Tom Cruise who runs half of a magazine business in New York who has a affair lover on the side (Cameron Diaz who isn't that bad in her scenes), but then falls in love one night with another woman (Penelope Cruz) and then the plot unfolds from there.  You can try to follow along with where the film is going, but be warned that at some point the film diverges into the stranger, and more surreal, though it's explained at the end. Worthwhile despite it's shortcomings, with actual human characters enriching the atmosphere.  Jason Lee and Kurt Russell also star. B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

This movie teaches us how to live a true love...,"First, I wanted to rent this movie when it came out on VHS, but unfortunately, the copies were always gone at my nearest video club. Three days ago, I was finally able to rent a copy. I have never heard more about this movie than the International Preview and I never saw ""Open Your Eyes"" either.The story is about David Aames (Tom Cruise) who's a rich man who inherited from his father. David has a lot of charm and have no problem with having the girl he wants in his bed for one night only. His latest ""friend"" is Julie Gianni who's brilliantly played by Cameron Diaz. David doesn't believe in love until the night of his birthday when he meets Sofia played by Pen√©lope Cruz. Their meeting is the proof that true love can bloom in one night.

"Good intentions, noble failure","I was rooting for this film.  Cameron Crowe has made some of the best American commercial films in the last two decades, an oeuvre that includes: Fast times at Ridgemont High; Say Anything (arguably one of the best teen films ever made); Jerry Maguire; and the celebratory Almost Famous.  As always, Crowe was working with some of the best talents in the industry, including cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line; Almost Famous) and a cast that included Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell (who hardly resembles Elvis here), Timothy Spall, Jason Lee, and a small part by the always remarkable Tilda Swinton.So, what the hell went wrong?In the film, Tom Cruise plays a CEO of a large corporation who is involved on a ""friend/lover"" basis with Cameron Diaz.  When he wakes up at the beginning of the movie, he hears Penelope Cruz's character telling him to wake up.  He does, and drives to Manhattan, which is totally devoid of people.  Then, he wakes up again....it was a dream.....only to hear Cameron Diaz's voice waking him.  Later, he meets Penelope Cruz's character at a party, accompanied by Jason Lee's character, who is Cruise's best friend. The chemistry between Cruise and Cruz is immediate.At this point, VS takes off into a variety of directions involving various time shifts, including a car accident with the now stalking Diaz character which leaves her dead and Cruise horribly facially disfigured.  In an overlapping thread, he is charged with a murder, although the discourse doesn't let on exactly who he was alleged to have killed.  The leit motif of the movie is to ""wake up,"" as Cruise desperately tries to get clear about what is happening to him, what has happened to him, and where the tsunami of circumstances is taking him.  Eventually, he begins to question the very nature of his reality as he experiences his interpersonal, internal, and physical life collapsing at every turn.Vanilla Sky is the latest addition to the '01 dreamscape genre following the absorbing noir Memento (not a dream, but plays like one), and two brilliant entries:  David Lynch's hypnotic and enigmatic Mulholland Drive; and the compelling Richard Linklater film, Waking Life.   These last three films are some of the finest movies of the year (all on my best 10 list), and a cross comparison with VS reveals a great deal.Two of these better cinematic entries possess a cohesive center.  Even though Memento is a precise exercise in non-linearity, the film presents a strong central character with a connecting plot thread:  he has lost his short term memory, and is trying to go back in time to solve a murder. Waking Life takes its protagonist on a clear line of interactions with remarkable people.  The film-maker's reality comes to us at the same time as the protagonist's, which gives us the sense that we are journeying together with the dreamer.  Mulholland Drive appears to make no sense and would seem to suffer from the same problems as VS, but Lynch's cinematography is so mesmerizing, the acting so compelling, the writing so damn brilliant, the scenes so unforgettable, and so incomprehensively real and surreal, that it works anyway.....arguably, it might be the best film of the year.But VS possesses a plot structure that keeps jerking the audience around; the discourse becomes increasingly incomprehensible which leaves the audience with a strained ability to relate to the characters and keep up with the capricious plot changes to the point where the audience becomes exhausted past the point of caring.  And the payoff, when it comes, seems weak and tacked on.  Ultimately, the ending  rearranges the film's tone and meaning which reduces it from an overly confused non-linearity to a trivial mess with a ""feel good"" message that seems even more pretentious and contrived than Spielberg's false endings in ""A.I.""I'm reminded of a story involving James Stewart when he was originally offered to play Scotty in Hitchcock's Vertigo.  Initially, Stewart turned down the first draft of the script because he felt that the film had nothing to ground it in reality.  But, when Samuel Taylor rewrote the script and included Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes), Stewart was said to exclaim, ""Now we have a picture!"" because he correctly realized that now the film had a center that would give the audience a hook....someone with whom they could relate as the action became increasingly surreal and strange.  That, I believe, is the central problem with VS, which offers the viewer no center, and therefore no hope of maintaining verisimilitude.  Any connection the audience might hope to establish with the movie vanishes long before the film-makers flash the final credits.**1/2 stars for me (despite the problems) for the good performances, the look of the film, Crowe's good intentions (a noble failure), and the fact that any film is automatically improved that involves Tilda Swinton.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
A great cast deliver an excellent story in top form.,"Vanilla Sky is an excellent adaptation of the Spanish film Abre los Ojos (open your eyes, which I have also seen). What Vanilla Sky has over the original is excellent performances from all its cast members. Along with Magnolia, this is probably Tom Cruise best performance, I am not a great fan of his commercial work, but you have to respect the man here. His facial expressions are a joy to watch in every shot, it is a great, underrated performance, like George Clooney's performance in Solaris. Cameron Diaz also shines as the 'villain'. I agree with a reviewer here which says that the music was distracting, even though the soundtrack is excellent, it is not appropriate, it seems as if Crowe is trying to make a video of every sequence. However do not let this minor issue stop you from seeing this movie. One of the great things about Vanilla Sky is that although the movie may seem confusing to some, everything is brought together at the end WITHOUT CHEATING. Many movies nowadays tend to get away from a straight narrative, nothing wrong with that, but with a script so full of holes that you could not put it together even with crazy glue, using the BS excuse that they will 'leave it up to the viewer to figure out what they really mean' or 'if you look carefully, it is all there'. Not here. In short, a great surprise from a movie I was not expecting much. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"

Too Slow,"Ebert describes this as requiring heavy lifting. Seems to me that at some point the viewer decides if the reward is worth the lifting and personally by the 90 minute mark I had decided that no ""explanation"" in the conclusion was going to balance out the tedium of the action. Did Cruise deserve to be wealthy? Probably no. Was he responsible? Not much. Did he ""use"" Diaz? Yes. Was she using him? Seems like it.  Did his getting into the car with Diaz after his night with Cruz justify the results? By what yardstick? Do we care about Cruise or Diaz as people? Cruz was ""cute"" but Cruise was unconvincing. Weak science fiction at the conclusion. And if the first voice saying ""open your eyes"" is Cruz's voice, then there is no moment of objective reality in the entire movie-it is all dream.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
An incredible film wide open for criticism.,"All right, I'll get this right out of the way.  I'm a Cameron Crowe fan, and consider myself lucky to claim as such.  Also, I have never seen Abre Los Ojos.  Those who feel this negates my right to defend this film need not read further.  All I can tell those of you who may have seen this once and thought it was too out there is to give it another chance to prove itself. Trust me, my loyalty to Crowe aside, I was worried when I walked in to see this one.  It was a total departure for the guy who made Say Anything..., Singles, Jerry Maguire, and Almost Famous (Untitled).  Also, it was the first time he'd ever directed anything that wasn't wholly original.  I was skeptical that so many critics could be wrong about this film, but the more I watched and got absorbed in the story, the more it worked.  I gave this movie three stars out of four upon leaving the first time.  After seeing it again for the second time tonight, I leave it at a solid three and a half. And the only reason I don't give it four is because it is not an original idea.  Aside from that, it's a four star film.  But here's the reason I'm writing.  I didn't love this movie for the twist (and enough with saying HOW MANY twists there are because there's only really one if you're paying any kind of attention).  The twists like this have been done before in different ways in The Matrix and Total Recall (to say nothing of its predecessor. So, in my opinion, to call this a brilliant film based on its narrative alone would at best be doing a disservice to its inspiration and at worst be an uninformed statement of someone fresh from seeing a new and interesting film.  What I really loved about this movie was how true love was captured. And not, as Cruise AND Cruz have maintained, in the love scenes but in those little moments of perfection that Crowe delivers in spades.  This is why I have loved Crowe since his first film and have stuck with him all of these years.  Who could have possibly torn apart the world and stopped Lloyd from playing In Your Eyes in Say Anything?  Or broken that perfect silence after Cliff says ""bless you"" at the end of Singles?  Or prevented that tear from forming (even if it didn't drop) when Jerry Maguire says ""you complete me"" and you realize he's carried it with him all that time?  Or not feel a shudder run through them when Penny is sitting in the plane at the end of Almost Famous and has that look of realization?  Or taken their eyes off of David's face when he looked back at Sofia that one last time in Vanilla Sky? This is why I love this movie.  Crowe has put enough love at the core of this movie to make my soul ache from it.  And those who will put away their checklists of what makes a good movie good (a very subjective idea, I might add) and take this film in as the fluidity of feeling that I personally believe it was committed to the screen in the first place to convey will find something that transcends the confines of celluloid.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
What makes this movie so special. . .,"Before one watches this movie, he or she must be aware that it can be viewed on two levels.  The first is the sci-fi aspect: special effects, visually stimulating scenes, thought-provoking plots, & technological possibilities. I feel that most people will watch this movie, and will do so only being aware of this first level, and this by no means is something negative - indeed Vanilla Sky provides interesting ideas in regards to what the future would be and could be like - however lofty and idealistic these possibilities may be.The second aspect that I feel Vanilla Sky contains, is what makes this movie so unique for me: the possibility of finding the one true love in the world. As any plot summary can describe, Vanilla Sky is about the protagonist David Aames (Tom Cruise), a man worth millions, a man who owns the largest publishing company in New York, a man who women like the beautiful Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) seemingly incessantly lust after.  Although he essentially seems to have it all, there is definitely something valuable missing - the one true love in his life.  This void is filled once he meets the kind, witty latin brunette, Sofia (Penelope Cruz).  With Sofia, David has found the one thing he has never had before - the perfect companion. Their time spent together is portrayed like a fairly-tale, and it is done so well, that the viewer can feel the perfection and the burning feelings generated by the love between them.  Fate and bad decisions hugely alter their relationship, but although things get quite crazy as Vanilla Sky progresses, the viewer (I did) may become swarmed with emotion at what really could have been for David and Sofia - the endless possibilites.All that matters regardless of the plot outcome, is that David is one of the few lucky people in this world who finds his match, and that notion in itself is something intense.  Vanilla Sky has made me hope that I will do the same at some point in my life and that I hopefully have not passed up any prior opportunities.  ""Every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around."" - Carpe Diem. . . Vanilla Sky teaches that you have to live it up while you can - and if there is something you really want - go after it, because if you don't, you could miss out on something so great - like the one true love.I'm sure many of you will think that my critique is too idealistic, but this is what I feel every time I watch Vanilla Sky.  It is more than an erotic, sci-fi thriller - it is something much deeper and larger.  It shows that while money can get you far in life, true love is something hard to find - and if you do find it - you are the luckiest person in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Just my thoughts, without spoiling anything","Because this movie goes a lot further than the trailer indicates, it's hard to comment about it without giving anything away.  I was intrigued throughout the movie to see what happens next, despite the usual ""how many different camera shots can we get of Tom Cruise posing without being too obvious?""  It's neat how the film manages to slip subtle humour into many of it's intense scenes.  Anyhow, after it was over I felt like I had watched a great movie.Have fun :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Disappointing,"This is a great movie, filled with very good performances, spoiled by a really disappointing ending.  All the actors are perfect in their roles, and though the movie is purposely confusing, it is interesting and holds your attention.  But then we are spoon-fed a cop-out ending that is the worst since Pam woke up to find she had dreamed an entire season of Dallas.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
Very Entertaining,"I found the film to be very interesting, and not what I expected at all. The acting was top notch, and the script was very intelligent.*An extremely entertaining and engrossing film, with images that will stay in my mind for some time. *",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Excellent movie, but not for everyone","If you take a look at how Entertainment Weekly rated the film, they gave it a D+ and the readers, on average, gave it a C+.  If you look at the distribution of these grades, though, you'll notice that they span all the way across the spectrum.  Some people will love this movie, some will hate it - just like Moulin Rouge, Memento, American Psycho, Romeo and Juliet (Luhrman's version), and so on.  If you liked those movies, you'll like this one.  Otherwise, stay home and rent Casablanca.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
"Yes, This Movie Is That Good. Do you know what 4 times means?","Here are the ramblings!   I watched the DVD last night, and all of the features.  Not a lot of extras in my opinion.  Prelude To A Dream - Is basically an introduction to how the movie came about - 6 min. & ""Hitting It Hard"" about the press tour for the movie.  A photo gallery, and trailers. Interesting.I have gone back and read some reviews on the film, with a reoccuring theme that audiences left wanting answers.  I do not proclaim now, or in the past, to be a ""film"" expert.  But I ""got"" the film.  Of course background filler would always be interesting, but I was very satisfied with my viewing experience.Is the film to long that viewers actually do not have the attention span to follow it through?  Were people expecting Jerry MacGuire?  Any why the hell did I enjoy this movie so much??  And would I enjoy it less if I saw the original?  I am not a ""multiple"" movie viewer, yet this one will end up in the collection.4 TIMES! ""Do you know what 4 times means?""If you are interested in a great, deep movie viewing, I HIGHLY suggest you rent and/or buy VANILLA SKY",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"
