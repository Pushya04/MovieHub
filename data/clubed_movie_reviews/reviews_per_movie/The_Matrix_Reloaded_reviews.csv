Hmph.. Upgrades,"The 2nd movie in the Matrix franchise follows Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus as they continue to lead the revolt against the Machine Army. The Wachowski's are once again able to craft incredibly memorable moments on top of an intriguing story. The CGI struggles to keep up during the infamous ""Rubber Neo"" fight scene, but overall this sequel is a blast to watch!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Dissapointing, but still entertaining","Compared to the first one, this one is a massive dissapointment because the world while trying to expand and add new concepts, it doesnt explain them in a good way and over complicates them, while also not having a story as strong as the first film. But, the movie can still be seen, its entertaining and has really good action scenes which are the things that keep you watching it. So, despite not being as good as the first one, its still entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The only thing this film lacks is the element of surprise!,"The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is close to the standard of the original. I don't understand the seeming reluctance to accept this film a suitable continuation of the original film. I'll be the first one to admit that Reloaded has a few slow points and that the story line has a tendency towards the pretentious but the film is also highly intelligent and entertaining but most importantly the film gets the story from A to B with adequate and in some cases remarkable character development.Acting wise the film is in the same kind of league as the first film of the series with a few mediocre performances, a few decent performances and one or two excellent performances. Keanu Reeves plays Neo pretty much like he did in the first movie and that is not bad. His monotone voice is canceled out by his clear and well defined body language. His overall performance is very fitting for the character which, lets face it, is somewhat square and Keanu's acting fits that kind of character very well. Carrie-Anne Moss has taken a small step down. I don't blame her as much as I blame the writing. Her character, while still ass-kicking, is too dependent on Neo. I know they love each other but come on. Laurence Fishbourne shines as Morpheus. His performance is slightly more stylized than in the first film but he steals almost every scene he is in. Other semi-known actors make glorified cameos. Actors like Jada Pinkett Smith, Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson are great examples. Gloria Foster returns as the Oracle in her (sadly) last performance as she died during the filming. Her one brief scene is both highly interesting and well acted. As it was with the first film Hugo Weaving provides the best acting by far. Although his screen time is somewhat limited he manages to leave a lasting impression and becomes one of my favorite screen baddies of all time. His performance is for lack of a better word fantastic.Effect wise Reloaded is a feast. There is literally something to look at in every scene. The ""real"" world has been given a face lift to make it more interesting. The real effects, however, take place inside the matrix and just like in the first film the effects are absolutely ground breaking. Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and LotR and that is saying something. The people who think the story is pretentious and the dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action scenes. Some scenes had me holding my breath and gasping at how beautiful and overwhelming it all was and as much as I love the philosophical aspects of the film I can watch it for the effects themselves as well. Without spoiling anything I can say that lovers of cool fight scenes and fx are in for a hell of a treat with this one.In terms of costumes the film has really grown into its own. Especially Neo's costume in The Matrix is very cool and is a great improvement over the previous film. Morpheus' and Trinity's costumes are the same with minor changes and they still look cool. Agent Smith's costume has changed slightly in the color scheme. His suit has become a bit darker as if to signify that he is no longer an Agent of the system but a rogue agent now. Also his sunglasses have changed so that they look more rounded so they look more like Neo's sunglasses which of course implicates their connection. Many of the secondary characters have their own costumes as well mirroring their own personalities.Were the film separated itself from other action packed films is of course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspects. Once the film has been watched a few times for the effects you can begin to see some of the elements. I don't think its possible to fully translate and analyze every element of the film. Mainly because every element can be analyzed in a bunch of different ways. Without spoiling too much I can say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find Plato, Baudrillard, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian elements and some more. The people who tell matrix lovers to get a life for searching the Matrix for a deeper meaning ought to open their eyes and watch the film one more time. With that I'm not saying that you can't be intelligent if you don't like the Matrix I am simply asking you to give it another chance. You really won't regret it.The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film and it deserves a lot more respect than it is getting and it is definitely underrated. I don't expect people to agree but I do expect people to respect those who love the Matrix sequels like me. I for one think that its hard to go wrong with Reloaded as it is funny, moving, awe-inspiring and very intelligent. I highly recommend this film to anyone.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The Matrix Reloaded: Visually stunning, utterly confusing!","""What's going on?"" ""Man, that was cool."" ""Jesus, I need a dictionary."" These three things went through my mind while I watched The Matrix Reloaded. Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, who goes to the city of Zion along with Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss.) As approaching sentinels get closer and closer to the city, an old enemy (Hugo Weaving) pops up again, determined to destroy Neo. As if that weren't enough, Neo has a dream about Trinity dying and he wonders if it will come true.The premier problem with The Matrix Reloaded is that it's incredibly confusing. For the majority of the film I couldn't understand what was going on or who new characters were. For example, Lambert Wilson plays a French character called Merovingian and after four viewings of the film, I still don't know what purpose his character serves.There is a scene near the end of the film in which you will definitely need a dictionary beside you. People who have seen the film will know that I am talking about the scene with The Architect, (Helmut Bakaitis) who has the widest vocabulary in the universe. I understand that it works for his all-knowing character, but what I don't understand is....well, what the bloody hell he's going on about. An example of a sentence he says is ""you are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision."" What?The saviour of The Matrix Reloaded are it's jaw-droppingly brilliant action sequences. Amazingly choreographed and with top-notch special effects, they are what The Matrix trilogy is famous for. I have to say that The Matrix Reloaded definitely has the best action sequences out of the three films and two of my favourite movie scenes are actually from this. My personal favourite scene is when Neo battles an army of Agent Smiths for about eight minutes. Rob Dougan's music during these action sequences also add to the suspense.Like any sequel, The Matrix Reloaded will always be compared to its predecessor, which is not good for TMR. The first film was more intelligent and intriguing, but the action sequences in the sequel were slightly better.With a confusing plot, The Matrix Reloaded disappoints, but the action sequences are top-notch. I give it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Perhaps overloaded, but definitely groundbreaking","Watching The Matrix Reloaded, one is absolutely entitled to say that it is overloaded, too lengthy action sequences for instance, and indeed, a way too lengthy dancing scene in Zion. But next to that, it is obvious that this sequal to The Matrix (1999)takes the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the working of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways, depending on their onthological background. A conclusion is not (yet) given, which adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality. For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll see stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense what he says. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Can not follow up on the first part,"'Matrix Reloaded' wants too much and wants to go one better on everything. What was the non plus ultra in the first part is now playschool. Agent Smith becomes an entire army, one guard becomes a quarter of a million.The same goes for the special effects. I don't need to see something in slow motion every 5 minutes just to make it look cool. Quantity instead of quality seems to be the motto here. Used purposefully, this is definitely a suitable stylistic device. Unfortunately, it is used randomly.Basically, the movie digresses into inanities, especially in the early stages. I'm thinking of this several-minute rave in Zion, for example. The movie wants to give insights into the everyday life of people living in reality. This is basically the logical next step, but unfortunately 'Matrix Reloaded' doesn't manage to relate to the people at any time. Everything seems sterile and unapproachable.In the first part, fight sequences were used quite purposefully. Every fight had its meaning. Here, I have the feeling that the fights are pure show interludes.'Matrix' didn't just stand out because of the action, but also brought a philosophical approach into play. Unfortunately, this approach is almost completely thrown overboard in the sequel. That's a shame, because it's a feature that can set it apart from the normal action genre.The point that really bothers me the most is the transformation of Neo into a kind of Superman. He can do anything and seems almost invincible. I generally find these types of characters difficult, because it's hard to identify with them.Finally, one plus point of the movie. The scenes on the freeway were really good. I would have liked to see this kind of staging for the rest of the movie as well.In summary, 'Matrix Reloaded' falls far short of following in the big footsteps of its predecessor. More should have been made of the strengths and special features of the first part.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
*A Bold Continuation of a Sci-Fi Legend*,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" picks up where its predecessor left off, blending philosophical depth with groundbreaking action sequences. The film expands the universe of the original, exploring the nature of choice, freedom, and reality. The visual effects are stunning, pushing the boundaries of CGI at the time, especially during the iconic freeway chase scene that remains a highlight.Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, embodying the character's evolution as a reluctant hero. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity shines in her role, showcasing both strength and vulnerability. Hugo Weaving delivers an unforgettable performance as Agent Smith, now more powerful and sinister than ever.While some viewers felt the plot became convoluted with its complex themes and numerous characters, ""Reloaded"" invites viewers to engage deeply with its narrative, providing rich material for discussion. The introduction of new characters like the Merovingian and The Architect adds layers to the storyline, though their motivations can feel obscured at times.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a thrilling, thought-provoking sequel that challenges its audience, even if it doesn't quite reach the iconic status of the original. It's a must-watch for fans of the franchise and anyone intrigued by the exploration of reality and consciousness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Much better the second time around,"I did not like this very much the first watch. But after watching Revolutions, which I thought was much better, I gave this another chance. The first time you are of course wondering where the story is taking you and it ends up being basically no where. Then Revolutions does go there.Because Reloaded is a second movie, it's the first half of the second movie. With that knowledge this first act becomes much better. Sure the action scenes go on a little too long, while they are very cool, but the second time when you aren't wondering about the plot you can enjoy them a little more.Maybe it would have be easier if they called this movie part one.My only problem with this movie is that it's uneven. There is over an hour of laying down plot line after plot line. Then action scenes that are very long and lose their significance to the story about half way through.Now all of the dialogue and action scenes are very good but there should have been a little bit of break up to make it easier on us and even it out. The last third corrects this problem though.Very good after a second viewing. The two movies are structured like one movie. It's really like watching The Empire Strikes Back, pausing it after Darth Vader shows up at cloud City and waiting 6 months to finish the movie.Please give it another chance and you will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Downfall,"After watching Matrix Reloaded I can say I was nothing short of disappointed. The first Matrix film is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my favourite films. But Reloaded fails to live up to that significantly.There is no story, plot or even good acting. The incredibly bad story of Reloaded fails at even having a complete story. Reloaded consists of fight scene after fight scene missing that heart of the first one. There's also basically no plot and you will most likely not even make out what's going on. And even the acting takes such a downfall it is laughable.The movie is also poorly made from a cinematography perspective. With massive amounts of fight scenes, you would think that you could tell what's going on at least. But you really don't, a shaky camera and bodies flying everywhere it makes it incredibly hard to tell.I was extremely disappointed with Matrix Reloaded but I still recommend you watch it if you enjoyed the first one. It follows the same dark gritty narrative that the first one created but fails at living up to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding Movie!,"Upon my initial viewing, I didn't find much to like about this film. However, after watching ""Revolutions,"" which I found to be a significant improvement, I decided to give this one another shot. The first time around, I found myself wondering where the story was headed, only to feel like it led nowhere. ""Revolutions,"" on the other hand, does take you there.Understanding that ""Reloaded"" is essentially the first half of a larger story, my perspective on its first act shifted. With this knowledge, the initial portion of the film becomes more engaging. Although the action scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, they are undeniably impressive, and upon revisiting the film, I found myself able to appreciate them more without the distraction of wondering about the plot.Perhaps it would have been clearer if they had labeled this movie as Part One.My main issue with the film lies in its uneven pacing. There's over an hour of exposition, followed by lengthy action sequences that lose their relevance to the plot halfway through. While both the dialogue and action scenes are well-executed, a bit more variety in pacing would have made the viewing experience smoother and more balanced. Fortunately, the final third of the film addresses this issue.Upon rewatching, I found ""Reloaded"" to be much more enjoyable. When viewed together, the two films form a cohesive narrative structure, akin to watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and pausing it after Darth Vader's arrival at Cloud City, only to resume six months later.I encourage you to give it another chance. You may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great Visuals, Bad Story","The first time I saw The Matrix I didn't really care for it, but as I watched it again and thought about it more, the more I liked it.  Unlike most comic book movies, you don't have to take the amazing stunts with an unbelievable pill because they are done in the constructs of a computer program where these characters are merely reprogramming the rules.  That concept was cool even if it was ripped off from any Cyberpunk novel/story ever written.  (Does anyone else think it is funny that Keanu was in Johnny Mnemonic?)The bad thing is that I am already having the exact opposite reaction to Reloaded.  I watched it and kept thinking ""WOW, COOL!"" but in retrospect, some of the CGI was obvious in stunts, there is too much of a reliance on a 'deus ex machina' resolution to events, and I kept expecting the Stay Pufft Marshmallow Man to appear every time they talked about the Key Maker.  In the end, I felt Reloaded set up Revolutions to be a bomb.  The Wachowskis and Silver are adding layers to the Matrix itself but are making it so cumbersome that you just want to say that there has to be reality at some level, but you never find it.Several continuity errors between films jumped out at me, but I'll let you discover them for yourselves.  All in all, it was a slightly above average sci-fi action flick that I'm afraid will become cliched to the point that one day we'll be seeing this on MST5K or whatever incarnation of that show may still be around in 20 years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Overwhelming and spectacular second part with some of the best action scenes ever made,"This exciting sequel is full of thrills , cutting-edge visuals, stylist innovations , fights , tension , suspense and groundbreaking races , but also several commercial elements , including computer-simulated violence . This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie , though overlong . It's an enjoyable , if somewhat light-headed piece of escapism with state-of-art special effects and straightforward screenplay . Big-budgeted film by the great producer Joel Silver led to break into the booming Sci-Fi/adventure/fantasy market plenty of inventiveness and imagination . Full of action, it's complemented by rousing scenes , breathtaking flights and struggles are spotlights . It deals with Neo (Keanu Reeves) ¨who is thought to be the chosen one¨ and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo has to decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams and he must find Merovingian (Lambert Wilson who is accompanied by a gorgeous Monica Bellucci). It is a dark time for the world in this second adventure. The epic war between man and machine reaches a thundering crescendo : the Zion military, aided by courageous civilian volunteers and led by councillor Hamann (Anthony Zerbe) desperately battle to hold back the marauding Sentinel invasion from overtaking the last human fortress . Neo, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity race against time and are advised by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) to encounter the Keymaker (Randall Kim) who would help them reach the Source. While the human city of Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival. The city , the last outpost of humanity , is defended by valiant warriors (Harry Lennix, Gina Torres , Nora Gaye) against the massive invasion of the machines to save the humanity as Neo fights to end the war at another front while also opposing the rogue Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).This is an action-packed, booming following with some of the best vehicles scenes ever filmed , including awesome visual effects by John Gaeta. This thrilling movie contains impressive fights , chills , breathtaking designs , dense philosophy and many other things . From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of car crashes on a California freeway and spectacular combats in mart arts style staged by Yue Woo Ping who also made ¨Kill Bill¨ and ¨Crouching tiger, hidden dragon¨ . Contrived beyond belief with spectacular races that play like video games , but slickly calculated to please 2000s audiences . Moving and pulsing musical score by Don Davis . Magnificent , glamorous production design by Owen Paterson . Colorful and imaginative cinematography by Bill Pope .

"Sometimes ridiculous, sometimes awesome, but ALWAYSspectacular!","Last night I was fortunate enough to stumble across some tix to the ""Reloaded"" premiere.  Since the original ""Matrix"" came out a few years ago everyone has imitated its' kenetic action style, which led me to think there's no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again.  But they did.  The Wachowskis have way out done the new ""Star Wars"" films and without a doubt have far surpassed the ""X-Men films.""   At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins.  A little goofy but fun. The action though, I can't say enough about.  The center chase scene is awesome and the opening cycle scene is....  Okay, no more words, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" will not disappoint and by the time you reach the cliffhanger ending you're more than ready for a break from this double talking, mind bending adventure.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
FANTASTIC!,"When the credits for the movie came up and yet another great song by Rage Against The Machine blaring in my ears, I just thought to myself, what a great piece of entertainment this movie was.I was a big fan of the first one (like other millions were) and was eagerly awaiting the sequel. Although it might not be as good as the first one in terms of it shocking us the way it did in 99 when it brought to us such a new flavour in cinema in terms of development in action, special effects and its terrific story. All and all it still held up very well considering the pressure this movie had on its shoulders to live up to the great expectation.I think that's why a lot of people weren't real keen on this one, because it had such huge pressure, and whatever the Wachowski's produced, it wasn't going to be good enough, or people would say it could or should of been better. I believe the Wachowski brothers made it more epic and like most sequels, you can tell that it had a s*** load more money to work with. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action, it's a special movie.Well done Larry and Andy showing everyone just why we go to the movies, Pure escapism and entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Confusing,"I'm writing this review more so for my own collection rather than anything. And this film has one and one thing wrong with it. And that it's too god damn confusing.I have never watched any of the Matrix films before so this is all a new experience to me. I sat down and really focused and watched every single second that was offered. And I still don't understand it. In fact I lie, I understand maybe 50% of it. Like there are scenes and characters that just don't offer anything to the plot, but are there to confuse and nothing more. There's some guy that speaks French, he's in for about 10 mins and that's it. What's his purpose other than to add 10 mins to the film and confuse me a bit more? I really really wish I understood it more and I could admire it. But I can't. Maybe this is a film you have to see 3/4 times to get it, I don't know, but from first viewing it's hard to get.The action scenes are phenomenal. 17 years later and these scenes still hold up more than enough today. I was in genuine awe at some of the action and the fighting that was displayed. It was honestly amazing. The film is worth watching for this alone.But yeah, I enjoyed my time watching this. Just dead confusing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Upgrades!,"The thing that really strikes me about The Matrix Reloaded is that the increase in quality, if it can be said that there actually is one, from the first movie is more the result of an increased budget than anything else. I loved the new movie, but the talent was there in the first one, you can just tell that in the sequel the Wachowski brothers had a virtually endless budget, which allowed them to do pretty much anything they wanted. They have a very distinct style that is clearly evident in all of their movies, even if they are not laden with special effects. The fluidity of the camera movement and the strangely dark tones of their films are only a couple of the techniques that make them recognizable. These things really come to the surface if you watch the Matrix films, some of the most recognizable films ever made, and then watch an earlier one of their movies, like the trashy 1996 thriller, Bound.That being said, I think it's safe to say that, despite the massive and seemingly unsurpassable genius of the first Matrix film, the Wachowski brothers have made another step up from their last film. It should be noted that the film is the second part in a trilogy, especially before groaning out loud at the sudden ending of the film, which built up and built up and built up and then just stopped, just like the fist Lord of the Rings film did. I won't take time here to go into what the story is about and how it continues the story from the first film, if only because plot summary in film reviews is a total waste of time for the writer as well as the reader, and also because I've only seen the movie twice, which really isn't enough to get a total grasp on the depth of the plots, so I'll just suffice it here to say that the startling complexity of the original Matrix (a complexity which is almost unheard of in a science fiction film) is added onto and expanded in this film, although despite being hard to follow, is never confusing.I've heard all kinds of talk about the Italian Job having an even better car chase than The Matrix Reloaded and how the chase in this film wasn't even that good at all, blah blah blah. There is a freeway chase scene in this film which recklessly promotes reckless driving (and, even worse, reckless riding), but it is one of the most impressively made and fascinating car chase scenes that I've ever seen. It also contains the characteristic style of the Wachowski brothers, and is famously filmed on a freeway that was constructed strictly for the filming of this scene. I can't remember where, Australia, I think. Anyway, Morpheus and one of the agents are having a kung-fu fight on top of a semi trailer (which the driver never seems to notice), the poor keymaker in struggling to stay out of the way, Trinity is flying between cars against traffic on one of the most badass motorcycles on the road (enter the Ducati commercial), and Morpheus is off doing, as they say, `his superman thing.'The superman thing is one of the elements of the movie that bordered on being campy, as the multitude of Agent Smiths comment to themselves, `He's still only human.' And then in the next scene he's flying. This is one of the points where you really need to keep in mind that Neo's body is plugged into a machine, in the strikingly less appealing real world, and is basically playing a video game where he'll die in real life if killed in the game because his body will think that it has been killed for real and will shut down.During the freeway scene, there's a camera shot where the camera literally goes right through the chassis' of a couple of semi trucks as it follows Trinity, which I think got the biggest reaction from an audience in a single scene that I've seen since that Velociraptor jumped up at the ceiling in Jurassic Park. One of the other most memorable scenes is the lengthy fight scene between Neo and the hordes of Agent Smiths, one of the most entertaining fight scenes I've ever seen. It's obvious that the vast majority of this scene is special effects (and not only because there are hundreds of the same guy in it), but it is so well made and convincing and even amusing that the entertainment value of it is massive.The new villains, by the way, are some of the best new villains since the Reapers in Blade II. I've heard something about an albino interest group that's trying to sue for the way albino's are portrayed in this movie because of these guys, although I can't exactly agree that they're even albinos. These guys are so weird looking they're barely human. If the albino interest groups are trying to sue, why didn't they sue when Me, Myself, and Irene was released? Anyway, these guys have the interesting skill of becoming transparent and therefore untouchable, with the small condition that they are also unable to attack when in this defensive mode, which makes for some great fight scenes as well as some cool tricks, like that of hopping into rapidly approaching Escalades (oh, there are lots of Cadillac commercials here, too). I heard recently that Cadillac is trying to aim for a younger audience than the much older people who tend to drive their cars, and if there were ever any doubts that the rumors are true, they are completely dispelled by their heavy placement in this movie.There are certainly some scenes in this movie where it drags and seems to even border on being unnecessarily philosophical and confusing, such as in the extensive meeting with the Oracle, who tells Neo all about choices that he has made but doesn't know he's made yet, or needs to make even though fate has already determined what decision he would make, or something of that nature, where after a while we find ourselves (or at least I did) paying more attention to the pigeons walking around in this startlingly different atmosphere than to the deep conversation that they're having. Maybe this is why it takes me more than two viewings to get the complete story of movies like this. Blasted pigeons.There is a lot of controversy over the quality of The Matrix Reloaded, which is to be expected, since it is a movie that has garnered such a vast amount of attention, even if only because it is the follow-up to such a massively successful film. But like Terminator 3, I personally was hugely impressed with this sequel, and am more than able to accept it as a bridge between the original and the final film in the series. It is the better part of three hours long, but goes by much faster than anticipated because it is so well made and entertaining. Never mind that totally campy scenes, like the bullet removal scene and the dance club scene, because like so many other sequels these days (and unlike so many others), The Matrix Reloaded will leave you eager to see the next one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Here is what I think about ""The Matrix Reloaded"":","""Commander Lock: 'Not everyone believes what you believe.'Morpheus: 'My beliefs do not require that they do.'Characters are always talking like this in 'The Matrix Reloaded,' which plays like a collaboration involving a geek, a comic book and the smartest kid in Philosophy 101. Morpheus in particular unreels extended speeches that remind me of Laurence Olivier's remarks when he won his honorary Oscar--the speech that had Jon Voight going 'God!' on TV, but in print turned out to be quasi-Shakespearean doublespeak. The speeches provide not meaning, but the effect of meaning: It sure sounds like those guys are saying some profound things.That will not prevent fanboys from analyzing the philosophy of 'The Matrix Reloaded' in endless Web postings. Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology; there is something refreshingly ironic about becoming an authority on the transient extrusions of mass culture, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.""My thoughts:Nothing sums up the hype surrounding ""The Matrix"" trilogy better than the above quote from Roger Ebert. Like him, I believe that much of the hype surrounding ""The Matrix"" and its sequels is nothing more than shallow philosophy mixed with allegorical and metaphorical strains of the Bible, among various other religious texts and two guys love of comic books. Do I believe any of it? Absolutely not, and I honestly hope that the people who seem to watch these movies religiously do not believe any of the things they say about it either.It's been four years since the first ""Matrix"" film wowed audiences back in 1999 with its special effects and mind-bending story. It has since been followed by a frighteningly devoted fan base, countless books and various interpretations of the plot line. I don't view the ""Matrix"" movies as anything more than a ""Christ"" parable and a very shallow one at that. The movie has its influences deeply rooted in Christianity (the most obvious), as well as Japanese comic books (Manga), Anime (""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Akira"" come first to mind), Hong Kong action flicks, and countless other sources that have been rolled into one hell of an action film.And also like Ebert, I make these statements with amusement, not criticism, mixed with a little bit of bewilderment. You see, like most movie-going people, I was put into awe by the special effects and story. I loved the first film and it's a classic, believe me. The first ""Matrix"" film is an obvious achievement in special effects and a landmark in science-fiction,but unfortunately its sequels aren't bringing anything new to me and (obviously) to others, which brings me to ""The Matrix Reloaded.""The cons:The biggest problem I have with ""Reloaded"" is that it many times tries to be deep and meaningful but fails miserably most of the time. The fight scenes aren't really worth any particular mention (the only exception being the ""88 Smiths"" and the much-talked about 14-minute ""Freeway"" chase) either. Many of them only seem to be in this movie to eat up time and don't have any significance to the story.That, to me seemed to be the biggest fault with ""Reloaded."" In ""The Matrix,"" the big lobby scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) get into a huge shootout with a S.W.A.T. team, signaled the start of a glorious rebellion within the system but not only that, kept your eyes glued to the screen for the rest of the movie, all the way up to when the credits start to roll and Rage Against the Machine plays on the soundtrack.The fights in ""Reloaded"" are too repetitive and seem to take forever to be over. Also, the romance in this film seemed to be way too tacked on to be believable. I wanted to see Neo and Trinity become a couple but I have to say that they have no chemistry on screen whatsoever. Their love scene is intercut with a huge mosh pit scene about 30 minutes in after Morpheus gives this huge inspirational speech and everybody goes nuts.Any plusses? Well yeah, that's why I gave it a six out of ten. I have to say, that while the fight scenes seem to be a bit on the excessive side, they're extremely well executed. The cinematography is beautiful, giving ""Reloaded"" a unique and eerie look. The ""flying"" scenes with Neo are very well done too.To sum up:""The Matrix Reloaded"" was at best, failed potential but it shows what happens when you try to put too much into one movie.P.S: If I want a science-fiction movie with real philosophy (emphasis on ""real""), I'll go and watch ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Terminator,"" or ""Ghost in the Shell,"" the latter film was a key (read: obvious) influence of the ""Matrix"" films.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Another step in the machine,The Wachowskis managed to move the trilogy forward with this second installment. And did so successfully. This sci-fi concept was a blockbuster and I was glad to get another dose. We added some other characters and brought a whole community into focus. My kids loved watching it too. So Neo gets further into the machine connection in this one.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"They went for some stuff, half of them didn't land, still a decent movie","I've seen the first Matrix for the first time back in 2017, and I loved it, I loved the world they've built, the characters, I understood the dilemmas, what was at risk, and at the end... I wanted to see more, I felt like they had just scratched the surface. But here I am, three years later, seing Matrix Reloaded for the first time. I can't lie, all the talk of people saying ""the last two suck"" and stuff, sort of made me not wanted to rush to see the other two. Idk, if that was good or not, but it was definitely a factor, and for sure made me watch this one with other eyes. Take that as you want.I have no idea why all that introduction, but well, I don't think the movie sucks necessarily, but is definitely not the ""more"" I ended the first movie wanting to see. Some few points here, it's definitely hard to evaluate something that did so much to the revolution of technology in film, and almost created a genre of its own, but oddly enough, this one for sure didn't aged as well as the first one. Mainly the full CGI scenes, where they change it up the actors for the full digital models of themselves, well... you can notice clearly, and at times can take you out of the movie a bit. It's that same old problem of, a first movie that had a smaller budget, and in the sequel with more movie they just went for it, and well... screwed the in-camera fight scenes (still there are a lot of them tho) But then again, that doesn't make the movie that much worst or better, imo, is just dated, and it prevents the film from having fully amazing sequences from start to finish.But idk, I like some of the new stuff they added, like the human city, I don't know if I quit understood the whole paradox of the chosen one thing fully... nevertheless, I liked it lol. But well, the movie is just weird at times, there are entire sequences I feel don't add to much at all, like the whole party in the city, in slow motion with people naked... idk, it just felt like adding to not much at all. Some of the fight sequences are great (like the one with the French guy crew), but others... are probably ""too great"" if that makes sense. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike them, but some of the fight scenes, like the first one with the bunch of Smiths, seemed like they go for sooo long, that at one point it doesn't feel like there is something in play here, it's just a dance of sorts, between Neo's CGI doll, and the dozen of Smiths (they even use bowling sound effects at some point).And well, I can't truly judge the movie that much cause... it doesn't have an ending! (At least back then they released it in the same year, which is still an insane thing to think about nowadays).To sum up, Matrix Reloaded, isn't as good at the first one for sure, and, sadly I didn't think it built the world as much as I wanted. I still love the concept, I love almost everything about Neo's power in the Matrix (the ones that aren't fully CGI dolls), but some scenes seemed to led to nothing at all, and they probably overdid with some fight sequences. Also, I have to give them credit, the car chase scene is awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Terrible... just terrible.,"The Matrix Reloaded: a desperate cash grab that is 90% filler and 10% plot.So much of this movie is absolutely pointless and quite painful to watch:Firstly, that speech by Morpheus, then the painful dancing and sex scene between trinity and Neo. That was way too drawn out and just unnecessary. We get it, they are dancing, and Neo and Trinity are making love, get on with it.Second, the whole scene with Neo and the Counselor. They have a lengthy conversation seemingly about nothing. What relevance did that have to anything? We were introduced to so many characters in Zion only to have them mean absolutely nothing in the end.Oh, and while we are on the topic of Zion... how did they manage to make such an advanced city underground? Did they have time to drag billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment down with them while the machines were on their tails, eager to kill them?Third: all of the action. It didn't add anything to the plot. Neo spends 15 minutes fighting all of the Smiths when he could have just flown away immediately after he realized it was a swarm.The fight between that random programmer in order to get to the oracle...Neo's Jackie Chan-esque fight scene on those stairs.The 20 minute chase scene with trinity, Morpheus, and the keymaker... don't even get me started on that.And how about those ghostly dreadlock twins...All of those scenes seemed to just fill the time as the real storyline: the looming destruction of humanity was sprinkled in.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Trapped in the curse of Sequels!,"The creators of The Matrix Trilogy had repeatedly state that this was conceived as a ""Trilogy"" from the start. Although I haven't a reason to doubt that, the 2nd (and 3rd) Matrix fall in the tradition that many sequels of good movies suffer from.Despite the fact that practically the same cast and crew who created the magnificent first part is here for the 2 & 3 (they shot it back-to-back) the movie quickly loses its spirit.First mistake is the introduction of many many new secondary characters who might not necessarily needed. And these characters are trying really hard to pose as important without that being the case at all.Second mistake is the forced philosophy that didn't actually had anything to add to that of the original. The attempt for a recreation of the perfectly scripted dialog between Neo and the Oracle in the original is a failed one. For some, including me, it even destroys the feeling of the original dialog by diminishing its great themes.Third mistake the (experimental) visual effects this time look completely fake. There is a big fight, shot with something that is described as virtual cinematography, and it's more than obvious that...well..it needs lots of work to be believable.In conclusion when you are trying for bigger and better there is no guaranty that you will succeed. A common thing in movie sequels. A curse, that struck the second (and the third) sequels of the Matrix.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Ruins the mythology but cool action sequences,"This movie basically ruined the mythology of ""The Matrix"". I know it can be difficult for a movie to beat it's predecessor, especially if the original is invigorating and awesome while being a visual feast with substance. The main problem with this one is that it lacks a lot of substance and to make up for that it has a lot of cool action scenes. Now the actions sequences is really cool and because of that this movie is worth watching. The music in this fits the premise of the movie and mixes well with the action to the point it can get addicting to listen to. If it pulled some surprises or unexpected elements it might have added to the value of this movie but that isn't the case The philosophical elements isn't intriguing or engaging to listen to but seemed forced at times. In fact when there is no action on screen the movie becomes very lame to watch. Especially the when it comes to the part revolving Zion. Overall this is a cool action oriented movie that lacks the substance that the first one has. But if you want to see some really cool action sequences with some cool music, you will probably be entertained to some degree with this one.6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A good and sometimes great movie on its own despite the far superior original Matrix,"Greetings from Lithuania.For ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) it was an impossible task to top or even be equal to the ""Matrix"" (1999). The original film was one of the best films ever made, and one that didn't necessary needed any sequels. But given the enormous success of ""Matrix"" in cinemas and especially of home media (i had the original VHS as well) and hype for the sequel, the continuation was inevitable. And as far as sequels goes, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is a good one.This film is bigger, more spectacular, has bigger sets and scope then first film. It doesn't make it better by any means, because with more epic scope it didn't captured the magic of the first one. There are less surprises along the way, and the whole plot of the 3rd act seems like far stretched and sometimes even convoluted. But on multiple viewing (i saw this film 5-6 times) and did appreciated it more and more. Last time i watched it was on 4k UHD Blu Ray and its a stunning movie to look at.Overall, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a good sequel on its own and probably the best one they could come up with. Its bigger, louder, more complex and spectacular then the ""Matrix"", but if you ask me which i prefer more and its always the first one - by far. And given the track record of the movies that these two directors will create in the next 20 years, this film is like ""The Godfather Part II"" - you know what i mean. All in all, this is a good and sometimes very good movie on its own to one of the best films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A daring and innovative film, but a bit too heady for most.","""The Matrix Reloaded"" is an ode to the highs and lows of sheer wretched excess. There's an incredible amount of what can only be called overload here - too much extemporizing, too much pop philosophy, and too much bloat. But the action here really is too much - in the best way possible - and that saves this movie. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" begins with an overwrought and over-philosophized first act, mostly set in the ""real world."" We see the last human city, Zion, which is a giant cave set deep within the Earth. In retrospect, I suppose the over-the-top action sequences set in the Matrix, and the whole sequence with the Merovingian are just as bloated as the tedious first act, which is set in the ""real world"" of Zion. However, there's a critical difference: the Matrix is a cool place to be, and the ""real world"" looks a one-way trip to chronic depression. All this made me wonder why the humans were at war to save Zion from the machines who control the Matrix. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to defeat the machines, take over the Matrix, and plug everyone back in so they can stop living the Soylent Green lifestyle of Zion and start living the good life? Still, with all the brilliant, groundbreaking action any movie fan could want, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is ultimately a rewarding film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great action, but plot starts to weaken","The story of Neo versus the Matrix continues. The first movie was epic so a very hard act to follow. The plot here becomes a little harder to follow (who is the Keymaker?) but the action remains strong.There are a couple of awful scenes (e.g. Zion dance, Neo superman) but the car chase is brilliant.Overall, not as good as the first movie but still worth continuing on with the trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix Reloaded  A Good Sci-Fi Film With Flaws,"The Matrix Reloaded is a good sci-fi film with flaws from the Wachowski brothers who return to direct this sequel which may not be on part with first one but it still isn't that bad either action wise. The Wachowski brothers show some real talent and skill with Reloaded but more unanswered questions and the lack of screen time given to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith including some other characters sort of weigh the film down. In this case though fortunately the good outweighs the bad. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think they could've improved to make Reloaded better. The cast are admirable in reprising their roles including Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving whose role in this one seems to be smaller than the original. Reeves still does a decent job as Neo the One who can now fly and begins to question his role to play as a battle between the machines and the rest of the humans in Zion the last city near the Earths core draws closer. Laurence Fishburne is still the perfect Morpheus who believes that Neo can save them from annihilation. I did feel as though he was more involved in the action in the first one than his character was in this sequel besides an occasional action/fight sequence, Fisburne still makes the best of his role in the movie. Carrie Anne Moss is believable enough as Trinity who's now in love with Neo and believes that he can save them from the machines. Moss like Fishburne gets several action/fight sequences that are impressive but her role doesn't seem as big as it was in the other one either. The same can go Hugo Weaving who definitely makes for an imposing villain as Smith the now renegade program who can make copies of himself. Weaving isn't it that much except for a couple fight sequences and most of his scenes are with well himself but none the less he still does a great job with his villain role. The rest of the supporting cast including Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Monica Belluci, and Lambert Wilson are admirable in their roles but none of them get much screen time. They show up for brief extended cameo appearances and thats about it. The same can go for some of the new supporting villains in this one who at the most make brief cameo appearances before being written out so none of them really leave an impression. Two of the new villains are known only as the Twins who besides one extended action/fight sequence aren't developed at all considering they show up very late into the movie only to written out rather quickly like the other new agents introduced. The two actors who played the Twins though still did a solid job with their brief roles in the film. The special effects are still amazing and state of the art. The action/fight sequences are equally impressive the ones standing out being the incredible highway chase and the fierce fight in which Neo takes on not one but around 100 Agent Smith's at once. The pacing was once again a little slow at times and the sex scene between Neo and Trinity didn't feel necessary. The movie also answered some questions but raises more that are never revealed which is sort of disappointing. The music once again is done very well by Don Davis and fits the tone of the film. The ending leaves off with a cliffhanger but it's not as surprising as it could have been. Overall though despite its flaws Reloaded is still an entertaining sequel that maybe flawed but there's plenty of action, great special effects, some suspense, and impressive performances by most of the cast that make it worth seeing at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Second Part that Improves the Whole,"Being a casual fan of the original The Matrix, I was looking forward to seeing The Matrix:Reloaded in the theaters. However, I was not quite ready to line up at the door donned in a Neo costume for a midnight showing on opening day. Having seen Reloaded, I can now say that I may be one of those people (sans the Neo costume) when The Matrix:Revolutions is released this winter. I cannot say that I think that Reloaded was as good as the original. Yes, it contained more action. Yes, the special effects were better. Yes, both the plot and the dialogue were more intricate and at times more head scratching. But Reloaded lacks what its predecessor had, the element of complete surprise. The wool has already been removed from our eyes. We know what the Matrix is. I cannot think of any plot twist that will be able to match what happens when Neo swallows the Red Pill. All that being said, after seeing Reloaded, I now appreciate the story as a whole. The Matrix and The Matrix:Reloaded when viewed as one complete story far surpasses viewing each as it's own single entity. While the original had mildly peaked my interest, I am now fully enthralled by the entire mythology of The Matrix (I highly recommend viewing the back stories available online on the Animatrix). Much like The Lord of the Rings series, I can no longer imagine The Matrix without contemplating Reloaded. As for Reloaded as a movie itself, the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed, though sometimes a little excessive. I would recommend the movie for the fight with the multiple Agent Smiths alone, as it is a phenomenally staged battle. My criticism lies mostly in the editing. This is a movie that could have definitely been shorter. Many scenes were unnecessarily long, such as the dance orgy after Morpheus' speech, or flat out unnecessary, such as Neo's fight with Seraph. But beyond the flashy fight scenes and special effects, its strength lies in the most unlikely (to me at least) of places, its story. It is a movie full of philosophical questions and religious allusions. The end scene with the Architect in and of itself warrants a second viewing, as it is quite a bit to wrap the brain around. And the way it handles its main theme is done exquisitely. What is reality? Is the ""real world"" just another part of the Matrix? Is Neo The One? All questions I will be asking as I stand in line for the midnight opening of The Matrix:Revolutions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Massive disappointment,"The Matrix Reloaded is a massive disappointment coming off it's iconic and superb predecessor, a muddled, dull and overly pretentious film saved by its impressive set pieces, some interesting ideas and strong performances from its returning cast.Keanu Reeves gives an incredible lead performance, even if he is no longer able to anchor the pretentiousness. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are great and Hugo Weaving is still a terrific villain but is annoyingly sidelined for new villains who are either bland or annoying.The Wachowski's direction is mostly impressive, the action sequences are still clean, comprehensible and exciting with the freeway chase easily being the highlight of the film. However, the reliance on some truly awful CG in some scenes undermines it. The music by Don Davis is good, mostly works but nowhere near as good or memorable as what came before.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Vastly inferior reload,"While there are better films out there than 'The Matrix', in its genre and as an overall film, it is still a great, impeccably made and awe-inspiring film and ground-breaking in its visuals and sound. It was followed by two sequels, neither of them being absolute travesties but at the same time neither are close to the same level.Under review is its first sequel 'The Matrix Reloaded'. A film with some great merits that come close to matching how 'The Matrix' executed the same merits. It also suffers from some major flaws, that make it both disappointing and frustrating. Granted the Wachowskis had a mammoth task to follow and it was such a high standard to compete with, so it was always going to be touch and go as to how it was going to come off.Starting with its good things, once again while not revolutionary 'The Matrix Reloaded' looks wonderful. The production design is still audacious, the special effects dazzling and uber-cool, very slick editing and cinematography that's both clever and imaginative. Once again the music score is hypnotic and haunting, the use of sound having a real sense of eeriness.'The Matrix Reloaded' benefits from some astonishing set pieces, that benefit from looking great, breathless stunts, a great sense of paranoia, energy and tension and, while rather underused, the villains are interesting.Acting varies with Keanu Reeves still oozing super-coolness, Carrie Anne Moss bringing strength and vulnerability and Hugo Weaving a commanding presence. As charismatic as Laurence Fishburne is he does take it too seriously here with too much of a heavy approach.Which is a general problem with 'The Matrix Reloaded' in feeling too heavy and the tone being too serious. It also feels bloated, trying to do too much and also incorporating too many themes and characters, some being not that interesting.Its writing is messy as well, with so much of the dialogue being cheesy and stilted. The pace surprisingly plods, especially at the beginning that feels endless with scenes that serve little to no point or drag badly, and the finale is convoluted.In summary, not an awful film but for a reload/sequel it's vastly inferior, even for expectations being so mixed. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A film about intimacy, choice, and purpose","It is six months later. Neo and the rebel leaders have 72 hours until 250,000 machine probes discover Zion and attempt to destroy it. The Matrix Reloaded, the long-awaited sequel to the 1999 blockbuster hit The Matrix, follows the lives and destinies of the freedom fighters from Zion and continues its inquiry into our reason for being. The original had us look at the nature of the reality we live in and the sequel invites us to look at how we respond once we understand that reality. Most of the same characters are back: Neo (Keanu Reeves) as the prophesied One, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) as the enlightened rebel leader, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) as Neo's lover, and the late Gloria Foster as the Oracle, a very wise lady who tells it like it is.As the film opens, the Zionists (sic) prepare to fend off the attack of the sentinels. Morpheus is convinced Neo can save Zion, but to do so he must fend off all enemies to find the source of the Matrix. While Neo is having nightmares about Trinity's ultimate fate, Morpheus defends his decision to remove the Nebuchadnezzar from the first line of defense and shows renewed interest in his ex-lover, Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the meantime, we get our first glimpse of Zion where the main floor with its rusted iron walkways and power generators looks like the remodeled boiler room of the Titanic. After listening to an inspiring speech by Morpheus, the entire floor erupts into a sensuous dance sequence to techno music, interspersed with scenes of Neo and Trinity making love. Neo learns that he must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who alone can provide him with entry to the mysterious source that controls the Matrix. Neo tracks him down but first has to get past a seductive Monica Belluci and a witty Frenchman named Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) who seduces his women with chocolate cake.As would be expected for a film with a budget that rivals the US Treasury, the special effects are outstanding and several action sequences stand out. The first uses digital effects and the choreography of Hong Kong director Yuen Wo Ping to recreate 100 clones of Agent Smith in a fight sequence with Neo. The longest and most bizarre sequence is a 15-minute freeway chase involving hundreds of cars, a Ducati motorcycle, trailer trucks, and agents all over the place. The scene, that included a specially built stretch of highway costing $1 million, took three months to film and is estimated to have cost $38 million. Don Davis choreographs the car chases with a techno score that becomes irritating after about the second explosion.The Wachowski's have been accused of ""heavy handed moralizing"", ""a for Dummies primer on philosophy"", and ""empty-headed techno-babble"" but I think very few critics are listening to what they are actually saying. The film is about intimacy, choice, purpose, and our place in the universe. It suggests that ""everything starts with choice"" and ""the only truth is causality"". Put another way, we are the ""chooser"", the author and the cause of our own experiences. When we choose, we are really choosing what has already been chosen. `You are not here to make a choice,' the Oracle tells Neo `You have already made it. You're here to find out why'. What this means to me is that we are all here for a purpose of our own choosing and our job is to discover the appropriate means to realize that purpose. Believe me, you do not learn this in Philosophy 101.Like the original, many elements of The Matrix Reloaded are fun and appeal to a younger audience but I found the sequel to be somewhat disappointing. The original left major aspects of the puzzle to our imagination and did not overload us with special effects. The sequel is more complex but lacks the sense of wonder of the first film. We know enough not to take the car chases and fight sequences too seriously, but without the element of danger, the highly choreographed set pieces become pointless and irritating. At the end of the first film, Neo told his adversaries on the phone, ""I'm going to hang up this phone, and then show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules or controls, borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible.'  I'm still waiting for that world that no longer requires guns, weapons, punches, or kicks and where everyone gets that they are ""The One"".

Zion Disappointing but Great Car Chase,"It's a little while after The Matrix. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to defeating the machines. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now with Neo. Meanwhile the machines have start digging, and will breach Zion in 72 hours. Also Agent Smith is now free from the code and is even more powerful.It's a good start to the second installment of the series from the Wachowski brothers. There's a ticking clock. It's leading to a big battle. We're going to see Zion for the first time. Agent Smith is even more powerful. But then we get to Zion.Zion is a sweaty mess. And for people with 72 hours to live, these people go have a dance party. Instead of great running battles, the first half is a very, very excruciatingly slow grind. The program world has some interesting ideas, but that also gets too slow at times. There are too many slow expositions. There is generally too much talking and not enough doing.I still love the kung fu fighting. The addition of the twins is quite nice. The first fight against the Agent Smiths is a disappointment. It turns into a CGI video game. That's never been cool in a movie to keep switching from real stunts to CG animation cartoons. Other fights are much better. Even the later fight against the Agent Smiths is pretty good.The best part is the big highway chase. That is an amazing bit of movie-making. It's a super fun time.And I like Colonel Sanders. He's uniquely original. He's certainly memorable.Overall the first half is a major drag. The movie gets better in the second half.

Reloaded reviewed,"A big ol' bite of eye-candy. The story continues as Neo ,Trinity and Morpheus, as well as a whole slew of new characters, try to fight the programs of the Matrix. The story builds and more questions are raised. This episode starts a year or so after the first ones finale. Neo has learned quite a few new tricks and he's looking like The One. More people in Zion start to believe in the prophecy. Morpheus gives an inspirational speech to the masses in the Temple of Zion. A new character , Niobe played by Jada Pinkett Smith, adds even more sexiness to this sexy spectacle. As does Monica Beluchis character Persephone. We also meet a character named Seraph who is quite enjoyable. We learn much more about the Matrix and it's origins and so forth. This film tells the tale of the incredible corruptness inside the Matrix program. It is a CGI spectacular. The first film innovated the film making process as did this one. It not only stood up to it's predececor , it went beyond it. There was allot of adding to the plot as well as dialogue , but this films superior quality is what it looks like. It ends in a cliff hanger but don't let that get you down, it's all vindicated in the finale. I would rank this film my third favorite film of all time. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest that you go out right now and rent it or buy it. After you have seen the first one.The Matrix Trilogy is the most fascinating and inspirational story of modern times. This is what film making is about and I hope to see other films follow suit. This is what I live for. To be taken into a different world and inspired by it is something that i enjoy. I can't imagine anyone ever topping this trilogy. I also consider The Matrix as a historical event in that it gave us hope in times of doubt. It shows us the reality of our sins and explores the benefit of faith.

Fortunately, pretty much everyone *has* seen The Matrix, so we all had a general idea of what was going on, I just mention it as an example of bad film-making.Muddle and self important, reloaded takes about an hour to get going. That first hour is remarkably lame, often seeming like some stodgy gladiator epic from the '50s, and containing a remarkable stupid and unnecessary bacchanal.But although it is vastly inferior to the original, with a story that never draws you in and has neither an ending nor a good cliffhanger (the end just left me scratching my head, unclear as to why that last shot is worthy of portentous music), the movie isn't completely worthless. While the fight scenes feel more like dance scenes, with no sense that a real fight is going on, they are fun, well choreographed, and at times quite ingenious, most notably in that short fight inside a car. And while there's a lot of sophomoric crap about free will and predetermination, the explanation near the end on the structure of the Matrix and The One's purpose was a surprisingly smart sci-fi concept in a movie that for the most part was more chopsocky than sci-fi. If you've seen the first one and approach this with low expectations (or, like some of the people at this site, consider all that blather deep) you might enjoy yourself, but if you're expecting a worthy sequel to The Matrix, forget it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Matrix + Superman + Lots of State of Art Special Effects = Disappointing Sequel,"The underground city of Zion is threatened by 250,000 killing machines. Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (a fat Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss), together with the operator Link (Harold Perrneau Jr.) get the Nabucodonosor and go to the Matrix, trying to save the last sanctuary of human race. Neo meets the Oracle (Gloria Foster) trying to get information about the matrix and how to save Trinity from her fate exposed in his dream. In the matrix, Neo fight against an upgraded version of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the Twins and become aware of further details of the matrix. `The Matrix' is a fantastic and stunning movie, where an original plot was supported by great special effects. Perhaps together with `Blade Runner' are the best science fiction movies ever made. Although not being a bad movie, this sequel was a great disappointment for me. The originality of `The Matrix' is gone and it becomes indeed a great action movie, with lots of state of art effects. But the plot is very complicated and has some foolish parts, like, for example, the (long) rave party in Zion while Neo and Trinity make love. Neo flying like Superman looks ridiculous for me. Further, why fight against dozens of Agent Smith, if he could escape flying? The outfit of Neo looks like the clothes of a priest. The story is also very confused and sometimes the viewer needs to re-watch the scene or sequence to get a better comprehension. However, there are lots of action and special effects and entertains.

Crap in the rabbit hole...,"When I saw ""The Matrix"" in 1999, I told to myself: ""what a great future fable, a great story with a lot of questions about humans and machines"".

My gosh ! The journey in the rabbit hole seems full of crap.

Ramming the spoon...,"I was 11 when the first Star Wars movie came out. I wasn't mature enough to appreciate Harrison Ford's space-cowboy smirk or Carrie Fischer's sarcasm, much less the swagger of their respective deliveries. All I cared about was robots blasting other robots.By the time The Matrix hit theaters in 1999, we had seen enough action-packed sci-fi over the years to make us cringe. Our demands had increased exponentially.We now expect both a story as well as the actors' performance to retain some amount of integrity. If this is missing, no amount of kicking or shooting can rid us of the feeling that we've just been wasting our time in a way that was only acceptable when we were 11.In light of all the negative reviews on Reloaded, I tried not to expect too much. Still, I paid a whopping $9.00 at the box-office of a top-notch theater equipped with the beefiest sound system in town. During and after, I felt embarrassed for having done so.I was given the distinct impression that Andy and Larry themselves had never even seen The Matrix.Reloaded is an entirely different film from The Matrix. It reeks of a sell-out, of board rooms filled with brainstorming marketing-scammers, of a colossal rip-off that seems to have forgotten what Generation X liked most about The Matrix: its atmospheric flair.In The Matrix, we're taken on a post-modern coming-of-age journey with Neo. In Reloaded, it's not Neo, but CGI that's the focus of the film.Reloaded is nothing more than a full-length feature COMPUTER GAME. So why not just go play one?The Matrix was a slick and suspenseful FILM, in which the viewer identified with the underdogs' characters. We rejoiced when they overcame. But Reloaded lacks any treatment of the protagonist's development, or anyone else's for that matter, allowing the viewer to identify with the plight of no-one.The Matrix closed out with a pounding tune by Rage Against the Machine, who scream ""Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy!!!"" So what happened to this perspective?It's Invasion of the Body Snatchers: The original writers were replaced by 14-year-old computer geeks more eager to escape into the arms of a voluptuous, blonde computer program than they are in making a film.Reloaded is so pristinely sterile, odorless, emotionless, CHARACTER-less, and at times so pubescently vulgar, it's hard to believe these are the same writers.This affects even the best of actors. It's disheartening to see the Othello of The Matrix reverse roles with Keanu in respect of acting quality.Fishburne's droning recital of horrific, pseudo-intellectual musing is so stilted, you can almost hear the director urging him to be ""More serious, Laurence! You've got to be more Morpheus than Morpheus himself ever knew he was!""Further criticisms include:---Actions sequences too clean (i.e. retouched) and drawn-out. Suspense is lost;---CGI used far too often to smooth over gaps in bullet-time photography. The least trained eye easily spots Gumby-like cartoon drawings stretching across the screen;---Acting and writing brutally stilted. Offends the most ill-equipped intellect. One has the impulse to ignore the dialog completely as a means of punishing it, like parents deliberately not reacting to a 10-year old who tries to shock them with foul language. Misguided attempts at 10th-grade level pop-philosophy add to superficiality;---The direction the story takes views like a made-for-TV Stargate spin-off with an all-new no-name cast. Story and characters are hideously compromised, amateurishly convoluted;---Nothing short of fury is generated by what sloppy writing did to Agent Smith (now a renegade evil hippie-bot on a soul-search, seeking revenge for reasons frighteningly lacking depth) and the Oracle (now trivialized by meandering, contrived oracle-speak, reduced to a pseudo-smarmy program, a side-act as opposed to the pithy element she was). These two key characters are robbed of their sovereignty and depth;---Sets in Zion are too Hollywood, mat-drawing or CGI. Costumes are straight out of Star Trek the Next Generation or a Calvin Klein commercial for Woodstock-copycat wannabe ravers. This contrasts harshly with underdog Matrix-hackers all wearing moth-eaten sweaters on the Nebuchadnezzar vis-a-vis Zion mission control's immaculate, glaring white, state-of-the-art hi-tech garb. Overload of scenes with superfluous counsels and commanders who all have something TERRIBLY important to say;---Twins are pubescently extravagant disco-albino Casper-the-Ghost punching bags. The freeway chase scene is among the most drawn-out sequences; leaves one addled, apathetic;---We anticipated seeing ""the minds Neo freed"" and how Neo does this more than anything, far more than him rescuing himself and his pals. The writers completely ignore this.In sum:This movie has nothing to do with the original, where it left off, or its 'message'.We overestimated the Wachowski Bros. when we hoped they would present a follow-up that would hold true to 'what it means' to be an underdog, hack a Matrix or rage against a machine.The Bros. need to rewind to scenes where Carrie-Anne Moss delivers lines from the back seat of a suicide-door Caddy in the rain: 'You've been down that road Neo...', or Laurence Fishburne's 'I suspect that right about now you're feeling a bit like Alice ... tumbling down the rabbit hole'. The feeling scenes like those evoked is long lost. Instead, the Bros. just reload and regurgitate on us, CGI-style.Talents of accomplished actors are squandered. The actors themselves come across brow-beaten by lousy script-writing until performances are all less than equal to Keanu's robotics.Between 1999 and 2003, the Bros. seem to have forgotten what it means to rock like underdogs.Maybe it's because the dollar signs on their eyes have blinded them. Reloaded not only abandons its own previously postulated truth ... that ""there is no spoon"" ... it now INSISTS there is one, and promptly proceeds to ram it down our throats.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Every morning I was able to shake hands with Laurence F. when I was to do my job. It was awesome to see how they filmed the stunts up on the big rig trailer and the fight scenes.

"Slow, but solid and enjoyable","To tell the truth, I've always found The Matrix phenomenon a little overrated. While I enjoyed the original film for what it was, a slick sci-fi/action comic book on celluloid, I felt the script was needlessly rhetorical, and attempts at depth and philosophy were instantly floored by one-note performances. That said, it was still a lot of fun with imagery that has become every bit as iconic as more substantial genre staples.Cut four years to Reloaded, and what we have is a totally different style of film. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Reloaded is every bit as good as its predecessor, neither better nor worse. Still don't expect any 'acting' here, but what we do receive is further exploration and enhancement of the exciting premise the films are based on. Reloaded might be less action and more talk, but the talk is genuinely interesting, and for the first time, The Matrix comes across as being a genuine sci-fi franchise that at least is making a half-decent stab at greatness, as opposed to being the vidkid's wet dream.The action comes in short bursts, but what action it is! The highway chase sequence is brilliance, true edge of seat stuff that even surpasses the first film. What's not so great is the unhealthy fascination with slow-mo shots. It creates a feel of 'yes guys, we know you can do special effects, now GET ON WITH IT'.But the true strength of Reloaded is its perfect fit with the original film.It answers the questions, its philosophy is less rhetorical, and while its characters come across as even weaker than they were in the first film (no mean feat!), the story is too engaging for you to really notice.It isn't a classic, it's just a strong follow up to a strong mainstream popcorn film. With a little less overconfidence, stronger character development and tighter editing it could have been truly great.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not as good as the first,"(2003) The Matrix Reloaded
ACTIONBecause ""Matrix"" did so well at the box office, Warner Brothers demanded the Wachowski Brothers and company another sequel as well as a third even though the first one stands alone on it's own, and by doing so offered huge salaries for everybody who wanted in, especially Keanu Reeves who was paid the most from this of 15 or was it 25 million to star in 2 and 3! In my opinion all this is a major cash grab for the Warner Brothers! To explain the plot of this is idiotic because it consists more meandering whatever one would know from the first one, all it's left is the action. The action scenes are new but 98% of it is quite boring which includes many boring fights with wires, special effects and fast- forward special effects all in one. Action auteur Yuen Woo- Ping who worked from Jackie Chan to Bruce Lee directed the action for all three films except that the first one consists of something inventive and new people had never saw before. I mean, to see someone fight using plenty of wires and effects that everybody has already seen before can be downright boring! The only action scene I liked of this one is occurs only on the beginning involving Trinity played by Carrie Ann Moss where a big explosion happens and use of a bike helmet to beat up on some guys is very cool to look at.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix: Deflated!,"The Wachowskis, having bitten off more than they can digitise in this, the second ""coming"" of so many computer nerd's wet dreams, have over-stepped their dubious talent here - obviously victims of their own hype! THIS is the computer game - THE MATRIX was the movie!To be expected, the flick has its die-hard adherents who would happily take a lie-detector test to convince us that they alone can penetrate the bulldust and fathom a master-plan in progress. This armored, but essentially - cranially displaced movie, is, like the sum of Morpheus' spoutings, heavy on pretense, light on significance. Fishburne's Moses-inspired ""address to the nation"" atop Pride Rock, must rank as the most non-sensical piece of dialog ever uttered in a movie. Even HE looks utterly embarrassed to be there, frequently pausing as if wondering ""WHAT did I just say?"" The entire sequence in fact, including the orgiastic rave with a BLADE soundtrack, appears to have been inspired by THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.As for THAT completely loopy and sex-less coupling with Carrie Ann Moss, I had to avert my eyes for fear of being rendered sterile! (Talk about LOT's wife!) C'mon....the woman looks old enough to be Reeve's mother and unintentionally cruel though it is, has any love interest ever been less attractive in the history of cinema? Reeves MUST have been wearing shades to do it! (Footnote to Miss Moss: No insult intended Carrie, I'm no better - way past my own use-by date but hey, LOVED the catwoman outfit!)Reeves in fact appears majorly stilted and wooden throughout proceedings here (yeah, I know that IS par for the course for dear old Keanu, but Hell, couldn't NEO (gosh thats brilliant - anagram of ONE,  Thank you HAL!) have had just a little fun? As for his excruciatingly prolonged brawl with the replicated Agent Smiths....what the HELL was that?.....realistic? meaningful? intellectual? spiritual? None of the above, this was pretentious, laughable, overlong and irritating. Did LESS than nothing for the flick's credibility. One may also well ask, why, with his ability to leap tall buildings and fly at warp factor 10, would he even be bothered with such mundane fisticuffs in the first place? If he can repel bullets and the considerably better equipped aliens simply by holding his hand up, whats the deal here with the army of Weavings?  The sequence of course was not intended for logical contemplation. simply to impart to the popcorn-munching cretins that ""hey, ain't this one FUN movie?""Quantum physics, Crane-crap, Zen Buddhism, Armani fashions, Cecil B De Mille, Fritz Lang and Jacke Chan aside, what are we LEFT with here?  A half-decent freeway chase and ONLY the second other intelligent part of the movie - the sequence with the architect.

The magic is gone,"Although I'm not gonna say matrix reloaded was a bad movie, it was certainly a disappointing movie. The visual effects, fight scenes, action sequences etc. were superb, and indeed far beyond those of the first movie. What was sorely lacking though was that sense of wonder and amazement there was in the first movie as the viewer journeyed with neo in discovering just what the matrix is and and just what the task was at hand. Also, I felt that the dialogue fell flat in many areas, and that was on of the strengths of the original as well. When I learned that sequels were being made, I wondered how they were going to manage to keep the excitement with neo being something equivalent to superman. Sadly, I was right in surmising that it would just be a special effects spectacular devoid of the surrealism and sense of mystery that made the first one a classic. Rather, this movie was just a ludicrous amalgamation of cool powers and hokey plot conveniences which just didn't satisfy the viewer as completely as the original matrix. Overall though, it was still a very entertaining movie, and I would not say don't see it, but also, don't go in with expectations soaring as I did.

The action scenes and special effects are incredible, but they are too much. The original knew how to separate the storyline and maintain the spectacle.

"Fine second chapter to the Matrix series, in some ways better that the first.","'In some ways better than the first.'  The problem with 2nd and further installments is the novelty is gone, and 'novelty' counts for a lot in this type of Sci-Fi movie. The original Matrix introduced us to that unique world, the travel between the real world and the matrix, the idea of Neo being a savior of sorts, the inventive photography, like 'bullet time', that has influenced a whole generation of movies and TV commercials. So, in 'The Matrix - Reloaded' we don't have to benefit of discovering all those things, instead we see the deeper development of the story, and a fine story it is.My only real complaint is that some of the fight scenes went on for too long. While I enjoyed them, after a short time they essentially keep repeating and I wanted for the story to move forward. But that is a relatively minor complaint for what as a whole is a superb movie. However, I rate the first installment above it, for the reasons I state at the beginning of my review. Much as the first 'Back To The Future' and the first 'Indiana Jones' movies were the best of their series.I own the DVD, and will buy the DVD of the 3rd installment, even though it has received some harsh criticism from some quarters. The Matrix movies have influenced , and will continue to influence, many movies made after them. I would not want to be without the complete set.

I like it more than the first one.,"So why do i like this movie more than the first one? Let me tell you.
It is because in the first one, i thought there would be more matrix and less the sci-fi stuff, which i did not like as much. This movie has a lot of matrix. It also has better and more action scenes in my opinion. I simply enjoy the action scenes more than the think really hard scenes. This movie gave me what i wanted, which was more stuff inside the matrix and more action scenes, and that i got. Yes, there is that weird scene with the french guy and the orgasm, but i can forgive that, because after that there is like a half an hour chase scene, which ends so epicly. 
The cgi which a lot of people say is really bad, i thought it is fine and i did not really mind it. It did not bother me.

"It lives up to the first with action, but not with writing.","Pretty much everyone's opinion on Reloaded is the same: Awesome action, not as great of a plot. I see a lot of reviews saying that the narritive is ""confusing"", but I actually felt like I understood the ideas it was laying out even though I only watched it once, and because it likes to be obtuse with how it presents them. My real issue with this movie is HOW it lays out these ideas. I found the dialog very didactic and boring. The first movie uses the mystery of uncovering the matrix and the truth about reality as its narritive center and produces several incredibly iconic moments and a 10/10 experience. But now that the curtain is down, Reloaded is just part one of a movie about saving the world from machine overlords.Most scenes consist of one character (usually Neo), asking questions the writers know the audience wants answered, and another character answering those questions. Most side characters' only purpose is just to spout exposition and have little to no impact on the plot. I mean, for gods sake, we're basiclly told toward the end that everything inside the matrix is inevitable. It gets the job done and sets us up for the finale, but I honestly have no interest in ever rewatching this film.I think the simple truth is that the idea of the first movie is way more interesting and the writers were significantly more inspired by mystery of discovering the Matrix than they were by the idea of battling the Matrix.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"I found the whole freedom of will discussion thought-provoking, and an admirable addition to the intelligent nature of the series","The original Matrix was a huge hit back in 1999, introducing the world to bullet-time special effects and the creative brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski.

In reality, it is actually sometime in the 2200's, and machines have taken over mankind, hacking all humans into a parallel universe called The Matrix, to prevent them from resisting and making them believe in a false reality.

That film also introduced us to Neo's arch-nemesis, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a menacing villain who is sent by the machines to stop Neo inside The Matrix, but eventually goes rogue after Neo overcome him.Naturally, with such a set up, the world was uptight so see what will come next in the Matrix universe. The first installment left viewers anticipating (and not always satisfied), and the box office success of that film led up to The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolution (parts 2 and 3 of the sci-fi trilogy) being filmed back to back en route to their hyped up release back in 2003. The results, however, were a mixed bag with audiences. While Reloaded was a box office smash with over 280 million dollars of receipts on the domestic side alone, Revolutions, which was released later that year earned less than half than that. People claimed Reloaded was too contrived for its own good, and that Revolution's final conclusion was a far cry from what they have expected. Personally speaking, I had a blast watching both sequels, and think that the original film just set a bar that was way too high for any film to stand up to. I, for one, was happy with what I got.The Matrix Reloaded tells us about an upcoming attack of the machines on Zion, the last human pocket of resistance. Neo must ultimately find the architect, the computer program that is responsible for The Matrix, in an attempt to prevent this attack. Meanwhile, he is haunted by visions of a dark faith awaiting his beloved Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and is encouraged by Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) to live up to the prophecy. During his mission, Neo encounters a new revelation that might shake the foundations of the Matrix before the humans do: computer programs who feel emotion, be it hatred by Mr. Smith or lust by Persephone. The movie was received with much doubts by fans and critics, as it is a more spiritual and philosophical journey than its predecessor. While many thought the questions aroused regarding freedom of choice and freedom of will were mainly boring and pretentious, I found the whole discussion thought provoking, and an admirable addition to the intelligent nature of the series. I also don't understand the yakking about lack of action  the car chase sequence with the twins and the multiple-Smith battle sequence were some of the best action scenes yet to grace the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More and More,"Of course, the novelty of the original film has worn off, but The Wachowskis are most resourceful in keeping the pot on a full boil. Early on, a new character is introduced, played by Anthony Zerbe. His slight smile--in contrast to the straight faces of all the other very serious, impassive players--betrays a touch of embarrassment, perhaps, at appearing in this melange of mid-20th century stuff, ""Superman,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" and ""Captain Video."" After a half billion dollar gross for the first movie, this sequel pulled in three quarters of a billion. Still, it's more of the same.

Ingenious,"The first Matrix movie was, in a lot of sense, pretty conventional.  I know it spurred much-imitated style and effects that are not only implemented in other movies that followed but also parodied in comedies. But consider the other elements: premise isn't so revolutionary (as Roger Ebert points out in his 1999 review, the concept is very similar to that of Dark City and Strange Days), storyline follows the quest-of-the-Christ-figure archetype that's been around throughout history, and the climax comes down to the conventional bout between the hero and his nemesis.  Fun, but ordinary nevertheless. The Matrix Reloaded takes leaps and bounds in its ingenuity.  Action is fiercer and more entertaining (from the thrills of the freeway chase to the sheer fun of watching Neo beat up on 200 copies of Agent Smith with a steel pole), plot thickens in truly revolutionary ways that leaves you both enlightened and dumbfounded, and the climax of the movie isn't some tired old fight sequence but a philosophical discussion and discovery of what the One truly is (or is it really true?). In the end, the movie leaves more questions than it answers, and that is precisely what the part two of a trilogy is supposed to do.  It hits at all facets and levels, and turns the Matrix triology, which seemed to be a more or less conventional trilogy, into a truly novel story of a scale grander than you could have imagined after seeing on the first Matrix.  This is the best ""part two"" flick in a trilogy since Empire Strikes Back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great action sequences but lacks story.,"This movie has some great fighting, even better than the first movie, but the overall plot and story is not interesting in the slightest and I was sitting there waiting for the next action scene.

Visually stimulating,"This is the second in the series and as I watched this spectacle I had to think of what kind of imagination Andy and Larry Wachowski have in their psyche. As difficult as it is to watch and understand these films its almost unfathomable to think up a story like this. The story continues with Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn) as they try and figure out how the machines can be stopped from invading their world and they suspect that there is a leak somewhere. The shots of the human world reminded me of some of the sets in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. Big and cavernous and some of the shots inside the homes looked like it may have been shot on a large ship. Actor Anthony Zerbe plays Councillor Hamann and Gloria Foster is the Oracle. They are the ones that give the okay to infiltrate the other side and try and locate the ""Keymaster"" who is suppose to have a key that can unlock a special door. Their are some lapses in the film where nothing happens and some have complained about them. But what are you going to do? Complain that the makers of the film were trying to move the story along without action? You can't have action every minute. The action scenes are spectacular though. At times they become almost breathtaking and technically they are some of the best ever put on film. I also felt that they were just put in for eye candy and had little to do with the story. The battle between Neo and the 100 agent Smith's seemed pointless although it was fun to watch! Reeves seems to have even less lines to speak in this one than the first. He just stands around when not kicking ass. The character of Trinity played by Moss is the one that seems to have been expanded. You can make a good point that she steals the film. Film has no real ending and it just sets itself up for the third installment that comes out this fall. I felt some mixed emotions when I was done watching this and while technically its probably more impressive than the first film I felt Reeves character of Neo seemed under used. Also, what was that messy dance all the people were doing in the first part of the film? Can't they wear shoes? Story structure seemed a little off but this is still a very entertaining film to watch. Visually stimulating and some truly memorable action scenes make this a fun viewing experience. For you trivia buffs out there, at one point in the film a police radio utters the phrase ""One Adam-12"". Also, boxer Roy Jones Jr. has a small role.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great, but...","The second part has the Matrix Universe expanded. But, it really affected the quality of the film. First part was the cream, confined to the subject and every second was thrilling and interesting. Here, audience are dragged into so many things, which are not really necessary or should have been done better, like the underworld, and other ships. Fight scenes kept the standard, though some parts of the CGI is amateur especially watching after 19 years. The free way chase and action sequences are the best and one of my most favorites in the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Loads of fun,"1999's The Matrix was a monster success when it was released. As with all major summer blockbusters, if a sequel was talked about, the anticipation was high and it was no different here. Matrix Reloaded would be the follow up to the monster success and was released in 2003. The film was directed by the Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Gloria Foster. The film would prove to be a huge financial success and was at the time, the highest grossing R-rated movie (until Deadpool). Critically, the film received generally positive reviews but nowhere near what the first film received and that is still the case to this day.With the danger of an army of 250,000 Sentinels coming to destroy the remaining human population, it is up to Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity to delve deeper into the Matrix and help save the remaining human population.Within the first few minutes of this film, the film makes itself fairly clear on what type of film it is going to be. A balls to the wall action film and this film does that spectacularly. I found the first film's action to be somewhat lacking. Still good, but it was the action in this film that I was really wanting to see. Every fight scene from the martial arts to the guns blazing fight scenes were loads of fun to watch and, dare I say, better than a lot of what we get in the original film. Granted, the CGI, when used, is not great and looks a bit cartoonish with the CGI people. But I was never too bothered by it. I found it to be fairly common for this type of CGI to be used in the early 2000's (with films like 2002's Spiderman and such). But, this film wanted to go balls to the wall and they managed to do that with what the technology was capable of doing at the time. There is a wide variety of action in this film. One could argue that the original film was a good way of ending the story and they would be right. But knowing more about the Matrix and Zion is nice too and the film for the most part gives us all that. Zion was only mentioned in the first film and I feel that in this film, knowing what Zion looks like and how it functions as the last human civilization is far more rewarding. We know more about the Matrix and with all great mysteries, when it comes to adding more and more details, it will make people a bit mad because everyone has their own idea of what the solutions to these mysteries are. These new details are largely left unexplained or would later be explained in Matrix Revolutions. The first film was heavy into the philosophical dialogue and that is fine and it works well for the first film. It could be argued that the first film handled all of the philosophical mumbo jumbo best because it was the first film and came unexpected and got people thinking. By default, this film's philosophical dialogue is not nearly as good but there is less of it. With the first film, you kind of have to be in the right mindset to be able to be held captive by the dialogue. With this film, you have the action which is something the mainstream audience could get behind and therefore, could get the mainstream behind the philosophical dialogue. The acting is fairly good. In other words, same quality of acting seen in the first film.I think Matrix Reloaded is a different type of film, it is more action oriented and with that being said, does a superb job at that. It really can be a toss up whether you want the more philosophical film or the more action oriented film. But largely, this film has the minor flaws of the original film. Overall, a good popcorn flick that is loads of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Like watching your little brother play video games,"An opportunity wasted.  A good story gone to pot.  Too much focus on trying to appease the theoretical needs of gen Y and their videogame mindset. Which came first - the movie or the video game?  During several long (and overwhelmingly dull) ""action"" scenes I felt like I was looking over someone's shoulder in a video arcade.  Boring with a capital B!  The movie redeemed itself somewhat towards the end when they actually got on with the story but lots of it was painful to watch nonetheless.  Several times I caught myself thinking (a) am I so out of touch with today's pop culture that I'm the only one who doesn't like this crap?, or (b) what on earth am I doing here?  I should be outside enjoying life.  And the rave scene? What was with that?  That was one of the dumbest scenes ever made.

Neo & co. return in full-tilt form; one of the best sequels ever!,"THE MATRIX RELOADED (2003) **** Awe-inspiring sequel to the insanely popular sci-fi series (chapter 2 in the upcoming conclusive trilogy) with Reeves as Neo, the chosen one, leading the rebel force of humans to stop the upcoming war between machines with mankind in the virtual reality of `the matrix' with several obstacles in his newly formed path of choices not the very least his arch rival and lethal nemesis Agent Smith (silky evil personified by Weaving also reprising his iconic role); realizing his true powers via The Oracle (Foster, who passed away shortly after filming her last role here) and his mentor, the visionary Morpheus (Fishburne, the baddest cat of the new millennia); and the ongoing romance with the always stoically sexy Trinity (Moss showing new meanings to the term 'ballsy').  On hand to help are newcomers including operator Perrineau and his main squeeze/warrior Gaye (who replaced the late r&b singer Aaliyah who was killed prior to the film's production); Pinkett Smith as Morpheus' ex and fellow sentinel freedom fighter who shares some bad blood with fellow commander Lennix and the Keymaker (Duk Kim who provides the missing link to total domination); and on the opposite side of good: femme fatale Bellucci, the jaw-droppingly beautiful concoction of Eurotrash magnate Lambert's; the diabolically deceitful albino-Rasta locked Rayment twins and the tricky Architect of the parallel universe (Bakaitis).  The true stars are the groundbreakingly awesome visual effects cooked up by the filmmaking sibling wunderkinds The Wachowsky Brothers, Andy and Larry, who incorporate sci-fi, Hong Kong martial arts (kudos to master ass-kicking maestro Woo-ping Yuen for the astounding choreography), Superman ethos mixed with every conceivable religious philosophies (Judeo/Christina, Zen Buddhism, Jedi) and comic book underpinnings to full high-octane effect.  Best bits: Neo's fight with a phalanx of replicated Smiths and for my money the price of admission alone for the 15 minute freeway chase/fight extravaganza that has film vault written all over it.

"Not that bad, m8","Some seriously Impressive GCI and fight choreography, as well as the reveal of Zion, many, many more human characters unplugged from The Matrix, and decent expansions of the franchise's two worlds are some of the things this movie gets right.Unfortunately, the dialogue dragging on forever and trying to use big words to sound important to the pint where dialogue becomes nearly impossible to understand in a important climactic scene and the movie's attempt at a ""story"" being hard to follow if one at all are some of the things the movie gets wrong. Also, I'm trying to keep the review spoiler-free but, to keep it vague, the return of a previously dead character and their newfound abilities seem a little forced and the movie barely tries to explain them.But at the end of the day the movie's pretty good and I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the first, just know it's not as good as the first. So DO WATCH. If anything this movie's biggest flaw is that it's ending is concluded in the not so good 3rd movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A great sequel, once you have seen the trilogy","First of let me say, i can see why people didn't like this. It had few instance where it made you think until your brain hurt, and just didn't make sense at times. Once you've seen the whole trilogy couple of times and re-watching this one, you start to appreciate it much more. The Matrix Reloaded has the increase in quality, if it can be said that there actually is one, from the first movie is more the result of an increased budget than anything else. I loved the new movie, but the talent was there in the first one, you can just tell that in the sequel the Wachowski brothers had a virtually endless budget, which allowed them to do pretty much anything they wanted. They have a very distinct style that is clearly evident in all of their movies, even if they are not laden with special effects. The fluidity of the camera movement and the strangely dark tones of their films are only a couple of the techniques that make them recognizable.The story continues as Neo ,Trinity and Morpheus, as well as a whole slew of new characters, try to fight the programs of the Matrix. The story builds and more questions are raised. This episode starts a year or so after the first ones finale. Neo has learned quite a few new tricks and he's looking like The One. More people in Zion start to believe in the prophecy. Morpheus gives an inspirational speech to the masses in the Temple of Zion. A new character , Niobe played by Jada Pinkett Smith, adds even more sexiness to this sexy spectacle. As does Monica Beluchis character Persephone. We also meet a character named Seraph who is quite enjoyable. We learn much more about the Matrix and it's origins and so forth. This film tells the tale of the incredible corruptness inside the Matrix program.The first film innovated the film making process as did this one. It not only stood up to it's predecessor, it went beyond it. There was allot of adding to the plot as well as dialogue.This was a film, where every knew that it was the middle of the story, so it didn't have a clear start or finish and Wachowski brothers knew that and that allowed them to make this film so complex that it distracted some viewers and scared some fans.The whole trilogy needs to be watched together and not apart. It is a very complex film that has a lot of underlying messages.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
In a whole different league than the first,"At the end of the original Matrix film, after Neo comes back to life, there is this sort of moment of realization. All the rules are broken, and we're given a glimpse of all the possibilities of this world with no rules. That moment of realization is expanded throughout all of Reloaded, and we're given so much more than just a glimpse. If The Matrix is about paranoia, than The Matrix Reloaded is certainly about discovery. I definitely liked the first better, but I really appreciate how this one takes everything further and stays 10 steps ahead of the audience. Remember when the original first came out and everyone said how confusing the plot was at first? Looking back now, that plot was simple compared to this one. You have to watch Reloaded a couple of times to really get a hold of everything.Along with the advanced plot, the special effects are advanced, too. There are some great fight scenes, and of course the infamous freeway chase sequence. In between all the action there is a lot of talk. Mostly about very confusing paradoxal stuff. You start to wonder if Stephen Hawking had a hand in writing the script. But I really liked those parts. No movie has really asked all of these questions and created such a unique world to ask them in. Those were the parts that got people to watch the movie again.The only parts that I can actually say bored me were all the scenes taking place on Zion. That's where a lot of the film's weak points take place, such as Morpheus' cheesy speech. Sure, it was probably intentionally cheesy (that seems like just the kind of character Morpheus is), and I didn't hate or resent the Zion scenes, I just wish they were shorter. Around those points I usually hit the fast-forward button. I was most interested by the scenes inside the Matrix.I really liked this movie overall. I was hesitant to see it at first since I loved the original so much, and I thought the commercials for Reloaded looked pretty stupid, but I took a chance and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see Revolutions.My rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The agent on the highway scene. . .,"My favourite scene in the movie was the highway chase scene where an agent jumps from the bonnet of one car to the bonnet of another one and crushes it into--you saw the movie, no need for me tell you how cool that scene was. The action in this movie was bigger and better--just blew me away!What made the first movie better than this one was the mind blowing discovery that went with it--how the amazing story reveals *What Is The Matrix?* and the *Bullet Time* concept used in shooting and directing the movie. But Matrix Reloaded expanded well on the amazingly realistic computer generated effects and on the story, in a way that was not predictable and that offered answers to questions like how the oracle knows what she knows, programmes in the matrix, the machines, zion and so on. The characters were all very cool, looked good--both in the first movie and this one. Plus the *to be concluded* ending was not cruel, but leaves one speculating on what next. I expect Matrix Revolutions will be one hell of a battle!And speaking of expectations, the people who felt cheated by this movie were actually failed by their expectations, not the film. The merit of the film definitely didn't fail in its quality and excellence and deserves the praise it has-and still is-getting.

Hopeless People Can't Dance,"The one thing everybody seems to agree on is that the Rave scene was unnecessary. I beg to differ. We'd only heard about Zion in the first film. In this one, we see the city itself, but only a smattering of its purported 250,000 citizens at first, so we needed to see what the stakes were: Ergo, a massive gathering. After they've been given the news that they might all be dead within the next day or so, we needed to see that they haven't lost hope, yet keep them together in the same space, rather than let them disperse and find their own fun activities. Well, pretty much the only display of unity that can be performed with athleticism by an individual in-place while standing shoulder-to-shoulder with thousands of others is dancing.... Club-style!

Unfinished Business,"'Matrix Reloaded' is the first part of a two series sequel to the original 'Matrix' (which was one of my favorites - a 10/10 which I rarely give). It not only ends with the magic and promising 'To Be Continued', but it also leaves many of the characters as well as the action suspended in waiting for the final. However, it does take a full ticket price to see it, it's a business after all, and a rewarding one it seems. Thus, the comments are also for the full price we pay and in my opinion, it is an unfinished business. 7/10 on my personal scale, largely a disappointment relative to the original.The Big thing in 'Reloaded' are the effects. Though it does not provide anything similar with the genius vision of the Matrix of humans connected to provide energy for the machines - one of the greatest visual images of the seventh art from the original - it has a huge amount of special effects of memorable creativity and force.Nothing really new concerning the Matrix. After the positive shock of the original idea, it looks like the authors have not much new to say, and the action is not much better than classical science fiction - humanity fighting machines or aliens - it really does not matter. It's good stuff, but not genial as expected (sorry guys, you are the ones who created the great expectations). Worse, a lot of pseudo-religious, pseudo-Shakespeare talk makes the film too heavy, and even sometimes boring.Overall, good entertainment, but not much more. Let us wait for the third film, and expect that we will be rewarded. I am ready to apologize to the 'Matrix'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An enjoyable film that you may or may not find annoying and unnecessary,"I'm not going to bother recounting the plot direction of The Matrix Reloaded. There are two reasons for this: first, it's up there in the 'plot' section, and second, it's actually not relevant to whether or not you like (or will like) this film. Allow me to explain.Watched on its own merit, Reloaded isn't terrible; I dare say it's quite good. It even has little glimmers of genuine brilliance. The extraordinary backlash against it was less because of its actual content and more because of its existence at all: The Matrix was such a standalone unit in everybody's mind that any sequel could only have felt like a clunky shift from single film to serialisation. I tested my own intuitions on this by asking myself what would have constituted a good, non-disappointing sequel to The Matrix and realised that nothing would have met the mark. We were always going to feel that one of our modern classics had been violated to some degree.There's much that's good about Reloaded, not least the exposition and development of the inner workings of the Matrix and AI. Smith's character gets a working over and becomes, if possible, even more interesting: the unsettling discrepancy between him and the other agents and his relentless, unfathomable-even-to-him desire for freedom from his own system and nature, are picked up from the first film and fleshed out, so to speak. There's a much broader cast and much of the supporting acting is excellent: Anthony Zerbe as the head Councillor in Zion stood out for me. His small, quiet scenes escaped my notice entirely at first, because first time round I was impatient to see more relevant things happening, but on repeat viewings they're welcome changes of pace.However, there are teething problems. Tank (Marcus Chong), everybody's favourite operator in The Matrix and a generally fantastic character, has no appearance; his replacement is Link, played by Harold Perinneau, who I'd previously encountered playing Michael in Lost. He annoyed me more in this film than in that series, because whereas Lost shoehorned him into the Angry Black Man stereotype for a long time before giving him some real characterisation Reloaded seems content to ignore his abilities as an actor entirely and use him primarily for comic relief during tenser moments. Someone narrowly escapes death: back in his control room, Link squeals with relief; that sort of thing. It's a matter of personal taste, but I could have handled him being a more serious character.I can only talk about acting for so long before mentioning Keanu Reeves, and it's that time again. Keanu is all over this film. He ramps it up here with love scenes, meditative dialogues (in which the aforementioned Anthony Zerbe, among others, sort of draws attention to Keanu by out-acting him considerably) and a small handful of one-liners. If you have a serious Keanu allergy, you simply won't be able to enjoy this film. Whereas in The Matrix his stiff, quiet style was in-character for the stiff, confused pre-enlightenment Neo, Reloaded has him take centre place as the hero of the film and if you can't stand watching him act then it's probably not worth your time. Personally, he's starting to grow on me.I mentioned love scenes. Romance plays a bigger part in this film, which for my money is a bad thing because it's never really been the Wachowski brothers' forté. The first film had kind of a weird relationship with...relationships, with Neo and Trinity ostensibly falling in love after a few weeks of tense, brief exchanges in cars and between gunfights. Reloaded continues their bizarre, silent courtship. The subplot of their relationship is central to the story, so it pops up again and again, but it never seems to bring the film's better moments: wherever love is concerned, the script seems to take a break, and most of the romantic dialogue feels clunky and forced. You may experience it differently. But just so you're forewarned, you will hear Keanu Reeves utter the phrase, ""I love you too damn much"".On a happier note, there are a ton of new antagonists, all of whom are extremely fun to watch; Morpheus takes a close-to-centre role again, getting a lot of the screen time and doing awesome things with it; and though it probably doesn't need mentioning, the action sequences are a joy to watch. Cars are crashed, lorries explode, bullets fly, doors melt in slow motion, and it's generally action fodder of the highest calibre. The sound effects team went a little overboard, with every slightest movement of a sword being punctuated by a 'shhiinng!' and that bassy bullet-time noise filling roughly half the film - the rest being filled by over-the-top orchestral climaxes - but it's not experience-breaking.Ultimately, though, these are secondary concerns. Your ability to enjoy this film will hinge on whether or not you feel The Matrix *needed* a sequel. The comment I hear most often about Reloaded is that it just didn't need to happen; if that's how you feel about it, you'll probably find Reloaded annoying and disappointing, at least at first, despite the fact that it's really quite good. If that was your experience at the cinema and you haven't watched it since, though, give it another chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A fitting second installment,"This did exactly what I think most avid fans of the first movie needed from a sequel. It had scenes that will be remembered for years to come such as Neo fighting a 100 Agent Smith's, or the car chase taking your breath away with every twist and turn. Most of all, the moment Neo dives between two collided trucks on the verge of mass explosion to save his crew. Shocking how something like that can be seen by our own eyes in a cinema and not just in our dreams, that moment alone demands the admission fee. I sat in the cinema and for the first part I felt let down by the rave sequence which wasn't to my taste. I thought it was drawn out and had no purpose in the film, I nearly lost sight, I started to get this sinking feeling. Yet I got beyond that when the pace of the film built up to a furious finale. I was immensely pleased by Reloaded. Every second since I sat through 'The Matrix' I had wanted a sequel. I had wanted to know what was going to happen in the world the Wachowski brothers had created, finally it is here, and I am far from disapointment. I don't see how anyone can be. They are not shortchanging us by leaving us on a cliffhanger they are giving us the 3rd and final part 6 months later so that the trilogy can be finished. I think the series is more of two movies, in which the 2nd and 3rd will act as a 6 hour sequel to the first. So make your judgements after seeing the finished article. All I know is that from the first and second movies I have witnessed movie magic, in scenes which I can talk about with my friends for years to come. I think a problem with reviewing Reloaded so early since its release, not even waiting for a good 5 or so viewings is wrong. 'The Matrix' wasn't a one time only watchable movie. I had to sit through it again and again to understand all of its messages before I could get to grips with the whole concept. This is what should be done with Reloaded. Given time and multiple viewings most fans of the first movie will see it as a fitting second to the series. I recently read the transcript to the meeting between Neo and the Architect, which at the time I became lost after 3 seconds of staring into the old mans beard. Yet reading the script I realised how intelligently the story has evolved. Simply there is too much information to be taken in whilst viewing Reloaded, a stigma attached to the first. So given time Reloaded will be seen as a huge success as it rightly should be. Take away the rave scene and you have yourself a 10 out of 10.One thing I'd like to see from Revolutions is Neo beating up some fat-blokes.

Regretting Matrix,"Now I am going to assume that you have seen the first Matrix movie. If that is not the case, do not blame me for pointing things out that happened in the first movie that you should be aware of, before watching this. And I don't mean that I will go into details of characters and their fates, but how am I going to write about this, if I am not saying what happened in the end of the first movie? Forget I asked, because there are obviously ways to do so, but I prefer not to.Now having going to lengths to make clear, what this will be about and from what standpoint I am writing, we delve into the story where the first one left us off. Another character is gone and replaced that did survive the first movie (and the issues behind the scenes that occured with Marcus Chong - feel free to google and see what happened there) ... and while the first movie was quite contained, this expands on so many levels. Which obviously has to do with way more money that was being given to the Wachowskis. Since I am writing this in 2021 (barely), I am aware that the formerly brothers are now sisters. Let's call them siblings just in case.Their vision and their taste for blockbuster movies never really changed. Philosophical to a point but really campy too. And quite a few soap opera elements mixed for good measure. Giving characters backstories is good - how they put them on screen ... well there is more than room for discussion on that one.While the first one revolitionized movies with the bullet time ... this has nothing similar to offer. That doesn't mean that the movie doesn't look good. Quite the opposite is the case! The movie looks amazing. In 4k after almost 20 years ... the CGI may have aged, but nothing that bothered me too much.What did bother me when I first watched it way back then ... was the party scene in Zion. Very early on and not really adding anything to the story, this was meant to show off ... well I reckon humanity. And what became of it ... and how they live or try to survive the madness. The scene itself feels like a commercial. It doesn't look bad - not at all, but it feels wrong on so many levels. Even with the speech that Morpheus is giving ... it can't be saved.What also can't be saved is a conversation Neo is having during that party (or was it after it? I just watched it and I forgot ... not that it matters ... although it should considering the ""weight"" of the dialog ... the delivery is quite wooden). Add to that one of the most akward sex scenes ever put to film ... and you may wonder again what the relationship between Neo and Trinity exactly is.And that was just the beginning. There is a lot of philosophical innuendo .. there is a lot of stuff that you can write essays about ... but there a lot of things that you probably will take issue with when you first watch the movie. While it seems like Hugo Weaving is gone as a central villain (and what a performance that was), they seem to have found a loophole to sort of bring him back. Again inner logic and all that. Still the impact is almost lost a bit, especially considering the numbers game ... which also brings us to the agents who seem put in a lesser role here.Do not try to overthink it, so many issues with inner logic, be it ""tests"" to see if Neo is actually Neo through fighting (yes we need an explanation now to see him fight) or new characters and new background for characters we have seen in the first movie (the Oracle, who had to be recasted because the original actress dies unfortunately ... they handled that well story and logic wise, but maybe you feel differently). ... the action is amazing as it was in the first movie and maybe it is the saving grace. With some very interesting action set pieces ... and some interesting actors thrown in for good measure.No one should expec this to match the fist Matrix ... and if you go in with an open mindset, you may actually have quite a lot of fun with this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie ROCKED!!!,"I really don't see where the dislike for this movie is coming from. It was great! I really think that people didn't understand it and rather than admit that they are slamming the movie. Its really annoying to hear people compare this movie with X2 or T3 when they aren't even on the same level. yes, I am sure they are enjoyable movies, but certainly they don't have the depth that Reloaded has. I actually heard someone say of Reloaded ""i hated having to think about it - when I go to a movie I don't want to think"". So, if you want a movie with simple plot themes and that require no thought process Reloaded is definitely NOT the movie for you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The re-watch opened my eyes,"With great disappointment have I read the poor reviews of the latest Matrix installment (part 4). I did remember how I really disliked part 3. Too much fancy dialogue that really had no substance. Just pseudo-philosophical nonsense. So when Reloaded popped up on Netflix, I had to check it out.Oh boy. These dialogues are painful to listen to. When I watched it back in the day, I was still impressed. Now that I am a little older, a little wiser? It sounds so clever and so spiritual, but quite frankly, that is just a pretty dress to hide the fact, that the story got weird and no one offers a real explanation. Maybe the writers were a little too much in love with their material? The success of the ever so great Matrix (part I) made them think that anything is possible? Well, everything is not possible.I am now 40 years old. Monica Bellucci kissing Neo or everybody wearing these cool shades (in the underground, in the dark), well, that doesn't compensate for the fact, that the plot doesn't really make sense.The Matrix part one was amazing. It will forever be in my top ten. All the rest? Basically just a lot of artists' ego put on film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Do stop fighting!,"I'm probably in a very small minority here, but i thought this film was better when they weren't all scrapping or blowing stuff up! Obviously, these scenes were important to the story, but i couldn't help feeling they went on a bit too much. After all, watching a thousand identical characters get kicked all over the place for five minutes can wear a little thin! Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are outstanding, and i suppose it's like criticizing 'Airplane' for having too many jokes; but the complexity and intricacy of the plot was what really stood out as the film's strong-point as it explored the nature of the matrix itself.Reloaded develops the Matrix story into far-reaching directions only hinted at in the first film, and most importantly credits the viewer with a great deal of intelligence, something that the majority of mainstream movies neglect to do. The development of the plot is both swift and measured, meaning you have to think hard when not having your eyes burned out by the bullet-fast action scenes.

"Interesting progression, visually pleasing, action too much like a video game.","The story was still pretty interesting, and builds on what happened in the first film, and not merely repeating instances of it. I have read reviews that talk about so many religious meanings to this film, but I have not read anywhere that it is actually based on any philosophical/biblical myths. I guess that is open to interpretation as the Wachowski duo excluded themselves from interviews and talking of the films, leaving the films to speak for itself.The action was all very well done again but at the same time felt pretty prolonged. For example Neo fights Agent Smith and the fight goes on and on and on. I really do not think it needed to be that long. Plus it was very video game like and that showed in the animation sequences of the action. The visual effects help it a lot as the whole film has this kind of virtual look and thus the animation stuff does not look so obvious.I am giving this film a pretty moderate rate, as I did not like some of the elements incorporated into this, especially that of the white patriarchal society. Basically, once you learn about how to see the underlying ideology in film, it is hard to find a film that does not conform to this ideology. Here are just some factors: A white man with all the power saves them, the female is asked to step out, the female needs saving, at the head of all this is a white man and so on. It is good that they have a lot of other ethnicities included in the film but their roles are very stereotypical; the Hispanic is a fortune teller, the Chinese are fighters or the brains and ultimately the white men are always the ones in charge.So as much as this film is enjoyable, and this series very intriguing, it has fallen from its initial attraction for me.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What is the point?,"Like other reviewers, I had high hopes for this after loving the original 'Matrix' so much. But alas, this is just unbearable. I am writing this review having only watched half the film, as I really have no idea what's going on - and what's worse, I don't care. This sequel lends nothing to the original: it doesn't pick up where the first one left off, and far from giving us the intrigue and action of the first, it relies on drawn out (confusing) plots, special effects and secondary characters that don't really matter.

"Reloaded, but this time the shot only clips the target","Neo flies. Trinity dies. Morpheus cries (almost). These are just three of the many scenes of The Wachowski Brothers' ""The Matrix Reloaded"", one of the most anticipated sequels of the last decade.The film begins with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves. Neo is plagued by nightmares involving the death of lover Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss). He believes he is seeing the near future. After a few neat CGI-filled scenes that show that to us, we find Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) (the latter of whom is being ridiculed by some fellow humans for belief in ""The Prophecy"") on their way home to Zion. There they learn that the amount of sentinels has increased greatly. The war is coming, or so we are told.Morpheus meets with his rival, stern Commander Lock (Harry Lennix). The two are constant competitors after Lock stole Morpheus' love, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). They fight about what to do, what's coming, and what to believe.So do we. With ""Reloaded"", what began as a single successful film becomes an updated ""Star Wars""-esquire trilogy, with a seemingly unbeatable first film, a middle piece, and a battle-filled climax. Many watchers will be put off from this film's lack of progression storywise, but that's meant to be. It's the centerpiece for the story, and it's unfortunately quite hard to do much with the centerpiece (""The Empire Strikes Back"" still wows me).What Andy and Larry have done is left open our questions from the first film. Oh yeah, they added some new ones too. And I get the feeling ""Revolutions"" doesn't clear them up either. Ugh.""Reloaded"" is every bit as entertaining as the original film, if not a little more confusing at times. There's enough action and excitement to keep anyone in their seats - especially the scene around the end of the picture, in which Morpheus and Trinity struggle to keep the Keymaker out of reach of The Twins and/or the Agents. And, all of this occurs on what's got to be the most realistically vicious freeway I've ever seen.One thing that I deemed unnecessary was the amount of sexuality. There was a fair amount of sexuality (including nudity) and too much sappiness throughout the film. Carrie Anne-Moss and Keanu Reeves making out? I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of a good time. Generally, things like this occur when the previously careful directors become more comfortable and popular ... which isn't always a bad thing.The CGI animation is spectacular. There's a slight drop in martial arts action from the first film, but the action sequences here are really fun. Of course, they're accompanied by another great punk/metal/rock soundtrack and a fast-paced score from Don Davis.One last note: Neo flies. Yep, he flies. As one of the Nebachudnezzar's crew puts it, ""Uh-oh - he's doin' the Superman thing again."" This happens about three times throughout the film, and while it does have a sort of cheesy and annoying feeling to it, I can't help myself but to find it fun. And funny.Overall, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" comes nowhere near being as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun time at the movies, and definitely a recommended watch.

One complaint I've seen in many reviews is that it's like sitting through a master's seminar in parts. I agree, except I don't see it as a flaw. The story and thought are revealed in a mix of western discussion as well as eastern teaching through metaphor.The action is very well done with a high quality than anything that has been seen yet. It continues in the sci-fu tradion of the first Matrix. The style of martial arts is solid chinese (with a Japanese katana to boot). Many of the the fight scene concepts are new (100 Smiths, the spectres, etc) from the first movie.As the summary suggests, this movie is not for people who are looking for another Terminator.

"It doesn't matter which pill you take ,The truth is already out there","The Matrix Trilogy will remain one of the most argument's raiser between critics ,movie geeks ,mainstream Audience,the loyal fans and the matrix's philosophy believers ,Every group pf those has what it love and what it hates ,With exchanging opinions and theories ,But above all that we have to confess that the Matrix movies in general is among the most important movies created in the history of cinema ,I will discuss my reasons later in this review .The first movie ended in Neo(Keanu Reeves) defeating the agents and causing temporary failure in the Matrix (That's my analysis) ,The Matrix Reloaded picks up the events in recent point to the previous events ,Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss)now are officially lovers ,Along with Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) they are teaming back ,They are waiting for the Oracle's prophecy to be fulfilled ,While Neo is having a repeating dreams where he sees Trinity is fighting in the Air with one of the agents and gets hit in her chest with lethal bullet and here the dream ends ,He seems concerned about his dreams and actually fearing them ,Obviously because he knows that he is The One so this can not be a normal dream ,It can be simply another prophecy waiting to take place sooner or later ,On the other hand we get to now that the machines decided to launch the ultimate war against the remaining humans in the last human city (Zion) ,The Sentinels are digging their way to Zion and there is only 72 hours left till they reach the walls of Zion ,Neo goes to see the Oracle who tells him to find the Keymaker who has access to the Mainframe of The Matrix system ,But the problem is that the Keymaker is being held by a the mysterious Merovingian(Lambert Wilson) ,The group go and meet him ,He seems in full knowledge of their purpose and simply refuses to let them have the Keymaker ,But Neo pays the Merovingian's Wife(The Ultra Beautiful Monica Bellucci) in a very special currency and she offers her help in return to let them find the Keymaker ,And the story goes from here.Actually the problem with The Matrix in general that it's Huge multi layered world ,Actually a unique world created completely with details of it's own ,To make full understanding of this world you need several things ,One of them is the analytical ability to tie all the different keys and events together to form some vision about what's really happening ,But your primal vision may be blurring at the beginning ,That's due to a very important fact is that you simply can not view each one of the three movies like individual segments ,They are completely integral and viewing them as one unit is necessary to get the full picture ,Another thing which actually is somewhat strange is that you have to have some background of Computer Sciences in general to make assumption for yourself and to understand completely the other assumptions introduced by it's creators (Especially in RELOADED) ,Another problem is the deep philosophy which wasn't suitable for all the viewer's especially among the Mainstream Audience ,But it actually depends on your willing to believe or at least to give yourself the chance to make a deep thinking about the ideas which the movie discuses ,But it also was confusing for the most heavy minded viewers ,Thus needed to wait till the third installment arrives .On the technical side RELOADED is simply a marvelous achievement in the Cinema's History ,I am not giving overhype or something ,But I am giving this statement based on close inspection and multiple watchings ,The Special Effects were amazing ,Many people complained that there is nothing new after the bullet time which was introduced in the first film ,But this is not right because simply the Bullet Time was not only a technique ,It was an INVENTION and inventions doesn't happen all the time ,What the Wachowskis done is improving it and it really were tweaked in RELOADED but some viewers didn't get rid off the feeling that they have seen the Bullet Time many many times before ,But this has nothing to do with the Wachowskis ,They have invented it and many entertainment forms ripped it from them ,Ranging from another movies to piles of Video Clip Songs!! ,Actually the fight scene where we watch neo fighting swarms of Agent Smiths really proves that there are no limits for what they can do ,The other scene is the Car chase scene which leaves you breathless during it's running time ,I haven't filled that there were overusing of the special effects at all ,You know they are in the Matrix world where no earthly rules are governing the characters ,And so the amazing fights were necessary to symbolize that ,The other elements like editing and musical score passed the test efficiently ,Another superior elements are the Decoration,Design and costume ,Put in the right places to support the feeling of the old comics as a reflection of the overall atmosphere of unreality surroundings their existence .The wachowskis hits hard and solid this time ,With very generous budget from the producers they had a plenty of time and space to introduce what they want to say ,At some points of the movie you wonder about them ,And how brilliant they are forming their ideas ,Their vision is marked for having no borders ,You are in some point in the movie and making anticipations or guessing about the forthcoming events ,they surprises you with ultimately different things ,And keeps doing this till you give up and stop making pre assumptions ,And this leads us to discuss some aspects about The Matrix's World and the impact it have done on the cinema's Audience ,The problems that many complained about actually are several problems ,One of them is the Zion's people and their appearances but we have to be frank ,The movie is about a world where the machines is controlling it and only one place is left for al the surviving humans so what do you expect from them? do you expect them to be clean and shaven and wears the latest fashion models?! ,About the mass sex scene I think it was designed beautifully ,Just look where Neo And Trinity were making it and you will notice that the place is designed  in a Womb like shape ,It gives a reference for the creation of the humanity and the mass sex itself  can be explained as human touch in a world threatened to be void of humans within few hours ,It has been known that human beings in times of danger tends naturally to seek the warmth of other humans companion and this takes the form of the sexual festival we've seen ,The techno musical score accompanying it reflects the artificial nature of their surroundings ,For these reasons I always thought about the whole scene as effective and necessary in the development process of RELOADED.Other people simply complained that the movie become very complicated ,That's may be right for the most of Mainstream Audience ,The whole trilogy needs an open min willing to give a deep thinking sessions in order to get the message ,And personally I think that many people of whom didn't like this movie were simply because they haven't understood it or simply thought about it as nonsense due to the large and heavy dose of philosophical battles ,Another people hated RELOADED because they had solid grounds based on the first Matrix movie ,Actually one Reloaded Excellency points came from taking the story in a whole new level and so it destroyed all of our beliefs granted from the first Matrix movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Wachowskis Go Off Their Rocker,"In the summer of '99 the Wachowski Brothers' sci-fi thriller The Matrix was the cool, sleek, sexy antidote to the dopey dinosaurism of George Lucas' Phantom Menace. Now the Wachowskis themselves have become George Lucas. The Matrix Reloaded, the further adventures of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, is the Wachowskis laying claim to Lucas' throne by abandoning the hip, funny flair they showed in the first Matrix in favor of quasi-mythic hot-air. The film is three action scenes surrounded by some of the most show-killing, ear-abusing dialogue passages in the history of movies. When did the Wachowskis come to the conclusion that what summer movie audiences wanted was cliff-notes Camus? Did they think that by repeating the word ""causality"" over and over they could trick us into seeing their mumbo-jumbo about fate vs. free-will as anything but Philosophy 101 jive? This is what happens when hacks start taking themselves seriously. We sit down expecting kung-fu fights, cyber-rebel attitudes, iconic images of Laurence Fishburne in a black raincoat and Carrie-Anne Moss in a cat-woman outfit, but what do we get instead? A bad French actor rambling on for hours like Sartre if Sartre had had the IQ of a toenail clipping.This is too bad, because one wants to enjoy the movie. Keanu Reeves is an actor who, despite his inadequacies, has the kind of good-humored, dogged way about him that melts cynicism, except you'd never know it by his joyless, immobile performance here. In Reloaded his character, Neo, has advanced beyond Jedi-apprentice status to full-Jedi, and like Luke Skywalker, power has made Neo a bore. He flies through the sprawling Matrix-city like Superman as dressed by Gaultier; he has portentous dreams about his lover Trinity dying; he fights a thousand Hugo Weavings without once losing his shades. This should be a hoot but isn't. Even during the epic battle with the army of Smith-clones, a slapstick CGI bonanza, the film seems labored and over-serious. The Wachowskis seem to be feeling the pressure of expectations. They want to elevate their story to Dune/Lord of the Rings status, to out-Lucas Lucas, and in doing so totally eliminate the semi-comic, subversive undertones that made the first Matrix amusing. They've become stiffs. The images of Reeves, Fishburne and Moss looking dour and pale - futuristic warriors as ticked-off photophobes - are no longer funny, they're just big and dead, and the whole plot about the fate of Zion and rescuing the keymaster (maybe they should've called Pete Venkman and Egon Spengler in on that one) seems like an act of desperation.The Wachowskis still know how to orchestrate an action scene, but it's a measure of their failure as storytellers that you think of the action in terms of orchestration instead of just enjoying the thrills. The film provides oodles of material for connoisseurs of wire-work, CGI and slow-mo car-crashes; unfortunately it also satisfies those who relish bad dialogue and listless acting. The single-worst scene must be Fishburne's Paul Atreides speech in front of the assembled population of Zion and the subsequent orgy. The Wachowskis are grabbing for respect here from the kind of people who think fiction starts with Tolkein and ends with Herbert. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films must've intimidated the Wachowskis; they must have thought they had to go for more of an epic and leave behind the rebel-hacker material that supplied the heart of the first Matrix. The sort of silly, pseudo-profound idea that can lend a bit of weight to a sci-fi story has become the purpose of The Matrix Reloaded; the Wachowskis have turned themselves into preachers of some kind of clueless gospel. And only a couple of world-class twerps would make us sit through such a tedious lecture of a movie only to stick us with a cliffhanger. To be continued? Who cares?",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"could have been better, could have been worse","personally the direction i would like to have seen the matrix go in is the direction hinted at towards the end of total recall. simply put deeper levels of uncertainty. in the first matrix neo is told that if what he considers reality is simply what his senses tell him then he is believing nothing but electrical signals. but as soon as he takes the new world he has emerged into as being more real than the last then he is simply depending on the same senses that betrayed him to begin with. simply put he is making the same mistake over again. the direction i would like to have seen the movie go in would have been neo finding out that the sewery subterranean life is but an illusion also. a second level of the matrix so free of joy that it should serve as a warning not to dig any deeper.instead i got car chases and explosions. so what. the movie still does a decent job of making itself interesting to watch visually. gotta love the exploding space orgasm cake, and i really was intrigued by the initial Buddha code appearance of seraph (another theme i thought could have been explored better) and the final visual of the architect was rather intriguing but simply tossed away never to be re-examined. the whole movie is filled with promise that is never payed back.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Matrix - warp speed version,"Greetings again from the darkness.  The Wachowski brothers understand what made The Matrix a hit, so they went to their lab and delivered a reved-up version that tries desperately to be a drama in addition to an action/special effects movie.  Too bad the story is so weak.  However, fans will probably not be disappointed by the action sequences.  Keanu Reeves and the brilliant Hugo Weaving face-off in some virtual gang rumble that is so fast it is difficult to keep up with your eyes.  Thought Weaving (Agent Smith) was one of the best things about the first movie - but he suffers from overexposure in the sequel.  Lawrence Fishbourne and Carrie-Anne Moss are perfect in recapturing their characters.  MANY MANY new characters are introduced.  Actually too many.  Jada Pinkett Smith has a nice turn in a role that could have been developed.  The stunning Monica Bellucci (Tears of the Sun) provides some eye candy, even boxer Roy Jones, jr has a brief role. Best surprise was seeing Anthony Zerbe, a TV staple in the 60's and 70's, who is just not seen much these days.

Not as good as the original but still a worthwhile movie,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the second film in the Matrix trilogy. Here, a war to end all wars looms between man & machine. The fate of the human race is in Neo's hands but first he's got to determine exactly what's expected of The One.It seems that the Wachowski brothers took a ""Star Wars"" approach to their trilogy. By that I mean that this middle film is basically a cliff-hanger that sets the stage for the final showdown.Most of the principal actors are back and there are a few new faces as well. The acting is generally on par with the previous film; in other words, not outstanding but solid and above average for an action flick.The action itself, though, is strangely not as satisfying as in the ""The Matrix"". This is puzzling because it cannot be denied that the effects are even more polished than in the original film. I suppose that the novelty had worn off somewhat but I also think that some of the action set-pieces seem arbitrary and tacked on. It also doesn't help that, unlike in the first film, the 'good guys' seem to be practically invincible. Where there's no danger, there's no excitement.Another drawback for this film is that the further exploration of the inner workings of the Matrix gets tiring after a while. But that may be just me, since I have a dislike for science fiction that emphasizes science at the expense of fiction.Nevertheless, the Wachowski's deliver the goods once again in the visual department. The direction is solid throughout and the effects are even slicker than in the first film. The music, including the score by Don Davis, has much of the same flavor as the original.In the end, the film failed to live up to the expectations of fans and I count myself among them. It's not necessarily a bad film but it isn't likely to make you rush out and see the concluding film, even with the cliff-hanger ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Freeway scene, 100 Smiths, etc.  Simply the BEST!  #2)  BEST CGI - Could NEVER have been better.  I DARE other film makers to beat The Matrix and Reloaded's sophisticated Action and CGI.  Awesome display and Simply UNBEATABLE!  The best the other lowly producers can do is COPYCAT.  #3) FABULOUS ACTING - Hugo Weaving, don't need to write much about him, the World knows he's the best film villain of all time.  Keanu's acting getting better and better, the beautiful Carrie-Ann, Fishburne, etc.  The Best.  #4) PHILOSOPHY - Logic, Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Christianity, it's all there, pay attention, look it up.  You'll learn a few things.  #5) FASHION SENSE - Heroes and Villains could NEVER have looked more Cool than what we have seen in the Matrix Trilogy.  NEVER.  Neo made Superguy look like a Fag.  The women were SEXY too!  This movie was flat-out SEXY.  #6) LOVE - We ALL know Love Conquers All.  Enough said.  #7) SOUND and MUSIC - Another Oscar for the talented sound effects editors.  Awesome groups in the Soundtrack. #8) BEST DIRECTING - Wachowski bros.  Enough said.  And Last (for now).  #9) CONCEPT - NO ONE, and I mean NOBODY in this Universe will EVER take away The Matrix CONCEPT.  And NO, I NEVER want to hear about Dim-Witted films that share an inkling of the same Matrix Concept.  The World checked up on those films.  Charlie's Skanky Angels is on top of the COPYCAT list.  The Matrix did it FIRST, did it BIGGER and did it ALOT BETTER.  I can understand the Wachowskis' IRRITATION.  Job WELL DONE in Reloaded.  No other film will EVER Top it.  Congrats again to the W-bros. for Originality.  I can go on and on, blah, blah, blah, but I'll stop here for now.  Enough can Never be said.I'll say this again and again.  NEO (Our New Hero) has made Supergay, well...look pretty and Gay.  He ain't in No Faggety tight blue suit.  Neo Sky-Rockets with shades, now THAT'S how you fly!!  It's ALL about the Black Trench and Shades baby!!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's.Super Who?? NO! It's NEO!!  The World's New and Improved Action Super Hero.Reloaded - HUGE 10 out of 10 Stars. And that was only HALF of it!  The BEST has yet to come.  REVOLUTIONS in November.  Shades baby!The Matrix has you...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Misguided focus,"The Matrix Reloaded is its own worst enemy. The film evokes divisive opinions about its quality because, in some ways, it is good, and in other ways, it is terrible. The special effects exemplify this by mixing impressive practical stunts with off-putting CGI. Meanwhile, the overall filmmaking is above-average but, unfortunately, in service of a subpar script. The cinematography is engaged and lightly artistic, the sound is immersive and stylish, and the production design is elaborate and detailed. The cast is strong and the music is memorable. Still, Reloaded misses many viewers because its writing is plagued with issues.First, Reloaded is boring. Much of its time is spent on long-winded conversations that say very little. The story fancies itself philosophical, but fails because it isn't as deep as it hopes. Themes of choice and control are beaten to death, all centering around Neo's love for Trinity. However, because such emphasis is placed on this relationship, its shallowness is exposed. Their romance worked as a cherry on top of the original, but needed fleshing out to carry Reloaded. Thus, we have a dull plot centered around a dull relationship. Ultimately, Reloaded's focus is misguided and dampens its solid craftsmanship.Writing: 3/10

Style Over Substance,"Well, I know this flies in the face of all previous comments... but here it goes.It's 1:00am and I just got back from Wednesday's 10:00pm premiere of The Matrix: Reloaded.  Contrary to my normal routine of going into a theater prepared to be underwhelmed, I actually had high hopes for this one as I very much liked the original and was impressed with the trailer.  Was I ever in for a surprise.The Wachowski brothers took the road too well traveled by following up an original, atmospheric and stylish movie with a sequel that takes numerous over-choreographed and over-stylized action sequences and wraps them around a thin thread of story line laced with mediocre dialog and uninspired acting.  I found myself unable to care about the characters or their plight and instead just wished for it all to end.  Two hours and eighteen minutes later, my wish was granted.If your idea of a great night out is partaking in a smorgasbord of over-the-top action and competent if unoriginal computer generated effects, then by all means indulge.  Otherwise, wait for the DVD and rent it.  That way, you're less likely to feel as though you've wasted your money. ... but that's just my opinion.  Anyone else?",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not a classic like the first, but still good","I tried watching this about a decade ago and for some reason couldn't really get into it, and stopped watching after 20 minutes or something. I don't remember why, especially because watching it for the first time tonight, I enjoyed it quite a lot. I'm admittedly curious to see what Resurrections is all about, but figure I need to work my way through Reloaded and Revolutions first.I think the one area where this exceeds the original might be the action. The powers Neo has at the end of the first are put to good use here, and make for some really crazy and entertaining action sequences. Some of the cgi is inconsistent, although it more often than not works, and the hand-to-hand stuff is truly great. There are some legitimately great martial arts set pieces, and even if the fight with 100 Smiths is silly for some, at least it's impressive, well thought out, and at the very least unique.I was mixed on the attempts to expand the world of the film. I think that may have been a turn-off when I tried to watch it a decade ago? It's still better than the alternative option for a sequel, which is just rehashing the original, so the effort to do that kind of word-building (even if it inflates the runtime) is still appreciated.Agent Smith fit into this one less than seamlessly, but his action scenes were fun, and we'll see where he goes in the third instalment. I also thought Laurence Fishburne was under-utilised at first, but then they give him a samurai sword and I was forced to eat my words.Overall, I don't like it as much as the first, but it was pretty damn good, and I look forward to watching the rest of the series soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A sequel we've been waiting for.,"Another great movie by the Wachowskis. After waiting four years the sequel is finally there (even two in the same year) and it's certainly not disappointing. The element of surprise isn't there this time but still it's a powerful Sci-Fi movie that makes you think about the scientifical progress we constantly make. The same cast as in the first Matrix and still a great job from all of them. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss just look stunning in their costumes. No Oscars for this one this time even though visually it was all great again. Again it's not an easy movie to understand but it's still great. H. R. Giger's influence is still there, biomechanical surroundings brings the decor to another level. I rewatched the three movies before watching the fourth new release from this year. It's necessary though, if you really want to enjoy the movies in the best way possible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very enjoyable installment,"Obviously not as good as the first one but had all the charms of it and still a high-star movie personally for me. Thoroughly enjoyed it throughout and had zero to no complaints (Except for the confusing plot but that's whatever that is). Awesome sequel. This was definitely filled with nice delicious action/fight scenes, especially every time Neo and Agent Smith fight.As usual, Matrix Reloaded introduces us to the same characters from the last installment, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus and the confusing plot follows those 3 on their ""Adventures"" if we can call it that. I will never understand how some people can hate on this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More FX than plot.,"When I sit at my computer, I am always, and I do mean always, troubled by errors. Illegal operations, General Protection Faults and so on. So it is obviously difficult for me to believe the premise behind the Matrix movies. Humanity is plugged into a giant computer simulation of reality. We know, of course, from experience that such a thing is impossible; it would be crashing every five seconds, just like our computers now do. The Matrix Reloaded actually addresses this issue, and raises the prospect that certain elements of the Matrix are, indeed, malfunctioning. Certain programs run amok, and they are doing so in, it seems, vast numbers. One of these is the former Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is now independent and seems to have the ability to duplicate himself. This leads to a ludicrous, but spectacular, sequence in which Neo (Keanu Reeves), that now quasi-messianic beacon of hope for humanity, is fighting hundreds, if not thousands, of Hugo Weavings (as if one were not sufficient). That is the problem with The Matrix Reloaded: the spectacular ludicrousness. Much of the movie makes little sense; there is one sequence in which Neo talks to the designer of the Matrix, the 'Architect' who speaks not one word of normal English throughout the conversation. There are more fights and action sequences than there were last time; indeed Neo, his 'boss' Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) and girlfriend Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) seem to spend almost their entire screen time beating people up, shooting them or being chased by Agents. There is a car chase that looks like it was filmed in Sydney that is one of the best I have seen in a long time, which ends up with Morpheus having a fisticuff battle with an Agent on top of a moving truck. Neo's 'supernatural' qualities - being the grand saviour of the human race - are played up to their breaking point in this film, and it gets a little tiring after a while. But if you stay away from that, and concentrate on spectacular action sequence after spectacular action sequence, the film holds up well. There are some unnecessary scenes, such as a 'rave party' of sorts intercut with a lurve scene between Reeves and Moss, and a rather incomprehensible scene with a French restaurateur who is really a sentient computer program and his wife, whose actions and purpose are never adequately explored. The Matrix Reloaded is part one of two, with Matrix Revolutions to start showing later this year. I certainly want to see that film, if only because of the rather climactic cliffhanger at the end of this one, but I'm not certain making two films with the one continuing storyline is a good idea. It might have been a better product all round if it had been one film, with one plot and less guff. Still, if you're looking for an action-packed film that looks fantastic, The Matrix Reloaded does nicely. Concentrate on the action and forget the plot; it'll work out much better.

entertaining flick,"i think this movie really is exciting, its not boring, the story is really interesting. Yes we've seen similar storylines, but especially with the animatrix, the directors, and the storytellers have pulled off something really special. Can't wait till revolutions. Also, i was wondering if anyone picked up that in the first installment, when Neo is in the station being interegated by Smith, just as the scene starts, there appears to be several screens. Just curious, if anyone knows if the brothers intended to imply that the ""Architect"" was viewing Neo in that specific scene. Does that make sense. Who cares, just curious!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Woah.,"I went and saw this movie once opening weekend, then again in IMAX.  All I can say is that it was so much better the 2nd time.  In IMAX you could feel the theater shake every time somebody got kicked in the head and you felt like you were right in the action.  Also, I understood more of what the architect was saying.  You get to catch the little hints and it all starts to piece together.  If you saw it once and weren't so sure, give it another try, or you could rent the animatrix.  Watching the Final Flight of the Osiris and Kid's Story helped so much.  I know I'll be the 1st in line when Revolutions comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Not nearly as good as the first,I was quite disappointed as far as story line goes.  Some parts were a little hard to understand and there was a lot that could have been cut out. The movie didn't need to be 2 hours and 45 minutes long.  The effects were great but the love story between Neo and Trinity went a little too far.  I felt that they should have stayed with the main plot the whole time.,,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This did have a lot to live up to,"This is based on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. This one suffers from several things, noticeably. The first shares traits with the original Star Wars... the main one in this comparison being that they were both the beginning of a trilogy, whilst being fully able to be taken as the entire story. Lucas managed to complete his series of three to the satisfaction of viewers... in part because all had been set up in the initial movie, things didn't get too much more complex and difficult to understand with the following two(don't get me wrong, I find Episodes IV and V to be excellent). The Wachowski brothers did not. This adds layers and facets that the one before it did not... quite possibly simply because it was already so packed, and it still pulled that off. Thus, the attempt here is to successfully integrate these new aspects, as well as top that one. And this entire epic tale was to be closed in less than four and a half combined hours. There was not enough time and the high expectations may not exactly have helped. Where the philosophy was smooth and neither stuck out nor came off as pretentious when this franchise began, it sadly moves in the wrong direction here. Similarly, the dialog just does not reach the same level, and there are downright poor lines herein. Some of the humor does work, other bits come off as being silly. The pacing is not spot-on, but uneven. The plot is good, and develops reasonably. The acting still tends to be in the positive end of the spectrum. The action is still mind-blowing, and it does expand the scope... I do not believe there has ever been anything like the freeway scene before, or that thus far, a similar one has been done. The cinematography is still stunning, and the inspiration and mix still astound. There are memorable sequences, and the choreography and execution for martial arts and shootouts alike are excellent. The music and sound are amazing. Editing is sharp. The effects are incredible. The new cast-members aren't bad at all. To anyone wondering... no, you do not ""need"" to watch The Animatrix, nor play Enter the Matrix. Yes, they tell you more, but one can appreciate and ""get"" all the films without those. What they do is put things in perspective and give more details on certain events and characters, nothing that is required. The ideas and food for thought of this are interesting, it is the presentation that is bothersome. There is moderately strong language, in relatively mild amounts. There is next to no nudity, but sexuality is present once, and very obviously hinted at, as well. This comes with a text introduction(the same one as on the others), by the writer-directors, to the commentary tracks: One with philosophers who enjoyed these, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who didn't care for them, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. They are worth listening to. The double DVD holds well-done featurettes. I recommend this to fans of the concept and/or science fiction. Just be aware that this isn't as great. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Going On The Freeway Is Suicide""","Although the much loved and touted ""freeway scene"" is almost as good, and certainly not better, than the ""freeway scene"" in Terminator 2 (1993) ten years earlier, it is near suicide, but will put you on life support, for a sequel to have such a standard action vehicle turn as your centerpiece.The premise of the first film was so original and fresh that one wonders how it could run out of creative juice by the middle of the second movie. Was that it? The introduction of a mostly talked about Zion was the best new thing they could do.There is a lot of nifty action, but, then again, in such an ambitious and mega-budgeted sequel, the innovation of multiple Smiths is not used once, but twice. The low battery light is flashing in this one and as everyone will find out, there will be no ""phone exit"" to get you recharged in the final film of the trilogy.

Enter the Dragon rewritten by anally retentive computer nerds.,"*This is a follow up to the original Matrix and therefore anything to be said here could be seen a spoiler to the original.*I have learned so many things watching movie and then writing about them. Here is just a selection: That a bit of cheap music can instantly create a bit of tension or take me back in time. That big subjects don't necessarily make for big movies (nor the other way round). That I don't like people trying to disguise cliché (including that tried and trusted good-versus-bad theme) by trying to wrap it up in so much wordy and visual nonsense.(Guess which one of those faults the Matrix Reloaded falls in to?!)Entertaining or not, the film makes little to no overall sense. However there are bits of plot I think I understand: It is set in two versions of the world, one the world of dreams (or close variations) and another in the ""real world.""The ""real world"" is just a mine shaft in the ground where a group of escaped prisoners play revolutionaries against the computer - The Matrix - that entraps them. In other words a lot of what we see is a video-game played out in a giant computer - but you can actually ""die"" in this video game through the film's own convenient b/s logic.Yes the script is pure garbage, in that no can really understand what is going on and this - or so the authors hope and presume - will prevent anyone from questioning it. After all you can't question what you don't understand, right? This movie has a logic all of its own and often the reverse of any known human version. Why stand and fight when you can flee through flight? Trapping humans in order create electricity, huh? First Spielberg with his ""futuristic"" three wheeler cars and now this!Is this not the central paradox of sci-fi: People that are smart beyond are wildest dreams judged by what they create and are also incredibly stupid judged by what they say and do?(The Wachowski Brothers don't do interviews so no one can question them about this b/s world of their own invention. I suppose the praise they receive is the praise that many people who build castles in the air receive: Stolen from people that do great work in the real world and who are far smarter. There is a million miles between thinking up ""a car that runs on tap water"" and actually creating a real one!)The look is quite interesting and the fact that so many people were dark glasses gives us the feeling that no one is quite human. Even when they are. Or sort of. Black people seem to have a large role to play and that is indeed curious - but like a lot of what goes on here, I have no idea what it means. Maybe they are the ""blacks with no soul"" that were mentioned in Kentucky Fried Movie. People that turn this handicap to their advantage by playing MOR at weddings!The worst bit is the computer operator (Link) who gives a running commentary on proceedings like he is on a speedway track. Having seen people being captured (Superman like) from certain death with my own eyes it is good that this is confirmed verbally. Second worst bit is the creator of the Matrix (well he claims he is - he is a white bearded theatrical lovey so he must have!) who spouts even more riddles than your old maths teacher.Bruce Lee (most famous for Enter the Dragon which this apes), with only his body and the occasional numchucka created tension, speed and excitement that they can only top by millions of dollars worth of computer special effects and fly-by-wire. No let me take that back: Bruce you were still better than all of them, even with their special effects and wire work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The movie is a cinematic gem that blends action , humor, heart , and breathtaking visuals","""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a stunning continuation of the groundbreaking saga that redefined sci-fi cinema. Directed by the Wachowskis, the film expands the universe of the original with exhilarating action sequences, philosophical depth, and stunning visuals. Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, grappling with his role as ""The One"" while exploring themes of free will and destiny. The choreography of the fight scenes is nothing short of breathtaking, particularly the highway chase, which is a visual masterpiece. The narrative deepens the lore, introducing compelling new characters like the enigmatic Merovingian.

Very inconsistent but worth watching,"The Matrix wasn't one of my favourites, I think it's good but it isn't amazing as some people think. The Matrix Reloaded made me appreciate the Matrix a little bit more however, as it seems to be a bit unfocused when compared to the first film which seemed to be well written and well made.Reloaded is inconsistent and it seemed a bit rushed and a bit of a mess when I saw it. Zion, which was talked about a lot in the first film, is now seen for the first time, but it's here where I was getting worried about this film already. Sequels often fail when they're just a carbon copy of the original, so I didn't mind the change in setting at the beginning of this film and all these new characters being introduced, but it just wasn't gripping and was very slow moving.Eventually the film speeds up and there's some awesome action. Like the first film Reloaded is often visually stunning, and it's the weird and wonderful exiles that are the highlights. From the moment Neo encounters the Merovingian, a very intriguing character, I was anticipating what was going to happen next and the film seemed to get better and better, leading up to the meeting with the Architect. This middle section is overall very good and great to watch.The main problem with Reloaded is that scenes just go on far too long much of the time. For example, when the Oracle is first reintroduced, this is a great scene at first, Gloria Foster's all-knowing mother figure, who was very interesting in the first film, returning again. But a few minutes later, and I'm getting bored, there's only so much philosophical discussion about Neo's choices that I can take. When this conversation finally ends, we move straight onto the Burly Brawl, the brilliant and visually stunning fight between Neo and the masses of Agent Smiths. That is, until it's gone on for far too long and bored me to tears. This section then, with the Oracle and The Burly Brawl, could have been shortened greatly to make it far more gripping and interesting.The worst scene not only of this film, but probably of the last few years that I can remember, suffers from a similar problem. As Morpheus delivers his speech to the people of Zion at the beginning of the film, they all go mad and start partying late into the night! This scene is just cringe-worthy, slow motion takes of Zion's people dancing to some dance music, inter-cut with Neo and Trinity having sex. I want to know what was going through the Wachowskis' heads when they filmed this scene, I do not understand what they are trying to achieve with it one bit. The worst thing about it is that at this early stage, I already equate Zion with this terrible scene. The scene goes on for way too long as well, a minute of this would have been tolerable, but it seems to go on for about five minutes. Enough already! One scene which doesn't go on too long is the awesome freeway chase scene which is up there with anything that the first film can offer. This was a scene which I wanted to go on for longer, as the creepy Twins chase Trinity down a packed road, while agents appear and place Morpheus in trouble. This scene is awe-inspiring and is backed up by a great piece of music by Juno Reactor which fits the quick tempo of the scene perfectly.Overall, when Reloaded is concentrating on some great action inside the Matrix and the strange beings which inhabit it, it plays like a question and answer session on the first film, answering all our questions that we might have had when we first heard the concept of the Matrix (what if...). It's the beginning at Zion which is slow-moving, and other scenes which are just too long, that prevent it from being great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Free Your Mind,The Matrix Reloaded Awesome Movie Love It Lot's Great Story Great Action Great Cast,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Breathtaking Piece of Crap,"The problem with evaluating sequels is that they are invariably compared to their predecessors. The problem with evaluating The Matrix Reloaded is that you also must take into account what is yet to come, since Reloaded is only half a movie.That having been said, what is on the screen for The Matrix Reloaded is a padded-out, self-indulgent, self-important load of crap.True, the special effects and action sequences are beyond state-of-the-art, and if that's all you're seeing the movie for, you won't be disappointed. But whereas the first Matrix challenged us to re-examine our own definitions of reality, Reloaded gets so bogged down in its own mythology that it leaves the audience (at least the members not trapped in their own ""matrix"") to ultimately wonder, ""Who gives a damn?"", specifically about a plot that the filmmakers are trying so solemnly and so earnestly to sell.I'm curious to see Part III, if only to see how the filmmakers will justify the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on creating and hyping this lead balloon of a movie.""The Matrix"" was a landmark film. But the story ended there. This sequel was, in the end, unnecessary. And that's about as damning a statement on a sequel that one can make.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix Reloaded,"Hype is a film-makers worst enemy. As showcased by the disappointing The Phantom Menace, hype can seriously damage a film's, or a series', reputation. Such is the case with The Matrix Reloaded. After the truly inspired Matrix sprung up out of nowhere in 1999, the sequels had such a huge expectation placed on them, in no small part by the films producer, Joel Silver, that it was naïve to believe that they could turn out a film as fantastic as was promised. And that's exactly what happened, because the Matrix Reloaded, despite several excellent moments, just does not have the originality or style that the original did.Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Carrie-Ann Moss have reprised their roles as Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, but whereas last time they all seemed so human, now they seem to have had their humanity taken away, particularly in the case of Neo, who seems just as soulless as the machines he is fighting against. It's a real shame, as it was Neo's humanity that made him such a fascinating character in the first film.The beginning of the film does not help matters either. We start off very promisingly with a dream sequence, which shows off the extraordinary bullet-time effects that made the first film such a breakthrough. But within five minutes it's over, and we are left with an overlong introduction to Zion, the last human city, and to the increasingly complicated plot. The Zion section has to be the real low-point of the film, and as it is at the beginning of the film, that sense of disappointment seems to run through the whole two and a half hour running time. Once it is over, though, the film really starts to shine, and the enormous budget can be seen taking effect. Here we have everything that made the first film great magnified ten times, as Neo unleashes his Agent-stopping powers on 100 Agent Smiths, and a hall full of vampires, not to mention one of the longest and most impressive freeway chases currently on film. This middle hour is the films' saving grace; it is a magnificently choreographed kung-fu-fest, showcasing the great combination of computer effects and live action that few films have utilised successfully. On top of this is a rip-roaring powerhouse of a soundtrack that keeps the atmosphere strong throughout the film, being both a fine example of a rock soundtrack and giving more mellow pieces, keeping the mood without being melodramatic.Once the final chapters come in, however, we end up back where we started  disappointed, and this time utterly confused. Repeated viewings are necessary to understand all of what the Architect says in his (now infamous) thesaurus-straining speech, and it does not help that we will not find out the answers to all the questions posed until the final instalment, released a full six months later. It's a real shame that the Wachowski brothers seemed to miss what made the original so great, and throw in too much philosophical nonsense to try and pad things out, as if they were making the script up as they went along. Whilst the centre of the film is a stunning achievement, the beginning and end just shows how much work will be needed for Revolutions to redeem the Matrix name.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:Having seen this many more times now, the flaws are more obvious. Sure, it looks good - stunning, even - but because this is a sequel it necessitates comparison with the original; and it is simply not as good. The original had a great idea that sat so well on its own, but the sequels complicate matters needlessly. Also, the first time I saw the film the effects looked great, but now with more time to evaluate them some already look dated and fake. The freeway chase, which seemed so cool the first time, has been surpassed many times, even by the likes of films like Bad Boys II (2003). It all looks like a well designed video game (ironic, I know) but it just does not immerse the audience like the original film did. It's still very stylish; it's not all bad, really, it does have some truly excellent parts, but it's also not a patch on the original. Could have been more, and should have been more.Re-rated: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"It's my least favorite movie of the series, but even the weakest movie of a masterpiece trilogy is one of the best movies you can watch.","The film's biggest sin is clearly obvious. The philosophical aspect, technological ingenuity, brilliant action sequences and dazzling soundtrack are still there. But I think it is a shame that the effects of some of the action sequences were not adequate due to budget or time and were left as they were. Almost cartoonish.It manages to detail the world it introduced in the first movie of the series in a quality way. His presentation of a post-apocalyptic city and culture is creative.

Not worth of its prequel,"Obviously the Wachowskis had set their own bar quite high with that amazing movie The Matrix is. And obviously its sequel would not have such a mind-blowing plot like the first movie did, but it would just limit itself to narrate Neo's path to try to disable the Matrix after realizing he is the One. I watched the 1999 movie yesterday, and today I woke up thinking about it, which I think it proves what a good movie it was. And I couldn't wait to watch this movie, because I was obsessed with knowing how on Earth could the Matrix be disabled.But this movie is not about it. It's just another action movie. Perhaps it was quite pioneer in that sub-genre that super hero movies are (which are now much more widespread than when this trilogy was released), but, honestly, I'm not into that kind of stuff. What I'd loved from the first movies were all the philosophical themes it dealt with, but these are hardly seen in Matrix Revolutions. You've got instead lots of kung fu fighting, cars being blown up with a katana (!?) and visual effects that might have been impressive for the time but that they now seem taken from a PlayStation.What saved it from giving it a lower score was the scene with the Architect, which is by far the best scene of the movie. The Architect is quite a fascinating character that reminded me of the Masonic Great Architect of the Universe, and I like how his lines, very well written, bring about some nietzchean Doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence to that contemporary Plato's Cave that the Matrix is. If I had seen this movie in the cinema, this scene would have been worth the ticket. You've also got some good ideas about causality and the dilemma freedom-fate, specially in Morpheus' character, who insists on people's free choices but blindly believes in a prophecy that would obviously bind people's actions to an a priori determined course of action. But who cares about it, people just want to to watch Neo stop bullets and fight thousands of Agent Smiths at the same time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Most complaints about the movie are not valid,"Okay, here's how I felt about the film: This is the best sequel to any movie since Empire Strikes Back and Terminator 2.  With that said, let's look at why people don't like this movie, at least according to the numerous postings on this site:1. A case of cognitive dissonance: nothing but talk/nothing but action and special effectsThis is very confusing to me, since many people complain about too much talking (which was great) with not enough action, and about too much action (which was also great) with not enough substance and dialogue.  These are predominant complaints that are directly opposite of each other.  So which is it?  It's largely a matter of how much one expects from a sequel to The Matrix.2. It was a big disappointment from the first Matrix movie.Disappointment follows expectations.  What did you expect?  The Matrix Redux?  The Matrix Repeated?  Obviously there will be comparisons drawn, but the fact is that the two movies are VERY DIFFERENT--and I'm not talking about which one was better than the other; they are simply different.  And isn't that how it should be, as a matter of fact?  If you have a trilogy that's simply three same movies, what's great about that?  The first and the second installments are (and supposed to be) designed differently because they serve different purposes in the grand scheme of a trilogy.  (This is particularly annoying when I hear people saying ""Empire Strikes Back"" was the worst of the Star Wars trilogy, when it was pretty obvious to me that it was much more skillfully made and directed than the original Star Wars.)3. It was too long.It was TWO minutes longer than the first Matrix.  What, couldn't hold the attention span through Neo's interaction with the Architect, the most shocking, revealing, and in a way exciting part of the entire movie (actually, in a way, of the entire trilogy so far).  Yeah, you could've cut out 5 minutes of the Celebration of Humanity/Zionic Rave, but can't you just sit still for a bit?  Titanic -- now THAT was long and boring!4. It was boring.Go watch a Jet Li movie.  He does those change-directions-in-mid-air moves too, and he does it for good solid 90 minutes of his movies.  And of course, there are plenty of Matrix knockoffs (like hey, ""The One"" with Jet Li!) you can watch.  Weren't you expecting at least a little philosophical discussion based on the first Matrix movie?5. The first was much better.First of all, this is insufficient and even irrelevant to the discussion of the movie's quality.  Again, these are separate movies designed to serve different roles in a trilogy.In fact, I think this movie surpasses the predecessor because it's less formulaic.  The first one was ""revolutionary"" (actually, it's not THAT revolutionary except that its sleek style reached much more audience than others movies with similar concept, e.g. ""Dark City"") but you have to admit it followed a kind of archetypal storybook sort of plot: discovery of a Savior figure, his struggles to discover the power within him, epic battles at the climax, and right up to the good ol' Sleeping Beauty-esque kiss that brings the loved one back to life.  ""Reloaded"" does not follow any of that. It's a brand-new territory; VERY EXCITING!  We have a hero who is not battling mostly with his identity rather than discovering his powers.  We have great philosophy running through about levels of control and in the end we are left to wonder if everything we've learned in the first Matrix is true.  This is beyond great; it's fantastic!  The makers of ""Reloaded"" has abandoned the conventional and safer route for an even more challenging and superb road that puts its own neck on the chopping block.  Coming out of the theater, I was left with a lot of questions (which I assume will be answered for the most part in ""Revolutions""), but it felt wonderful to be challenged in even more daring ways by the world of the Matrix.So it seems like much of criticism and disappointments come because people choose to come with certain ideas and biases in their minds.The problem is, indeed, choice.joe k.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The awesome sequel to the original.,"Well I have to start buy saying that this is an honestly good movie,
but with all sequels it has it's flaws as well. (There easy to overlook).I think that this takes place at least six months after the first,
and we get to see Zion an underground sanctuary where the human race
hides, we also learn that the machines are digging their way to them.
Neo flies, a prophecy is talked about and there is a ticking clock to all-out 
war with the machines.
(Let me get into the flaws first).First I would like to say that this is a fun movie, great action scenes
great visual effects. But the movie manly lacks in I would say character
development, maybe a bit of the story is a little muttled, and a little
confusing and convoluted. I can't place my finger on it but it's there,
to put it simply they should have done something else for the story.
Even before I seen this I was kinda expecting something different,
you know, new villains, new threat just something cool but different. 
Not that what is in it isn't and not that I was let down or anything when
I watched it but I'm saying that it was missed opportunities for something
really special.
(On to the good stuff).The action scenes are awesome and quite memorable,
my favorites are when Trinity is on the freeway in a high speed chase,
Morpheus fighting an agent on a semi-truck's trailer all the bad ass fights
with Neo.
There is a scene where Neo kisses Monica Bellucci that is quiet erotic
also Neo and Trinity have a sex scene in this, I can tell the directors wanted
to have some sex in this film LOL.
A side from that this was an enjoyable film to watch all though I do watch
this film a lot less these days, I do find myself going back to the first more
often. But this one is still good and ends on a cliffhanger leaving you wanting
more.Overall I give it a 7/10. Fun to watch every once and a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Boring and interesting, if that's possible","An ambitious film that takes four years to make and with so many different elements will inevitably suffer a certain disjointedness.What saves this film and it's predecessor, which I was not too enamoured of, is it's interesting plot. Throughout history, totalitarian states have grappled with the problem of controlling it's slaves and their rebellions. This film dares to devote a lot of screen time in an almost academic way to the complex problems an advanced technological machine culture would have dealing with it's slave labour, giving a strange poignancy to the helplessness of the humans crushed by these cold machinations. The result is a boring, weird and brilliant film.

The action scenes, especially the highway chase, are pretty good. The ending cliffhanger is weirdly effective. Keanu Reeves basically is a superhero male Mary Sue this time around, but the world he is in is so bizarre it'll keep the viewer's interest.Side Note: I found it interesting that everyone slams the laughable incomprehensibleness of the Architect.

"One of the better, more entertaining films you'll see this summer, possibly this year","The Matrix Reloaded is like a high octane video game for Playstation 2 or X-Box, brought superbly onto the screen by the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), with plenty for the audience to enjoy and soak up.  This is indeed a film that doesn't match up quite to the original (what could, really), but what is breathtaking is how the Wachowskis' feel a confidence, mastery of their medium of sci-fi action storytelling.  Even when the film gets all too deep into the philosophical speculations and dialogue (which the first balanced with the action perfectly), it rebounds to get to what the audience wants to see- fights, chases, gun and knife/sword battles, and all the visual effects that can be brought forth in a Hollywood picture.I won't say too much of the plot except that in the second installment we see our heroes, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, facing the oncoming of the war with the machines, and how they, and more specifically Neo, will be tested to their limits.  These limits make up the sum of the visual effects and action sequences, which are about 60 to 65 percent of the whole movie. And that's what makes the film a worthy watch (not the acting, since it's even lesser than in the first one, as Keanu Reeves proves) is that there seems to be always something to look at, admire, and maybe even dismiss as TOO un-real.Bottom line, The Matrix Reloaded isn't a great movie, like it's monumental predecessor, however it doesn't leave I, as I'm sure it won't leave others, with a sense of money not well spent.

Don't get over-excited,"The above tag-line is intended as advice both for people who haven't seen it, and for those rabid critics who have so savagely torn it to pieces in reviews elsewhere on IMDB. Let's start with the basics. It's not as good as the first one. Many of the fight sequences do seem to be little more than fillers. There is little to no development in overall style or technique from the first movie. The storyline is frequently lazy and complacent. Much of the dialogue was insipid. All of these are valid criticisms. But - worst movie ever made? Come on you guys. There was a lot of extremely dense plotting towards the end of the movie which you probably didn't notice as you were too busy being disappointed. Had you paid proper attention, you would see that some elements of the Matrix Universe (fight sequences and special effects notwithstanding) do represent a considerable development from the tremendous promise laid down in the first film.

I have seen countless atrocities done by the Studios in the name of cultivating a continuation, Trust me, this comes no close as compared to those abominations.The narration here might not be the strongest suit as the scarcities are rather obvious, still, we had got the same set of characters that we all idolized and some more. In terms of character advancements, the likes of Trinity, Neo or even Morpheus might not have taken substantial leaps forward; however, they still hold their own and continues to do what they do best, kick some asses.The Action is again in the centre, comparatively more so in this iteration! People who went in to see some credible action, well, I don't think they were greeted with disappointment. Although I have to admit, despite amassing a bigger scale and much more in terms of sheer volume, the execution was nowhere near the standards the first one has had met.And the part of the reason may as well be the factor of complacency.

I wasn't impressed,"I was having a very hard time when I was in the theater.  After 4 years of falling in love with The Matrix, I found myself trying to like Matrix Reloaded as I was watching it, convincing myself that Matrix Reloaded did not suck, and I was not bored by the special effects, or the one-liners, or the story line.  But who am I kidding, if it was really such a great flick, I would be spending 100% of my time enjoying it, loving it.  But I wasn't. The story was the most disappointing part.  After we learned what was the Matrix four years ago, the movie was trying to throw in some extra twists to complicate the plot, and to explain certain concepts that were better left un-explained.  The fight scenes were not any better either, most of them were overly pretentious and LOOOONNNNG.  I was so unimpressed by them that I was constantly asking myself ""Is it gonna end anytime soon?""  The highway car chase scene... yes, a lot of car stunts, a lot of fighting, and tons of bullet-time... but you know what?

Bigger is not always better...,"...and this movie is a perfect example for that. This sequel to ""The Matrix"" is bigger in many ways, bigger fights, heavier special effects and a notable larger budget. Does that mean it also is a better movie? No way!Let me start of by saying that no matter what, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" still is an awesome and spectacular movie to watch and like all the three Matrix movies, I'm glad I've seen it in the cinema. The fights are incredible and truly spectacular to watch (although, a bit fake at times). The highway sequences is a really good chase scene, on par with the ones in ""The French Connection"", ""Bullitt"" and ""Basic Instinct"" (Yes, I really feel that the chase scene in ""Basic Instinct"" is a real classic).Problem is that the Wachowski brothers tried to make this movie bigger than it was. They tried to bring a mythology kind of story into the Matrix trilogy, the result is a confusing and a not always understandable story, with lots of crazy talk that nobody seems to fully 100% understands. The first Matrix movie already wasn't exactly easy to follow at times but they have really gone to far this time with both this movie and the third one, ""The Matrix Revolutions"". I don't think anybody was waiting for a story like this, when people go and see a Matrix movie they go and see it because of the awesome and groundbreaking special effects and fights. At least I do...The worst thing about ""The Matrix Reloaded"" are most certainly the Zion scene's. They are boring and seem to drag on for ever, with the absolute low point, the whole rave/orgy scene after Morpheus speech which he did half naked by the way, for no apparent reason.Yes I really was disappointed by Morpheus appearance in this movie. In the first Matrix movie he was a Yoda kind of character, in the two sequels his character suddenly changed into a character that I just couldn't like as much as the Morpheus we got to know in ""The Matrix"".A very laughable thing is the whole Neo and Trinity relationship. Man, they really have no chemistry together on the screen and the relationship is totally unbelievable.The cast is joined by some good actors such as; Lambert Wilson, Monica Bellucci (all she does is showing her great body and looks but hey, I'm not complaining!) and Ian Bliss. There are some nice characters added such as the Merovingian and the cool twins but also some unnecessary characters that are given weak dialog and are played mostly by some horrible B-actors. Thank goodness Hugo Weaving is also still in this movie, he makes the movie really worth your time. Agent Smith still is a very cool character!All in all, compared to ""The Matrix"" a disappointing sequel mostly because of the way too complicated story. Still I recommend this movie to everyone because of all the awesome fights, special effects and nice musical score by Don Davis, it all makes ""The Matrix Reloaded"" a spectacular movie to watch, although far from a science-fiction masterpiece such as the first Matrix movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good summer film but ultimately fails to live up to predecessor,"For the past couple of months I have begun to feel sorry for the Matrix Reloaded. It is a film that not only had to hold it's own as a summer action flick but also had the immeasurably difficult task of living up to perhaps the most celebrated sci-fi action flick of all time. Did we really expect a film as good as the MAtrix?But then I think to myself, on the other hand, did the Wachowski's HAVE to make another Matrix film? The answer is no and I no longer feel sorry for all the flak they have taken for tarnishing the once untouchable name of the Matrix. I hope for their sake that Revolutions is not only a fantastic movie in it's own right but also manages to make everyone think twice about Reloaded. I for one am not so sure the Wachowski's will be able to pull this off but I could be wrong.As if the odds against it weren't enough Reloaded had similar unlucky fate as Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones; It was released two weeks after a Marvel film that garnered considerably better reviews than it. While Reloaded still managed to pull in more money than X2 (though the gap ($60 million) was not as large as experts had guessed) it's critical success was not as good. Unfortunately, it wasn't just the critics; movie-goers just seemed to enjoy X2 more. As if this wasn't bad enough an EVEN BETTER film came out a couple of weeks after Reloaded. This one was even a kids' film. Finding Nemo officially dethroned Reloaded as the 2003 summer king both by getting better reviews AND by making more money. Dethroned by a kids' film that no one had predicted would make more money, the Wachowskis may have made a whole load of money but have also suffered heavy embarrassment. They also have to live with the knowledge that because of all the negativity, revolutions will neither have as big an opening weekend, nor will it make as much money in the long run.So this of course all means Reloaded is a bad film? Well... no. It's actually pretty good. Unfortunately it isn't it's The Matrix. It tries so so hard to be it's predecessor but it's not. Director Joel Silver said this film raised the bar to unimaginable levels. However there are no special effects in this film that we have not seen used in a whole bunch of films before. Just where does the bar get raised, Joel? When Neo fights the hundredth Smith? When we see a bullet time effect for like the ten millionth time? The most exciting scene in the movie is the car chase scene and despite all the hype, people were more excited at the Nightcrawler scene in X2, a scene that the filmmakers of X2 did not hype at all. This is a good example of hype coming back to haunt a film. Someone should tell film makers that the last thing they want to do is hype a scene in their own movie cos if the audience do not feel the same way, they're screwed.The action scenes in Reloaded are top notch however and you can see a lot of time and effort has been put into them but there is one major problem...we've seen it all before. Unlike the first Matrix, where the viewer came out thinking ""Wow, what the hell was that? How did they do that?"" you just sort of sit there thinking ""Oh. That again."" and ""bullet-time again"". The only new cool action sequence is Neo flying (even if it is a bit too CGI-filled).One of the most celebrated things about the Matrix was the philosophical aspect of it. I always had mixed feelings about this aspect. While the film was certainly more clever than your everyday run of the mill action flick, I'm afraid it wasn't Aristotle either. The ""philosophy"" in that film was rather shallow and very uncomplicated for obvious reasons. While I do not think that this was one of the Wachowskis' intentions, this aspect of the film ended up being probably the most talked about. For this reason Andy and Larry decided to amp it all up for Reloaded. This is where this film's main fault arrives. Given the plot of this film, there is literally no further philosophy than was in the first film but Andy and Larry have decided, rather than inserting real philosophy into the film, to only pretend to do so. The result is a number of the characters in the film saying normal things in stressfully complicated ways. This is nothing more than a cheap and low shot by the Wachowskis aimed at the less knowledgeable of Matrix fans. I find this to be the one thing about Reloaded that I cannot forgive. There are few things worse than being pretentious. If all you've got for us is a brainless summer blockbuster, then admit it. Don't try to fool people into thinking there is more than meets the eye to the film.The unfortunate result of this is a lot of Matrix fans telling everyone that they did not get the film. If someone says this to you, be sure to ask them exactly what it is that you didn't get and watch them falter or say something ridiculous like ""you have to find out for yourself"". Accept everything in this film at face value. There is nothing subtle ot remotely sublime about it.Overall Reloaded is a good action movie to watch if you want to see some good old fashioned butt-kicking and great special effects but if you're looking for an intelligent film, watch Adaptation or City of God.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An Eclectic Hodgepodge of Sci Fi/Martial Arts Themes,"18 May 2003. Matrix Reloaded has become an uneasy collage of sci fi, virtual reality, and martial arts spectaculars interlaced with attempts at emotional human connections and intellectual philosophy. The beginning sequences unfortunately come across as imitations of Final Fantasy computer generated animations (that supposed to represent actual reality) along with the original HR Giger images of Alien creations of an inner earth and Minority Report computer mechanizations. And somewhere along with way, the audience is strangely passed over and dropped into the sequel to Matrix having been left out of about an hour a missing introduction to a whole nether world that we've never seen.Plenty of movies have used virtual reality to good effect - even Virtual Nightmare(2000) which played on the Sci Fi Channel was able to include a triple twist in its two hour playing time duplicating the twists in the Matrix and its sequel minus the martial arts action sequences. Brazil (1985), The Cell (2000), Dark City (1998), The Truman Show (1998), eXistenZ (1999), Freejack (1992), Total Recall (1998); Virtuosity (1995) have all used the virtual idea, some to better impact than Matrix. Matrix: Reloaded, overdoes the action, overplays the martial art action and becomes a rather unsettling series of confusing, exploding, repeatings scenes.While the intent, the energy to make an intelligent, above average sci fi - action -thriller, this Matrix sequel only succeeds in revealing how truly difficult to combine so many elements into an even, compelling memorable movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The movie is made for two types of people. 1) People who like guns and fight scenes and are somewhat lacking in the logical department -- or as it's put in the movie 'using every muscle save for the one that counts'. And then it is also made for the people who want to be challenged by this idea of living in a virtual reality world. There are points when you wonder if you're actually supposed to understand it or whether the writers just pulled out a dictionary and looked for a lot of big words to string together, but after mulling it over a little the idea does catch on. I confess that I didn't see this movie until just yesterday, three years after it was made and the graphics are somewhat mediocre, but that really doesn't spoil the movie -- and there was only one fight scene (which went on for at least 5 mins) that I actually got bored enough in to pay attention to the graphics. The matrix reloaded is a very clever story, making one wonder about the decisions they make in every day life. And, maybe it's because I'm only 14 and have a very active imagination, but I really did enjoy this movie and the whole idea of it still phases me. So for those who like fight scenes, big psyche up talks and a load of philosophical mumbo jumbo this is the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A dazzling Mis-fire,"Amidst productions delays resulting from the deaths of supporting players and injuries to lead actors, `Matrix Reloaded' has arrived. The wave of hype surrounding the film resembled the `Star Wars' and `Harry Potter' releases, and is the first of two sequels to complete the trilogy. Reloaded continues the story of a band of humans who are locked in a deadly struggle against alien/invasion. The majority of the population is suspended in a blissful dream state unaware that the world they live in is an illusion. Those that are able to be free of the dream state, battle the invasion over a vast network knows as `The Matrix' by enabling cyber implants in their bodies. While in the Matrix, people can fight the invaders and accomplish missions using a variety of skills and weapons.<p> The new film picks up after the events of the first film with Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn), returning to the last human city of Zion to recharge their ship from battle and to prepare for another mission. It seems the forces of evil are burrowing toward the buried city and will soon arrive for an all-out cataclysm. There are those amongst the humans who believe that Neo is the chosen one, and others that do not believe the prophecy that Neo is the savior and this forms a point of contention for the human leaders. The film is awash in effects as Neo and his crew set off on a mission to save humanity but sadly the story seems to get lost along the way. While the film has plenty of effects and action, none of them seem particularly exciting, and I noticed a real lack off cheers and applause from the screener crowd during action scenes as much of it had a been there seen that look to it, that despite upping the quantity, was the same as we saw in the last film. The bullet-time effects are getting stale as it seems to be the only trick in the films arsenal, and the creative team behind the film goes to the well far to many times given a sense of tedium to what are otherwise well-crafted and designed scenes. There was also a severe lack of tension in the film and Reeves lack of emotion and his monosyllable delivery made it hard to really get behind the plight of the characters. Several people mentioned after the screener that they could not make sense of many of the plot elements and that they did not think that the characters were well defined or developed.<P> What I saw was a film that had some nice effects that quickly became boring as the setup and execution lacked any tension and the plot lacked cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. This point was further underlined by the lack of any applause at the end of the film and several disparaging remarks being loudly uttered as the audience filed out of the cinema. I found myself trying hard to like the film but despite the number of effects they were very ho-hum as if I was watching a FX real and many of the best effects had already been shown in the previews. Lets hope that `Matrix Revolutions' can end the trilogy on a high note, as `Matrix Reloaded' is a misfire.<p> <P> 2.5 stars out of 5 <P> Gareth Von Kallenbach <P> International Association of film critics",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as original,"Last night I was fortunate enough to stumble across some tix to the ""Reloaded"" premiere. Since the original ""Matrix"" came out a few years ago everyone has imitated its' kenetic action style, which led me to think there's no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again. But they did. The Wachowskis have way out done the new ""Star Wars"" films and without a doubt have far surpassed the ""X-Men films."" At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins. A little goofy but fun. The action though, I can't say enough about. The center chase scene is awesome and the opening cycle scene is.... Okay, no more words, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" will not disappoint and by the time you reach the cliffhanger ending you're more than ready for a break from this double talking, mind bending adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A typical sequel ... disappointing,"Like other great sci-fi films based on a single concept, (Planet of the Apes, Alien) it is difficult to make a sequel that has the same impact as the original.

"Well done, well thought out, with only a couple of issues.","My first mistake was listening/reading reviews before seeing the movie. I was VERY impressed with the movie.  The visuals were wonderful.  I measure how good a movie is by how much I think about it once I am done watching it. I've been piecing the story line together in my head.  I didn't find the movie anti-climatic.  I didn't find it below my intelligent level, in fact the more I think about it the more depressed I get.  It seems that the mere humans were just pawns in a struggle between good and evil, the good and evil of two human created, non humans.  The Architect and the Oracle. Which one was good and which was evil?  It wasn't by chance that the Architects was light skinned, and so gray as to appear all white.  His clothes were even light colored.  The Oracle on the other hand was dark skinned, dark haired, and even had a dark habit, smoking.The Architect created a world for the humans to live, love, and grow. What was the Oracle doing?  Franly, just creating chaos.  In fact so much chaos that the lives of millions of human and non humans were nearly ended.Was Neo modeled as a savior, or an anti-savior?  I guess this all turns back to ourselves.  Seldom, if ever are people pure good or evil.  Causing mass murder would be evil, right?  Well that is what Neo, and his group were doing.  Not to mention that they were working for someone that was looking to destroy it all.  Hmmmm makes you think.Two minor problems I have with the movie.  Neo was able to destroy the sentinel by his thought alone.  Where the hell did that come from?  This one aspect could have turned the movie into a interesting direction.  It was glossed over by the Oracle, but not explained in any detail.  Frankly it shouldn't be an ability outside the Matrix, hmmmm outside the Matrix...makes you think.  Secondly.  In the mech fighting exoskeletons, well bluntly, they were shooting MANY MANY more shells that was contained in those two tiny ammo packs.  One can only hope that most of the frame contained ammo, and those packs were just topping it off, yeah right.Bottom line?  Good movie.  Better than the first, for action.  Better than the second, because the second was just irritating.  The second movie was good, but I don't like being left hanging.  Go see the movie, but put your thinking cap on first.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Original themes sold out in favor of dopey sci-fi action,"It's astonishing to me that the people who made this film seem to have no idea what made their first film so good. I can only assume this is the case because their present effort is just plain bad.It wasn't just the ultra-cool fight scenes that introduced movie audiences to the concept of ""bullet-time."" It wasn't just Carrie Ann Moss' fine self drop-kicking bad guys and running up walls whilst clad in skin-tight leather and latex. I mean, don't get me wrong, they were an integral part of the film's entertainment value.But the first film wasn't just a simplistic clash between cartoonish caricatures of good and evil a la Star Wars. It was a revolution fantasy about looking at things in a new way and dealing with the consequences through love and loyalty -- and, okay, kung fu.In the first film we were made to care about our loveless and pathetic protagonist and his humdrum life as he seemed adrift, as so many of us are, in a cynical and lonely cityscape of cubicles and punch-clocks. We cared about him because he was trying to find out why life was like this and we cared because he wasn't falling prey to the pitfalls of drugs and destructive relationships. He was looking for answers and staying pure to his quest. In a real sense, he was every unmarried young urbanite trying to intellectualize himself happy with the help of a computer and a little too much solitude.When the answers find him, he takes a chance and leaves his world for theirs and pays the price big time. The system is not happy he's switched sides and seeks to deprive him of his life, his livelihood, and, what's worse, the hot new woman in his life. Anyone who's ever made a major change in lifestyle can relate to metaphors that illustrate this kind of peril.And it doesn't take a genius to recognize the hidden meanings behind the fact that in one half of the movie Neo (or as he is referred to by Matrix enforcers, Mr. Anderson) is taking orders from whitebread America (his boss, the FBI), and in the second half he's listening to world-weary but wiser poor black housewives (the Oracle) and hipsters (Morpheus).So, it's the computer enthusiast who thinks for himself allied with the funky downtrodden masses against the straight-laced corporate bloodsuckers. This is a story my generation can relate to. The good guys prevail because they see the system for what it is and because they help free each others' minds. And a little kung fu never hurts either.'The Matrix Reloaded' is a total sellout. Our hero isn't in the trenches with his new compadres any more, he's flying over their heads, literally, like Superman, and duking it out with Eurotrash bad guys like it was some sort of Schwarzenegger picture. He lands long enough to have sex with his girlfriend or stand around and look iconic in his shades.They set themselves a pretty high bar for visually interesting fight sequences with the first film and the ones in 'Reloaded' pay off if you try and ignore the fact that it's quite often a completely computer-generated Keanu you see lunging around. But you won't care. This picture's got no soul. All the right actors are there in all the right outfits, but there's way too much of a BattleStar-Galactica-come-Star- Trek-Next-Generation contingent marching around in tunics and talking of ""ships"" and ""crew"" like they had invaded this film from some stupid made-for-SciFi-Channel movie-of-the-week. One particular scene seems matched shot for shot out of the BattleStar Galactica TV series: Our spaceship pilot gets home to his rebel abode and gets a bunch of smack from his warrior wife about being more careful when flying through the Alpha quadrant. I mean what the hell kind of crap am I watching here?I think a better movie would have tested Neo's funky new alliances in some way and would have existed more exclusively in the actual Matrix.But they thought it would be better to be more like Star Wars or something which is a god awful shame for those of us who really related to the intelligence and style of the first picture.Why didn't the Wachowski brothers stay true to their original themes and inspirations?

The George Lucas method for destroying franchises in full display.,"Back in 99 everyone was expecting the new Star Wars movie, it was going to be the ""big"" sci-fi/fantasy event of the year, of the new millennium. Turns out the phantom menace was an atrocious mess of cgi and bad writing, same with the rest of the star wars prequels. The real sci-fi event of that year was not Lucas ego leaving a big stain in cinemas all over the world, it was a fun kung fu/anime hybrid of nerd power fantasies done right enough to engage the viewer and not make you feel that your intelligence was being insulted. It was the year of the matrix.Now move to 03, the sequel is coming, the Wachowskis had an entire generation in the palm of their hands. The could had created the biggest and most successful cult-movie franchise this world has seen since....Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. The world was full of possibilities for the matrix, everything was coming out: video game, anime, action figures and anything else you could name of. History in the making. Then Reloaded opens in cinemas everywhere, and we have another mess of bad writing, poorly directed sequences, annoying cgi and so on. A franchise permanently killed (not even the money made from the expectations helped) dozens of fans writing endless rants ""explaining"" the movie in the internet and just a bunch of people coming out completely bored out of their minds.It's not hard to see where everything goes wrong. The matrix reloaded has pretty much no reason to exist at all, just like the star wars prequels. It adds nothing to it's world, it actually destroys it. But mostly, is just a bore to watch, a huge incredible bore of a movie that will hammer your head with endless sequences of tedious fights that go nowhere, and a bunch of cgi stamped all over your face.Neo is now god/Jesus/mahoma/whatever, the whole learning process from the first movie is over. He can defeat agents with his pinky, but not just him, pretty much everyone else can do that, except of course Trinity in a atrociously placed sequence for yet another embarrassing scene of super nerd powers. Remember how dangerous the agents were in the first movie? Every encounter could mean the death of any of the characters. Not here, they're just cgi filler for all the over-long action sequences that the Wachowskis could stuff here.Remember how the first movie felt with a purpose? A clear series of objectives? Surviving the agents, protecting the location of zion, watching Neo learn about his abilities. None of that is here, there's a web of characters over a web of sub-plots over a mess of a ""core"" plot where Neo is suppose to re-start the whole matrix because the creator of the matrix made it that way. Sounds interesting? It isn't, the dialogues never once will engage you in any way possible, neither the acting, which seems to have hit rock-bottom after the fairly decent performances in the first movie. Several characters are now just filler, others fan-service (hello Mrs Bellucci) and there's just more and more stuff that never feels that it belongs there, or that is fun to watch.There's probably a long long website/blog/vlog of matrix fans answering all the ""questions"" about this and that. But when a movie boils down to a long summary of Q&A, then it's not a movie anymore. It's a fan-fic in this case, a badly written one. It's not the ""what"" but the ""how"" that really matters, even if Reloaded was speaking about great truths in this world (not the case here by the way) it does so in the most utterly juvenile, incompetent and clueless way possible. Yeah man, Neo might be the reincarnation of every single human deity into one, but he will still look goofy as hell in those clothes and flying around everywhere.It took George Lucas two decades to ruin his franchise, the Wachachachoskis did it in only 4 years. I guess this still could be worse, it could be a movie about blue furries fighting one dimensional space marines, or Indiana Jones fighting aliens.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"sorry fanboys, it aint that good","I saw this movie on Monday evening. there were about 20 people for a ""secret"" showtime at the theatre. the overall opinion was the movie is ""OK"". I was there with my friend and his wife. He fell asleep during this film. the action DOES have excellent special effects, but I felt most of the action scenes were too long and drawn out (the car chase was way too long). I know people say that movies like this sometimes take repeated viewings to fully understand, but could someone explain why Neo can do so many things while in the matrix but not others? he has no ""kryptonite"" so whats holding him back? I will say the scenes that took place in the new world run by machines were outstanding, although i wish there were more of them. like i said the movie is OK, but too inconsistant.

Not as bad as people are saying.,"I don't see why this movie is taking the beating it so unjustly deserves. It's not a bad film by any means, neither is it Lawrence of Arabia, but that shouldn't have been suspected. What especially disturbs me is the comments people make implying that this movie, ""doesn't live up to the first film."" Maybe I'm alone when I say this but...well, the first movie wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's originality was astounding, but the script, and acting, left a little more than a little to be desired. So for the sequel my expectations were greatly lowered.Maybe that is why I enjoyed the sequel much more than the original.  No, one reason I liked the second movie better (and the most shallow reason) is the noticeably better budget, and therefore better special effects. There was one problem with the pyrotechnics, there was a little too much of them. After about the tenth fight scene you just don't care, but I'm more of a plot person anyway.Secondly I enjoyed this movie more because the script was SO MUCH BETTER! In the first film half wit one-liners almost ruined any fun to be had, but thankfully, almost all of that has changed, almost.Finally, some bad news. With the exceptions of Keanu Reeves (Who has gotten better by not acting if you know what I mean) and the Oracle lady, everyone has taken a step backward in portraying their character. Either that, or they were given nothing to play (As in Carrie Ann-Moss's Trinity). But all in all...well, I was not impressed.

What they did with Link's character forever marred both sequels,"I recently re-watched the Matrix Trilogy and I finally realised what it was (for me at least) that de-valued Reloaded compared to the first part - it was the way they inserted several full frame head on shots of Link reacting incredulously to Neo's abilities on the audiences behalf (almost breaking down the fourth wall and reducing his character to a kind of Jer Jar Binksness, i.e. The only reason for his character's existence was to project the viewers perspective into certain scenes, I hate that, for me it only works as a device in children's animation and comedy and when I watched it the other day each of those scenes actually made me cringe) had these few short scenes ended up on the cutting room floor or been shot very differently I think the critics and history would have been far kinder to both sequels..",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Pretentious sci-fi sequel overloads on gadgetry, special effects and technobabble.","`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn't even compare with it.`Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have.The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving's `Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress.A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one's for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Despite a strange ending this is a good film,"This film is strange. It has great set pieces and the pacing is good but it just ends abruptly.

More demanding aficionados will likely have a few reservations, some of which will not be addressed until the release of the third feature, Matrix Revolutions. I fall into the latter category. Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like, the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that it's virtually impossible to view this as a finished project.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not as good as the first, but it will still rock your socks off.","Matrix reloaded isn't great cinema. It doesn't even really have a beginning or an end. It's just the middle part the story. It's that grey area where we're waiting for the big finale, but we already know there isn't anything left to develop anymore because it was already explained in the first film. So Reloaded builds onto the matrix mythos. It explains some of the intricacies of the matrix that we didn't get to see in the first film. It explains things like why there are ghosts in the matrix and it builds a lot on the different programs that perform all the many tasks in making the matrix look and feel real. It isn't as heart poundingly exciting as the first one, but when it's over you'll just say ""Wow"" and be speechless.The action sequences are stunning. They'll blow you away. The car chase and the burly brawl, in which Neo fights 100 Agent Smiths, are just way way cool. The computer effects have taken a step up since the first movie. Before I saw that, I didn't think it was possible.Overall I didn't think this was the greatest movie ever made. I didn't think it was as good as the first Matrix. It isn't even a full movie, only a part of one. Alone, that would be horrible. But it isn't alone. Many movies have a whole lot of potential that they just don't live up to. That's what makes a movie a bad movie. This however is one of the rare cases where the movie met or maybe even passed it's potential. But because of the nature of being ""the middle part"" it's potential just wasn't that high to start with. So in short, it's not the best movie I've seen, but it couldn't have been better.

An underrated gem with admittedly some minor flaws,"Let me preface this review by saying that the first Matrix might be my favorite movie of all time or at least up there because of its blend of philosophy and action and you start questioning your world.Some very minor and vague spoilers incoming.Let's start with the negative things first. It's mainly some dull character interactions and the pacing in my opinion.You could've cut out many of the scenes from Zion for instance and have a better movie, since the conflict between the commander and Morpheus or even Link and his wife are forced and you could've get that message across more easily and faster. On a technical point there's some moments in which the CGI isn't well done, which takes you out of the movie for a short time.Now to the great aspects of this movie. The action is great and some nice additions to the original were made. But the movie is strongest in its world it has built and the thought process behind it and what many things symbolize. The idea of a virus entering the matrix being something perfect math can't foresee, the Merovingian's speech about causality, the architect's speech being of pure logic. The representation of the decision between love and duty, of trust and overcoming your fears. Of course you need to be into these kind of philosophical forays.These things elevate this movie to a level, that I can easily forgive its flawed scenes.Overall a great sequel and never understood the exuberant hate towards it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Rather pointless sequel.,"This film really wasn't necessary from an artistic standpoint.  The first Matrix film had a conclusion - Neo reached enlightenment and gained freedom from the matrix.  You didn't know exactly how he was to break the matrix down, but you assumed it would happen.But now we have this sequel, and there is to be a third installment, presumably the final one.  It's understandable that the filmmakers want to make a few more bucks, but the sequel isn't as good as the original.The computer graphics continue to be stunning, but nothing is new here, just a continuation of the technique developed before.  The central characters return - Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also returns but he's more caricature than character this time around.Several new members of the crew and the city of Zion are introduced, but the actors portraying them are not very good and they detract from the main story.  There is also some unnecessary melodrama - a jealous spat between Morpheus and the Zion commander over a woman, a wife angry that her husband spends too much time following Morpheus around.  The romantic angle between Neo and Trinity also takes up much of the movie.The original left some loose ends, but it was better that way.  It dealt with the matrix in allegorical terms, whereas this sequel (and presumably the final chapter) seem determined to define everything for the viewer. Sometimes, it's better left to the imagination.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Matrix Reloaded in 2021,The following for The Mateix is a masterpiece in it's own way. It's not for everyone as the idea itself is o ly for particular type of movie fans. This plot has to be followed with the plot of the first movie in mind. Some little details are linked and even few dialogs are linked and it should be watched in that way to get the 100% out of this movie. It's brilliant and I I don't understand why there's hate. This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. Action sequences are well choreographed and has a unique style. It's not the typical action sequences we see everyday. This is still a very relevant movie even in 2021. Most underrated. This rating has occured because of confused fans in my opinion as the plot is complicated but it's well written.

Interesting flick,"The Matrix reloaded is an interesting movie. For some strange reason, it gave me a lord of the rings, meets terminator, meets jackie chan type feeling. (I know that's difficult to comprehend) On the note of comparing it to other movies, there is a scene in the movie that they stole straight from minority report. The movie ends too abruptly for me. Where as other recent triligies/sequels have some sort of closure at the end of each film, reloaded just sort of stops. People in the movie give long complicated speeches and some things are difficult to follow. In the phantom menace, darth maul didn't receive enough screen time, nor did lady deathstrike in X2, and once again the two cool lookig bad guys in reloaded are robbed of screen time and dialog.

This is a good movie for those of you who don't get bored by watching the same fighting scene in dozens of different settings.The movie itself could last 30 minutes and nothing would be lost (except all those action scenes, of course...)Action, action, and more action, but where is the plot????If you really, really, really liked the first Matrix, then don't go and see this one, it is definitely not worth the 10 Euros/Dollars that you will have to give away, you would be much better off with any John Woo film or any old chinese/japanese martial arts movies.If you just liked the action scenes in the first Matrix, then this is the movie for you. Although it might be that you get bored after the 20th fight scene in the film.Summing up, it's better to buy the game and have 20 hours fun in front of your Playstation 2 than spend the same money and have 1,5 hours of boring, irrealistic and many times poorly rendered fight scenes...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The longest movie trailer in history. Or was it the ad for no. 3? So bad it hurt.,"I was hit in the solar plexus by the first film. A gut reaction to a fantastic plot and state of the art effects and design. No. 2 was such a letdown. Words with no meaning, players in search of a plot, effects that looked slapped together that went on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Neo as Superman. Come now you guys. You can keep no. 3 for yourselves. I admire and respect the work of Messrs. Reeves, Fishburne, Weaving, Moss and Co. but am amazed they took part in something as flat and one dimensional as no. 2 became. I was really looking forward to this and after about 10 minutes could not wait for it to end. It could have been so good. All the elements were there. What happened?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good film, bad matrix sequel","First of all, it expected a lot of it, it wasn't as good as I thought is would be. The story is not as good as in the first film, the stunts and fights are better then in the first one. But the dialogs between the less important characters and the one between the matrix' architect and neo are just too rough, the script is full of gaps. The conversations keep the speed out of the movie. The film is not bad, don't get me wrong, but for the sequel of one of the best movies ever, it is not good enough. It's just not good enough, that's the problem. they have put too much time and money in to the stunts and too little in to the script and the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Even harder adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish,"Whoa! If you ask me, THE MATRIX RELOADED is an even harder adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Like the predecessor, I couldn't tell hat was the real world and what was the cyber world. Also, when Neo (Keanu Reeves) was being pursued, I was scared. This was because I didn't want him to get hurt. Also, the martial arts and special effects were very well done. Now, in conclusion, if you liked THE MATRIX, I highly recommend this even harder adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish to any Keanu Reeves or Laurence Fishburne fan who hasn't seen it.

Unfairly maligned sequel.,"The original matrix film is a masterpiece, there's no question about that. It's the most influential science fiction film since at the very least T2, maybe even star wars. It was tightly written, stunning to look at, had revolutionary effects and was just cool as hell - and still is. Like I often state in my reviews, the very best movies, especially of this genre, just don't date like lesser efforts, and the same is true of the Matrix.Onto the sequel then. For me personally, I think this is all but as good as the original. It has a couple of issues, sure - the zion rave, whilst nowhere near as bad as most people make out, is still pretty superfluous. Some of the CGI, whilst really ambitious fell short in 2003 and does so now, particularly the 'burly brawl' and a couple of other bits. For the unprepared, the plot gets fairly complex too and I can see why some people don't like it for this.I actually think it's the sequels greatest strength though. It makes you think and challenges you to make your own interpretation of it. The overtones, wether religious or otherwise, I found to be fascinating, and they're expanded on in interesting ways in this, and I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this, surely it's preferable to just repeating the first movie which so many sequels are guilty of.Despite the aforementioned issues with some of the FX, the action scenes still easily match and often surpass the ones in the original though. The freeway chase is absolutely outstanding, a riot of pure chaos, and is in the conversation for the best car chase sequence ever put to film. The staircase fight is a fabulously shot and choreographed ruckus, and is for my money one of, if not the best fight in the trilogy for it's crisp intensity. The score in this scene is excellent too. The aforementioned burly brawl, despite the occasional PS3 effects, is still a whole heap of fun, with Hugo Weaving at his villainous best. There's a ton of other great action scenes here too, this film is still a spectacular blockbuster in every sense of the word. We're even treated to a cliffhanger ending, which is pretty rare even today.All the main players put in solid performances as expected but for me Weaving is the standout, and steals every scene he's in, providing the film's humour on the way too.I absolutely adore this film. Give it another chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Smith Strikes Back,"No the Agent smith character isn't Neo's father or anything... but the best movie I can compare it to is The Empire Strikes Back, its a very good sequel however much like starwars it isn't as good as the first.  Basically it doesn't have as much of an impact on us as viewers into a new story like the first one did ... the movie was a more action packed version of the first, with some type of twist. The movie is definately darker than the first much like empire strikes back.  My only real problem with the movie was the sex scene. Not that I have anything against sex scenes but it almost seemed like it was a pointless part of the movie. It just seemed out of place and too long. Besides that the movie seems to try to get too ""deep"". However, overall the movie was very entertaining with awesome special effects. I would give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The new Empire,"See it again. This movie took the great original and opened up a brave new world.  It takes such brass to do what the brothers' did. OK, yes, ""the kid"" was a stretch because of the Animatrix.  It sells, its Hollywood.  But what the Brothers are trying to do is make a whole new world, a new universe, not unlike Star Wars but with a very human feel.The first movie takes place on ONE ship!  What do the other ships do? What about Zion?  How do those people feel about their situation?  Can anyone save them from doom?  This is what makes Morpheus' speech work - pride and fear - Just like most religions.  They believe Neo is the one and how it all is handled is a very cautionary religious tale, which might be a redemption in the third movie. Now, I am not a religious person.  Not at all.  But I can see a good story. For those who thought the first movie was great, which I do too, after seeing this film the first time, I did not think it was the best movie because it veered so off from the original...but that is what makes it so great the second time.  First time around, you look for similarities to the first, the ""sequel""-ness to it. It is NOT a sequel, it is a continuation. It takes what you know and forms opinions from it, ideas from it.  The second time around watching it, you are ready for it.  AND LISTEN TO THE FIRST 40 MINUTES OF THE FILM!!! The insights and thoughts set up a great payoff - Which off course as most know, leaves a cliffhanger...but stay for the end of the credits (which are long) for a teaser for the third film.For those who felt ""cheated"" the first time he/she watched it...think how HIGH your expectations were and relax, take a deep breath, watch the film as you did the first and see it as a great continuation to a wonderful story. You know how bad The Empire Strikes Back was panned?  Why?  Because it was so darn different.  It opened up too much, it stretched, it veered, it was hard to top the original.

First Hour was a complete waste of my time but the rest of the film made up for it.,"This film could have been amazing.The first hour is just Load of Sh**.

They were running out of time and the last 30 minutes was literally like a trailer!The fighting scenes were amazing, but UNLIKE the first film, the choice of music for those fight scene was RIDICULOUS. Completely out of sync with the action and it really spoiled the rhythm.And those Lawrence Fish-bone speeches.. so dire, so naff. Probably written by some hippy.

At least in the first one some of the special effects were ground-breaking, but they've been so over-used in the interim in other features and in commercials that this time around they seem old-hat. And since there's not too much of a story-line to interest viewers it becomes just a matter of waiting to go from one action scene to the other. And at that, one of the longest scenes in the film is a fight on top of one extremely loooong truck speeding full throttle along one of L.A.'s murderous freeways which seems to last hours instead of the normal minutes!

Even worse than I originally thought,"I'm a fan of the franchise, and I've seen RELOADED three times now (only NOW am I starting to understand exactly what the Architect is saying in his ""ergo/vis-a-vis"" diatribe), but I have to say: RELOADED gets progressively worse with each viewing.  If you really want to know how bad this sequel is, go back and see the first movie again.  The first one and RELOADED don't compare, in terms of coherence as a movie.  I pity the poor guy who sees RELOADED without watching the first one (there must be like 2 or 3 people left that have actually done this.).Yeah, the fight scene is good, and the chase scene is without equal.  Yeah, sequels cannot be as good as the original.  But after the fulfilling first film, I was expecting more than a music video.  The [fake] philosophizing that flowed incredibly in the first movie gets diluted, dumbed-down, and forced in this one.  The stuff that the Oracle says isn't slick anymore (""Werewolves""??  C'mon).  It's as if all the supporting actors simply mimic each other's (and mostly Morpheus') deep thoughts.  And there are *seriously* corny lines that shouldn't have gotten past the quality inspectors-- all at key points of action, all of which accentuate Keanu's wooden acting.The original movie has ""replay value"" and still remains good.  This one I really, REALLY wanted to like, but it's getting dated already.  Lucas might have tried it and flushed Star Wars down the drain with the prequels (As of this writing, I can't imagine how Episode III could possibly salvage the series.), but the Wachowskis can't try to sneak a franchise this smart/pseudo-intellectual with poor plot/dialogue development.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels ever!,"After paying the 9 dollars for the special sneak preview ticket and waiting in line for over an hour, I have to say that this movie was so worth it. Furthermore, it relieved my fears that it might not have lived up to its extraordinary predecessor since it was, afterall, a hard act to follow, but Matrix: Reloaded follows through very very nicely.First off, the action.  Mother of mercy, there are some spectacular fight scenes!  They will have you picking your jaw off of the ground one minute, laughing another, and becoming awe struck once again.  There are three in particular:  a high speed car chase that redefines any other car chase ever made, a well choreographed fight in and around two staircases featuring some cool medieval weapons and of course, my favorite, the 'Burly Brawl' as the filmmakers call it; Neo fighting 100 Agent Smiths hand to hand.  Awesome to say the least...or should I say, ""Woah...""?Then there are the speeches, which I found to be very interesting. Reloaded gives you the same occasional lines that totally screw with your mind in the best way possible and of course, a lot of explanation into the realm of The Matrix.  There, in fact, is a lot of talk, probably a full hour's worth total if you listened, back to back, all of the verbose speeches given by Morpheus and company...I found these parts very interesting, but, I can see how others may find them boring.  There are so many loose ends left untied, it literally makes your mouth water in anticipation of the grand finale, Revolutions.Keep in mind, this, like many trilogies, is the middle trilogy that continues the first one, but leaves more loose ends to be tied.  There will be a lot of story thrown at you in the 2 and a half hour time frame, so you have to pay attention.  I will definitely see this movie again in the weeks ahead just to get a clearer perspective of all of the twists and turns shown in the movie because they run aplenty.  This one wasn't better than the first one, it was different.  The first one, though in my opinion, is still a better movie overall, it dealt with the birth and awakening of Neo. This one deals with the life of the post-death Neo coping with his new responsibilities and searching everywhere to find his purpose...it is a ravenous desire, and it takes Neo to the edges of The Matrix and back.  It has a slightly different look and feel to it, which I thought was a great way to keep the mind blowing special effects from the first one away from becoming a 'been there, done that'-athon.  I, personally loved it.The Matrix was one of the few movies I have ever given a 10, and rightfully so.  It was a breath of fresh air that literally came out of nowhere, and hooked an entire generation of people to a new breed of movie.  Reloaded is a worthy sequel that does its predecessor justice, and even far surpasses it on some areas.  To me though, what it lacked was the impending feeling of desperation and mystery that the first movie wore on its sleeves.  Like I said though, this is afterall, a totally different movie, and even if it followed the original's formula to a 'T' it would have been very boring and too predictable.  The story is a tad confusing at parts, but so was the first one, and also on that note, I would like to say I've learned my lesson a long time ago, to not judge a confusing movie without watching it at least twice.  Based on my first impression, though, this movie rocks.  It is an incredible summer thrill ride that is a worth successor to the 1999 hit. 9/10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Amazing!! Almost as good as the first,"This movie is an adequate sequel, it doesn't quite live up to the original(what sequels do?) what it does is give you a ground-breaking exercise in mind bending, out of this world adventure and special effects. It's a layered and very well made Sci-Fi epic that can very well be a good sequel but saying it surpasses the earth smattering, ground breaking original is a little out of this world. Oh wait! That's exactly what these films are.The Matrix: Reloaded is exceptional well crafted and blended Science fiction adventure it brings more to the table this time than the first one and with a bigger and more grand style it serves up course after course of mind bending twists, out of this world action and more ground breaking special effects than the first film. This movie is not as philosophical as which is something that made the first so enjoyable ad good, instead Reloaded somewhat discards of the preachy moments of the first film and focuses more on the action and the thrills, which is good and all but that sometimes does not make a movie. No what made this series great was it's dark under tones and malicious story between deceit and truth and the line that sometimes that can get blurred along the way. But is Reloaded a bad movie? No way! Is it a good sequel to the The Matrix? Most definitely. Doe sit live up to the first? Heck yeah!! SO what is it that makes a great movie? Well if you've seen The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded than you've seen great film making on a rare and near-grand scale. It bust off the screen in an almost three dimensional style that can't be match or copied for that matter, The Matrix: Reloaded blew all the competition away at the 2003 box office and set a new standard for movie sequel excellence and the way it should be done. It's powerful and brilliant and an ingenious machine that ticks along, slowly counting down the minutes to the end. But honestly if your watching this film will you even care about time? Or anything around you for that matter? No you'll be too caught up in the extravagance and mind boggling splendor of this movie.Keanu Reeves turns in an adequate performance in this sequel to his super star making role in the first film. He brings more to the table than the first time around and makes the movie oh so much more better than if he wasn't in it. Carrie-Anne Moss was the only let down in this film in the first she was fantastic in this she was dragging herself just trying to keep up with Reeves and Fishburne, Fishburne was also a little stale in this film he doesn't give off the same fascination and vibe that made it so great in the first. But none the less Fishburne holds his own and comes out on top, Hugo Weaving(who I know have great respect for) keeps the same power and intensity that he had in the first film and he raises the bar in this one and goes all in with all two billion of him bring the fight to NEO's doorstep.It's a wild and insanely fun ride that can't be missed or ignored, it's great fun for anyone with a heart for complex stories and mind bending plot twist. This film delivers more and more each time you watch it and each time you feel differently. It's a great film with a great vibe with amazing eye opening special effects. Its great for anyone in the mood for a good time then look no further than the Matrix: Reloaded it'd your guide to wild, insane and out of this world fun.

"Action and Confusion, Diminishing returns","With the first movie being as excellent as it is, the sequels had really big boots to fill. The first matrix was original (kind of, there were predecessors with similar ideas), it was ground breaking and revolutionary. I think it is pretty safe to say it was iconic. It had an open ending, and I think it should have remained that way.I might be wrong, but the sequels don't feel like they were counted on from the start. It is a different feeling when you plan to make a trilogy or you make one successful movie and stick two follow-ups onto it. This feels as the later, and the sequels are diminishing in returns. While the plot of the first movie is in essence pretty understandable with nerdy programmer stuff sprinkled in there for us geeks, the sequels double down on the geeky stuff and action.The plot of the sequel is about saving Zion from an immediate threat of a robot army. It is highly advisable to watch the Final Flight of Osiris from The Animatrix, to better keep up with the characters, though it is not essential or necessary. The plotline inside the Matrix is basically a fetchquest with the goal to somehow save Zion as well, and there is a Smith Situation on top of that.No-one will fault you if you can't quite keep up. I have seen the trilogy multiple times, am somewhat of a geek, an engineer familiar with programming (though not a programmer by trade) and I am not entirely sure that I understand it completely. The sequels dive really deep into philosophical waters at times with way too much expository dialogue that requires multiple rewatches to fully grasp. These parts are a determent to entertainment and do not stick with you as much as the messages of the first movie did. To balance this, there is the action which is excellent, though not really better than the first film. As a kid, I just used to watch the Burly Brawl and then the whole sequence since they get the Keymaker towards the end of the highway chase. You have some fighting with weapons, shootouts, highway chase including on a motorcycle. Very entertaining stuff.Let me get back to the object of interest of the sequels, it being Zion. Personally, I don't like it very much and for the small runtime it gets it should have been left for the third movie and better developed. It had the potential to be an another memorable Sci-Fi set piece but what do we get? Everybody wearing dirty rags, a council of diverse characters we learn nothing about and a cringy cave-rave. While the look and feel of the first movie was groundbreaking, the look and feel of the sequel is rather disappointing. Thanks to the entertaining action I rate it as an average sci-fi which is a shame considering what came before. In fact, I'm going to give the first movie full marks if I already haven't done so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Rabbit Hole is deeper than you thought!,"It is amazing how many bad ratings and comments you hear of this movie. But it is obvious why. Everybody who saw ""The Matrix"", was so excited because it was a big surprise, but most important there were no expectations of that first movie. Everybody who saw ""The Matrix"" expected ""Reloaded"" to be so much better and so incredible that they forgot to think realistic of this movie. So it should have been obvious that it was impossible to top the first movie, but it was possible to hang on it somehow. Gaeta's Visual Effects are again incredible and amazing, they are definitely better than in the first one. Neo is doing things that are unbelievable, but somehow normal because he's ""The One"", and ""The One"", the anomaly of the Matrix, is able to do anything in the Matrix. Smith is back, and he is not any longer an agent of the Matrix, there is a mystic connection between him and Neo, that you will know when you see the third part of the trilogy. Trinity would give anything for Neo and Morpheus is just as cool and strong as in the first part. The Machines are digging. There is no time to breathe while watching the movie. Watch the Animatrix and play Enter The Matrix to get some background knowledge, and it is important to see ""Reloaded"" several times to understand it and to see the details, that made me love the movie just as I did the first one. It is a great instalment of the Matrix cult. Free your mind and you will love it. 10 out of 10 rating points. Like I said, no time for breathe while watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A somewhat entertaining mess visually and plot- wise,"After The Matrix become a huge hit, won many technical Oscars, and started the entire ""bullet- time"" idea that so many movies would copy, a sequel was inevitable. Along the way, many little hints and clues and rumors were spread all around and when every new trailer was released for the movie everyone had to see it. But what happened to The Matrix Reloaded doesn't have to happen to every sequel. Quite a bit of people will say the point of number 2 in the trilogy is to set- up things for number 3 so it's pointless to complain about plot gaps. That's not always the case. For example, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom didn't quite set up for The Last Crusade. A lot of weight rests on the shoulders of sequels: they have to a) entertain b) be as good as the first one or even better c) have better effects then the first one and d) be able to stand- out alone. The Matrix Reloaded briefly entertains with it's edgy and kinetic action sequences such as the twenty or so minute long Highway Chase, but sometimes the action feels a bit stretched. For example, when Neo was fighting off the 100 Agent Smiths (something that has been advertised about the movie just about everywhere), why couldn't he have just flown away in the first place? In The Matrix all the action sequences made sense, they connected with the story, and they just made you go ""Wow"".  In terms of characters and character development, there isn't anything improved on from number one. Things get worse. It seems that Keanu Reeves is now totally concerned with flying around and getting into fights with people, and he just says his lines with no real intensity. Lawrence Fishburne tries to be a leader- like figure with his ""uplifting"" speech to Zion which he delivered terribley. The rest of the cast is fine, except for Hugo Weaving who seems to be there just to complicate things. With so many flaws, how can this movie not be bad? Well, there is an occasional perfect balance of story- line and action, and things get very suspenseful and dramatic. The action sequences are quite amazing, and the special effects are dazzling. Yes, The Matrix is of better then this sequel, and yes things are left open quite a bit for The Matrix Revolutions. Oh and the Zion scenes weren't very good. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The sequel to a modern masterpiece,"I thought the first ""Matrix""-movie was excellent and awaited parts 2 and 3 with great anticipation. And for what? ""Matrix Reloaded"" is completely pointless. It's probably supposed to be the bridge between parts 1 & 3, but come on. It's only an excuse to pack a 2,5 hour movie with special effects, fighting scenes and action. Did the team behind this time-waster have too much money and not enough ideas, perhaps? I absolutely think so. Not only that, but this joke of a sequel is extremely annoying and monotonous too. To quote the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, it's ""just talking loud and saying nothing"". It's a poor excuse for a movie, and those responsible should have known better, done better and tried harder. Shame on you.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Re-diculous,"I recently watched Reloaded again, thinking that maybe I missed some important detail that would give the film a whole new meaning and expand upon the myth created in the original film - but no, it's still just a mess.The film itself is devoid of what made the Matrix so much fun to see. Everything feels synthetic and artificial. The sets feel very much like sets, and the over-use of CGI doesn't help either. It's amazing that the effects actually can get worse with a bigger budget and better technology. The actors look tired and bored, the exception being Weaving's deliciously deranged Agent Smith, who is the only one that manages to liven up things in between the endless talk, talk, talk ... Why they felt the need to throw in about a dozen new characters not to care about, is a mystery to me.The only redeeming features are the Burly Brawl (unrealistic, yet so spaced out I couldn't help liking it), and parts of the car chase sequence.After the initial viewing, I checked the Internet for theories as to what was going on. Of course, there were a thousand different takes on the film, all claiming to have found a message somewhere in it. Well, I still think it's a pile of rubbish. Reloaded still doesn't make an iota of sense considering everything that happened in the first Matrix. Whether the Wachowskis just got lucky with the first part of their ""trilogy"", or if the studio wisely managed to delete the worst parts - I don't know. I do know that Reloaded is nothing more than a money-making machine, disguised as a movie with an important philosophical/religious message (read mumbo-jumbo).By cleverly throwing in a barrage of existential references, the WB's make sure that people can have their own theory about what is happening. There is no right or wrong, simply because there is no real story here. The only evident message is see the film, watch the nine animated shorts, play the video game, visit our website, bow down in front of Mammon, and then you'll know what it is all about.

"Were we spoilt with ""The Matrix""? A ""must see"" all the same ...","This is more of a comment on the experience of seeing the first two Matrix films, with some critical commentary.My comment is, has Neo had an impact on the geek? I saw ""Matrix Reloaded"" (MR) at midnight on the night it first opened, just after watching ""The Matrix"" in the same cinema immediately beforehand.I've seen ""The Matrix"" (TM) four times now, and each time I derive something new out of it. In fact, it took until the third viewing to understand most of the fundamental concepts of the film. It is definitely a film that one can become immersed in - one that has a pace that doesn't slow down - the tempo just keeps rising. Leaving the cinema after seeing Neo step out of the phone booth, put his glasses on and slip off - you catch yourself thinking that we really are all in the Matrix - it is all around us. To accept that wanting to live in real world instead of the Matrix is something Morpheus and Co aspire to, is a spin out in itself.So, coming out of the ""reasonably filled"" cinema from seeing TM, I encountered a sea of guys. These guys would traditionally be the sweaty geeks - the type that have no regard for their personal appearance. The ""Trekkies"", who, when gathered in a cinema, put out a collective BO that is unpleasant, yet somehow reassuring to experience (it lets you know that there still are geeks in this world).But, for the MR, the sea of guys - literally hundreds of them, all had that Neo cool. Well dressed, many on mobile phones, not too stinky. I'd estimate that 2 - 5 per cent of the viewing audience was female.This was my reason for going to the first public screening of MR - to not only see the film, but to be part of the experience of seeing it with a kind of brethren. I was reassured that I assimilated with these cool geeks more than your ""I don't get out and mix with normal people too much"" kind of geek.So, what did I think about the film? I came out of it a little disappointed. Now, all of you who have seen TM more than 30 times and are probably, as I type, watching MR for the fifth time since its release 36 hours ago, will probably blindly declare that I am a heathen.MR just didn't have the impact of the first film. Some of the most exciting parts of TM were grasping the concepts, watching the stunning visual effects, seeing the story develop and increase tempo, relating to Neo and his troubles with the world. Witnessing the slow motion, normal speed and ramping of fighting scenes, shooting scenes, the warping of the image. All of that stuff. Importantly of all, watching Sydney, Australia as the vital backdrop to this amazing movie. Like New Yorkers having pride that their home town is the key to films like ""Spiderman"", Aussies feel the same way about this film - even if I am from Melbourne! (FYI, there is a great Melbourne / Sydney rivalry between people who live in their respective city, but as Australians showcasing our country to the world on films like this, we proudly put those issues aside).Now, going into MR, we expect all of those visual effects. You almost become complacent, which is a terrible thing. I had to remind myself, ""Hey, Neo is being attacked by 5 Agent Smiths!"" And a few minutes later, ""Knucklehead, Neo is being attacked by 100 plus Agent Smiths! That is a very impressive effect!"" All of the Agent Smiths attacking Neo seemed so real, it didn't seem to be an effect - that is something truly impressive.As a sign note, I would bet Hugo Weaving, who is an unassuming Australian actor, must get a huge kick out of playing this sort of role and seeing himself projected on the screen in that manner.Similarly, watching the much talked about freeway action was truly amazing. The way all of the characters ducked and weaved through traffic, even travelling again it, without any hesitation, was a sign of the strength and conviction that Neo, Morpheus  and Co have in each other and cause. The quote from Morpheus, ""What if tomorrow the war could be over ... isn't that worth dying for?"" is shown off throughout the film.But, most of Neo's powers are now assumed. He can stop bullets, he is a great martial arts fighter - we've had that established in the previous film now, and that's part of what's missing in MR. Still, there were times when Neo showed new skills - ""Neo's doing his Superman thing again"" - his flying skills were put to great use, both visually and for the story, towards the climax of the film.Aside from the opening scenes of the film, the first half hour of MR, the tempo was slow, almost falling into melodrama. I wouldn't have raised an eyebrow if the cinema collective had of yelled out ""Finally, some action!!"" as the tempo started to wind up. The opening screen, Trinity's mission, was truly impressive and made me think, ""if the start is like this, we're in for a hell of a ride!"" As you know, a common film technique is to flash forward at the start of the film, to something that is significant at the end. I made a note of this when watching Trinity in action.Then the pace slowed down. We saw Zion, we established that Neo has cult status among his people. We saw the political processes at work in Zion. A necessary evil to establish this background story? Perhaps. But get me back to the action that the Matrix is all about, please!So, ultimately, I think fans of TM will not be disappointed by MR. We were just spoilt too much with the brilliance of TM on a number of levels - story, visuals, concepts - a lot of things that MR would find difficulty to top. Having said that, MR is obvious a ""must see"" for all fans of TM. It all concludes in just 6 short months!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
In need of a trim.,"While well choreographed and well designed, Reloaded has many elements that should have been cut.  The first half hour is a good example.  Bad acting is pretty rampant, and characters that were hyped make disappointingly brief appearances.  To me, the film doesn't feel like it stands on its own. Instead, it feels like a stopgap between The Matrix and Revolutions. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding Sequel,"Wow! The action/fight scenes are epic. I could literally not look away. Props to the fight choreographers, stunt coordinators and everybody involved.

I'm not saying the first one was anything less than amazing though. I definitely recommend watching this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A positive review of the Matrix Reloaded.,"I have yet to read a review of the Matrix Reloaded that I felt fully did it justice. So I decided to write it myself.First up, most people will be interested in the special effects and fight scenes. Well if you thought that the effects in the original Matrix were good, prepare to be blown away. Without wanting to spoil the plot for you, I'll just say that the bullet time effects, especially on the Freeway scene are astounding. The fights this time around have more people on screen at once than before. The fights are fast and furious, with more of an edge than before. (There is a pun in there, but you would have to see the movie to get it.)The story this time around is comprehensible. That's because all the tricky confusing stuff has already been done in the first movie. The plot gets built upon and the story of the Matrix and its world is furthered. As it is a trilogy there are some questions that remain unanswered at the moment. If you go in a group you will get an er.. lively discussion regarding what's going to happen next.I felt that there was a bit more emotion to the characters this time around and that the acting was flawless.Not only that but this time there are a few comic one liners that are really funny.Some people have dismissed a lot of the plot and story as psycho babble, but I disagree. You either think it is great or you don't. And you can't decide that until you see it.This is the closest thing I have seen to a perfect movie. I loved it, and I went in thinking that there is no way a sequel could better the original. But it did. It is most definitely worth going to see, don't wait for the DVD, because the big screen just gives it extra oomph. The movie oozes style, and like all good movies, the guys leave the cinema thinking that they too have the same abilities. Which leads to more comic moments in the car park.Overall 10/10.P.S. Stay in until the end of the credits to see the Matrix Revolutions trailer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A good sequel,"After the events from the first movie, Neo is confronted with a war of monumental proportions. His ""real life"" city, Zion, is under attack by a huge number of drills and sentinels, leaving him short time to react. In the meantime, his old nemesis, Agent Smith, freed from the system, begins multiplying at a very fast rate, threatening the chosen one and his crew all over The Matrix.This sequel brings a new conflict to the world of the first film, and along with it, numerous fighting scenes, more and more complex and, of course, awesome in slow motion. Unfortunately, the story isn't as brilliant as the first ones, compensating though through drama and action. It is still a very good movie, which is to be continued in the last reenactment, leaving some suspense along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Talk, talk, talk... Fight, fight, fight!","Ok it's a good movie, very high concept, and of course it had to be to compete with the original. However this movie underlines the fact that it's very hard to top yourself when you set the bar so high in the first place. It's a little ironic that the very guys who set the new standard for action/sci-fi movies are themselves now victims of that very standard.First I'll address some of the concerns I have read in other peoples reviews, then I'll add a few concerns of my own;The big one people seem to have a hard time with is the dancing scene near the beginning of the movie. It seems that most Matrix viewers are comfortable with narrative symbolism but are completely unable to comprehend visual symbolism. The dance scene is symbolic of why humans will always triumph over the machines, it's because we have that joy, that 'rubbing up against each other' that machines don't have and never can have. The dance scene was a symbolic reference to the human spirit, but I guess that concept is a bit subtle considering most of the audience was waiting for buildings to blow up.So I have no problem with that scene, it made perfect sense to me and humanized the movie a little.The other scene people either loved or hated was the Neo vs. 100 Smiths. I have a problem with that scene too but not the problem most other people had with it. My problem is that in the first Matrix, he was able to destroy agents by flying into them and 'absorbing' them or whatever. Why then in this movie does he just keep fruitlessly hitting them over and over with no real results? I can tell you exactly why, because the film makers thought it would look cool to have Neo fighting 100 Smiths, and they decided style was more important than continuity or coming up with a better idea.A better scene would have had Neo destroy all the smiths rather than having hit continually hit them over and over with increasingly big sticks, and then finally retreating. The final scene would have been Neo surrounded by dead Smiths, and would have been cooler than him running away.My second problem with that scene is connected to another fight Neo has a little later after they free the keymaker, Neo has to fight 6 guys who don't seems to be anywhere near as powerful as Smith is. Even though he has only 6 guys to fight instead of 100, it takes him forever to kill them. Why was he able to beat off 100 Smiths without too much trouble, but these 6 guys kept him busy for what seemed like an hour?A better scene would have been for Neo to beat them incredibly fast, solidifying the concept that he is the most powerful thing in the Matrix. This scene diminished his perceived power greatly and for no good reason.I do sympathize with the writers of this movie, they made Neo a little too powerful at the end of the first Matrix, thus leaving themselves little room to move with the character in this movie. Evidence of that can be seen in the tricks they used to keep Neo out of scenes where he simply would have been to powerful, like when he found himself suddenly 500 miles from the battle that was happening on the freeway.These writing tactics are similar to what they have done for years in the Justice League comics, its hard to present any threat to a team where Superman is more powerful than all the other hero's in the group put together. The writers often resort to temporarily de-powering Superman or they conveniently get him out of the way for a while so the other characters have something to do till he can get back to save the day. Both of these things happened to Neo in Matrix Reloaded. The de-powered version of Neo shows up at the end where he destroys 3 squids outside the Matrix. He is so powerful inside the Matrix that I suspect the next movie will happen mostly outside the Matrix where Neo still has some power, but nowhere near as much.I really liked the symbiotic relationship between the machines and Zion. They created a flawed program to fit flawed humans. The flaws in the program always leads to some people escaping and forming a city, and eventually leads to an anomaly like Neo who signals to the machines when the cycle is ending and its time to destroy Zion and start again.It's an elegant solution to the flaw built into the system they made. But it's an ironic plot twist that I think most people missed, again maybe in a movie that is so visually stupefying, narrative subtlety is lost on the viewers.The fact that Neo chose not to continue the cycle is interesting, but again I think that was lost on most of the viewers who were waiting for the next visual feast. Just like the Oracle kept telling him, its about choices, his choice was to continue the cycle or risk everyone's life on a gamble.I guess this movie is an example of how you cannot have your cake and eat it too, when you have that much eye candy on the screen it becomes impossible to get any kind of deeper meaning across to the viewer. I think the impact of the story would have been more dramatic if the visuals had been toned down just a little. But the film makers had themselves boxed into a corner, they simply had to do both. Make it a bigger story and bigger special effects as well. I think they would have been better off topping one or the other, but not both.No rating, it's a good movie, just not an easy one to watch, like staring into the sun too long. I was relieved I did not have to suffer anymore visual dynamite at the end of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Almost Surpasses The First,"Keanu Reeves is back as Neo, the only one who can end the machine war. Again, I was enthralled by the Matrix. We meet the Architect, the creator of the Matrix. We meet Niobe, a fairly uninteresting character played by Jada Pinkett Smith. We meet The Merovingian and Persephone, the cruel Frenchman and his wife. We meet the Keymaker, the one that Neo needs to find to unlock the secret of the Matrix. We meet the Twins, the henchmen of the Merovingian. We meet Link, the replacement for Tank. A bunch of new people come into the series, and not many of them are that interesting. However, I really liked this movie a lot. The story was good, the writing and directing were good, but my favorite element was the progression of the special effects. The special effects were wonderful and the action sequences were wonderful, especially that long-elated battle with the Merovingian's henchmen to take the Keymaker. That freeway chase was absolutely wonderful. I loved this movie, and almost thought it was better than it's predecessor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Aside from the Burly Brawl and the Freeway chase I just didn't care for it that much.,"I know a lot of you liked this movie, but it just wasn't for me.  It just didn't have a good flow like the first one and resembled stop and go traffic for me.  The good parts of this movie though included the fight between Neo and Agent Smith generally referred to as the Burly Brawl.  It was one of the more fun moments in an otherwise too serious film.  Even though some of it was clearly digital I still enjoyed it.  Probably, because Hugo Weaving the actor who portrays Agent Smith seems to be just having fun with the role and isn't as stiff as most of the actors in this movie.  The actor who was the French guy and the gal playing his wife are also rather good in their roles. The freeway chase is just a nice car chase that is exciting to watch even if you hated the rest of the film.  Unfortunately these scenes may make up 20 or so minutes of the film.  The rest of the movie is poorly paced and just rather dull and anticlimactic for me.  The first 45 minutes or so aren't really worth watching at all, as it is very talky and dry.  There is also a very bad dance sequence and sex scene between Neo and Trinity, which isn't very appealing to look at.  Carrie Anne Moss just isn't attractive to me and at times I have a hard time distinguishing between her and Neo during that scene.  Quite frankly, I would rather get it on with Rebecca Romaijn Stamos in full Mystique makeup.  Keanu Reeves seems more tense in this movie, like the directors wanted him to do a flawless job.  In the first one he seemed to be having fun.  Fishburne also does a worse job.  All his lines are philosophic...I mean can't the guy talk normally every now and then. Yoda even takes a break now and again, but no matter what the circumstance Morpheus (Fishburne's character) always says something philosophical and he says it very slow.  Jada Pinkett Smith is in this one...sort of.  She adds nothing to the movie, but I here she is very featured in the video game. This is kind of stupid, as a person shouldn't have to do homework before seeing the movie.  Apparently, you have to watch those animated movies and play the game to totally understand all that is happening in the flick.  You should be able to go to a film though and just enjoy.  All in all I give this movie a 4, because of those two scenes I really enjoyed.  I won't insult anyone who liked this movie, but like I said it isn't for me.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
No heart,"Hollywood has spent so much money on their latest offering that there probably isn't a sofa in La La Land that hasn't been checked for loose change. With film fans being left with dry mouths since the conclusion of the first film this sequel was as hotly anticipated as the next instalment of a Star Wars movie, only without the annoying Ewoks. The idea of the Matrix is, if you remember, that the world as we know it is just a computer simulation, and our heroes Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus must fight to overthrow the machines that are taking over the earth. Now there is a new battle as the city of Zion, where the remaining enlightened people of earth inhabit, is under threat, and armies of sentinels (don't ask) are burying through the planet with mass destruction being their primary goal. But before you know it, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus mount a defence while fitting in some nifty kung fu fighting that even Bruce Lee would have raised an eyebrow at. Among those fighting Neo and Co is Agent Smith, who plagues Neo like a swarm of wasps at a picnic, the trouble is you never know which one to swot. This is because Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is now one of hundreds, and his fight scenes with Neo provide some of the best moments of the film, as they exchange fists and one-liners with equal relish. However, one does beg the question as to why Neo doesn't simply fly off, as his new ability to fly everywhere would make it easier to avoid getting punched, a risky thing to happen, especially as Neo's sunglasses look particularly pricey. Among all the fighting and soul searching Neo finds time to meet the Oracle who informs him he'll have to find the Source, but for that he'll need the help of the Keymaker, a funny little fellow who reminded me of the character of Penfold caught up in a episode of Danger Mouse (albeit one with a slightly larger budget) And so before long there is more action than you could shake your popcorn at, in particular an incredible fight on a highway with characters jumping from truck to truck in jaw dropping style. And so is this film worthy of all the money and fevered attention? The answer is yes and no. The film works fabulously on the level on which it is being sold, that of an incredible computer game with Keanu Reeves as the main player. Reeves, along with Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss are brilliant, as is Hugo Weaving, although their characters are not strongly enough written for you to worry for the hero's safety, the whole MTV feel of the film suggesting it maybe wouldn't be cool to do so. This is a film that has more money spent on it than the national debt but is also one that has no heart (although your own heart will beat so fast that you probably won't notice) And so this is where the film's weakness lies, this being that if you look past it's glittering surface you might just find it rather empty, a film much like the Matrix itself, something that gives the illusion of being one thing while being entirely another.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An unfortunate let down after all of the hype,"After the massive amounts of hype that The Matrix Reloaded had created, and the fact that I was a pretty big fan of the original movie I couldn't help but find myself disappointed by the sequel.  I will not dispute that the special effects were great, but as opposed to what the directors must have thought, they are not a substitution to other vital elements of a movie. The plot and many of the plot twists had the makings of a great movie, but I felt like the effects were at times over doing it and were just being used to show what they could do.  In addition there are some continuity problems with the movie.  It also seems that much of the movie is run like a freshman philosophy class, and instead of trying to teach you subtly, at every turn the issues are banged into your skull.  There are only so many times I need to hear them talk about free will and choice...Anyway, if you're just looking for a fun time, you can see it, but the original was definitely more enjoyable, and more thought out.

"Short, sweet.","Entertaining. No better & no worse than the first one. Only negatives are:1) Long fight scenes for no particular reason (though technically brilliant) aren't that exciting. Especially when they are 90% digital effects.2) Used properly digital effects are a great tool. However letting them dominate a movie (Star Wars: Attack Of The Snores) takes away any sort of edge-of-your-seat excitement and jaw-dropping disbelief that old-style effect movies like Indiana Jones gave us the first time we watched them in a cinema.3) I didn't get the architect. Oh I'm sure the message he had was well meaning and is probably highly important to the context of the storyline, but the movie came to a dead stop for what seemed like a very long time for that particular scene and destroyed the pace.4) Nice to see that tho they might have lost dominion over the planet they still haven't lost the ability to hold Raves. Why they hold one in the face of almost certain death, I've no idea.First Matrix had some holes as well. Still enjoyed it tho. Even tho this sequel has possibly the greatest car chase piece in the history of motion pictures right now, the good/bad thing about digital effects are that with the time, talent and money something like that isn't really that difficult.

Deserves more respect...,"On first viewing, i thought that 'The Matrix Reloaded' was excellent , a superior sequel to an already impressive movie.

Unsatisfying,"Technically dazzling sequel is about half as much fun as the original even though it looks to have twice the budget.  The effects and production values are first rate--Matrix Reloaded shows what can be done if you have a seemingly unlimited budget and the best special effects and martial arts people at your disposal--but I left this one feeling less than satisfied, to say the least, and based upon the boos and catcalls in the theater where I saw the film at an opening day matinee, I can safely say that I wasn't alone.  Matrix Reloaded gets off to a very slow start in its scenes in Zion, recalling the worst snoozefest elements of George Lucas' recent Star Wars films (does anyone but the most obsessive fanboy give a crap about politics in Zion?)  Film begins to right itself once the cast finally leaves Zion and goes back into the Matrix.  While several of the set pieces are impressive, including an imaginatively staged fight between Neo and dozens of Agent Smiths and an intricately choreographed car chase, none of the scenes are truly exciting in the visceral sense where they get your heart pumping and you actually get caught up in what's happening.  Reaction is more detached--like cool, wonder how they did that?  Presumably some of the characters will have bigger parts in the next film--Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith has little to do but replicate himself and engage in martial arts fights with Neo--the audience is given no real clue as to what it is he is actually trying to accomplish; and as for Monica Bellucci's character, if I hadn't read several articles about the film I would have no idea at all what the point of her scene kissing Neo was.  While magazines have played up her character as being a dangerous villain and someone who cannot be lied to because of her powers, there's nothing much to suggest anything like that in this film.  I guess we have to wait for the next one--which is another problem.  While Peter Jackson found dramatically satisfying places in the narrative to end each of his Lord of the Rings films Matrix Reloaded seems to end where it does because they reached the middle in terms of running time--it's like they had a four and a half hour movie and just split it in two.  There were no boos coming from the disappointed audience at the end of the Rings movies, but many people at the theater where I saw Reloaded were positively hostile.  Maybe seeing the next movie will make Reloaded seem more worthwhile, but as it is this one was a bit of a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The fight between Neo and the Smiths is my favorite fight in the whole series.I am a huge fan of massive over-stylized action combat, and RELOADED has it in spades.

"Perhaps one of the worst sequels of all time, despite a few entertaining action sequences.","'The Matrix Reloaded (2003)' is often considered as one of the worst sequels of all time, one that actually almost makes the first film worse unless you ignore its existence completely. The piece seems to demonstrate a total lack of understanding as to what made 'The Matrix (1999)' such a success, and a downright classic, to begin with. It has long stretches of dull, exposition-filled down-time that only serve to give us more time with the picture's lifeless, close to unrecognisable characters and to bombard us with overly complex, somewhat self-aggrandising world-building. A large portion of the piece is dedicated to a bizarre sort of pseudo psychology and school-grade philosophy lessons disguised as science-fiction. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it was entertaining, but it's just a bit boring and almost comes across as pretentious. The affair's saving grace is its action. It's incredibly ambitious and, generally speaking, it's nearly as well-achieved as some of the stuff in its predecessor. The highlight is certainly a memorable, ever-escalating highway chase sequence. Still, a lot of the action isn't all that compelling. It gets a bit too big for its own good, so much so that you no longer believe that the heroes are actually doing the things you're seeing them do. As such, there's never really an appropriate sense of danger. When things get too carried away, the use of intangible, fully CG body doubles remove all sense of plausibility from the piece. Plus, the stakes are mitigated quite a bit by the fact that the lead, after his arc in the prior movie, is essentially an invulnerable superhero when he is plugged in to the matrix, able to do whatever he so desires. In the end, the movie just doesn't have any real impact. It doesn't seem to go anywhere and its few interesting ideas come far too late - and are far too poorly explained - to hold any real weight. It does have some accomplished action and it keeps you relatively engaged for its majority. However, it isn't particularly compelling or exciting. It's a far cry from its predecessor. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A very poor sequel,"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. My review for the original gave 9 out of 10. This sequel would not even get 5.The plot is the problem. What happened to the matrix? It was all but forgotten in the sequel and very well could have been any other action movie. What made the original movie unique was pretty much ignored in the sequel. There was a standard chase sequence which went on way, way too long and had no place in a matrix movie, as far as I'm concerned. And why did they feel the need to throw a romance into it? Not every action movie needs to have a romantic relationship just because there are two single available people in it.I can't complain about the acting - they did the best they could with poor material.The special effects were a little too much for my taste. It fell into the trap other sequels, like ""The Mummy Returns"", have fallen into before - because the first movie is a success, they open up the purse strings and end up putting in a bunch of unnecessary special effects just because they can afford to.I disliked this movie so much, I haven't even bothered to see the third one. I suppose I will sooner or later just to see how the whole things ends, but I'm in no hurry to.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good sequel, with a different tone that makes it a hit","The gang's all here again to battle evil in the ""The Matrix Reloaded"" this time there's different and new characters not seen in the the first. You have Zion, there's Bane, there's the Architect. And my favorites the Oracle, and the Keymaker. The Keymaker was the main player in the movie. Making the keys, and helping out our heroes. The best thing about this movie are those villainous twins who go from solid to intangible during the fight. General Motors played a great deal with their Cadillacs especially the SUV that the twins drove. Too bad that they weren't fire proof. Morpheus was very wicked with the Katana. And that collision scene with the two semis was kinda awesome in a way. Too bad the drivers weren't playing chicken. And fighting off the multiple Smiths is no picnic either, but keeping him from prevailing is a must in order to find peace in both worlds. What I saw in this movie so far that it didn't end like the first one did, to me this was a whole different story. It was heroic for Neo to save is love, he knew he had that power, I wished he would used it more often. 4 out of 5 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

After such a beautifully written script for the original, I expected something as seamless for this one. Now, I enjoyed the movie, but man did it start off slow. I think the first 45 minutes could have been told in 10 and, if it had, I might not have any other complaints.Complaint 1: Diatribes. They were used to explain things in Reloaded where carefully crafted dialogue interwoven with action was used in Matrix.Complaint 2: Too many characters, not enough development. There were so many new characters thrown in the mix, it was confusing. And I know each of these characters were supposed to be rich with history. But they weren't.Complaint 3: I like sexuality when done right. But this wasn't ""sensual, sophisticated Wachowski-bros ala Bound"" sexuality.

The Matrix Still Has You,"The Matrix was a landmark achievement that raised the bar for science fiction films for years to come. The first of its two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded, had huge expectations to live up to, but is everything its predecessor was and more: more visually stunning, more intense, more confusing. After learning that Zion, the last human city on Earth, is on the brink of destruction, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his cohorts, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), dive back into the Matrix searching for a way to save humanity. The story is initially very confusing (and may take multiple viewings to fully comprehend), but is ultimately very deep and satisfying, despite its cliffhanger ending. Reloaded's biggest asset, however, is the special effects that highlight its action sequences, which are absolutely sensational. While sometimes longwinded, The Matrix Reloaded is a spectacular ride that no fan of the original should miss. There's a reason why the Matrix universe has become so popular: it's just plain awesome.9 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It's the question that drives us.,"The thing about the matrix reloaded is that no matter how much you hate it or love it, you just can't stop thinking about its riddles, the amazing special affects, the always splendid fighting choreography and of course the biggest cliffhanger in movie history, which makes me believe that people who come here saying that the movie was boring and that they fell asleep really makes me mad because its all bullsh*t because there is no way anyone can fall asleep when watching the Matrix movies.I truly believe that this was the best movie of the summer, it has a unique form of story telling that has never been assembled in movie history, and the dialogue are very well categorized in terms of philosophical, religious and social resemblance. The movie itself is like a poem and if don't get then your critique is pointless and illogical. The special affects can never be questioned and the chase scene was beyond measure.I like the matrix because it makes me think, there is nothing worse to a moviegoer than to leave the theatre with no recollection of the movie he just saw.

Reloaded does not Reload the awe of The Matrix,"Release Date-May 15th, 2003The Matrix: ReloadedAnticipation Rating- MEDIUMRating- 6.5 OUT OF 10Producer Joel Silver began hyping up this movie, months in advance. He began saying stuff like. ""What the Brothers have done, nobody will be able to duplicate for years to come..."". Then the lame ads came, the less than amazing previews, and the bad pre-buzz of the movie. By the time I actually saw the movie, my push to see it, had gone down to basically zero.I went into the the movie with 3 friends of mine, all of whom enjoyed the first movie. Most of them wanted to see the film more than I did. We ALL came out with the same views...the movie is not that great. It is a HUGE dissapointment. There is nothing really spectacular at all in the movie. Most of the time, it drags, and lags, spitting out corny as hell dialogue, that comes to the point of laughable. Morpheus's speech at Zion, is one of the funiest moments in the whole film. Everyone in the theater was laughing at this scene. The acting is a major low point in the movie. In the original Matrix, we had all of that shady metaphorical dialogue, but for some reason, we bought it in that one. In Reloaded, something has gone horribly wrong with the actors. They lost the touch from the first movie. It just doesn't work here. The plot of the movie, is easier to follow than the first, until a certain point. I actually got the first half. This did not happen in the first. I had to watch the original a couple of times before I fully understood what was going on. The whole Agent Smith plot, the Keyaster or whatever, and the whole Creator of the Matrix thing is just too complicated. I had a huge problem with the Creator scene. You know the actor is telling us something major. But he talks ridiculously fast, and uses massive words, it gets hard to follow. And the ""shock"" ending I heard about, isn't really a shock.The movie isn't a total loss though, the effects are pretty cool, and the action is enough to keep you into the movie. The Hyped 14 minute car chase scene is good, but it's not nearly as revolutionary or massive as people are saying it is. And I have one question: where is the Bullet Time? It's not here that much. They opted to use more slow motion shots. The Bullet Time shot at the end of the car chase scene is incredible. It's my favorite moment in the movie. But why take out something that basically defined the original movie? Why use the slow motion instead? They claim that the effects cost 100 million alone. I;m sure they had plenty of money to do it. Seeing Neo fly in the movie is awsome. Warner Bros. is going to put out the next Superman movie soon. This just makes me want that movie more. And they really abuse the use of CG people. Bottom line, I'm not quite sure they have made a film, that's going to make people want to see the next installment as much as this one. There were BOOS all over the theater when the movie ended. People were calling the film retarded. I think it left a sour taste in the majority of the audiences that saw it. The only thing they have going for it, is the ending is a cliffhanger. People are probably going to want to see how it ends, but Reloaded is nothing spectacular. X2, is still the movie to beat this summer.6.5 OUT OF 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A world that is much more complicated than we were shown,"The first ""Matrix"" made a splash, became a revolution in the world of cinema. Initially hooked on a wild action, a way of storytelling. Cyberpunk, which the directors presented under a new, previously unfamiliar sauce. Only then, people, reviewing their favorite movies from time to time, began to be imbued with mythology. And it turned out that one project cannot show a much larger world, which the heroes told us about. And of course, the luck of the first picture allowed us to give the green light to the sequels. At least, after the finale of the 1999 film, it did not seem that it was needed. But I think the creators wanted to earn more, while expanding the universe of the project, where events take place and show how the world of machines will try to destroy the last city of people.In fact, the beginning of the ""Reboot"" raises a lot of questions and even in some way erases what we were shown at the end of the first film. It seemed clear that there is a Chosen One, he commands the matrix. Acts as it pleases him. But the start of the second picture shows that the Chosen One still needs to learn how to act correctly, to be able to live in the real world, where, it turns out, not so many people believe in the prophecy of the Messiah. Controversial scenes and arguments, they initially stump, but later the viewer is carried away by what is happening on the screen, which slightly leaves aside legitimate questions.Despite the fact that the Wachowskis made a strong bet on special effects in the picture, they do not forget to develop mythology. More and more new characters are introduced into the plot, which are designed to show that the world of machines and the matrix itself are much more diverse and complex than it was shown earlier. Now there are new dangerous villains here, and the ubiquitous agents do not seem to be such a serious threat anymore. Although of course they are also deadly.Neo is worried. Yes, he is gnawing at a new role that he did not ask for. Too many are counting on him, and some even believe that he is the key to the end of the century-old war with machines. Keanu Reeves perfectly conveys the experiences of his hero, who is in constant search of the meaning of his existence. Morpheus seemed to have faded into the background. He acted as a wise mentor in the first film, but here he seemed to have retreated into the shadows. Somehow, his interesting monologues are not even enough. Although, on the other hand, he still showed the main character what the matrix is, fulfilled his mission. Now he's ready to just be around. Trinity and Neo's relationship looks kind of vulgar, in my opinion. You watch the characters, but you understand, either you just don't believe the actors, or their still young relationships are shown this way. They have love, but they still have to work on it.Zion shows us people's lives, reveals the world of the ""Matrix"" even more. It turns out that there are many ships with the same commands as Morpheus, there is a legislative and executive body, a hierarchy. Everyone in this world fulfills their role. The first picture only mentioned all this. Here we see everything with our own eyes.I liked that there are new storylines. For example, with Morpheus' former lover Niobe, who is now with his rival. There is Persephone in the matrix, who was once happy with a Frenchman, and now even claims that he was like Neo. You wonder what if the Chosen One was a negative hero. We could get a completely different story. The final meeting and the Architect's super-clever story seems too long and with an overabundance of abstruse phrases and terms. Wachowski's attempt to show the reasoning of the machine in this way, in my opinion, led many viewers to a dead end. The general meaning was clear, but you watch it with furrowed brows, trying not to lose the thread of the narrator's reasoning, which broadcasts unexpected events and versions of the matrix for the viewer.The visual part of the picture is, of course, the decoration of the ""Reboot"". Excellent battle scenes, decent graphics for that time, a highway chase scene and accompanying music are simply brilliant. From a visual point of view, this movie is much better than the previous one. A great fight with agents, where Master Daniel Bernhard appears, a fight with Seraph, Merovingen's wards in a fight with Neo - all this is already an order of magnitude higher than the final battle of Neo with Agent Smith in the first part. Well, the chase on the highway generally makes you watch the action on the screen with your mouth open. You are especially surprised when you find out later that an entire highway was built for these scenes.The second film about the matrix, for me, is undoubtedly a great movie. There are bright memorable characters, brilliant action scenes, chases and fights. On the other hand, the mythology of the cyberpunk world, as shown by the first film of the franchise, seemed to have gone somewhere to the side. Well, what's missing here is the gloominess of the first film. Many people took this Wachowski film with a chill, scolding for the lack of a clincore of the first project, probably deservedly. But for me, ""Reboot"" has become my favorite series of the trilogy, probably still because of the greater action on the screen. In terms of philosophy, this project loses to the original.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Attn Hollywood Advertisers...,"Next time, please, please restrain yourselves.Is there anybody out there who didn't know this movie was coming out? Is there anybody who didn't have a suspicion that there might be some cool action in it?I ask these questions but, of course, I already know the answers.My point is, why is there this constant need for studios to give away so much of their films in their media blitzing. With one or two small exceptions, I had seen virtually every action scene in this film weeks before it came out. All I got in the theater was each scene, I'd seen earlier, but longer.If memory serves, the first film was advertised very mysteriously. I recall a woman in tight black latex floating, frozen in space, about to deliver a kick as the camera flew around her. I recall a man moving so quickly he was a blur as another man tried to shoot him. I recall what appeared to be a menacing robotic squid. I recall Laurence Fishburn's  powerful voice over all these strange visuals talking about something called ""The Matrix"". I was hooked. I knew nothing about this film but I had to see it. I was not disappointed. Virtually everything about the film was amazing and fresh.Four years later, the ads start running for the next installment. I see some amazing things in the new ads. I can't wait to go to the theater to see what I haven't been shown. I movie arrives and I rush to see it. Sadly, I was very disappointed. Virtually everything about the film gave me a sense of deja vu with the exception of the last half hour (which, for a while, I was sure I was watching the preview of the third film as the editing seemed extremely disjointed and haphazard). Don't get me wrong, what's on the screen is ultra-cool for the most part; but believe me, you've already seen most of the action in the commercials before you even step into the theater. (I fear the ads for the film ""Hulk"" are doing the same thing.)I've no comments about the plot at this point as I've basically only seen half of the story. However, before I end, I'll add one last comment; just as I feel shanked when I see a singer lip-syncing during a otherwise live performance, I feel equally reamed when, during an otherwise amazing fight scene, actors are suddenly and obviously replaced by fully computer generated animated characters. It's disappointing when it happens other films of the genre, and it was even more disappointing when it happened in this movie since I assumed, wrongly, that all the wire-work that is really martial-art ballet in the Matrix films would be ""live"".

But it's the story of all kind of movies, the first one is the better and the sequels aren't good enough, with some exceptions of course. Matrix Reloaded is a good movie, but it fails in the way they presented. Some action scenes are out of place, and some scenes are dull and boring. But another scenes were amazing and mind-blowing.

Reloaded was dull & incoherent,"Reloaded pretended to be smart and philosophical by over-dressing it with obscure references to ""choice"" and ""destiny"" (oh the clichés), but ultimately there was no thought put into the writing. Even the fight scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as the setup and execution lacked any tension.  The plot had no cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. I found myself trying hard to like the film but failing miserably. Despite the number of effects, they were very ho-hum as if I was watching a FX reel and many of the best effects had already been revealed in the preview trailer.

The movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter (shorten the fight scenes and the ""mosh pit""), and the story would have been much tighter and it would have moved along at a better pace. As well, I was left wondering how Neo ever got back to the ship - did he just appear? Never once do we see him use the old fashioned telephone technique. One is left assuming that he has suddenly acquired/honed a number of wonderful new skills. Finally, I have a real peeve that the the movie was simply designed to introduce the final installment.

Simply the best movie trilogy ever,"Ok i have heard enough of this Matrix bashing since the beginning. Now, most people would have said that a Matrix basher would not get the story or something. But now people have become more wise about the story from the first Matrix movie. But people still don't get the flair of this trilogy. It isn't just some MACHINES REVOLTING AND TAKING OVER THE WORLD ploy like so many other movies. There is more meaning and psychology to this trilogy than any other science fiction movie ever. I don't know the reason why people compare this beautiful trilogy to Star Wars. I just thought Star Wars was a copy of Star Trek and was boring to me. ""LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER"" must have been the only worthwhile dialogue in the whole StarWars legacy. The Matrix is already being hailed as the best science-fiction, fantasy movie trilogy ever. I have watched Lord of the Rings and I have absolutely no reason why it's any good. The only part I must have liked in their whole trilogy is the first scene in the first movie when they show how the Ring has been passed down generations. Back to the Matrix. The philosophies are clearly very complex and mindbending. The Wachowskis definitely have a vision and they must have read many books to get this knowledge. Even though the first movie was stupendously mindblowing and a very deep storyline so did the second movie. The story might look very weak but actually it is quite strong. It is a progressive story instead of the hard hitting story for the first movie. The brothers intelligently made the second movie to follow on from such a classic that it didn't even feel like a repeat of the effects and action sequences. Clearly, the freeway chase scene blew me away. And I don't know what people have against cgi being used in the 100 agent fight but i thought it was stunning. The fighting choreography must have taken years to get right cause it was crazy to do. Poor Neo, had to do all those moves. Other movies you can clearly identify cgi stuff but in the matrix movies you just can't. The ZION city looks ultra cool and the sentinels look as creepy as ever. One thing though, the Architect speech was a very spectacular twist. I don;t know how the Architect memorized all that beautiful ranting about anomalies and human errors but it was very jaw dropping. The brothers seemed to write every detail into that speech and made it very involving. Now I love cgi only if it's nice so I loved when Neo burst out of the room and broke everything in his way. Fire explosions from the building, glasses shattering. Cars smashing and flying. The cinematography was very good. The fight scenes didn't just look like actors doing moves and the camera moving in one way. The camera was going in all angles and directions. The zooming of buildings as Neo is flying to save Morpheus. Oh yeah and the monumental scene in which Trinity falls. The brothers tried to show this scene like in the first movie when she runs from the agent. Very awesome scene. And did anyone notice how door numbers played an ultra huge role in both movies. I won't go in detail about which door did what and what were the consequences. There's still a lot of philosophy going on about the Architect's speech. Simply put the BEST SEQUEL for a movie in the longest of times and obviously the BEST MOVIE TRILOGY EVER!!!! 2003 IS THE YEAR OF THE MATRIX.

I'm sure that if given enough time to fully work out a coherent story that furthers the story of the first film, and expands on the CGI effects, the two subsequent films RELOADED, and REVOLUTIONS could have been something AWESOME.As it is.....they're not. Enough time's passed since these film were released to look at them NOT through rose-tinted specs, and be honest in critiquing them.One film franchise to compare the MATRIX trilogy with is the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Both of these film-trilogy's had similar backgrounds to work with - a large cast that was needed (for the most part) to be available for an extended filming period, and complicated stories that - while they all link together, should also be able to hold up independently. They both involved creating largely artificial worlds for their stories. These films also were made in the same part of the decade, but where one succeeds, the others falls apart. As I said - I'm speaking with that wonderful ability; HIND-SIGHT.The 2 MATRIX follow-ups continue the 1st film's story (yes, everyone's familiar with it; humanity lost a war with the machines, they're kept alive for their use of 'energy' the machines need, and some humans - realising that the world's an illusion, try to fight back).Alfred Hitchcock explained that he used a 'macguffin' to propel his stories - that is, something everyone watching the film THINKS is the MAIN point of the story, but it's really just a ruse for what's REALLY going on.I bring Hitchcock up because the latter-2 MATRIX films contain so many 'macguffins - so much padding, that if this 'fat' was trimmed off, what would be left COULDN'T sustain the 3 films, but COULD (maybe) sustain 1 LONG, or 2 films.A prime example of this padding is the infamous extended 'rave' sequence in this film. A scene that goes on far too long, and (honestly) doesn't move the story ahead. It's the film equivalent of being given a 1000-word paper to write, and after finding your short by a lot, starting to add MORE adjectives, repeating these pointless adjectives (e.g.; Mount Everest is a very, very, very, VERY tall mountain...').And where the first MATRIX film's use of 'bullet-time' caused many jaws to drop, there is no radically new/different effect in the succeeding 2 films use of CGI. I know that there are going to be many who take offence at what I'm saying - missing the whole, deep 'meaning,' but I'm NOT discussing the MESSAGE, I'm discussing HOW that message was DELIVERED.It also seems that by the time they film makers got around to making REVOLUTIONS and RELOADED, the box office on the first film being as big as it was, decided to 'amp-up' the product placements' - the eye wear especially.Many critics have said how this film is a good film for Keanu Reeves' (limited) emotional range. It's sad, but, even Keanu seems like he's wading in muck. It's cartoon acting to an extreme, and when all is said and done, both RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS will NOT be remembered as much as the first film will be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Wachowski brothers fall for the typical sequel trap,"Well, the special effects are fantastic. Stop there. This film lacks the 'oomph' and wow factor the original had- its script is less inspiring, the characters seem flatter and of course it has keanu reeves acting- which seems flatter since the first film. True its a very watchable film- and i must admit the 100-agent fight in the backalleys was one of the greatest i've ever seen, but those expecting a film along the lines of the Matrix will be dissappointed. The brothers have concentrated way too much on memorable explosions, fist fights and set pieces and not enough on interesting scriptwriting, something which made the first film stand out. To be fair, the first film had the advantage that it was an original idea- we'd heard it all before by the second film and there was no significant revelations to be made. Nevertheless, it held together and despite the atrocious dancing scene (10 minutes of idiots jumping up and down), the film picked up towards the end. Lets hope it continues improving for the final installment in November, and that the Wachowski brothers realised the truth for this film... There is no script.Jas",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Hard to judge since it's only half a movie.,"Let's get this out in the open: Reloaded is half of a movie.  If you want resolution, conclusion, or catharsis, you'll have to wait for the third film.Keeping in mind that this is only half a film, the biggest problem with Reloaded is the editing.  The fight scenes drag on far too long.  The dialog drags.  Everything drags.  There was easily 20 minutes of footage that could have been removed.  The rave/sex scene should have been cut in half. Better editing would have gone a *long* way to improving this film.Reloaded's story lacks the coherence of The Matrix.  The plot lines that tie the action sequences together are not nearly so strong.  Or maybe the bad editing made them hard to pick up on.Despite all of this, Reloaded is fun.  It has more of The Matrix's action, with some fun enhancements.  The kung fu scenes are really good, just too long.  The new characters are somewhat interesting and do bring some complexity to the screen.  The dialog in the last half of the movie is interesting, but most will find it hard to follow.Reloaded is not The Matrix.  The lack of resolution can be forgiven (but Revolutions damn well better wrap things up), the story isn't as compelling, and the editing is bad.  But it's still a decent film and worth watching.Let's hope that The Brothers do the right thing and let a real editor do a pass over Revolutions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Too Loaded,"Matrix Reloaded is more of the same as The Matrix, but...The Matrix Reloaded story is set 6 months after we last saw Neo, Morpheus and Trinity. Neo and Trinity are deeply in love now. There is an imminent danger that the machines will soon invade the human safe haven of Zion. The leaders of Zion do not have the same view on the best way to handle the machine invasion of Zion. The story flips between the reality of Zion and the matrix world. Luckily for the citizens of Zion, Neo's powers are now a mix of Dr Strange and Superman.Visually it is spectacular and another great job done. The story telling is a bit harder to follow than first Matrix film. The fight scenes and car chase scenes in Matrix Reloaded are awesome, but become overkill, and I found myself thinking please just finish the scene.Matrix Reloaded is worth watching particularly if you like Sci-Fi or The Matrix concept.

The Matrix Reloaded: 6/10,"Stop the presses! Keanu Reeves has set a new record for himself-he actually goes through an entire movie without saying the word `whoa'. That is what you'll be saying throughout the movie, although the non-extreme scenes will leave you confused and bored.Neo, our hero from The Matrix, is back again, along with Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar floating through the real world (to understand what I'm saying, check out my Matrix review). This time, he somehow has to save the last human city of Zion before the machines destroy it. Also, he's in love with Trinity. Follow that?Put simply, The Matrix Reloaded is X2 for an older crowd. They're both sequels made just for money from a movie that may have been original and grossed in between $100 and $200 million. They both offer more action, often ridiculous, have more convoluted plots, and include more and unnecessary characters. But it isn't all bad.This is a special FX movie, and you can't expect anything more. There are some great fight scenes, with awesome moves. As filmcritic.com's Christopher Null states, `This is a movie about kicking ass.' And there is a lot of that going on. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) clones himself, causing Neo to fight thousands of the same person. The opening credits were neat, but were worthless since the only thing it said was `The Matrix Reloaded'.On the flip side, there isn't really any meaning to it all. Characters come and go, like the albino twins who can transport, or that guy who cuts his own hands. Also, many points seemed to be like `Rocky and Bullwinkle', when luck-of-the-draw things happen. Although this movie played out `fate', it just seemed like everything `just happened'. I didn't really like the whole destiny, cause-and-effect thing, it just didn't work.Reeves, as Neo, does his usual one-note `tough-action guy' persona which he's had ever since the Bill and Ted movies. Face it, Keanu, you aren't that good of an actor. Laurence Fishburn, as Morpheus, is good at these types of roles. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, is one of my favorite actresses, and I've been waiting for her to be nude in a movie since 2000's Memento, and I heard that she was in this movie, but I was misled. Weaving is definitely typecast as Agent Smith.The Wachowski Brothers, the directors and writers, decide to change the many action scenes. Martial arts can be enjoyable and funny (hey, even `I know kung-fu' was funny in the first one), as evidenced in Jackie Chan movies, but here they overdo it. Most of the fight scenes didn't impress me; it was just the same OVER and OVER again. They also looked obvious. It was shot individually-Keanu with one, Hugo in others, and just spliced together. $100+ million budget? Didn't look like it. It's basically a cliché or parody of what the first one was.It all boils down to this: if you loved the first one, you'll love this one. If you liked the first one, you'll think this one is OK.My rating: 6/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and some sexuality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The real world is dull.,"The strongest of the sequel films, this builds on the mythology of the original and the plot develops in interesting ways. Its strengths lie in developing the world of the Matrix itself, as Neo looks to understand his role and issues of fate and free will are again front and centre. The film also continues to develop the action that the original was known for, culminating with a sustained action sequence that moves across different locations and takes in fights, chases and gun battles that are brilliantly choreographed and edited. It's a shame then that for all the positives of developing the world of the Matrix, the less said about the world of Zion and the ""real"" world the better. It is here where the film's pacing becomes problematic and the characters introduced are barely realized and largely uninteresting. Plot beats in this world are rushed and it becomes difficult to care about anyone outside the core trio of Trinity, Neo and Morpheus. It's a flaw that becomes even more problematic in the next film, but here with the focus on the Matrix itself, these flaws don't quite negate the films strengths.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Get Me An Exit!,"* ½ (1½ out of 5)The Matrix ReloadedDirected by: The Wachowski Brothers, 2003This movie has been getting a bad rap and I have to join in. I wasn't that much of a fan of the original either (a 2½ rating, so imagine my solitude when everyone was raving madly about it in 1999).Keanu Reeves was poor in The Matrix. He's a really, really bad actor and the whole concept of the Matrix itself was not only dumb, it lacked simple logic and at best entertained like disarming nonsense. For a sci-fi freak like myself the basic idea was technically charming but the structure and themes were wafer-thin. Guns? Fistfights? Black leather? Suits? Too stylized, too nerdy, folks. You can tell it was written by nerds, for nerds, an ""action-utopia"" or ""perfect computer game enviroment."" To my knowledge and if I tune my future-goggles right here, hey, machines would never build something like the Matrix. On the contrary: Why cater to humans? They're all drugged and locked down anyway.But back to Matrix Reloaded. The things that worked in the first one and that I liked - the atmosphere, the larger-than-life feel on a decent budget and the impressive still-motion wire stunts (that already back then got overdone) - are missing here. Well, the 'feel' of them are. This is just the Wachowski brothers with more money. Huge fights and huge chases but no excitement. It's soulless, it's heartless. Keanu is even worse than in previous outings - yes, it's actually possible - because here he has to tackle a romance with first lady Trinity. He delivers lines so bad, so wooden, they made me laugh. Funny also, because Carrie-Anne Moss is both cool, charming and sexy but she's just kissing and staring into the face of this bland neanderthal. Sad stuff.The fights in Reloaded are way over the top. More of the same to begin with. Punch. Block. Kick. Punch. Jump. Kick. Say what? Why? Read Harry Knowles' review for more. He's completely on the money. We've seen it all before and it's idiotic. So just shoot the damn gun, alright? Oh wait, Neo can block bullets now. So why can't he block kicks and punches with a ""mindwall"" like he can bullets? Ah, the logic.Agent Smith is back for no other reason then.. well, he's back. The public wanted him. Pretty obvious. So how to bring him back from the dead.. How about we make him a computer virus? Nice one, we'll buy that, but the thrill is lacking despite Hugo Weaving's characteristic spoken drawl and sleek meanness. Furthermore, Smith manages to turn up at two pivotal junctions in the story, just after Neo has delivered crucial dialogue to either The Oracle or Morpheus. How does he do that? The third installment, Revolutions, might shed a light on that, fanboys, but it's writing based on audience reactions, not vice-versa now. Contrived populism that destroys whatever shards of integrity the original had.The grand fight scene that got all the trailer buzz - the many, many Agent Smiths against a lone Neo - made me speechless. Because I didn't care. Been there, done that. Neo will win. There is no intensity, no drama, just a retread of effects from the first one and juiced up. Then when the brawl escalated into a computer game (completely computer generated) I had to look away. I went into the kitchen and made some coffee, contemplating on how few moviemakers today have actually realized how CGI just isn't good enough yet. They want us to think so, but it's not. Talk about denial.Later on, a freeway chase has logistics to die for. The Wachowskis actually built 1.4 mile of freeway just south of San Francisco to make this scene. That's moxy, considering how everyone else would just CGI-y it. I was psyched when this scene began hence it was maybe the kick in the face Reloaded needed. But it just doesn't resonate. I must direct people's attention to other recent movies: in Spielberg's Minority Report (that is even more CGI-drenched in its chase scenes) we cared because the story and storytelling was so good. In Terminator 3 - lesser all around to the two before it, but not as bad as we could have feared - the firetruck scene is gawking simply because there's a focus on the nitty-gritty basics of the action and struggles itself, real steel and glass, real automobiles burning rubber and colliding. In Matrix Reloaded the whole freeway slam-bam scene feels like a computer game. You know how you just always floor your car, pedal to the metal, when you play a computer game because you just don't care? It's all speed and velocity? Same thing here. Trinity, Neo and Morpheus whiz in and out of traffic, chased by agents and bad guys and there's just no tension whatsoever.That scene is a full-on free shot. That hits like a powder-puff.Same can be said for the movie as a whole. I didn't even get to the underworld of Zion, the long pandering neo-classical religious and philosophical speeches or the two new henchmen, The Albino Twins, who - when they morph into spirits - reminded me of the effects in Poltergeist (22 years ago).Matrix Reloaded is bad. A disappointment even for moderate fans of the first one. The program doesn't just need patches, it requires a real upgrade. Somebody call Bill Gates.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Incredible!,"This movie was astonishing.  The movie actually starts out somewhat slow but then it just keeps getting better and better.  Towards the end the story gets really complex and you're just dying to know what happens next.

The emperor's old clothes,"'The Matrix' was the surprise hit of 1999, blowing away the much hyped 'Star Wars: the Phantom Menace' by using similarly elaborate special effects, but with much fresher purpose. The acclaim that the film's extraordinary visuals generated, however, appeared to blind many to the movie's inherent unoriginality. The grungy-cool aesthetic and cod-philosophy, for example, are de rigeur in the sci-fi genre: while the ""you can be anything you want to"" message and the endless violence were pure Hollywood. The theme of computers turning on their masters dates back to at least '2001', while even the idea of a film where life is a video game seems less than striking when in real life, video games are turned into films! But when two sequels came out, there was a fierce negative reaction. In the absence of a similar visual advance over the first film to that which the first film had been over all preceding movies, the flaws were revealed to all, and both movies were badly slated. In truth, while the original was hardly as ground-breaking as its fans would have you believe, 'The Matrix Reloaded' (film two in the cycle) is not nearly as bad as its critics would make out. It's a highly polished piece of hokum, just as the fist film was, and generally, very entertaining except in the interminable fight scenes (which are spectacular, but sadly as engrossing as watching someone else on a Playstation). The second film in a series of three is always going to be the hardest to make work as a stand-alone entity (which perhaps explains why film three was released so quickly after it); but I think the Wachowski brothers have made a pretty decent fist of it. This is still a stylish movie, and an enjoyable one as well, as long as the original didn't fool you into expecting anything too profound.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The stop-action action scenes were cool, so Reloaded features two interminably long action scenes that got rather tiresome.  The hacker stuff was cool, so how about a Freudian monologue about Neo's true purpose from the matrix's architect?  Add to that an out of place sex scene and Neo's unexplained power in the real world, and you've got a mess.  A very long mess.If they shortened the action scenes, moved the architect's monologue up in the film, and then had Neo struggle with the concept of free will, Reloaded could have been much better.

Denial is the most predictable of all human responses,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!!**queue intro music**Tonight's movie flick is The Matrix Reloaded (2003), the sci-fi sequel to the phenomenon The Matrix (1999). Obviously after the success of the original Matrix, the head honchos of Warners gave a large amount of cash to the Wachowski's and asked for more and guess what? That's exactly what they did, with this new entry in the world of Matrix, the mainstream film goers finally got what they just wanted to see - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus back in action and for that, boy did the film deliver.The Matrix Reloaded starts with Trinity riding a motorcycle into a building guard shack, then being chased by an agent around inside the building before jumping out of a skyscraper window where we get to see bullet-time aka slow-mo treatment of Trinity firing her pistols as she falls. In the middle of the flick, we get to see Neo take on a vast array of replicated Smiths where we get to see non stop martial arts action which is heavily influenced by Japanese Anime and old school Hong Kong action flicks. We also get to see an underground cave city of Zion and the wild rave parties that take place there, which begins to turn into a pulsating orgy. We see Neo and Trinity escape to a bedroom where they have sex to the tempo of the wildly beating drums. Glimpses of rear and side nudity accompany their movements where barely-clothed bodies sway and leap, rub and thrust as the torch-lit mob gives themselves to the tribal stomp- style rhythms.The movie has a number of complicated dialogue and monologues from new and current characters that end up making you feel confused of what they have said and trying to keep up with the rules of this wonderful universe. The film does allow viewers to go deeper into the rabbit hole, but this is the first time as a movie enthusiast that I felt uncertain about where this hole was heading. The explanation of the universe is over complicated such as rogue programmers, yet the story overall is simple, an army of sentinels is set to invade Zion and kill the remaining rebel humans.The story however isn't as appealing to the original. To be honest this story feels like you are playing a video game, which isn't bad. At each stage, heroes fight off attackers in order to finish that level and proceed to the next one. First, Neo must reach the Oracle. She tells him to find the Key Maker and get the key that opens a secret door. To secure the Key Maker, Neo must get through the Merovingian and his henchmen. To reach the secret door, the rebel Zion crew must disable the security alarms...or it's game over.The acting suffers from the same problems as the plot - it is all too heavy and this can be demonstrated with a key character Morpheus (played by the great Laurence Fishburne) who in the original played a very dynamic character - from waking Neo up to The Matrix, talking like a prophet and having a mix of playful wit and serious touches when they were needed. In this sequel, his character seems to be mistaken that he is playing a political leader for example him speaking to the crowds at Zion before the rave party. Even his fight scenes, in the first film his face-off with Smith you could see the vulnerability however in this film he is more like a rock and less fun and mentoring.New characters such as Persephone who bares quite a bit of cleavage and her partner the programmer Merovingian both feel unimportant in this film. Why bring in a character who can manipulate the Matrix code in a way that compels a woman to give him oral pleasures and provide them satisfaction when eating a desert? The transparent twins also were wasted in this film.Overall, it was always going to be hard to follow up the first film. There are reversal call backs to the original where you saw Trinity bringing Neo back to life with a kiss in the first film. In this sequel it is Neo who returns the favour by resuscitating Trinity by reaching inside her digitized body and ""healing"" the computer code that's been disrupted by a bullet. Did you get that? Yeh complicated right? The epic car chase is awesome where we see fight scenes that do not involve Neo, we see Morpheus kicking butt and Trinity driving through a highway where we see enough vehicles crashing and burning to make the creators of The Fast and the Furious drool with envy. However the overall plot loses its simple touch by diving too deep into the computer language world. One thing that the movie didn't squander was upping the ante with fetish style leather costumes. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Too much of not enough,"In our first opportunity to revisit The Matrix we have arrived at a time when freeing people from the Matrix has apparently become Neo's (and others) full time job. It turns out there are several ships that cruise around ""freeing"" people. But now Zion is being threatened with destruction by the machines and there are two approaches being considered for repelling their attack: 1) fight them face-to-face and defend Zion in the real world or 2) send in ""the One"" to destroy the Matrix from the inside.That's it, that is all there is to the plot. The bottom line is that the story has been sold out to the special effects, and those weren't even as good as the first movie. There are several times when the special effects are completely computerized and in fact look like a computer video game. For comparisons sake the Star Wars prequel graphics are far superior. There is no substitute for actors (LOTR being the only possible exception).The script was apparently so focused on the fight scenes and special effects that it basically forgets it's self. There are several sub stories that arise but are never developed, explained or addressed with any satisfaction. Link's wife is mad at him for working on the Nebekenezer (but it is hard to tell), Neo and Trinity are in love (but didn't we all know that already? was a 5 minute ""love"" scene really necessary?), some kid who Neo apparently saved is following him around (why should we care at all about this kid, Neo doesn't? and who the HELL is he?), Morpheus and Niobe used to have a thing I guess (but again it is hard to tell), There are a couple of ""ghost twins"" that are quite powerful (but who are they, where did they come from, and how come there is not more concern for the damage they can do?) and so on and so forth. By developing just a couple of these lines (or limiting the love angle) there could have been much more support for the main story. Instead they end up just being the frayed edges of an unraveling rope.Keanu's style of acting (if you can call it that) no longer fits here. It was perfect in the first movie, but it fails here, Neo almost appears to be board with being ""The One"".I guess I have to go see Revolutions in the fall, just to see what happens. But unless Revolutions somehow salvages the end of the story, I will consider the story to have ended with the first one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Dazzling, but Disappointing","The history of brilliant sequels is not long and illustrious, and unfortunately the Matrix Reloaded fails to buck that trend. First the good bits. This movie contains some of the most jaw-droppingly amazing action sequences I have ever seen. Gladiator showed what live action and computer generation could do if you respect the laws of physics. The Matrix Reloaded shows what you can do if you don't - and in the process it takes George Lucas' Star Wars' prequels outside and gives them a good kicking. My two favourites are the scene when Neo fights a hundred clones of Smith (formerly Agent Smith), and the scene when Neo flies into rescue his friends following a spectacular head-on collision between two trucks.So what's wrong with it? First, the superficial stuff. The Matrix was cool. The blue hue, the soundtrack, the cellphones, the outfits - all just screamed coolness. Reloaded does not live up to that.Second, the characters. In the first film, we barely get to know our characters and we don't care - their superficial but they kick ass. By the end of the second film, we're sorry we have got to know them better, because there ain't much to know. Trinity's only redeeming feature seems to be looking good in pvc; if Neo is the One then he does a damn good job of permanently looking lost and/or dumb; and Morpheus, so promising in the first film, seems just increasingly pompous.Third, the beauty of the first film was the elegant simplicity of its plot. Reloaded has none of that. It is confused and rather pedestrian, brought together partially at the very end but too late to save it. And the final cliffhanger looks like a cop-out for failing to come up with something more dramatic.Finally, Reloaded illustrates the classic film-makers dilemma that necessity is the mother of invention. There was no limit to what the directors could do with this film, and that feels like part of the problem. Zion, for example, such a powerful idea when it is left to the viewers' imagination, is horribly disappointing when depicted in such a cliched fashion (candles and dancing to house music in caves - give me a break).So viewers have a dilemma. You've gotta watch it, for the action sequences alone. But overall, you'll be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I have heard from people I know and reviewers that this movie did not live up to the original.  Let me just say that that is completely FALSE! I never put stuff in all caps.  I swear.  This movie was and is phenomenal. It upped the ante bigtime!  No new special effects?  What?!  Screw the special effects!  Before I say that, I should say that the special effects were amazingly different, but that's not why I am so psyched about this movie (I'll get into special effects later, SOOO second on why this movie is so good).  This chapter introduced a level to the story that smackingly amazing to me.  The first movie was about discovering.  By that I mean Neo discovered what was there.  This movie was about understanding, and about how that perception of understanding leads to a more important concept of what that understanding entails.  I haven't seen the third movie yet.  I will see it tomorrow.  Not important right now.  Right now I am writing not to try to sway the other tens of thousands of reviewers, but because I had to, I figured IMDB.com was the best place to tell as many people as I could why I loved this movie.  Damn, I'm gonna be long-winded... oh well.So at the end of the first one, Neo accepts that he has a role to play. I'm not gonna get into why that one was great, lots of people thought it was (perhaps for technical/mass-appeal reasons rather than philosophical ones, but whatever).  Reloaded was not a sequel, it was a continuation - difference being that it was not the same story in a different setting, it is the next step.  There is obviously a lot that happened between the first movie and Reloaded.  Maybe Animatrix or the video game filled that in, but I haven't experienced either.  Still, work had been done, and they are at a turning point, which involves the survival of Zion, but I'm not gonna get into how or why, just in case anybody with enough time to read this hasn't seen the movie yet.  Anyway, the story evolves, as some might have heard, with the notions of love and choice and causality.  There are old characters in the same light as the last film, old characters cast in a new light, and new characters with a new light altogether.  The story evolves, that is what is important. And the significance of this evolution is what makes this movie so great.Technically speaking, some people wanted another Bullet-time-like advance in the special effects.  There was, though the obviousness might not have been as visually different from the first movie from its predecessors.  There are scenes here that have never been done before, just as the bullet-time wasn't done before, only more subtle in that the effects don't involve a visual change (i.e. characters on a screen), but a technological one (i.e. what those characters are and can do).  So difficult, but perhaps easy to underappreciate. Rest assured, try to compare the technical aspects of the movie, and you will be hard pressed to find an equal.While watching this movie, either for the first time or again, think about the evolution in skills and in opponents.  Both have risen in scope and intensity.  In the story, think also about scope and intensity - both have increased significantly.  Face value is nice, really nice, but the beauty lies beyond.  If you don't see it, this review may not help you to.  But rest assured, it is there.  The question is always more important than the answer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"not enough Zen, overblown, too much camp/kitsch",a big head on the part of the brothers led them to make some very poor judgments. let's hope for redemption in #3.

Fixes the flaws of the first film and makes a damn sight more sense,"I didn't like the Matrix. It was entertaining and loud and visually brilliant, but it's plot was meaningless. It seemed vacuous in its reliance on 'fate' and 'destiny'. All the reviewers loved it though. They decided all that fate and destiny was intelligent.The Matrix Reloaded I LOVE. Adore. Worship. It is genius. We see Morpheus not as the Obi-Wan po-faced mystic as in the first film, but Morpheus the blinkered, egocentric new-ager unable to see reality. Elements of the Matrix itself that were seen as unexplainable mysticism in the first (because the first film is filtered through Morpheus) are now explained and the concept suddenly seems intelligent to me where it didn't before.But I'm an IT geek; a nerd with a toehold on the subject that the Wachowski's here provide brilliant and entertaining metaphor for. The plethora of negative reviews for this film complain it is MORE mystical and up its arse than the first; that there is far LESS plot than the first. Such fat, balding middle aged cretins should not be allowed to review this film, because they are unable to see that it has far MORE plot than the first; the subtleties of the IT characterisations here made the geek in me laugh out loud. Negative reviewers listen too closely to Morpheus - yes he spouts gibberish mysticism, THAT'S THE POINT DULLARDS. He's a mad man.There is plenty to entertain here. The action sequences truly are like nothing seen before, even if the larger fight sequences are a little too 'animated'. The film could well do without the ridiculous post watershed music video sequence in Zion (you'll know it when you see it), but you'll have forgotten that by the time you reach the end and the final twist in the machine humanity battle leaves you eager to learn what new evolution this series will lead to. The first film was gamers. The second film is hackers. The geek army can't wait for what the third will bring.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix Has You...,"I got to see the Matrix Reloaded on Saturday. I will discuss this the best I can without spoiling anything. Let me start with the basics.I thought the sound, cinematography, and CG effects were outstanding. Note: I hated the visual effects in Spiderman. This was much better.I also found the plot to be very good. I loved the twist realization Neo made at the end of the film.The script I felt was adequate. The scenes were done in traditional fashion  Some action, some romance, etc. I feel that the directors could have gone more out on a limb and made a truly dark twisting introspective film, but they chose to make an action movie.I felt the acting was moderate. You could make an argument that there isn't much to the characters, but I feel that Keanu Reeves could have performed the emotional torment Neo is going through with how many treat him as being the One much better than what he did. He should remember what it felt like to have his puppy dog run over by a car when he was a kid and shed some real tears on screen. I felt that Carrie-Anne Moss brought some real emotional content to Trinity. Again, I am impressed with her a second time. Morpheus' speech at the temple was done really well. Good job Laurence Fishburne. Its the only ACTING they let you actually do in these films, and it was awesome. I think by far though, the best performance in the film was Lambert Wilson as the Merovingian. Just outstanding.I have two things to say about the script that might contradict each other. First I would like to say that I liked how the movie didn't hold your hand from scene to scene trying to explain everything. You had to really pay attention to understand who was who and what was going on, and yes, it all did make scene. I do dislike though that they put so much emphasis on their mumbo-jumbo philosophy. This movie should not, in any way, be looked at as a great work of philosophy. Most everything was cut and pasted from real intellectually accepted philosophers. I feel that anyone who walks around and says, `Oh yeah man, Matrix Reloaded is so awesome. Its such a philosophical movie,' is just really impressed with big confusing words.Overall, I was thoroughly entertained by the film, loved the ending, really want to see the next one, and would some day own a box set of the three films. What more can I say about it.Patrick",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
victim of its own success?,"The original Matrix was stylish, fresh, and ended. Really, it ended there. This sequel should never have been made, it's just effects fodder. PJ's review takes the words right out of my mouth, ditto Highlander. The prophetic death scene of Trinity's was the high point, and could have been an emotional challenge to span the sequel and the threequel but it seemed to have just got wasted. The story, appears to get itself into too many twists and convolutions to remember where it is or what was it's point and has that making-it-up-as-it-goes-along feel.

Offically the Greatest Film Ever,"When I sat down the watch Reloaded, i was expecting a sequel, but instead i was given the greatest movie ever made. It's better than the lack luster matrix 1 and, the almost as good, matrix 3. This movie holds great action around a wonderfully scripted scenes. This movie sets out to pull the rug from under your feet making you have a different look on its predecessor.

"Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are back for more martial arts and Matrix style action.","Home Songs Poetry Reviews Links Pics Downloads Forum GuestbookThe Matrix ReloadedRating: RStarring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo WeavingSo, if you haven't already seen the first Matrix, you should obviously watch it before you watch this one. That being said, I'm going to write this review on the assumption that you've all seen the first one, you know that Neo is the one, blabada blee, bleebadee bloo.The movie opens with an interesting sequence where Trinity (Moss) rides a motorcycle off a building and jumps off before it crashes into a security building. Next part of the sequence, she jumps out the window of a skyscraper with an agent right behind her, the cool matrix bullet time effects kick in, and eventually Trinity gets shot and crashes into a car on the ground. Then Neo (Reeves) wakes up.He's been having this dream before, or at least dreams like it, and oddly enough, it's starting to get him a little bit jumpy. Morheus (Fishburne) believes the end of the war with the machines is coming, and of course that Neo will bring about this end. He takes his ship home but orders one other ship to remain outside of Zion and stay in the matrix so that the Oracle can contact them.Zion is an interesting looking city, and despite its rough unfurnished exterior, it still appears to have a homie feel about it. Everybody gets a little R and R, Neo and Trinity get their freak on, and then it's back out into the real world.When Neo goes to see the Oracle, something interesting happens when he's done talking to her. Agent Smith (Weaving) comes to see him. But how? Wasn't he killed in the first movie? Apparently Smith refused to die, and now he has the ability to copy himself on anybody in the matrix, so there are hundreds of thousands of Smith clones running about, looking for Neo.Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity all pay the Merovingian a visit to try to get the keymaker from him. They need the keymaker so they can get inside the source, which is where they believe Neo can do his thing and turn the tables on the war with the machines.I predicted before I ever watched this movie that it would be like the original Star Wars movies. First one is a stand alone that could have sequels, and at the end of the second, there are tons of loose threads that need to be tied up, meaning there has to be a third movie. I won't say what all the loose threads are. You'll just have to see it yourself. Overall, this movie is a solid action movie with some great martial arts sequences, not to mention the infamous highway chase scene.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth watching)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Certainly has its Moments but Nowhere near as Enjoyable as the First,","The Matrix Reloaded is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a good cast.I was certainly disappointed by this movie as I was really looking forward to seeing the continuing adventures of Neo and his crew,and it was not even close to the entertainment the first one was,but the movie still definitely has its moments.There are still several action packed scenes,but there weren't as much as the first and they didn't feel as unique as they use to,which was a big problem with this movie,for me anyway.Keanu Reeves still delivers a great performance,I've given out about his acting in the past,and I still think he's a lifeless and uninspired actor,but he suits Neo so much and he continues to prove that in this movie,and of course Laurence Fishburne delivers another excellent performance as Morpheus.The Matrix Reloaded is certainly a disappointing sequel but I would still recommend it to fans of the first,and the ending with definitely make you anxious to see the third.Neo assumes commands of his powers as Zion falls under siege to the Machine Army.Only 72 hours separate the last human enslave from Sentinels programmed to destroy mankindBest Performance: Laurence Fishburne Worst Performance: Jada Pinkett Smith",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
similar to real life problems,"I am satisfied. This all reminds me of real life problems like fears, enemies, states of consciousness, worries, lack of space and resources, wars, protests...

long.........,"watched it last night.several points that need to be brought up. - too long. some of the battle scenes especially were unnecessarily tedious and long. - too long to get to ending, and then the ending was too short and abrupt. - some of the characters were unnecessary. esp the stupid keymaker and the maker of matrix. - that leads to another point. some of the dialogue was silly and some of it was too long winding. jeez, i don't want to hear another lecture.i felt that the movie was flawed. and hopefully this will be fixed up in revolutions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
My take on the matrix trilogy,"Here's my take on the matrix trilogy I have been trying to write this up for 12 years ever since I saw reloaded and revolutions, but its taken this long to figure out what really the matrix is. The director imagined a world with artificial intelligence. The machine world is not dated, so we have no idea if this is likely to be in the 21st century or 25th century. No one knows. They then wanted to create a movie based on their knowledge of the Vedas and created a set of characters based on Greek mythology and Hindu philosophy. The main theme of this movie is Humans Vs. Machines. They imagined that one day machines would be at a distinct advantage and that humans would be struggling to protect their planet. They also included numerous references to religion. Their idea in my opinion came from watching world war movies. They knew that world war 3 would not be nuclear, so in their imagination they created Sentinels. I have absolutely no idea how they thought of a human as a computer program and virtual reality. Ingenious, no doubt. They created the story well from Matrix v1. In v1, it was just about action and dodging bullets – no one would have understood anything but Hollywood fans would have wanted to watch v2. I think the brothers knew V2 and V3 had planned them before V1. Conceptually, the movie is about philosophy and psychology. The main theme is love. But why do they include references to religion (no Hinduism), was it deliberate to get the inquisitive audience. Were they trying to reach an audience who can think at a higher plane or was it just that they wanted to confuse everything and make a movie about love. There are numerous references to Zion, the holy land between Israel and Palestine. Did the brothers forget that the origin of life is from the Ocean. There are also many quotes from the bible, and many references to Buddhism. In my opinion, Buddha was a genius – Buddha re created what was already present in Vedas and started his own religion. The highway chases, martial arts and fighting aside the brothers did not imagine anyone to reverse engineer the script to find out the idea behind the matrix. I don't think the brothers wanted anyone to go read the Ramayana or the Mahabaratha, and in my opinion both these texts are fiction and just like the brothers wrote the matrix story, some other genius wrote the story behind these texts. Yes there is proof of a holy land in Sri Lanka but can you show me proof of flying monkeys or there is proof that a war happened at Kurukshetra but can you show me proof of Krishna and estimate the size of the armies. 5 brothers with a common wife against 100 evil brothers seems like a made up story to me. The director of the matrix movie expected his audience to be enthralled by the machine world vs. Humans war. Not by the infinite references to Greek mythology where the character names are derived or the Hindu philosophy of the one. Also the one has a guru in Hinduism, so this is clearly portrayed in the movie. I do not believe that the director of the matrix has read the Hindu texts fully – they just wanted to create a futuristic movie and mix up various subjects mostly mythology, psychology. They also wanted people to become more philosophical after watching the movie, a noble goal for Hollywood producers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great action, rubbish plot","In 1999 an action film known as the Matrix became a surprise hit, written and directed by two unknowns, the Wachowski Brothers, and except for Keanu Reeves, had no major stars. The Matrix became a hit because it was a great action film, but also because it had a great plot and deep message about philosophy and reality (I personally recommend reading 1984 by George Orwell to get an idea about it). The film brought extra fame to Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishborne and Hugo Weaving, all staring in excellent films and the Wachowskis could could any project they wanted. The Wachowskis claimed that the Matrix was always meant to be a trilogy, and after the success of first film, shot The Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions back-to-back, the first time I think it ever been done.Set six months after the first film, the machines were preparing for the invasion of the last human city, Zion, by drilling through the Earth. The commanders of the city are obviously worried about the upcoming battle and plan to have every ship available to fight. But some elements of the human population, mainly people who have been from the Matrix think that humanity's only hope comes from destroy the Matrix, freeing the trapped human and prevent the machines from having a power source. This now seems possible with Neo (Keanu Reeves) being the one. To do this Neo, Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) need to free the Keymarker (Randall Duk Kim) from the exiles, powerful rogue programs that have gone into hiding from the Agents. The Keymarker is the only ally available to the humans who can give them access to the source of the Matrix and thereby the heart of the machines' program. The humans also have to battle a reborn Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is even more powerful then before, with the ability to make copies of himself. The humans has to battle with the agents themselves. But Neo is also suffering, having nightmares of Trinity being killed. He doesn't want her involved in the battle in case she is killed.The best thing about the Matrix Reloaded is the action scenes, some of the best ever filmed, with excellent martial arts sequence. Particular fights of note are the fight between Neo and Seraph (Collin Chou), the fight between Neo and the Smiths, Neo and the exiles and the Freeway sequence. But that is the only really go thing about the Matrix Reloaded. The plot is confusing and all over the place; even with the philosophical message in the Matrix, it was still pretty easy to follow. They are too many sub-plots and many are left unsolved. There is no focus and a Matrix sequel should have been so much more. The philosophical message of the film is more forced in this film, and it's not easy to believe the message compared to the first film. The message is mostly about fate and choice and the fact machines and humans need each other. I can imagine pretentious people saying I understand this and that means I'm cleaver. You're not, you just think you are clever. The dialogue is at times weak, I excepted better from the film. Also Keanu Reeves shows his talent of being like a tree. At least Fishboure and Weaving are still good.The Matrix Reloaded is not a good film, but the action scene are worthy, just ignore the lack of plot. Avoid The Matrix Revolutions, it is a massive let down.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Continuity?,"Ok, I've mulled it over, talked it over, here's my opinion....The Matrix: Reloaded is sub-par in every department.  It has very little visual continuity withthe original, the story is not as tight, many scenes (the lovescenes in particular) areextremely cliche, some dialogue and acting is absolutely terrible,and the producer / studio /directors (?) gaveway to product placement instead of maintainingartistic integrity.Ok, here it goes...The prodcution design and art direction of the original was incredible. There was a contrastbetween retro technologies (rotary phones, classic cadillacs,etc.) and the themes of theMatrix, the lighting and cinematography was breathtaking, and thespecial effects wereappropriate (and mind boggling).Reloaded retains very little of this.  The suicide-doors caddy gave way to Escalades, CTSs,Audis and Ducattis.  Sleek clean cell phones became chuncky crappyones.Electrodes tookplace of accupuncture.  Scenes were brighter, cleaner and didn't retainthe lighting, color ormood of the original.The special effects, in may cases, were terrible.  In the original instead of resorting tocomplete digital scenes they made the effort to use the actors andcompliment the scene withdigital environments and effects (the way they did this wasrevolutionary).  In Reloaded, manyof the fight scenes were totally digital.  Thedigital body doubles were terrible and took awayfrom the mood and focus.The original had a very tight and original story.  Nothing about the original was cliche.Reloaded's script is filled with holes, eye candy and inconsistency. The story built up aroundan oncoming seige of Zion.  At the end, suddenly the seige wasover??? Why did they spendso much time on the gate scene when Morpheus's ship returned todock if this was notforshadowing something.  What was the deal showing all the machinery andprotection of thegates?  If Zion was not a ""character"" in the movie, these scenesshould have been cut.  Lovescenes were too abrupt, too cliched (i.e. the elevator groping,saving Trinity, etc.).  The scriptgave way to Kung Fu instead of character and story development.  And what's the deal withNeo in the end?  Being able to control the Matrix, which is aprogram, is acceptable, butshooting lightening from his finger-tips and stopping squiddiesbreaks any suspension ofdisbelief.Finally, I was sick of seeing logos (mainly of the cars).  Most people had no idea the blacksedan in the original film was a Cadillac.  Nobody got out of Reloadedwith out seeing theCaddie logo a hundred times, or the Audi logo (the emphasis ofthe shot when the Agentsdrive up), or the Ducatti.Anyway, it was ""ok"", a 3 out of 5 stars, but it definitely is not an academy award winning stunner.I don't know, what do you think, honestly?JAB*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ok, I saw the film a second time and, although I have more respect for the film, I'm holding to my original posting.  The film either flies through long action scenes or looses itself in philosophy.  There are how many 'deep' philosophical scenes?  Neo and the Counselor, Neo and the Oracle, Neo and Smith, the French program... I'm missing a few here.  This is a film, instead of burying us in its philosophy it should show us.  The philosophy should come out in the story.  It can't happen the other way around.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What a tragedy,"I consider the Matrix to be one of the most groundbreaking, breathtaking and simply awesome movies ever made which makes watching the catastrophic holocaust of a movie that is The Matrix Reloaded a very sad experience. Where did it go wrong and why did it go wrong so badly? I am tempted to say that $$$$$$$$ was the primary factor in deciding to make two sequels and those people who maintain that all three movies are part of one film (as in LOTR) are deluding themselves. The pseudo psycho babble dialogue is so confusing that even the actors admitted they didn't understand a lot of it but they reassured us that the Wachowski's had all the answers. Great, but if you don't even understand the question that isn't much help. The opening orgy scene in Zion just makes you think - why on earth would anyone want to save these degenerate ravers? I suddenly and shockingly found myself in agreement with Agent Smith when he said in the original Matrix that humans are the disease or virus and the agents and machines are the cure. By the end of it you got the feeling that even the actors couldn't care less.After watching the abysmal Alien 3, I decided that I would pretend that it never existed and that the brilliant Aliens was in fact how Ripley, Newt and Hicks signed off. Likewise with the Matrix Reloaded, I think I will just forget that I have ever watched this abomination of a movie and regard Agent Smith's demise at the end of the original movie as the best way to remember that incredible film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
computer Neo sucks,"The first Matrix was terrific, but in the sequel they decided to get away from what made the first one work. There are too many computer special effects. The slo-mo effect from the first one was so cool. Here, we get a computer Neo that looks so fake when fighting the many Agent Smiths. It looks like a video game.  And most of the fight scenes were boring. We know Neo can beat the agents, plus he can fly, so why would he stick around to fight a hundred of them. I'll give them credit with parts of the car chase scene mainly because the twins were so cool.  Also, when Trinity is driving the motorcycle against traffic, that was filmed so it was thrilling.But, what makes the sequel fail in comparison to the first one is the story. From the start with follow the white rabbit, the first film had me hooked. Reloaded never held my interest, especially the beginning. The whole rave in the cave was so stupid as well as Morpheus speech. And did they need the sterotypical over zealous captain who thinks he's in charge but really doesn't have the answers.  And where was all the cool stuff with somebody telling them in the Matrix where to turn and what to expect to avoid danger. And why hire a known name, Jada Pinkett Smith, when her character does nothing.FINAL VERDICT: Reloaded lost the magic and entertainment the first film had. It's like different people wrote the scripts and with a bigger budget decided computer effects would make a better film, and they were wrong.  So, if you are a big fan on the Matrix, you may not want to watch this one because it will ruin all the great things about the first one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Spectacular but confusing,"Maybe its just me but did anybody get slightly confused by the whole film? Recalling my experience with 'The Matrix' (I had to watch it twice to understand what was happening), I would say it might be just me...Anyway this film has some more ground breaking effects and death defying stunts, which is perhaps the reason for some of my confusion. Not only does Neo defy death himself several times (fighting over 40 people, dodging bullets etc. etc.) but now he seems to be defying death in others. With the dramatic saviour of Trinity does it not seem like 'The One' has become a God like figure? I appreciate that this may have been the aim but I have no idea where his skills in bringing people back to life (by performing closed-chest heart massage) have come from.Zion had an air of Star Wars about it, I half expected to see Jar Jar Binks at the Council table and indeed this would not have surprised me purely because I hadn't grasped the plot.To be honest this was a slight disappointment given the creativity and originality of 'The Matrix' and I'm left in two minds about whether or not I intend to re-watch it and bother with the sequel later this year.If you're wide awake and have a good attention span then prepare to be amazed by a loaded action thriller. If not then prepare for lots of big fights and fires and car chases. Ooo car chases.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Pretentious Genius, good and bad in one.","Okay don't get me wrong I like the Matrix films. But let's get a few things straight. They didn't invent bullet time, trenchcoats, sunglasses or black shiny outfits. Nor is the concept of Robots rebelling against mankind after being mistreated a new one. Infact it's got to be one of the oldest in sci-fi history.Okay, as I said I liked the films and when you look at what they achieved with what is basically a sack full of action/sci-fi cliques it's pretty damn impressive. This is largely down to the directors vision in putting this together. It's the glue that is important not the individual parts. None of this is really new, but it's what is being done with it that is impressive.The problem I have is people seem to be forgetting this already. Not least of which being hollywood that seems determined to put these elements into every action film they make without regard to wether they work or not. The excessive bullet time works in the matrix where as it definetly doesn't in films set outside of a manipulated reality (like when they used it in a certain bond film). While the Matrix made good on old cliques it's created a whole load of new ones that seem set to be even more overused then the old ones ever were. This is something many people seem to celebrate about the Matrix series but I think people that do that have missed the point.All this stuff with the game and the animatrix is just cross marketing. Nothing more, nothing less and damn it I'm fed up with seeing everyone wearing trenchcoats. I've been wearing them for as long as I can remember and they've come in and out of fashion but since these films there are more people then ever wearing them. Apparently you have to christen a new DVD player with a matrix film, it's ""traditional"" apparently. This seems a bit of a joke to me. Don't forget even good things can be over-rated (I've said for years that as good as the Beatles were they are still one of the most over-rated bands of all time). It's all getting a bit too prententious for my liking and I think people are letting it cloud their judgement.This film wasn't as good as the first film. It was somewhat predictable both in style and plot. But as I said it wasn't the most origional of ideas ever stated. The whole plot could have been something off the twilight zone or the outer limits. The imagery is standard cool-gothic and again nothing overly origional. However it is put together tremendously well and there are a few scenes that really impress.It's not the best series of films of all time, and as individual films I doubt this particular one would likely make it into the top 50 (at least not my top 50). Definetly impressive for the special effects, stunts and the way it is all put together. They really do know how to use CGI, many otherwise excellent directors are clueless when it comes to computer animation so they have shown what can be done. I also don't think it's really that ground breaking either when you think about it. Most of the effects used have been around for years, but it shows what can be done with it all. But it's mostly down to focused minds and a lot of hard work rather then doing anything really new. The scripts not the best ever written, the actors are pretty average (especially Keanu Reaves) and the basic plot elements really are not at all origional.But it's all about vision and this film (and the others in the series) have an abundance of it. It is one of the most visually pleasing films to watch and it's important to remember that while the visual elements such as the long coats aren't origional they weren't in high fashion before the first matrix came out and so were picked because they would work in the film and not because they were trendy.It's just sad it has led to hollywood being overun by the idea that having cliques in the films are more important then the suitibility of them being used. Two of the worst films to be victims of that phenomenom I've seen so far have been that last bond film (with the poor madonna soundtrack) and the film of ""House of the Dead"".

Groundbreaking and exciting,"After watching the matrix I instantly fell in love with the concept and the film but once the release date was made available for part two I couldn't help but get excited and this is not normally a good thing, building a film up in your head 99% of the time will end in disappointment , but this was not the case with reloaded.From start to finish I couldn't take my eyes off the screen the story line is epic, the special effects where even better than the first film and Neros growing powers being demonstrated are what every little boy dreams about.This is a film that sits in my top five of all time and that's something considering how many films I have watched over the years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It was OK,"I think one of the problems with the Matrix Reloaded is the Matrix.  Let me explain.  When we all first saw the Matrix most of us were BLOWN AWAY.  It was awesome!  The special effects and action scenes were something that just wasn't seen in movies.  This raised the bar and subsequently was copied by other movies and even music videos to follow.Now in 2003 we have the Matrix Reloaded, one of the most anticipated sequels in movie history.  We all have such high expectations that we ourselves have made it hard for the sequel to live up to the first.  We were expecting something new, but we got the same thing as the first, we were expecting a lot of action, but Reloaded was more story based.Ultimately the Matrix Reloaded serves but one purpose to further the story started by the first one that will lead up to the conclusion in Revolutions. Thats it.  And because of that it was a let down.  It was too long, too over-hyped, too much video-game like special effects and too much of an attempt to make every scene super cool.Hopefully Revolutions will save the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"More Matrix, but a little underwhelming","I was curious when I heard that there was going to be a second Matrix film. We'd get to see more of Morpheus and the gang. Some of the sets were really cool, like the human city, but the fights were a little overdone in the CGI department. I did like some of them though. Overall, the movie was decent and I don't know if I'll watch it again but the ending led into the third (and supposedly final) chapter of the saga. And now that we're getting another Matrix film, I figured now would be a good time to go back and see what I had missed.Even if this and the third one weren't that great, I'm hoping that the Matrix saga will get its own expanded universe. If Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and all of those other sci-fi movie sagas can get their very own expanded universes, then why not this one?Bottom line: if you liked the first one, stick with it.

Matrixed.,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" continues the long and sometimes very confusing saga of a human race of people trying desperately to reclaim their place on the planet over a group of tyrannical Controllers that run everything in the real reality and the virtual reality worlds. The story picks up several months after its predecessor and Keanu Reeves is having recurring dreams of Carrie-Anne Moss' death. Laurence Fishburne and the two aforementioned players go to Zion (which was talked about the entire first film, but never seen) and we get greater insight to what remains of the human race. It appears that the Controllers (led by Hugo Weaving who has also struck gold in ""The Lord of the Rings"" series) are about to attack Zion within three days and try to eliminate the few humans that remain. Thus the clock is ticking on Reeves and company as they try to stem the tide and possibly end the war for good. Unfortunately the Controllers have gained strength as Weaving is now able to duplicate himself endlessly. Twists and turns aplenty are in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and the only real solution in the end is a bridge to get us to the third entry in the series. The second chapter in the trilogy is a little better than the first (I was not a huge fan of the first film). It widens its scope and it explains a few things that were hard to comprehend in the initial installment. The introduction of several new characters (Jada Pinkett-Smith and the illuminating Monica Belluci in the roles) ends up adding new dimensions that I would have never been able to predict beforehand. There is lots more action as well. I found the first chapter way too talkative and a bit dull in many areas. This movie still suffers from some dull moments (the screenplay's dialogue is questionable at best), but the action sequences are mind-blowing to say the least. The special effects and editing techniques are even better than the Oscar-winning ones from its predecessor. When all is said and done though ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is still not a total triumph with me. I remarked that the first film was ""as empty and meaningless as a painting by Picasso"". Admittedly I don't quite feel that strongly now after seeing this film. The first movie makes a lot more sense to me and I have a little more insight into what the Wachowski Brothers are trying to say here (the directors/co-writers). With that said I think the ideas in ""The Matrix"" are a wide jumble that never do come together in a cohesive manner. In this series there are undertones of Biblical teaching, Greek philosophy, science-fiction story-telling and an almost endless number of elements from varying cultures around the world. When put together the experience is more migraine-inducing than it is interesting. ""The Matrix"" series lacks everything that the recent ""The Lord of the Rings"" series has. ""The Lord of the Rings"" has a focus that keeps its audience interested and intrigued. It has a heart, mind and soul that put it above most other productions of the genre. ""The Matrix"" has a better mind than I originally thought it had, but its heart and soul are still nowhere to be found. The series is very cold, sterile and at times a trial to get through. I am anxious to see how this series concludes, but in the end I am not sure I will care any more or less about ""The Matrix"" and that makes it only average when it finally completes its long schizophrenic journey. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A worthy sequel,"Trying to describe it is futile. Just go see it.Between the money scenes, we get characters standing at attention and burping prophecies and deep thoughts at each other. A solid followup to a truly genre-transcending film. As sequels go, The Matrix Reloaded is every bit a dynamite film. The dazzling 14-minute chase includes cars, motorcycles, a couple of 18-wheelers - and nonstop martial-arts battles and leaps inside and on top of the vehicles. That scene alone will justify the price of admission for many. High budget, high concept, high drama and high level action are the highlights, but Reloaded has loads of love, too, and much more: it's sci-fi with ranch, for one thing. Death defying stunts, by the dozen. Multiplying Agent Smiths who can morph you into another Smith at the poke of a hand into your ribcage. Fight sequences that draw no blood but demolish buildings. Highway mayhem shot with speeding motorbike-cam. And if you want to get Reloaded with the mystical/spiritual side of The Matrix, this one's for you, too, peppered with profundities and set in an apocalyptic tomorrow where machines threaten to annihilate humans. This is not a totally original concept, I grant you, but the brothers Wachowski have made something new out of the idea, layering Reloaded with philosophical and mystical references. You don't have to dig deep to find any number of references drawn from Christian mythology, like Neo's long black robe, seemingly pilfered from a priest's locker, his disturbing visions, his appellation as The One, his moment of doubt, his healing powers, names of other characters like Trinity and Morpheus.I can't wait to see what the Wachowski's have in store.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Good film, but tries to be more than it is.","The Matrix Reloaded is not a great film. I'd heard complaints that in the first hour there's nothing happening. This is pretty much true. But it's not even close to being the reason of this movie not working as well as the first. The problem is the philosophical rubble that just goes on and on and very soon gets irritating. It feels like the directors are bragging with their material.. ""oh, look how smart problems we've managed to write in to the script"". Of course the whole idea of the world being fake is deeply philosophical in itself, but this was just the theme in the first. The first film made it's point by visuals and not including much of it in the actual dialogue, but in Reloaded they for some reason saw that it wasn't enough. Shame. Also most of the comedic moments are flat. The film has it's good qualities too. As expected, the action scenes are terrific. The fight between Neo and the Smiths goes on a bit too long though and the hero himself looks animated in some shots of the scene. The highway chase steals the whole show.. the twins kick ass and the cars flip over like it's poetry. Surprisingly good are also the scenes between Trinity and Neo. Not overly melodramatic, but rather nice. As a film, Reloaded is a three star picture, but the great action ups the stakes. Revolutions? Bring it on.**** / *****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Worst movie ever ??,Finally i have seen a movie which forced me to write my first negative review ! Incredibly bad plot .. cheap action .. i still can not believe it is a sequel of the Matrix !!!,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix Retarded (spoilers),"The second instalment of the Matrix trilogy takes all the excitement and energy of the first and flushes it completely down the toilet. In its place you're given turgid politics, ludicrous amounts of pseudo-philosophy and an unconvincing romance. It finally becomes clear that the Matrix has disappeared up the Wachowskis' arses.But what's most criminal of all is that the action is dull. After all, I'm not one of these sad teenagers that give a damn above the 'mythology' of The Matrix or the crappy philosophy. I have no desire to dress up like a knob and wear sunglasses indoors while practising bedroom kung fu. All I want is a decent story and some decent action. But instead you get a moronic story and lacklustre action.The most hyped piece of action is the car chase. Supposedly it was going to be the best car chase of all-time. It was going to change our attitude to cinema. Instead what you get is a bit of gun firing and one or two cars flying up in the air. It's the sort of thing you've seen in millions of films before, and often done much better than it is here. And as for being the 'Greatest Car Chase of All-Time', don't make me laugh. You'd have to be a moron to think that it could stand up to The French Connection or Bullit or Ronin. I even prefer the car chase in The Rock and I hate that sequence. I mean, at least it has the absurd zoom in, zoom out camera trick to fuel my rage. Here I was just apathetically shrugging my shoulders.The only decent bit of the car chase was the Ducati. What a beautiful bike. Oh, and Moss isn't a bad bike either. Seriously, all that money spent on special effects and your eyes still gravitate to an Italian bike and a woman's arse.But much worse than the car chase, which I'm merely apathetic to, was the fighting. Sweet Jesus the fight scenes were dull. All they consist of is a bit of flying about and tons of blocking. It's rare that anyone lands a punch. It's like they're playing Patty Cake. And most of the time the action serves no purpose. There's one bit where Neo (why does it always sound to me like people are addressing him as Neil? ""You're the one Neil"") fights hundreds of Agent Smiths. They fly about a bit and do tons more blocking. Occasionally someone lands a punch but then when the person goes flying into all the Agents you get an absurd ten-pin blowing noise. But then after this rubbish computer graphics demonstration, Neo just flies off. So what the hell was the point? I think the answer is a couple of sentences back. It's just to show off what the computer geeks can do. ""Hundreds of Agent Smiths? That would be so kewl!"" Sod the fact that the action has no consequences or that it does nothing to help drive the narrative forward. It's empty grandstanding and empty padding.Another dull action scene is the one where Neo fights lots of henchman in some French bloke's house. The turgid fighting is there but Neo can also stop bullets in midair. How can you care about someone that's invincible  especially someone that's both invincible and dull?One of the most unintentionally funny Neo scenes is where he has to kiss Monica Bellucci. Apparently she has to suffer being with some dull French bloke (who bores the audience to death in one of the million half-witted dialogue scenes) so she wants him to kiss her like he kisses Trinity. It's hilarious the way Reeves enters the Shatner school of acting. He looks at her and you can almost hear his thoughts, ""Kiss? IIdon't understand. It'sillogical."" But of course the reason that the scene's in the film is so that fanboys can soil their pants with fantasies of a quality of woman they'll never touch in a million years.Which brings me to the sex scene in the film. What a load of rubbish. You get more erotic movement out of an earthworm. And what kind of man is Neo? He almost cries when he comes. Although, having said that, the drums that play during the rave would probably make me cry too. All the party needed were whistles and glow sticks.But you see, the reason that sensitive, caring Neo gets emotional, is because he's worried about Trinity. Even though the two have no chemistry whatsoever. And just to show what an idiot he is, he chooses saving her over saving the world. How selfish can you get?But worse than the action, the sex, the sub-Stargate SG1 politics, the horrendous dialogue, the half-assed philosophy and the bad CGI (CGI Neo is just as unconvincing as the flesh and blood Neo) is the scene with The Architect. Nonsense dialogue gushes from his mouth, dialogue that in a deep and meaningful way is supposed to bring fresh revelations about The Matrix (there's talk of 'The Source' and other 'The Ones' and rebooting) but instead of being a speech on the nature of freedom of choice and all that jazz (if he's the Wachowski's idea of god, then god is more of a tool than I previously thought), it's merely a convoluted B-movie way of getting the hero to choose between saving the world and the girl. Of course Neo chooses the girl. Ergo, he's exactly the same as every hero out there. He loves his girl more than humanity. Idiot.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Oracle said that the French guy is a program; then he must be the fifth version of `The One' if `The One' is actually a program?! What is the machine's fall back plan if the entire human race were to be wiped out? Is the change in Agent Smith a design or an unexpected event in the machine's strategy?  Since the two choices given to Neo are obviously under the machines control, could there be a third choice?

I could never have guessed how terrible this was going to be. Easily the poorest sequel in recent memory. I can't think of ONE thing I liked about it.

With these kind of critics the producers could have slapped a Matrix label on a box of dog crap and still gotten glowing reviews. I am a huge Matrix fan and have seen the movie 3 times in the theatre and countless times after.  So here is a legitimate review. Aside from the fight seen, the first 45 minutes is a waste of budget money and film.  Anyone who says it contributed to the plot and enjoyment of the movie is lying, or hasn't seen it yet. I knew that this film would have much deeper pockets than the first one, which may have contributed to its thin plot and meaningless action.  The movie is packed with explosions, high budget car chases,  and wall to wall wire fighting and C.G.I. effects.  But it seriously lacks in the original story and attention to detail of the first.  In one particular fight scene where Neo was taking on multiples of the same agent, my girlfriend turned to me and said ""This doesn't look real, it looks like a video game.""  I thought that perhaps it was just my over-critical eye for C.G.I. detail, but coming from a girl who's movie genre is romantic comedy . . . I was shocked.

Heavy on action scenes, light on the thought-provoking dialogue, there is no doubt that this sequel is a different kind of film than it's predecessor, which is vexing, as it comes from the exact same people who brought you the first.On the surface, it's a loud, rip-roaring summer blockbuster with outstanding visual effects and mind-blowing action sequences. But what it has in brawn it severely lacks in brain. A story that is basically bookended by Neo's (Keanu Reeves) desire to save his love interest, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), ""The Matrix Reloaded"" takes a lot of time to get to its point. What little plot is being pushed is constantly interrupted by giant stunt showcases or martial arts extravaganzas. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a testament to all that is possible with modern film-making, and to that end, it succeeds.What it fails at is telling a compelling story. The plot relies too heavily at times on external media (i.e. video games and an anime home video by the name of ""The Animatrix"") and in all honesty, could have been condensed into the closing chapter, ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" thereby almost negating its existence. What we are left with instead is a film that is half the sum of its predecessor, and which may dazzle the audio and visual senses, but hardly stimulates the brain like a ""Matrix"" movie should. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" stands strong as an action epic  the true summer blockbuster it is  but disappoints when the time comes to tell its story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Sometimes if you expect greatness better than average is a bummer.,"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was by this film. To give you some perspective, I loved ""The Matrix"". I saw it three times in the theater and I own the DVD. I loved ""The Matrix"" because  1. It allowed a certain ambiguity. 2. It didn't spoon-feed the audience 3. It didn't take itself too seriously.""The Matrix Reloaded"" comes across as a typical Hollywood sequel: Repeat/Augment the successful scenes of the first film, Add some interesting characters and blow the whole thing with exposition and convolution. I expected more from the Wachowski Brothers.I will be the first to admit there were some incredible visual sequences. Some fights and chases were executed in fine form, but I found myself thinking during some of the extended martial arts scenes: ""Why am I watching Keanu Reeves in a wire harness in ""bullet-time"" when I can watch a true artist like Bruce Lee in my copy of ""Enter the Dragon""? In light of the true nature of 'the matrix' all the fist-fighting and gunplay seems superfluous and ultimately filler until the next expositional moment in the script. In other words, sure there were some cracker-jack action scenes, but they didn't advance the plot a whole lot. A great action film usually requires a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, but at some point the whole ""jacking into and out of the matrix gimmick"" requires a new level of suspension of disbelief. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an example of  another film with many cracker-jack action scenes but the difference is the scenes actually advanced the plot.Speaking of exposition, I kept waiting for Micheal York from the ""Austin Powers"" movies to show up. I mean, COME ON! Somebody tell the screenwriters that the high-school level philosophy class isn't impressing anyone over the age of 18. The first film did a much better job of avoiding making the audience feel like they should take  dictation without coming across as shallow. This film does precisely the opposite by talking itself in circles and in the end appearing vacuous.Also another suggestion to the filmakers: keep the power level of Neo consistent. In one scene he can disrupt the entire matrix with his ""wake"" and in another five dudes with less skill that Agent Smith keep him occupied for far too long. Either he is omnipotent or he is not. If he is omnipotent within the matrix you don't have much of a story. The Wachowski's seem to want to have it both ways.OK, I admit I'll shell out the $10.00 to see the next one and ultimately that determines the financial success of a movie, but box-office receipts do not determine whether a film reaches it's potential as a classic series as ""The Matrix"" could have.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Severely under-rated - a very good follow-up,"I recently watched this movie in sequence with the original, and it was only then when I realised the equality of the two movies. It must be said that while the first movie was a very entertaining science-fiction movie, it was in no way flawless. Pointless side-characters, over-written dialogue and slow pacing are abound, but these are brushed aside due to the strong plot that held the movie together. This time, however, people went into the movie without realising that these flaws would still be present in the sequel.Instead of taking in what they saw, expectations from the audience were simply too high. With all of the hype over the original movie, which was continually added on over the four year gap, the sequels had a lot to live up to in order to ""beat"" the original. People wanted something better than the original. And simply put, this isn't that.Instead, this is exactly more of the same, and it's because of that fact that this movie was given such bad responses.The movie is in actually very well thought out. The original had a very open-ending, but was also quite finished with in that all of the original plotlines were ""resolved"". This sequel, on the other hand, had the task of continuing this storyline without repeating the original movie - a trap many sequels fall into without creative flair. However, this movie does carry on the storyline in the most logical way - the stakes are raised immensely as things merely hinted at in the original are expanded and explained in logical detail. But here lies the problem of the Matrix sequels.The Wachowski brothers made a critical mistake in creating two movies in such a short time span. Instead of focussing on one, many storylines have been strewn throughout both movies in order to keep enough material rolling. Only one sequel should have been crafted at a time. I can't really comment on Revolutions after only one showing, but if my memory serves me well it was very weak compared to it's older brothers - it definitely does deserve the criticism it recieved, as it felt tired and uninspired. But if people had not known about a third installment, the chances are that they would have been far less critical of Reloaded. As it is, no one was sure what to make of the middle part of this trilogy.And it definitely is the middle part. It carries on the storyline from the original, but leaves itself open for the third movie. Exactly as the second Lord of the Rings movie did. But because Reloaded can't stand all that well as a stand-alone movie, that may be why so many people felt cheated. In reality, it's simply doing exactly what it says on the tin - being the second part of the trilogy.After watching in sequence with the original, it's clear neither is perfect. Both are let down by poor dialogue, awkward pacing, unnecessary philosophies (which are interesting, but could be far less overbearing), and have too many unneeded characters. There's nothing wrong here that wasn't wrong in the original - except perhaps a totally unnecessary and very terrible Xion Rave sequence, which plays out like an MTV video and features soft pornography (designed seemingly only to appeal to a modern youth demographic). Perhaps this one scene was responsible for killing enjoyment while watching in the cinema).As it is, this movie is a good follow-up. The story is carried on logically, the action is just as gripping (though fight choreography could be better at times), and the pace is consistent. Despite massive complaints about the over-the-top special effects, there is nothing wrong here - the fight scenes play out at exactly the right length. On repeated viewings, most action sequences lost their touch, but because the fights are so long here, they remain just as compelling every time through, and new details can be picked up on every time. The only exception to this rule is a Neo vs Smith fight which starts off wonderfully, but eventually ends up trying to be too ""cool"" in favour of being logical, as Neo rips a telephone pole from the ground in order to fight his nemesis. Now that was unnecessary.The effects themselves are all fantastic - the CGI flows seamlessly with the on-screen action and the lighting is simply perfect - a direct follow on to the style of the original.Taken as light entertainment, with deep undertones for those who want it, this movie is very much a triumph. Yes, it could have been better in many places, but so could the original. This movie is simply more of the same. It doesn't try to improve on the original's flaws, but really it doesn't need to. It's just the way a sequel should be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Waiting for #3 a bit much - could have completed story,"Worst than the first.First 30 minutes or so is very slow and not very interesting.  Rest of the movie is pretty excellent.  But then you hit the abrupt end and realize you are going to shell out another 10 bucks in a few months to get the rest of the story.In this case it seems Hollywood realized they could milk the plot for awhile and convince us to spend twice the money to see the completed story.  Thanks for nothing - I hope this does not become a trend.  In this case, they could have easily cut the first boring bits, extended the movie 30 minutes, and given us a complete story in one go.  That would have been more entertaining.As I left the theatre I heard one viewer say ""What a rip-off, if I'd known it was a 'to be continued' I'd not have come to see it.""

"OK the first time, Excellent the second time.","I went to the Matrix Reloaded opening night and saw that The Matrix had lost it's unique quality as a great movie and transformed into another 'shoot 'em up' movie.

I was able to see the details of the plot revealing twists and situations I'd never realized or dreamed of. The first time I found a B grade movie. The second time I found an A movie; it was just amazing.

An Awesome Follow-Up!!,"The Matrix Reloaded (2003)Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss. Directed and Written By The Wachowski Brothers *****/*****In this brilliant follow up to the 1999 hit ""The Matrix"" Keanu Reeves reprises his role as the Computer-Hacker hero who is the only chance to save the last real city Zion. Picking up shortly where the 1st film left off Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are heavily in love and a long with prophetic mastermind Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) must save the city of Zion from thousands of machines invading and destroying the city. In this film you learn a deeper meaning of what the matrix really is and more is uncovered.Overall the film packs a punch full of explosives with it's dazzling special effects and fight scenes. Even though the now famous ""bullet time"" has been parodied in countless films and even commercials, it still remains fresh and even better in The Matrix Reloaded. As for the sroryline I loved it. Many things that go unanswered in the The Matrix are answered in The Matrix Reloaded. Many scenes may leave you questioning different theories of what the matrix may really be. Certain points in the film leave you feeling like you know what's going to happen but then suprises you. The performances were all great. Keanu Reeves' character Neo is probably the most well-fitting character he has played since Ted from Bill and Ted.In the end The Matrix Reloaded is a state of the art action flick with a good story to back it up. The movie leaves you in suspense with an unexpected ending and leaves you in excited to see The Matrix Revolutions.Overall: *****/*****...10/10(imdb)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Philosophical Repercussions Of This Move Will Rack Your Mind For Years,"Of course the movie can not match up to the surprise and intrigue of the first. In the first Matrix, we were let in on a secret and were as much of an exploring entity as Neo himself.By the time of Reloaded, the Matrix pop culture had exploded and the element of surprise when viewing the movie is therefore diminished, but not destroyed.I will not reveal any plot elements, perhaps other commenters will take care of that for me.The most important thing this movie asks though, and yes it has been asked countless times before, is... are we truly free?If so, What is freedom? What is control? What is power?Neo comes face-to-face with these questions in Reloaded, and so did I.If you have the mental capacity to ponder such questions then this movie will have important revelations for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Splendid sequel.,"Despite the almost complete lack of humor, or anything you can really laugh about, Reloaded is a good movie. Not all critics may agree with me, but it has been a difficult assignment to make a worthy sequel on such an original movie like The Matrix. The movie has cost a fortune, and it shows: the best special effects ever. The movie is very entertaining, and really leaves the spectator thinking. A star performance by Laurence Fishburne, who is without question the best actor in this movie, because he maintains the cool attitude he had in part one. The only bit disappointing thing in the film is the role of Neo. This is such a rigid character, it doesn't leave Reeves any space to give his personal twist.

Visuals not helped by lack of editing,"There is a tremendous level of visual grandeur in the ""Matrix Reloaded"", so much that it almost parallels the ""Lord of the Rings"". Almost.Unfortunately, it takes nearly half-an-hour into the movie before any real plot is developed that the audience wishes things would kick into gear again.  The first movie relied on initial force and story to draw attention. There were a few bullet-time scenes that made it interesting, but it remained fairly straightforward.In ""Reloaded"" there is bullet-time and slow-motion galore.  Too much in fact.  Also, the plot and effects in themselves get to the ridiculously overblown stage by the last 30 minutes.  Pity.  The action itself leaves something to be desired.  After the umpteenth judo battle began, I realized just how annoying it was getting.  The fight on the tractor trailer was just too long for this reviewer's taste.I don't mean to criticize the Wachowski Bros. because they have literally put their heart and soul into these movie, but the editing this time around is just awful.  Even the wondrous sound uses in the first ""Matrix"" feel like they've been skimped on this time.Overall, just not as good this time around; a lot like ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" when put in the original context.  3 out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Up to par w/ the first one,"Ok, what can I say, this is a good movie overall.  It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was definitely enjoyable.  The FX were great, but I'd liked to have them appeared a little smoother.  The one major complaint that I had was that the dialogue of the main characters however didn't quite seem to match the first movie quite like I'd expected.

Sequel is far more than the original,"We see a lot of sequels now. Some are horrible. Others outshine their predecessors. And now we have a sequel to the beloved Matrix, four-years in the making. And like Star Wars Episode 5 or Blade II, this sequel blows the original apart. Why? The visuals are more stunning, but that is hardly the important factor. The story here, although simple, is twice that of the original. The first Matrix was beautifully crafted to shock and surprise the audience with this image of fabricated reality. There is no way the sequel will copy that same format, considering that we already know what we are supposed to know about the system and the prophecy of the one. But The Matrix was not original in its most basic story. It follows in the same tradidition as the original Star Wars trilogy: a man who is ignorant of the world around him steps into his role as the savior of mankind. The Matrix is like that. However, Reloaded provides us with only remnants of that first storyline. Now it is a discovery of the ""why"" question rather than the ""how"". There is a dumbfounding twist at the end (which I will not reveal here. See the movie!) which adds an entirely new dimension to the story. There are also some strong Classical themes here regarding leadership, themes which are brought up with the same questions of choice in Vergil's Aeneid. Reloaded may initially seem like nothing more than an action movie with some philosophy as a bonus. But to those who listen carefully and comprehend what it is they are saying, Reloaded is an incredible experience. Though of course you may have to see it twice to fully grasp what the Wachowski's are trying to accomplish. But, why wouldn't you see it twice?

They went in thinking it will be a simple good guy / bad guy movie with a fairy tale ending like most simplistic movies.I noticed that some critics argued that the fight scenes were unrealistic.

"Entertaining, but most certainly not brilliant","I went into the theater expecting an entertaining film, and I got my wish. However, if you go in expecting something challenging mentally, you will be sorely disappointed.  Hopefully you've seen the first Matrix already, though, so you know better than to expect something witty.On the plus side, the special effects were amazing.  They most certainly improved upon the original style, though there was an awful lot of weird physics that was probably not intentional (unlike the scenes where the characters purposely utilize the properties of the matrix).  The scene with the cloned Smiths was a little silly, but all in all the movie had a number of good fight/action sequences.  The music/sound was very well done, too, with only a tad bit of cheesy trance thrown in for good measure.  Most of it flowed well with the film, and if you ate up the first soundtrack you'll probably be stoked to hear this one as well.  The best thing about the Matrix sequel (and what puts it better, in my mind, than the original) is the way in which they tie everything together in a neat little package, working in both the mysticism and technology of the matrix.Now for the negatives.  The dialogue is the worst dialogue I've heard in a long time.  I think even George Lucas could've written better dialogue, and if you've seen any of the recent Star Wars films, you'd wonder how that was possible until you saw Matrix Reloaded.  Yeah, sure, you can shrug some of it off as Agent Smith being his usual robotic self (since he is a computer program).  And there's even one very, very excellent line in the film (""It's like wiping your ass with silk."").  However, if you look at the lines that came from the ship's operator, you wonder how comic relief became so painful.  When you listen to the romantic crap going on between Neo and Trinity, it should make you genuinely wonder how whoever wrote this isn't stuck writing soap operas.  Hell, even Morpheus' speech isn't all that great, though it's given a very key placement right at the start of the film (though what follows is five minutes of my life I wish I could take back. Seriously, who decided to put a pointless music video in the middle of this movie?).Worst of all, the ending ten minute sequence with the Architect is the most asinine part -- remember that ""neat little package"" I just wrote about? Well, the creators of the Matrix do their damnedest to obfuscate the simplicity of it as much as possible by having the architect use a large number of consecutive words rarely heard in the English language.  They then complicate this further by throwing in as much technological mumbo-jumbo as they can fit.  The reason for this is simple -- to make stupid people think they are watching a smart film.  I was amazed by the number of people who were like ""Yeah, the ending totally messed with my head, man.""  Whatever. Nevermind the fact that all the philosophy that was so shallowly explored in this movie had already been talked about, from literature centuries old to fairly recent films like ""Ghost in the Shell""...what really slays me is that people think this is a deep film.  If it really asks any questions you haven't thought about before, you must not think very much.  And they don't even bother to touch deeply on the issue...instead, the cause/effect and free will/destiny philosophical arguments are used simply as a facade to make people think that the Matrix is more intelligent than your average action flick.  While this may barely be true, it can't stand up intellectually to most dramas even Hollywood puts out.Go for entertainment, and enjoy the stunning visuals and audio to the max by seeing it in the theater.  But please, please, please do not try and tell me there's one shred of intellectual stimulation in the Matrix.  It's all been done before...just read some cyberpunk, watch some anime, and hell, I could even recommend some books from as much as 2000 years ago that offered better insight into the same questions the Matrix Reloaded asked.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great film that enhances its predecessor,"The Matrix Reloaded is an extremely well made movie that successfully builds upon the universe introduced in the first film.

My only criticism is that in an effort to ""one up"" the first film it extended fight scenes a bit to long and slightly misused the bullet time effect. In the first film bullet time helped draw you into the scene building on anticipation, in this application it as if the timing is slightly off--slowing down some of the scenes.

It contains a lot of portentous psychobabble (I'm a psychology student, and have also studied philosophy and it went way over my head) and some of the fight scenes, while fun to watch, have been done before.Carrie-Anne Moss is excellent, and Keanu is passable again, but I must admit I found Laurence Fishburne's character to be extremely irritating.

Much inferior to the first film.,"Okay, I expected much better. After a movie as inspired and as original as ""The Matrix"", the minimum expected was something equivalent, especially given that we have back the entire original team, including the directors, who also sign the script.What we have in this film is the beginning of the ultimate conflict between machines and human beings. The film continues to bet on the style created earlier, and it continues to look cool, and trying to keep it up most of the time. The fight scenes have become even more impressive and stylized. The special effects are fantastic, all the actors' work is good despite being as impersonal and cold as in the first film. The actors do the best they can, but they don't always achieve the brilliance of the first film. There's just something missing. In addition, the film has moments that shouldn't be there: the sex scene was expendable, and I hated that kind of rave, with little clothes and more like the beginning of a gigantic orgy. Yes, in fact they are about to start a gigantic battle that decides whether everyone lives or dies ... and what they want to do is to be semi-naked and rub their bodies together, to the sound of an electronic beat.

After a while we can't figure out what laws of physics apply or don't apply. One e.g. of many: whenever the main character wants to change scenes he just flies off like superman; then why can't he do that all the time. Computerized characters are blatant.

Good but nothing compared to the original.,"Decent but convoluted follow up finds our hero Neo trying to discovery the origin of The Matrix. The problem with the film unfortunately is the fact that it's a little too long in dialog, and way too short in excitement. The Special Effects are groundbreaking and show stopping,but they are far and few between. The sequel should have been a stand alone movie in a trilogy but it's bogged down with a cliff hanger ending that answers nothing, and a climax that is very underwellming.

"The Matrix, Rebloated","The most disappointing sequel in recent memory. I felt like i was watching Mortal Kombat 2 all over again. It was like a horrible nightmare. There was tons of action, so much so that it became boring if you could believe that. Lots of pointless action and lots of pointlessness, for example the dance club scene. If i wanted to see people dance i would go to a club myself, not pay 15 bucks to see it in a theatre.There was too much Kung Fu in it. I didn't believe it would be possible but the Matrix ruined something that i thought you'd never get enough of. All the fighting scenes were pointless since you knew who was going to win no matter what. So the whole movie was Neo wasting agents over and over and over again.The special effects were top notch but i don't care how much special effects are in it, it still sucked. Star wars episode 2 was all special effects but that didn't stop that ship from sinking and it certainly didn't stop this one. The ending was one of the worst i had ever seen in a sequel. The might as well have ended it after the opening credits because the movie was pointless.The entire time i was watching it, I was waiting for the movie to come out of its sleepy boring state and wake up to the real story, the real point but it never did. It was as if i was watching a 2 and a half hour long trailer.Well the Matrix did succeed however. It succeeded by suckering me into watching it and wasting my money.And it will continue to do so to others for months to come.The matrix is a very huge, very complex sucking machine that will have repercussions echoing through time, disappointing complex matrices of people worldwide.

"so many good, cool parts... so many bad, painful parts...","It's nice to be able to watch this movie with a fast forward button available.  I don't think I could sit through the Zion dancing scene again, and there are many other scenes I could do without.  It's hard to fast-forward though the bad acting though, since it's spread throughout the film.Anyway, I didn't expect the acting to be good, but I did expect a lot from the special effects department.  Sometimes they delivered, and sometimes they put stuff on the screen that made me cringe.   Let's just say that when people look back at some of the CGI in this movie, they'll say ""this was cutting edge at one point?"" I don't mind the use of CGI as long as it's integrated into the film well.  If you can pinpoint the specific time that CGI cuts into a scene, then the film makers have not done their job.  Like the people in the Lord of The Rings documentary said: ""people shouldn't know that they're looking at an effects shot"".In the Matrix you can tell exactly when Neo is CGI and that takes so much away from the experience.  And one thing is clear...  you should never... ever.... ever do close-up slow motion CGI shots of a human... at least not for another 10 years or so.The main redeeming part of the action in this movie is the freeway chase. That was quality, and you couldn't tell when CGI was used, since it was used for vehicles and far away shots of the agent jumping on the car.Anyway, it wasn't a bad movie... but it just wasn't polished work.  I expected a bit more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not everything I hoped for...,"There's no doubt about it, Reloaded is a visual masterpiece. Upon viewing, the audience will no doubt be blown away by the near-seamless special effects. The fight sequences in Reloaded are nothing short of phenomenal: flowing, turbo-charged, and at times even clever. Not a single complaint there.The problem thus lies in Reloaded's style. Whereas the original Matrix is subtle, Reloaded tends to jump out and beat the audience senseless at unnecessary times. The Matrix was chock-full of violence (though not gore) and sexual tension (though not overdone explicitness, reminiscent of a low grade rap music video).  Reloaded seemed to take the easy way out of attracting the Average Joe viewer one too many times. I would suggest that the makers of this film remember that the audience occasionally enjoys figuring things out on their own, not being force-fed.I won't go so far as to say that Reloaded is bad, or to suggest that a potential viewer pass up this eye-feast of a film. I will, however, withhold my final judgment of the film for the second viewing, where I'm hoping that the seemingly gratuitous tendencies of the plot will resolve into satisfying underlying themes. (Reloaded's pacing is very stop-and-go, alternately subjecting the audience to long, incredible fight and chase sequences, and long, dialogue scenes; consequently causing the viewer to tend to zone out during the important dialogue scenes, thereby -- hopefully -- missing the less obvious underlying themes on the first go-around.)All in all, Reloaded doesn't hold a candle to The Matrix, but is definitely worth the seven-odd bucks of a viewing, or if you hope to catch all the dialogue, the fourteen-odd bucks of a second.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"I didn't hate it, but it wasn't Gods gift to cinema either.","Do I think it's worth seeing? an enthusiastic Yes! Do I think it is equal to the first? no.The special effects in the first one helped explain the Matrix, drive the story and the character development, they also were seamless. at no point in the first film did I look at Keanu and think I wasn't seeing him, because the wire work and the compositing was second to none. In Reloaded, while I enjoyed the ride, there were plenty of times during the fights that it was obvious that I was looking at a 3D model of Keanu and not the actor. and while they were excellent models....they were models none the less.Suddenly instead of buying the reality of the Matrix I was standing outside of it. If you are watching a movie about a false reality that is too perfect to distinguish from reality, then the effects should be indistinguishable from reality as well, and sometimes they were not. In the Matrix they were, in Reloaded the scene of Keanu flying in the clouds was obviously 3D...some wire work by The actor and a cheaper compositing process would have kept me in the reality of that shot better. (the original super man did that in the seventies) my long winded point is this. no one special effect type is the best for every situation and it never will be. 3D is a tool just like wire work and compositing are. judicious use of each yields the best results and in the original film, that is what was done, though most likely because of money constraints. Simplicity of effects is what made those scenes in the first so ground breaking and rock solidly mind blowing. not simplicity in choreography mind you.The best parts of the fight between Neo and the Smiths in Reloaded were the ones where they used live actors for the fights and judiciously used 3D compositing to put Agent Smiths face on all of the players. Believe me, I want to watch the ""One"" battle the smiths again and again and when I buy the dvd when it comes out on the first day of it's release I will, but that doesn't change the fact that the fight in the train station in the first film never made me think for a second that I wasn't actually watching them fight. it was hyper reality, not animated fantasy. ...and Hyper-reality confounds the noodle more than fantasy ever will, so in short, I loved it and hated it all at the same time, I paid for the ticket I'm allowed.Will I see Revolutions on the first day it opens in November....you bet I will.Sam Scum",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

From One Too Many and More Conspicuously Absent,"""The Matrix"" (1999) is a singular masterpiece, so I suppose one shouldn't be surprised that the sequels failed to rise to the level of that initial effort. The man-v-machines sci-fi theme remains, but, here, it descends into a freeway car chase reminiscent of something from an installment in ""The Terminator"" franchise. The bullet-time photography returns, and the CGI may even be better four years later, but there's nothing here quite like the ultraviolent shootouts from the first film, while there is more of the superhero flying. It's still darkly-lit cyberpunk, but ""The Matrix Reloaded"" has largely abandoned the neo-noir tropes of the original. There are no ""Alice in Wonderland"" references now (although, as in the Alice books, there are still dreams, plenty of doors, as well as keys and the promise of a clock motif this time around). We've lost that introduction from a dreamworld, and now we have two worlds, real and false, that are stubbornly obvious in their demarcations (until, perhaps, the end). Not even the pretensions to the philosophies of Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation"" and Plato's Socrates and Cave Allegory are discernible anymore, as the sequel redoubles the biblical allusions for its pseudo-religious prophesying. While reductionist in this sense, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" does follow the pattern of doubling in sequels in other respects.Early on, this multiplication is evident with the former-agent Smith and his doppelgängers. Later, we learn the ""One,"" Neo, may actually be one of many, as especially well staged in the Architect's room full of screens with images of Neo(s). There are the identical, ghostly white, twins who chase the heroes in that freeway sequence. And the film-within-the-film itself is even a sequel, ""The Brides of Dracula"" (1960), as viewed by two programs who are like vampire (or, more so, like werewolves) in that they're only killed by silver bullets. All of this is a common practice of sequels to reflexively nod at the fact that the films themselves (and, indeed, movies in general) are reproductions of an original. I (and others, I'm sure--there's never just one) have talked about this repeatedly before. One of the my favorite examples is one of the first great sequels, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), which redoubles everything from characters (two mad doctors, two monsters, two brides, etc.) to the narrative (with a frame story of the author and a bifurcated plot).It's the simpleton earnestness of it all, however, that seems more obtrusive in the sequel, although it was there, too, in the first film. Heck, when the Councillor in Zion (yes, very heavy on the biblical and otherwise religious names) tries to complicate the picture's polemics a smidgen, by talking about humanity's dependence inside and outside the Matrix on machines, Neo shuts him down with his jejune absolutism. Honestly, the Wachowskis tend to seem unambiguous with their pictures' politics and philosophies despite them being typically ambiguous in definition, as perhaps dictated by mainstream movies that demand to not be pinned down to any controversial standpoints (which is to say any actual position beyond, say, that enslaving humanity as batteries is bad). Nevertheless, the true successor to ""The Matrix"" in my mind is their ""V for Vendetta"" (2005), which is explicitly a comic-book movie, but one that is rooted, as with ""The Matrix,"" in prior works and other genres: in that case, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and swashbucklers, both of which feed back into the superhero genre. There, too, the politics are ridiculously simplistic, but it does hark back to ""1984,"" the book and film--similar to how ""The Matrix"" echoed Baudillard and Plato, as well as Lewis Carroll and a noir sort of fate. While the party sequence in Zion might be well filmed or that car chase may arguably be fun, along with the repeated martial-arts fight scenes, there's too much missing here from the highly influential, perhaps even revolutionary, first ""Matrix,"" and with nothing substantial, for all its doubling, to replace it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Improving on the Original,"The Matrix Reloaded is well worth the price of admission.  Where as The Matrix was a good movie, this sequel took the best of that movie and built upon it, making an even better movie.

The biggest downfall to the movie, that widely takes away from the fun, is the absolute horrifying CGI. There is ALOT of CGI in the movie and it looks like something out of a video game. Further more there are many fighting scenes that last forever and don't make much sense. First of all, if kicking and punching doesn't hurt the guy, then why are you still doing it ten minutes later? Furthermore, at the beginning of the movie Neo makes the comment ""upgrades"" to the agents, telling us they are better then the last film. But then we have Morpheus stand his ground and fight an agent for quite awhile. How on earth is that even possible, when in part one no normal person could fight an agent, let alone an upgraded one?

I'm whiny,"Well, it did not go as well as the first part. First of all the storyline is thin and secondly action is the bulk. I did not enjoy it as much as the first.

But I feel it had more to tell. They could have done a better job when focussing on Zion, somehow it did not seem the most important aspect of the film. Also Neo should have been put in the apprenticeship, it would have been amazing to seem him become the master a bit later or even the end of the movie, it would have given a sense of vulnerability and made it more exciting.2) Action seemed to fill in places most of the time.It was fantastic seeing the explosions, but we did experience most of it in the first part, nothing new out here.3) Hats off for the special effects, i did enjoy the agent smith versus Neo fight a lot.

Kung-fu fun; Sci-fi nightmare,"As a fan of Science-fiction movies, I have been aware of The Matrix since its release in 1999.  From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it, I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated.  I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland.  I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released.  With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.The disappointment was too great.  The premise of the matrix (the controlling device as opposed to the movie) was clever.  The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternate realities is shopworn.  However, I could still have bought into the film, as science-fiction, if it stayed firmly in that genre.  Unfortunately, it turned into a standard, ""will they or won't they escape, break through, rescue those in need of rescue, etc."" To make matters worse, it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts films are really two different types.  To the purest, the devotee of one or the other, mixing the two doesn't work.  It is like mixing science-fiction with romance.  You can have one or the other, but not both in the same film, or, at least, not both to the same extent in the same movie.If there were such problems with The Matrix,  The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems.  At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car-chase.  (This observation ignores the question, made in every professional, negative review of the movie: If Neo could do the Superman thing, why bother to fight at all? The answer, of course, is that's what draws the young, male demographic group into the theatre.)  Then there is the ""redemption through love"" aspect.  That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago.  It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded.  Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite, but arcane sci-fi philosophizing. Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung-fun fest.  Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films:  Science fiction, martial arts, or soap opera?

A poor successor,"As a personal fan of the original Matrix, which I have watched end to end dozens of times and practically memorized the dialogue for, I was expecting the new film to be a blast, both in terms of action and substance. I was right about the former, entirely wrong about the latter, and I'm almost disappointed that I went to see it.The sequel premise is rather straightforward. Approximately one year after the original film, Neo's powers have grown to the point where he is literally a living god within the Matrix. He is married to Trinity and is gathering a huge following as the ""savior"" of the last human city of Zion. The Osiris, a ship patrolling the upper levels, detects the presence of a massive machine army coming to destroy Zion. The commanders and ship captains begin bulking up defenses, but Morpheus, with his messianic vision, believes that the key to defeating the machines lies with Neo. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar takes upon themselves a mission to fulfill the prophecies of the Oracle and save Zion.While in plot the film is quite good, the acting was atrocious at times and unworthy of some of the actors. Keanu Reeves could have been literally replaced by a stunt double and he would probably have done better acting on screen. In an attempt to somehow become more ""deep"" and ""philosophical"", the Wachowski brothers tried to pepper the film with awkward dialogue and pseudo-mysticism. While that material is not necessarily bad or wrong, it could have been delivered more effectively.The action was good but some of the CGI was absolutely horrible, while some of it was fantastic on the other hand. I found that the scene where Neo fights 100 different Agent Smiths was the poorest of the scenes involving CGI, as it seemed a little *too* artificial. It annoys me to no end that fans try to pass this off as the ""artificiality of the Matrix"" and the ""deep inherent message"" when it really comes down to the ineptitude with which the scene was edited, due to time constraints.Worth seeing for a first shot but really not memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

You have to see it for yourself ...,"After the massive success of the excellent original movie, expectations were very high for this one. Unfortunately, as you probably know this one wasn't as popular or as great as the first film. The main reason for this as far as I can see is simple -- at the beginning of the film there is a half hour or so segment set in Zion which completely sucks the life out of everyone, and most of them can never truly be recovered after that. The later, tedious dialogue sequences that go around and around in circles don't help much either.Don't get me wrong, the action sequences are all great, the multi-Smith battle, the lengthy car chase and road battle sequence are all fantastic pieces of cinema history, and for this reason alone ""The Matrix Reloaded is not to be missed. As a general rule, any scene in this film that is set inside the Matrix is great and worth seeing, and at the end there are not one but (eek!) TWO twists that, while they might not make a whole lot of sense, will make your head spin and definitely make you want to watch ""The Matrix Revolutions"" if you haven't already.Now, onto that pesky first half hour ... the reason that this segment is there is to establish plot, develop characters and it is mostly reliant on dialogue. As you'll remember from the first film, plot and dialogue aren't exactly the Wachowski brother's strong point. They proceed to poke so many more holes in the Matrix arc-plot that you may as well just skip over this opening segment -- it won't make sense anyway. The new characters also fail to be as interesting or appealing as the character's who we know and love in the first film, and I find that I wouldn't care that much if they all ended up dead in the next one. As for the dialogue, there are certain lines that almost made me cringe and clench my seat in agony. George Lucas had a similar problem with his latest Star Wars efforts ... it's a case of great special effects combined with inadequate scriptwriting.On the whole this an entertaining film and worth seeing for certain segments, but by no means is it a classic like it's prequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Matrix = Best Film Ever The Matrix Reloaded= Worst Film Ever,"The most disappointing film I've ever seen.Did someone kidnap the Wachowski brothers and replace them with hack TV Sci-Fi director android clones who were blinded by the opportunity to have a 100 million dollar opening weekend regardless of the quality of the film they delivered?

"Been there, seen that","""The Matrix"" is a movie that works perfectly fine on its own, but there was also the option of making one or two sequels without telling the same story twice and actually developping a great saga. Well, after having seen ""Matrix: Reloaded"" I have to say, the story should have ended after part 1.It's not like part 2 was a complete rehash of the first one, but it introduces stupid new aspects and storylines that go nowhere. Questions are raised without being answered and the whole thing makes no sense at all (I'm sure this can be debated over for hours but at the end of the day I think the Wachowskis were trying to be weird, rather than presenting something that can be explained reasonably).I'm surely not the first to state that this movie is way too long. The dancing sequence.... God, I almost fell asleep. The fight scenes... yeah, I'm a guy and I'm usually of the opinion that action's cool but this went too far. Besides, I'm so fed up with martial arts these days.Another flaw for me were the props. How the hell could they put all of the budget into special effects and then shoot the goddamn thing in a studio that makes the movie look like an episode of ""Star Trek""? The ""cool"" coats, leather suits and glasses of Neo, Trinity, Morpheus & co. are so overdone that ""The Matrix"" becomes a parody of itself. In ten years from now people are gonna laugh about this. Come on folks, didn't we learn anything from ""Saturday Night Fever"" or ""Miami Vice""?""Matrix: Reloaded"" is watchable, but I don't think I'm gonna watch it again soon. ""Matrix"" (no. 1) is the only part of the trilogy, that will be remembered as a movie classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It lacks the originality.,"I saw this movie yesterday expecting a mind-blowing experience with awsome special efects and new cool carachters. But instead a i got a action movie. If you didnt understand what i meant then read on.All the things that matrix(1999) stand out from normal action movies. was the use of special fx in an original way(when morpheus stands in a white room with neo and all of a sudden its filled with various guns(matrix)) is lost in this movie. The fight scene with agent smith*100 is very cool but many times neo looks artificiall and the Wachowskis has missed the ""hard punches"" the ones that make you think ""oh, that got to hurt""(trinity jumps up in the air and they freeze the picture and than spin around here(matrix)) and instead you get a lot of punches wich lacks the energy(?)for a man supossed to be ""the one"".but the effects were really cool. the car scene will be rememberd for a long time and its well worth 95kr(9 dollars(i think)) and i want to see the third one even do i didnt not like this as much as the first.p.s Keanu reeves is a bad actor and shouldnt have been casted for these movies. almost anyone could do the job better. and i know i cant spell in english.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Better than the first, but did anyone realize...","This was one of the best sequels I have ever seen. THe fights were spectacular and the characters had much more depth than the last movie. Some have commented that it takes too long to get going, but I disagree. In the original Matrix, it's nothing but Neo waking up for half an hour straight and laurence fishburne talking with a weird smile and sitting in a crappy red chair. They talk a lot in this movie too, but what they say is interesting! IT answers so much that the other film left hanging. There were only two flaws that I could find: The awful sex scene during the rave (That really wasn't necessary). The other involved the car chase. NOw don't get me wrong; the chase itself was excellent and well-choreographed. But I realized about halfway through that all the cars they were using were made by GM. A twin shoots through a chevy tahoe, the cops all drove Chevy Impalas, and the agent jumps on an Oldsmobile Intrigue. The only non-GM car in the movie was the Audi A8 taht the Agents drove.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great ending, but little else","The final 10-15 minutes really makes this film great, but the rest lacked that greatness and provides nothing new compared to the original.  And just like the Matrix copy cats must be compared to the original, so must the reload.If it weren't for the fact that people could walk away from this with a completely different interpretation, I'd give it a much higher ranking.  So there are the problems with this film.  Lack of originality and lack of clarity in the story.For those unsure whether they want to spend over 2 hours in the theater, you can get by with watching the final hour without missing anything significant.  Monica Bellucci provides far more sex to her character and the movie than the scenes between Neo and Trinity.As to the soundtrack/score, it has some very impressive moments.  For a movie that you'd expect to cause you to jump out of your seat at least once because of surround sound FX, there is nothing.  The visual FX, on the other hand, live up to the hype.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I give it 7/10And the fight scene with Agent Smith.... so fake... one of Neo's move is like Princess Fiona's move in Shrek! (Although I do admire their effort) Seriously, don't go see it, maybe wait and see the Revolution and see Reloaded on DVD when the whole trilogy comes out.I agree with some of the comment regarding Lawrence, he was fat and ugly... need to put more make up or something.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Disappointment,"People often say that sequels will always disappoint. There are two schools of thought for this: either you loved the first one so much that the second will be disappointing due to high expectations, or sequels just always suck.That's a rather defeatist way to look at movies. First, there have been numerous successful sequels. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was quite good, establishing a large chunk of story and still managing to be involving. Same for ""X2"", which wasn't perfect but was very enjoyable.So sequels can be good. This is just a case of one that isn't.There is a widely-established myth that ""The Matrix"" was a perfect movie. It definitely wasn't. It was very derivative, ripping most of its technobabble and sci-fi base from Dick and Gibson. Where it excelled was the way the story was told. The world was (mostly) believable and gritty, the characters very involving, the actors perfect.The sequel fails because the Wachowski brothers seem to have fallen victim to the same trap that befell George Lucas: they believe people loved their movie for the plot (which was shoddy at best) and spend an inordinate amount of time expounding upon said plot. And expounding. And so on.There are so many lengthy scenes of people debating emptily about the meaning of life. Very little is actually said in these debates and lectures. It's just rambling, and it becomes irritating. Most egregious is the final speech given by ""The Architect"", where it is obvious that the Wachowski brothers were thinking ""If we make it confusing and use big words, people will assume it's deep."" The Architect prattles on about fate and choice (for the fiftieth time) while 400 images of Neo do painful emoting exercises on the background screens. It's unbearable.The problem with the movie is that these scenes make up the majority of the film, along with excruciatingly long and detailed kissing and romantic scenes. This is not an epic, it is sci-fi schlock with very good action scenes. When did the Wachowski's start to believe the fanboi hype?Another major problem is that the action is amazingly well choreographed, but not in the least bit compelling. Neo is Superman, he cannot be killed and we know this. It is unlikely that Morpheus or Trinity will die (although the possibility of one is presented as a tease). Thus, when they fight you're just admiring the choreography.Jackie Chan has repeatedly noted that in order for a fight scene to sell, people have to be hit. The viewer has to _feel_ the impact. But it is obvious that the punches aren't landing in this movie. Everyone is fighting so fast and doing so many acrobatic movies that the punches are secondary. In the Burly Brawl (the popular name for the fight against the myriad Agent Smiths) Keanu is just doing kata, dancing and spinning and it never feels like any punches land.That and the over-reliance on bullet time and wire-fu seriously detract from the battles. In several instances you can clearly see where the wires take over, so Keanu will smack someone and they will jolt up, then back at an incredible speed as the wire pulls them into some obstacle. It's just not compelling. Real fans of kung fu movies want to see real fights, not dancing. Not to mention the way Keanu escapes from danger (flying away in a Superman pose) just begs the question, why doesn't he do it sooner? If he can swoop in and save his friends, why waste time punching and kicking?I don't hate the film, it had its high points. I expect it would be a better experience at home, with a remote control, to skip past all the pretentious speechifying and cheesy romance scenes.But in the end I can't help but feel taken. ""The Matrix"" was not planned as a trilogy (no matter what they tell you now, it was a standalone movie and was ""developed"" into a trilogy when it became a success, which is why it took four years). Thus the newer movies are plagued by a feeling of padding, of ""haven't we already seen and heard this ten times?"" that is neither compelling nor interesting.It has an 8.1 rating here on IMDB, and it is already a financial smash. How ironic that a movie about being enslaved by machines has turned into its own mechanical franchise, where fanbois and yes-men salivate and prostrate themselves before the altar.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Meh,"I didn't go in to the theater expecting much, and that's what I got.  The story of course, wasn't horrible.  Definitely not up to par with the first, but it's a hard movie to follow up.  Now on to the good parts... the fighting, sucked.  Boring and over-choreographed.  Who wants to see Neo(who starts looking like Abe from Abe's Odyssey whenever the CG kicks in) basically dance around the screen for 10 minutes at a time?  He doesn't really need anyone else there, because he doesn't really get hurt throughout the entire movie.  The Agent Smith fight....wow...where'd the $100 million go?

Hate it? Love It? Keep Thinking!,"For both those who rave and those who rip Reloaded, I suggest you keep thinking about it.Most who loved the movie seem to be wowed by it's ground-breaking special effects, incredible action and solid story-telling.  Some who hated it, thought it was just an action flick with too much emphasis on special effects.For both camps, this movie goes much deeper.  The true brilliance of The Matrix, which I believe has been surpassed by Reloaded, is found in the ideas behind the story.  Layers upon layers of sometimes conflicting philosophy speak to the heart of human nature, our perception of reality and the very meaning of life.Reloaded suggests that we, that our lives, are about purpose...that choice is a blessing and a curse ... and that hope is our greatest strength and our greatest weakness.  But in the end, after digging further down into the rabbit hole, The Matrix: Reloaded demonstrates that it's really all about - faith.And this is why, after the first weeks of spectacle-seeking fans pass through, audiences will continue to flock to this movie to see it again and again, propelling it to become the most successful R rated movie of all time.So have a little faith, and keep thinking before you make up your mind about The Matrix: Reloaded.

Not bad but not great either,"With great expectation for Matrix 2 I bought tickets to the preview on May 14.  The action sequences expected for The Matrix are fulfilled but at mostly a speed slower and longer than my expectations. I wanted to hit fast forward during the film to solve this.  The story, while at times compelling, does little to endear us to the main characters fighting for freedom. In fact, Neo and others seem downright two dimensional when they encounter the decidedly more vivid enemy. (The actor from the restaurant was amazing!)  Finally, I felt the writing was too geeky and dependent on the cult of The Matrix. This film has a hard time standing on its own unless you know the original story well and are willing to wait for Matrix 3 to have some questions answered.

Highly disappointed...,"The Matrix Reloaded doesn't even come close to the level of excellence achieved by its predecessor.  It feels as if a different director made Reloaded because the meaningful dialogue, strong story, and the unique and likable characters are missing.  Reloaded simply tries to imitate the greatness of the first Matrix, but fails miserably.  It's obvious that Reloaded and Revolutions could have been one movie because while the first Matrix is fast-paced, Reloaded drags on and on.  It moves along more slowly than Gangs of New York which is still a great film.  Every scene, whether it's dialogue or fighting, feels extended and much too long. The first Matrix was deep and meaningful while Reloaded is pseudo-intelligent and pretentious.   Younger fans of movies like The Fast and the Furious may enjoy the action scenes, but people looking for more should look elsewhere. The musical score is also very poor even though Don Davis returned to score it.  The freeway scene is probably the only good scene in the entire film. The rooftop scene with all the Smiths could have been good, but I just don't feel comfortable or impressed watching CG characters fight (the later parts of the scene).  CG characters should not replace human ones - don't the Wachowski brothers follow their own philosophy? X2 is a far better sequel than Matrix Reloaded.  Definitely see that first as it improves on the first X-Men which was a great movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not perfect, but certainly a good film","What a great deal of discussion the Matrix Reloaded has prompted. Even if the film has 'let down' many of the ardent fans, it has certainly provoked widespread debating with regard to the plot and given many people something to chew on until November 5th. I find this to be almost as important as the film. Whilst not succeeding on certain levels, the second installment is incredibly enjoyable and engaging throughout. This has led to many late night discussions on what will happen next. Call me a geek, but I find the storyline far exceeds what is demanded of an action film. Secondly, at least the Wachowskis are making ambitious films. It has led to debate and arguments. The special effects were irrefutably fantastic. Point out the few moments of cgi imperfection if you like, but the film dares to stretch the boundaries and I like it for these reasons.The main problem of the film was the hype. I honestly believe that the hardcore followers thought it would cure cancer. One must remember that it is only a film, and a sequel at that. Where the first film arrived like a silent assassin and took the world by surprise, we could see this one coming from 500 yards away. As a result, the level of expectation was ultimately going to be damaging. The Wachowskis had action fans, philosophers and the the public to please at the same time. They succeeded by not folding under the wealth of pressure. Nonetheless, the amount of vitriolic posts on websites bewilders me. This is NOT a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. It is simply not as good as the first film, which was perfect in its pre-millenium timing and slick execution. Having read many reviews from respected newspapers and magazines, they all found Reloaded to be a reasonably solid film. This is because they didn't expect the film to change their world. I have seen the film twice now, and found it notably better on second viewing. Take away the expectation and I found it to improve instantly. I am sure that if the Matrix was under such close scrutiny then Reeves would have been mocked as would have some of the throwaway characters ie Switch, Apoc etc.I am not a blind defender of the film, and do acknowledge its flaws. Some of the dialogue is trite and some of the action gratuitous. Neo's superhuman status also damages the characterisation - he is no longer vulnerable and I was rarely afraid for him. Where we once felt tense as he went into battle, I knew the outcome. However, the third film is undoubtedly darker and sees Neo (from the trailer) in trouble. Whilst there is clearly more of a 'popcorn' feel to elements of the film, it never pretends to be anything else than ambitious and plot-driven. The second film always has the dilemma of building on the first whilst leaving enough for the third. One must also remember that the whole story is not yet complete. The ignorant groans that accompanied each end of the LOTR films (which are undeniably great) are a testament to a public with little patience. ""Wait and ye shall see"", and personally I look forward to the third film with great anticipation.I dont intend to analyse in detail what was great about the film, because much of it is the same reasons why I liked the first film. The storyline,the principal characters, the dark undertones, the combat, the guns, cars, bikes, and the undeniable style to name but a few. There is much to like about the Matrix Reloaded, and a few niggles. Writing out a few lines and making some of the fighting more relevant would have made it that little bit better. Despite this, I still hugely enjoyed the film and for those who are still dismayed by its lack of perfection, please drop your impossible expectations. The film is just plain old good, not perfect.

"Yes, there is a spoon.","It's been a long wait, but The Matrix is back. No spoilers, but I will include some specifics here that may not agree with those whose sole joy of the theater rests in their being surprised. If you want to know nothing about this movie, stop reading now.There, for the rest of you, this: The Wachowski Bros. have nailed it again. The story picks up some months after the conclusion of the first film. A new operator, Link, played by Harold Perrineau, has replaced Tank at the controls of the Nebuchadnezzar, Neo and Trinity are sleeping together, and good old Morpheus is still doing the serious leader stuff. If you don't know what I am talking about, and I seriously doubt that, then you haven't seen ""The Matrix"" yet. Trust me, rent or buy the DVD prior to seeing ""Reloaded"". It will help.It will also hurt - here's why:  Unlike the original with its stunning opening bit with Trinity in the hotel room, this movie starts slowly. The Wachowskis have a story to tell here, and it just takes a bit of time to get rolling. During perhaps the first 45 minutes of the show, I was beginning to think that ""Reloaded"" was stumbling into the same hole as the Star Wars movies. It was beginning to feel self-absorbed, ponderous, overly serious, and cautious. I am sorry if this comment hurts the feelings of the Star Wars fans, but that is how I see that whole thing going. The Matrix, on the other hand, is decidedly not tripping down that particular rabbit hole. Things do pick up, and when they do, hold on.There is much to tell about the film, but I want to call attention to one character you will meet: The Architect, played to the hilt of pomposity by Helmut Bakaitis. This guy personifies pedanticism. And if any of the words in this last sentence gave you a problem, just wait until you meet the architect. This guy is your worst freshman philosophy nightmare, straight from the pit of hell and Oxford, humorless as a cold razor across your palm. Some films are rated R for violence, some for sex -- and you will find a bit of the latter and a passel of the former in this film -- but you will not find another movie anywhere with a stream of vocabulary like this guy spouts. The film board should have a proviso added to the ratings system that includes `Rated R for Incomprehensibility, no one under 17 admitted without a thesaurus'. While the architect was onscreen, I couldn't help thinking, looking around the theater at all the teenagers.The thing is, the Wachowskis are peeling an onion here. Layer after layer it goes, and when you think you have gotten somewhere, another layer is discovered. The Architect reveals some startling information to Neo, but is it really true, or just another layer of the onion? What is reality? What does it all mean, Mr. Natural?My guess is, the kids will figure it out faster than me, and good for them. Good for you, too.

Well at least the first film wasn't half bad......,"Four years after the first Matrix film, comes ""Matrix Reloaded"" and this time around the world of Neo is a vastly less intriguing one.Matrix Reloaded is a vapid and sterile movie, which features little else other listlessly boring acting, ridiculously pretentious dialog and an unending amount of computer-generated ""eye-candy"", which tends to make this movie look more like a video game, rather than a live-action film. Having only seen it once, that being said this film follows an obvious and highly predicable formula of: action / pontificate at great length / adjust sunglasses / more action / pontificate some more, etc. To me this movie was nothing more than a tiresome and cringe-worthy series of (1.) Visually complex, yet utterly sterile and incredibly fake looking action scenes, which again, look more like a video game (and not a particularly good one), rather then a movie. (2.) And then there's the dialog..... which, as many other reviewers have also stated, is criminally bad and often insufferably painful, and that's entirely due to the movies wordy and highly pretentious screen-play. In at least half a dozen scenes this movie torture's you with one lame-ass ""from the future"" after another, who, without fail, indulges in a ""deep"" and lengthy speech; of which most are placidly delivered snore-fests, that tend to ebb and flow around possible/hypothetical out-comes of the future, whereas a few others are fire and brimstone diatribes that mostly focus on berating Neo. But in any case whoever the messenger may be (I found the snotty Frenchman to be the most obnoxious), all of these scenes are overflowing with some of the most exceptionally wordy and singularly pretentious screen-writing ever. Seriously, Matrix Reloaded is loaded with some of the all-time worst dialog, which it's makers SO DESPERATELY want you to be impressed by. But ultimately it comes off as nothing more than conceited nauseating drivel. They really should issue a barf-bag with the purchase of this movie - should you be stupid enough to waste your money on it in the first place.In conclusion Matrix Reloaded, though not completely bereft of artistic merit, is simply a very boring piece of Sci-Fi cheese, which also happens to showcase front and center, some of Keanu Reeves worst acting (it's as if he slept through his roll) and the only reason I finally got around to seeing this movie, a whole 14 years after it's release, is because Mike Nelson and the rest of the Rifftrax crew, gave it the long over-due ripping that it so rightfully deserves. They too have no delusions on how crappy this movie really is and without their commentary it would have been even more boring, to the point of being unwatchable.Matrix Reloaded = sterile, lifeless, super-massively over-rated, Sci-Fi rubbish.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Top notch action, light on plot (duh)","Depending on what you are looking for Reloaded can be considered a better or worse movie than The Matrix.  The special effects, action, and fight scenes are amazing. The plot and character development is not.Basically, this was a 4 hour movie split into two 2 hour movies with 30 minuties of filler to get em up to 2 1/2 hours.  Many scenes leave you going, ""And the point was?""  Luckily, the movie does not need a point. Or, really, the point is, ""Look at our AWESOME effects and action! Oh, and here is a bit of a plot to keep the movie going until we finish it for The Revolution.""Go see this because of movie magic and fun-factor, not to see a gripping story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great !!!!!!,"I consider this movie an artistic movie, the beauty of the photography. Congratulations to the crew and art direction.  Of course it's not an easy story, interesting but complicated.

The Matrix Reloaded,"The last one was a romance, this one is an action film. It picks up where the first film left off in terms of cinematography, but the flaws are magnified. The martial arts sequences still look good, but there are more than enough of them to make it seem cumbersome and long. It's hard to imagine a film whose main line is actually held together by romance, and it's really surprising to see Giuseppe Sulfaro.

Worth the wait,I thought the Matrix Reloaded was well worth the wait. I'm just glad I don't have to wait another four years to see the last one. I felt that the storyline was interesting from beginning to end. unlike most movies that have lulls in between the action.

Overkill on effects no SUBSTANCE,"I went into this film with low expectations and still managed to be thoroughly disappointed. I should have known better then to expect Keanu Reeves to have another good film.  It seemed to me that the movie was out to prove that it's fight scenes would bigger and better than first Matrix. But in doing so the filmmakers gave no consideration to the substance of storyline. For those of you fortunate souls who have yet see Matrix Reloaded, count your blessings and move on.If you don't believe me I'll give you an example of the ridiculous storyline. Apparently there are VAMPIRES and WEREWOLFS in the Matrix. OH YES I forgot to mention GHOSTS. Here are some other major flaws with the film:1. At the end of the first film Neo was invincible, now he is back fighting when doesn't even really need to fight? (According to Morpheus in the first film) The Guy can stop bullets and fly but he still needs to trade punches.2. Apparently everyone in Zion took a course in Agent fighting 101 from Neo, because they all go toe to toe with agents. In one scene Morpheus is helping Neo take on like twenty Agent Smiths. If my memory serves me correctly Morpheus couldn't take care of one in the first Matrix.Things that could have save this Film1. Limit Keanu Reeves's dialogue to sentences like ""I Know Kung-Fu""2. Kill the Malcolm X speech by Morpheus.3. Limit the Number of exploding cars that tumble down the highway to less than 10 in one action scene.Recommendation: I say 6 pack of beer about an hour before Showtime along with a couple of hits off the peace pipe should ease the pain of this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Moose Hole - The Matrix Reloaded Review,"The world we live in is not real. We are all part of a large computer program. It is not the year we think it is. Most humans believe it is the year 2003 but rather it is the year 2099 or something close to that. Machines have taken control of the world and most humans are tapped into a thing called The Matrix. Pretty weird, huh? Well, the strange premise of The Matrix caught on in 1999 and now the first sequel has been declared the movie event of 2003. Though the sequel, like its predecessor, is rated R, the highly anticipated film is still expected to break box office records faster then any other movie. It is even expected to challenge Titanic for the highest grossing film title. A huge amount of hype has been placed on the film. Fanatics have been surfing the web and chatting how excited they are about this film. You couldn't go into a movie without seeing at least a teaser trailer for the film. Now that the film has finally arrived in movie theaters across the country and soon the world, will The Matrix Reloaded live up to the hype?The story for The Matrix Reloaded does not exactly take up where the original left off. To fully understand what is going on, one must rent The Animatrix on DVD and play the Enter the Matrix game but let us say that we are not all huge fanatics like the rest of the world. Here is the simple and basic story line for The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and man is fighting an ongoing battle with machines. Machines gained control of the world and put humans into slavery. They built a computer program called The Matrix which all are connected to except for a small few. Those small few would include Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last human stronghold. They are continuing their fight against The Matrix and searching for the answer to this question: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? That is as simple as you can get about this premise without confusing somebody or giving away most of the movie. It is highly recommended that you not see this film unless you have seen the original The Matrix. The story can be confusing even to those that have seen the original but it is still excellently done. It is amazing how intricate and complex the plot is that there is not a single action within the course of the film that does not have a significant action later on either in this film or in the next.The cast of The Matrix Reloaded is wonderful as it is expanded significantly from the original film. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo or The One. There was some question with the original if he could handle such an important role as this but Reeves totally proves his acting worth not only in the original but also in this film. Carrie-Ann Moss is great as Trinity. Her role is placed more center stage in this film allowing more screen time and more importance then some thought in the original film. Laurence Fishburne is, accourse, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to show more emotion with character this time around though not too much away from the normal emotions Morpheus had in the first movie. Jada Pinkett Smith is okay but one would think that her role will be bigger in The Matrix Revolutions. Monica Belluci's role is nothing more then eye candy for the young males. Her acting range is never really seen which is quite disappointing with such good word coming from her foreign films.The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the movie event of the summer but not quite as perfect as all the hype said it would be. As great as it is there are some things to pick at. What is with the constant huge kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity? Almost every time they are alone they are eating each other's face. I think after the first kissing scene we would have gotten the idea that they are in love with each other. Another thing that was a problem was the orgy scene in the city of Zion. Was that truly necessary? It went from being a totally sci-fi film to this porno flick. What was the deal with all the sexual references within the course of the film in general? Are they that desperate to attract and appeal to young teenage boys that almost every other scene has to include a sexual action or comment? You would think that this kind of film would be above all of that but guess not. Other then those comment, The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the film to see this summer. One should see this film for the special effects alone. Absolutely amazing though in parts they seemed a little much especially with the fight between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect by any standards but maybe that is what the film makers intended it to be. It is only half a film.

Lost the plot slightly,"I feel that this film isn't a patch on the 1st matrix film, as too much chatter and the love interest angle spoils the story.. Also too much kung fu, goes on and on making the fight scenes dull, should of had short action fight scenes instead. I liked the freeway action sequence, plenty to keep the audience happy.

Mediocre sequel.,"I enjoyed the first ""Matrix."" It had a good, fresh concept with interesting characters, unexpected twists and turns in the plot, downright excellent action scenes, and of course, state-of-the art special effects. It's not something that'll get on my best movies list, but it's pretty good.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is merely a little above average. It's got significantly better action and effects, but the plot just isn't as good as the original's.""Reloaded"" starts at what seems to be a few years after the original. We find that all this time, the cast has been fighting a war against the machines that operate the Matrix. It's actually been going on for over a hundred years. However, some events have been forming that lead Morpheus, the leader of the group, to believe that the events of some prophecy that foretells that the war will soon end are unfolding. Meanwhile, Agent Smith, who Neo destroyed in ""the Matrix,"" has returned. Seems his death resulted in his removal from the Matrix, but because he didn't want that, he's been reinstated as an ex-Agent without a purpose. He now has the ability to turn normal people into clones of himself through touch. To give himself purpose again, he must satisfy the machines by getting rid of Neo. And Neo is now having terrible visions of the future in his dreams that the Oracle confirms to be true.The special effects and downright astounding. Armed with a far larger budget than the original had, ""Reloaded"" truly goes for broke. The hyper-fast and slow-motion action scenes, production designs, and CGI are some of the best ever.The acting is pretty good. But no one really stands out. That you can definitely believe that they're all the characters they're playing is all you need to say.Come to think of it, the only real problem lies in the plot. First and foremost, the return of Agent Smith. I had bad feelings about the movie the moment I saw this in the trailer. But what I'd pictured was nowhere near as bad as what I saw. The excuse the bring him is pretty weak. Because he didn't want to no longer exist? How is that relevent? How does he get this new ability to turn people into copies of himself? Fortunately, Smith doesn't get too much screen time and therefore doesn't hurt the movie as much as he should.The rest of the plot ain't bad at all. But what makes the film mediocre to me is that there's just too much. There's at least three things going on that could be movies on their own. As a result, the movie is hurt badly; you can only do so much with so many subplots in two hours. So while all of them are good concepts except the return of Smith fiasco, they by necessity are not furthered enough.Which is too bad. In my book, ""Reloaded"" would probably be great with less subplots (and making sure the Smith ""resurrection"" was eliminated from the final script). Of course, it also ties directly into ""Revolutions."" I myself have never seen it and won't until it's released on DVD, but since none of ""Reloaded's"" plot points were ever resolved, I doubt if it rose above being ""Matrix Reloaded Part Two"" in quality as well as story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A 118 Minute Movie That Checks In At 138,"Here is a film that screams for tight editing.  Perhaps the third film will ultimately show that the Zion scenes were justified.  They appear to be introducing characters that may play a larger plot role in Revolutions.So, will the annoying kid have some key role in the third?  Obviously Cain will be important.  Will Niobe heal Morpheus and his shattered beliefs? Will Commander Lock be redeemed?  Will Counselor Hamaan play a key role in negotiating peace with the machines?If yes (or, given the Wachowski Brothers, more surprising plot twists), the scenes in Zion may make sense.  If no, then they are what they appear to be standing on their own, wasteful and self absorbed.  Regardless, we didn't need a love scene that has no heart to understand that Neo and Trinty's relationship has moved on.  Within this scene we didn't need the interruption at the elevator.  We already knew of Neo's Messiah status within Zion.  The Morpheus speech, tribal dance scene was embarrassing.Wouldn't the plot have moved along just fine if the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar had learned of Zion's plight via videophone communications with Zion?  In The Matrix we saw the world through the eyes of the Nebuchadnezzar's crew.  Knowing Zion existed was enough.  Wouldn't this have tightened the plot and kept the suspense tight.  The movie actually starts when the message from the Oracle is received.So, the flow is:Dream Sequence - Neo wakes up in bed with Trinity (gee, their relationship seems to have evolved) - Join Morpheus on the bridge and monitor a communication from Zion about their plight - Message received from the Oracle.Additional edits:Cut the length of the Burly Brawl by 3/4.  It looks fake anyway. The fight with Ghost is reminiscent of but a pale echo of the Morpheus/Neo encounter in The Matrix.  It is unnecessary and wastes time.A far better film.  Unless all this stuff really is setup for Revolutions. I'm willing to give the Bros. the benefit of the doubt although nothing in the trailer shows it's true.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first yet still good.,"Okay, so we all know the plot now so no need to go there.What a lot of people (me included) didn't realise at the time was there was a lot of film footage included in a video game that was released before this film.If you do a search, all of the clips can be found online.Once you've seen them, this second installment makes a lot more sense.Also, there is the ""Animatrix"" which also clears up some character arcs and dialogue. The first 4 shorts help in explaining certain points during this film.This is essential viewing before watching this film and whilst a novel idea at the time, really hurt the film when it was released as people weren't made aware of this.Out of the original trilogy, this is definitely the weakest entry. You can skip through large chunks of the film and it doesn't affect the main story.I expect somewhere out there, someone has probably edited this and the next one into one film, minus all the padding.Good action sequences, CGI looks a bit outdated now but not distracting and overall, not a bad story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than X2,"Where to begin... THIS MOVIE IS NOW #1 ON MY LIST!!!!  It used to be ""X2"" but now this one has beaten it down.

"Self-important, over-hyped, fast-paced and boring","Absolutely no spoilers ---First off, you'll probably find that it's worth seeing, but go in with resonable expectations...The action sequences are generally pretty well done, but the CG were overly noticable in parts.  It lacked the engaging plot of the first Matrix and tried to compensate with 15 minute fight sequences that leaving you wondering ""Why?"".The first Matrix was able to make its characters engaging without attempting to dwell too much on backstory, loved ones, etc... This film spends far too long on romance, back story, rhetoric and redundant dialogue.  Far too much is spelled out in some areas and then the film attempts to far too mystical in other respects.  It does neither especially well.In many ways, this film represents what it wrong with the Hollywood movie machine.  The flim is all about ""more more more"" in every respect other than the plot and the pacing.  The film is far too disjointed to be considered ""great"" and the fight scenes too long and tiring to be considered on-par with the original.I felt it diminished the original work, rather than enhancing it.

"Great sequel, but Reloaded needed to be Re-edited","I saw the matrix last night and rushed home at 1am so I can pull myself out of bed to get to work.  Needless, was it worth it, well after the disappointments of Starwars I and II, I fail to be ignorant to hype anymore but I was ooo-ed and ahhh-ed through out the movie especially during the fight scenes.  I do agree with some of the points of earlier posts of the weak plot fills and terrible ending but I wouldnt go as far as TERRIBLE and WASTE of money.  I guarantee  those people were clenching there fist and had gaping mouths open like I did through the fight sequences.  There will always be people like that and always want to be those who ""think"" they are beyond the masses by trashing anything good in anything.  (must give them purpose in this world)  Though Im not a fan of it, I did enjoy the audiences loyal applauses through out the movie which gave the idea we all generally wanted to see the characters succeed here but....THE DANCE SEQUENCE...not needed.  Seriously after the first literal 5 minutes I started to look around the theater and then try to find possible hidden meanings with the human primativeness that was needed to be addressed between man and machine. I was wondering if I was watching Dirty Dancing or Basic Instict...or even Shaka-Zoo-Loo.  I DID enjoy the furthering of this story.  There was more to this rather than ""oh, we did well with matrix 1 so lets make a more fighting sequel"".

What is the Matrix Reloaded?,"The Matrix Sequel overall is a good movie.  Not surprisingly it does what all middle films do in a trilogy it raises the stakes and leaves you hanging at the end of the film.  Much like Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars Trilogy, the Matrix Reloaded also changes the perceptions of the film series.  Although the change here is far less dramatic.I think what weakens the film was all the time they spend in Zion in the first half of the film.  It wasn't really necessary to spend 5 minutes in a montage of rave dancing and love making.  Nor was it necessary for the passionate speech to the masses given by Morpheus.  I prefer the more subtle and mysterious manners that the character displays while he is in the Matrix world.Outside of the drawn out love scene the love story between the Neo and Trinity works well and provides a nice reversal of roles from the first film.  This time out Neo knows whats going to happen and has to save Trinity.The film is good but it is much like all the other sequels that are out there right now.  It is yet another middle film in yet another trilogy.  We all come to expect some twist in the middle film now and you do get it here. Trilogies, over all are becoming tiresome and in a sense a genre all to themselves.  That said Matrix Reloaded is a worthy entry into the franchise and will most likely will further immortalize the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix creators, due to the large success that the film is going to be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Doesn't live up to the last one,"Its known that most sequels are not as good as the first (there are exceptions, eg terminator2), and reloaded is a perfect example of this. the first movie was 'fresh', an original idea, great effects. reloaded gives u the feel that it is a fast made movie to make more money off the name.the story is pretty much incomprehensible, and though the first was somewhat similar, it was a tough act to follow because the story itself required it to. here 'weird twists' seem to be put in just for the sake of making the story confusing.one thing that ticked me off was that the last one was rated R for the action. this one even though it has action has unnessisary nudity.don't get me worng...reloaded has its good parts, the action sences are amazing, especially a chase sence on the highway. the animation is great...but to make a great flim u also need a followable story...in the end the matrix reloaded is a good flim, but considering the time it took to make, it should have been great. no way near the original. more of a action animation bluff. and i hate movies that end with ' to be concluded'...a 5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Definitely an excellent movie, in my opinion the best ever","This was truly a great movie. I thought that it was the greatest movie ever, but before this I thought the Matrix was. Maybe to some of you you won't find it as great as I found it, but it really was, at least for the real fans of the original who understood what made it more than just good. Here's the thing- it is loaded with special effects, which is one of the reasons people enjoyed the first movie, but, behind that there is a great engrossing story and action movie that takes you deeper in than you would think possible. People say too many special effects; I disagree, and say that they are only a backdrop to aid in the movie. The people who have said things like that it had no plot or nothing new I have a few things to say A) They've probably seen so many movies it has jaded their perception when viewing a new and different movie, B) They must have been asleep because there is plenty new, and C) of course there is nothing BRAND NEW! It is a trilogy, not a series, so each movie builds on the last one. If it was something like (best example I can think of) Star Trek, they would have something new because they are not building to a final climax. They are in trilogies, like Star Wars or any other. I would say that the ending of this movie does definitely make you want to see the next one and that this movie takes everything that made the last one truly great and builds on it. The ideas of the Matrix are built up and the fight scenes are incredible. Maybe it is the people who enjoyed the Matrix but didn't love it, because they liked it for different reasons, but as for me I would say it is like the Star Wars of today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
the formula sellout,"worth every cent of the admission price for the explosions and fight scenes alone, this movie is a monument to subpar sequels.  albeit this movie was made with the forthcoming revolutions in mind, so a lot of the plot lines that it leaves hanging can be solved by saying, well the matrix: revolutions will tie them up.that does not satisfy me because 1. that's a cheap gimmick to make us pay to finish this movie, and 2. because it disregards the matrix reloaded's presence as a film of its own.If the Wachowski brothers are expecting the audience to see both reloaded and revolutions as one 4 hour long movie, then i must say the first 2 hours were filled with a paper thin plot glossed over with superfluous slow motion fight scenes.the action. the choreography has improved on a technical level, though the fight cinematography in this film now has an irritating tendency to favor strange angles over a wide view of the whole fight.  The kung fu though is overall much better thanks to the actors' additional training time since the first movie. the special effects are on the top of the industry and film history as usual, however there is one complaint to be made about innovation in this movie.  While the 'bullet time' developed by Gaeta in the first movie was a complete innovation, and the introduction of yuen wo ping's wire action fighting into american cinema was a bold move, we have nothing of the sort in this movie.  The first's action amazed on a new level as well as impressed on the basic level.  However in order to escape imitators, the Wachowskis have given us something no one could copy -- because it costs too damn much -- the highway scene, and the 100 agent smith scene. Essentially, they paid their way out of thinking up a new idea, the highway scene, though amazing, didn't bring action to a new level, but simply made it as big as possible.  Within the world of the matrix, where our suspension of disbelief is complete -- we can accept neo flying without too much laughter, and their immediate knowledge of fighting and motorcycle riding is alright in the matrix.  So when the fight scenes in this fantastic world do nothing new, it's like buying your favorite band's new album, and finding out that it's nothing but a collection of remixes.the drama/plot.laugh.  cliches like ""i love you too damn much"" and ""i'm never letting go"" are supposed to get us to believe that trinity and neo are in love?!  yes, the story says they are, yes other characters say they are, but with such stonefaced acting and poor fanboy writing, the love subplot did not succeed.as for the philosophy presented by the movie of causality and free will versus destiny, there is nothing new here.  While the first presented a mixture of philosophies and religious ideologies to create a new idea on the modern world and it's growing electronic foundations, this one does nothing to further that idea.  in fact, it regresses, and provides the same stock answer for every problem the idea of such a huge system like the matrix vs. real world brings up: it's not our purpose to ask.  There are many dramatic monologues that sound disgustingly deep through the use of big words, logic tricks, and tricky writing, but when analyzed, what they say is nothing deeper than a kid saying he stole the candy bar, ""just cause"".the movie does introduce some interesting ideas in terms of its own world however.  unfortunately, they come in the very last quarter of the film, and of course end abruptly in order to get you to watch the third one.in terms of characters, the main ones introduced are painfully undeveloped and depend on the experience of the first movie to make them 3 dimensional. If one were to watch this movie on its own, then it's easy to see how quickly all of the people in the story are made of cardboard, with their one way motivations and actions.conclusion. this sequel was a sellout.  instead of spending time crafting their characters and the complex world in which they lived [which had already captured the audience's imagination], the wachowski brothers opted to forge straight ahead, and pump out two sequels, paying their way out of writing real love, 'human' characters [neo seems more robotic than agent smith does], and a substantial plot.  We would have eagerly waited for a much better movie, but we got this first.

The most disappointing movie I've ever seen,"Notice how I didn't say the worst movie? This is the most disappointing movie I've ever seen because I expected so much more and felt very let down.

Lots of action - not much else!,"I'm afraid it never really got to Joel Silver what made the original Matrix such a success at the box-office. At least, that's the impression you get when watching this latest installment in the franchise. See, what I really liked about the first film was that not only did it have some amazing action sequences, more importantly, it also had a great and wholly original script, offering a very intriguing world vision. ""The Matrix Reloaded"", however, fails to deliver equally on both fronts. Particular attention seems to have been paid to perfecting the visual aspects of the film -- and the results are impressive, I have to say. It just doesn't cut it. It cannot hide the fact that the basis of this film is a... well, pretty weak script. I definitely would have liked to see much more emphasis being placed on story, while cutting back on some of the action. That would have made for a much more engaging film -- catering to the MINDS of people, as well as to the EYES.Rather than joining company with films like ""Crouching Tiger..."" and ""Minority Report"", this Matrix enters the ""Blade""-category.Disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Beautifully done....but empty,"I have to agree with other user comments that the Matrix Reloaded, while beautiful, is not exactly a clear movie.  For all the philosophical conversations breaking down this 'world' and explaining all, there are some particulars that are not fully explained.  I don't understand the limitations of Neo's powers inside the matrix.  He can fly at superspeeds...so why doesn't he just teleport to where he needs to go?  If he can stop bullets, why doesn't he just magically pull in a sword or gun from down the street for instance to help in his fight against the relentless Smith(s)?Also, since these characters have super powers, any acrobatic stunt they perform seems so unimpressive...the fight on the freeway, while VERY well done, didn't have the same type of drama a scene like that usually draws because we cannot relate to people with such power, the world around them has almost no effect.  So it comes across as boring...because being on top of a high speed truck is like nothing to them.  The fight scenes seem plain and redone, like I've seen this kung fu or what have you someplace else (but done with less charisma than by someone like Chan or Li).I just found myself not getting into the world of the Matrix, I found myself getting more involved in X2 since you can relate to the characters.  Even though those characters all have powers, they have weaknesses and still follow understandable laws of physics.Plus the philosophy of ""we hate machines...but we need machines....machines hate us....but they need us"" isn't deep at all, its just circular reasoning...that leads nowhere...how boring.

"Somewhat padded, but it still works","Despite its many shortcomings - the techno rave, the length and number of fight scenes - I must admit there is a lot about this movie I do like. Having not seen it for many years, and grown considerably since the last time, it manages to continue the narrative of the first movie in a convincing manner. That said, this movie suffers greatly from being the middle child of the original trilogy, being neither a beginning nor end to the story, and I can't help but feel that it's heavily padded to expand its runtime.Whereas the first movie was a more philosophical piece that only came to blows in the most desperate situations, this movie relishes in the almost endless action scenes with greatly exaggerated slow-mo shots and heavily choreographed fights. The action doesn't necessarily distract from the plot, but it can very much seem like they're stalling for time, since they could easily have trimmed the runtime with 30 minutes and it probably would've flowed just as well, or perhaps more ideally merged this with the third movie and eased up on the fight scenes. The fight scenes and the large sweeping shots are also where modern audiences might notice the blatant switching to CG, but is done well enough to not be too distracting, though it's definitely 2003.With that said, I obviously liked the movie. It doesn't feel like they're stalling for time because they're out of ideas, but more to emphasise their fight for survival, something Morpheus' overly dramatic speeches certainly speaks to, himself seeming more devoted to the cause than ever before. It does manage to bring back some of the philosophical questions of the first movie and build a bit further, but doesn't go terribly far, though there's some key elements to the story that you can't miss. While I would've liked more meat to the story, I still feel it's handled pretty well, and while I personally find the whole romance a bit tiresome, it's at least not simply tacked on to please the audience.Love it or hate it, it gets a pass from me for how much I like the premise of the story and sci-fi in general.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Metaphysical Graffiti,"Though merely competent overall, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a better movie than the original, probably because this time out directors/conceptualists the Wachowski Brothers have no tolerance for the muss and fuss of explaining themselves to their audience--they just go about their business of crafting a universe in which they can stage all the martial arts fights and epic car chases they want and doll it up with prohibitively dense metaphysics that have meaning only to themselves and those that want to pretend they're in the know. There's apparently no need to bother with what appear to be major plot holes (such as whether Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, whose woodenness makes him weirdly perfect for the lead, is human or not--everyone keeps reminding him he is, even though he can fly) or characterization (the actors either under- or overact and some are caricaturized--most notably Lambert Wilson as the campy Frenchman Merovingian--to the point of embarrassment). But what the Wachowski Brothers do well, they do exceedingly well: those martial arts sequences (choreographed once again by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen) and the climactic fourteen minute freeway chase are thrilling in their carefully analyzed revisiting of shopworn action scenes; they don't know when to quit, but for some reason, it's impossible to not be fascinated. (Note: this film was viewed in the IMAX format and it's a wonderful choice for such an elaborate production. But the seemingly high-definition format also points to the struggle makeup artists will have to deal with in the future: every zit and facial imperfection is highlighted for the entire world to see and if I were Laurence Fishburne, I'd have that thing above my forehead checked out.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Truly the worst movie of all time in the entire universe,"Too many people see a bad movie and then say ""That was the worst movie ever"" without thinking about it long enough. Well, I've seen many movies, thought about this one for a long, long time and THERE IS NO DOUBT: Matrix 2 is the greatest atrocity to film-making ever. No alien race and no era of man - could ever produce a movie worse than this. I could only imagine someone disagreeing with me if they have seen Matrix 3. If you have, I feel deeply sorry for you, even more so than the shared sorrow you must feel for me, knowing that I too have sat through this utter refuse.Compared to this, ""Howard the Duck"" has a plot like the ""Godfather"", ""Scooby Doo"" had special effects as good as ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Glitter"" had the impact of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Spice Movie"" had acting like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Gigli"" had the power of ""Platoon"". Everything about this movie is an utter travesty - and it takes itself so seriously that it is a capital crime against the human intellect.Some say it has classical references. I have a degree in classics and post-grad research in literature and can say with certainty that this pile of trash is an insult to every theme and philosophy it inanely goes in sight of. This movie was so numbing I did not have the strength to laugh; it was so preposterous I didn't have the will to cry. It simply left me feeling angry for having been so misused to sit through such nonsense; I honestly felt like I had been intellectually violated.Despite my moral opposition to censorship, I strongly recommend all copies of this movie be burned, along with it's successor.The first Matrix was OK though.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"At one point, the film seems to have something to do with a machine attack on Zion, the last city of human beings, and Neo's existential doubts about his messianic mission","After the resounding success of the first film, which revolutionized cinema, the second part of the planned trilogy initially arrives to end the public's anxiety. The Wachowski sisters try to expand the universe in a much more risky way in dealing with the public with new conceptual additions, which are shown in action or dialogues simultaneously. Here, the aim is to expand and ""self-conscience"" the philosophical discussion, varying between the struggle as a contextual end, or an easy resolution, and particularizing humanity as a principle for transcendent reach.After defeating the machines in their initial combat, Neo (Keanu Reeves) still lives in the Nabuconodosor alongside Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), the ship's new crew member. The machines are carrying out a major offensive against Zion, where 250,000 machines are excavating towards the city and can reach it in a few days. Nebuchadnezzar is summoned to return to Zion, to attend the meeting that will define the human counterattack on the machines. However, a message sent by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) causes the ship to depart again, taking Neo back to the matrix. There he discovers that he must find the Keyring (Randall Duk Kim), a being who holds the key to all paths in the matrix and who is held prisoner by Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci).Obviously, the films still have qualities, but it is clear here that the story took very questionable directions. The first Matrix made the right choices on the scale. Presenting a virtual world that machines use to enslave humanity while the real world is in ruins would be a lot for the public to process, so telling Neo's personal journey in this reality was a wise choice. Here, the script falls into a very common trap seen in sequels of great successes earlier, which is to try to maximize everything at the expense of the main plot. It seems that everything, necessarily, needs to be bigger and better, which results in several exaggerations. What was a concise and well-defined science fiction becoming an avalanche. Numbers, speculations, tentacles. It would be redundant to repeat this here, since the silent self-promotion of the Wachowski brothers works better, in persuasion and convincing, than the gears of a manipulative matrix. In the minds of the Wachowski sisters and producer Joel Silver, a continuation should, by digital logic, be an upgrade. Potentiated effects, more vertiginous action, multiplied beating, in addition to in-depth metaphors and symbolisms. It turns out that the result does not have the edges trimmed. There are excesses, of the most varied types.Perhaps what makes the Matrix a masterpiece is not the bullet-time, but the philosophical hints connected to the issues of the cyber world. There is no technological advance to replace an original and well-told story. In ""Matrix Reloaded"" the focus of Neo's story was removed and the protagonist was positioned as just another piece on a much larger board, the narrative lost much of its appeal. Dozens of new characters (from the city of Zion and the Matrix) come to just deliver vague dialogues and drive the script forward. Ironically, the new characters were as robotized and lacking in depth as computer programs and Neo, Trinity and Morpheus did not have enough time to develop the bows satisfactorily.
The newborn franchise then had a difficult task: to continue the plot even after the spectacular outcome, but without losing its charm. It didn't happen: the whole mystery of how the Oracle's prophecy worked, how Neo was so powerful and the fate of humanity was explained in the infamous scene of the Architect's monologue. The boring and sometimes incomprehensible explanation was a loss of immense quality, since the first film spoke deeply of philosophy and spirituality without losing its dynamics. The film's most crucial dialogue, between Neo and the Architect. In an attempt to create something rich and complex, the directors / screenwriters printed an exaggeratedly complicated language, notice how the dialogue with such a figure is full of ""difficult"" words just to complicate an idea that could be easily transmitted. Unfortunately, Neo's visit to the home of the Merovingian program (Lambert Wilson) is exceedingly long, making the feat of making a production associated with electrifying action and intriguing philosophical concepts boring and even monotonous. The pseudophilosophical speech yields 12 uninterrupted minutes. It is thought that the proposal is to support the ""seriousness"" of the film, but the content is identical to a dissertation written by a high school student who has just discovered Schopenhauer, Nietzche and Sartre. It is clear that this sequence, specifically, had the objective of linking some excellent action sequences through the streets, with trucks, cars and motorbikes, in some of the most inspired scenes in the film. Another notorious fact is the calculus of the machines, very well displayed in Matrix through the agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is abandoned here, exchanged for eternal flourishes that end up confusing the viewer. The idea that the whole story is cyclical and that the chosen one is practically created by the machines is then lost within extensive dialogues that seek to hide its true message.
With the exception of some genuinely spectacular sequences, thanks to brand new, laborious and ingenious special effects, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is one of the most boring, pretentious and confusing films of recent times. The whole action suffers from prolonged and often unnecessary sequences. In the first film, the fighting had a certain raison d'être: they were either part of Neo's learning or they were deadly duels against the agents, seen then as unbeatable. Now, the hero fights every ten minutes. He fights (for a long time), without major consequences, with a guardian of the Oracle, with the henchmen of Merovingius, twice with the Smiths. The impression we have is that the long and didactic pseudo-philosophical scenes are just a hook to generate action scenes. Another excess is that in the first film, Morpheus was the voice of reason and hovered over the others with his teachings. Now, all the characters have something ""intelligent"" to say about freedom, faith, choice, power, free will, destiny ... Philosophy has become a fetish. Obviously, the redundancy with which catchphrases are said causes wear and tear.At one point, the film seems to have something to do with a machine attack on Zion, the last city of human beings, and Neo's existential doubts about his messianic mission. The feeling of absolute disorientation is compounded by the fact that many scenes in the film are, in reality, mere continuations of plots developed in the video game Enter the Matrix and in the Animatrix short films. An excellent marketing scam, for sure. It is clear that these action scenes remain impeccable, bringing the most modern and advanced features in the cinema at the time of its release. Neo battling a hundred replicas of Agent Smith or Trinity falling in slow motion, on his back, while fighting a duel with an agent, in addition to the long sequences of chase through the streets are undoubtedly moments of pure cinematic joy. And they are almost worth the price of admission.The visual issue ends up gaining more relevance to the detriment of philosophical issues. In terms of deepening, we started from exactly where we were left in the first film. There are no didactic efforts to remind us of each of the elements already presented, which works in favor of the narrative of the work. The journey through the rabbit hole is now much deeper, taking us not only to Zion but to the fundamental principles of the Matrix. The production design maintains the same logic established in the long predecessor and brings us, through Zion, a true amalgamation of human cultures. With a scrapped appearance, full of mechanisms that seem to have been taken from the beginning of the 20th century, this last stronghold is filled by people who look more like refugees. The Wachowski remain true to their original premise in this regard and make minorities the majority in this ""real world"", remembering that only those who are not in love with the shadows projected on it leave the cave. The sequences in Zion rescue much of the spectator's astonishment when in the first film - now we know another side of this universe, which, however dystopic, still holds hope.Of course, other aspects are explored with a lot of category. The religious side is quite accentuated. Morpheus is, more than ever, the leader blinded by belief. Neo is, more than ever, the messianic icon. And the sequence of the party watered by sensuality and electronic music in Zion is emblematic. It does not just contrast human affection versus the coldness of machines. It also suggests that the unplugged become alienated in the face of a commanding voice and respond only to the carnal desires inherent in human nature. In the refuge city, there are even power and ideological duels between ship commanders and advisers. From this perspective, the routine outside the Matrix in itself becomes potentially explosive.Shortening the plot and removing several of the supporting characters (perhaps migrating them to the acclaimed animated miniseries Animatrix) and summarizing everything in just one film would have been ideal for Matrix. The impression ""Matrix Reloaded"" leaves is that the main concern was to deliver something visually even more striking than the first film and that most of the narrative only served to prepare the audience for the final duel of men against the machines in the coming ""Matrix Revolutions "". Despite new elements, little really contributes to the advance of history, but it is still very worthwhile to follow this sequence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The 3 major fight scenes - Neo vs. 100 Smiths, the Freeway chase and the Foyer fight, which account for perhaps over 1/2 the films run time, are worth the price of admission alone.  The penalty for seeing these amazing effects on the big screen though is the other 1/2.  The non-action scenes are truly gawd-awful, especially the 7 minute rave sequence in Zion where the directors suddenly decided they were filming a techno music video (and a very dull one at that).Every from the dialogue and pacing to the locations and music is merely a pale reflection of the original.  Matrix reloaded comes across more like a remake by people with less inspiration but more money.Let's hope the 3rd one can redeem this disaster and restore the mythology this one destroyed.Matrix provided intelligent philosophical ponderings on the nature of reality and freedom while interspersing fantastic fight scenes.  Matrix Reloaded interrupts it's mind-boggling fight scenes for ponderous and contradictory dialogue that tries to be philosophical but most often sounds forced and out of place, now trying to incorporate the nature of an artificial reality into it's overall philosophy, but doing it very childishly.If all you want are the great fights, go see this film, just be prepared to pay the price for that devotion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Makes Cyber Tracker 2 look like The Terminator.,"It's pretty hard to go from good to bad, especially if the good is very good and the bad is absolutely terrible. But the Wash-out-ski's managed to pull it off...and guess what? They did it on purpose.Yes, Andy and Lynda made this movie suck on purpose. The original Matrix (which isn't very original) was written well and several years were spent working on the script, and it shows. That's why so many people love it. So when making a sequel, the Wash-out-ski's realized that people will see it anyway, whether it's good or not. People going into this movie had nothing to judge it by except for the first film.The Wash-out-ski's may be thieves, liars, nerds, and homosexuals...but they aren't dumb. Why spend so much time and effort to make it good when people will go and see it anyway? That's exactly what they were thinking. It's why this film broke box office records and the second didn't come close. Because when going into the third and hopefully final Matrix film, the audience had more to judge it by. They saw how awful this piece of crap was, and decided not to see revolutions.So what's so bad about this movie? First, there's the dialogue. One chunk of exposition after another. Sitting there and watching a bunch of idiots explain everything is boring. There's also a big scene that explains why Tank is not in the movie. The problem is: we now know all of this stuff about Link...and we never knew that much stuff about Tank. He's an important crew member, but they never spent any time giving us details beyond that he was freeborn. We get this history of Link, his problems with his wife, whether he should be reassigned to another ship, etc. I know they were trying to make Link into the non-believer who comes to believe...but we didn't need boring scenes to do that.Then there's all the political crap with Morpheus and the commander. It's a boring subplot that we keep going back to but never goes anywhere. It kills the momentum of the story. There's also all the crap with the French guy and his (extremely hot) wife, where we learn about their marriage problems and all that. What the hell as the point of that? How is that any of our business? How does it advance the story? And the pointless fight scene with the Chineese guy...and then there's all the scenes where people are sitting around instead of DOING things.Then the protagonist...Neo. He starts the movie the same way as he ends it. No character arc at all. He's just a God-like being that can beat anybody. A recipe for great fight scenes? No. The exact antithesis.And speaking of the fight scenes...all I can say is WOW...and not in a good way.Agent Smith is back just for the sake of being there. Not just Agent Smith, but countless duplications of himself. This scene had the potential to be really cool, but literally everything about it was just wrong. First, they give away Smith's duplicating ability before the fight. So instead of a shock moment where he duplicates while fighting Neo, we go into the fight knowing this already. The use of CGI would not be so bad if it wasn't so blatantly obvious and poorly executed. The scene also went on for 3 times longer than it had to. Neo vs. Smith, a bunch of Smiths, and EVEN MORE Smiths. OK, we get the point! And we all know that Neo will defeat Smith(s). But no...THE HERO RUNS AWAY! How are we supposed to connect with this character and be on his side when he's running away from a fight?Then on to the big freeway chase. No suspense, no drama, no excitement at all. How can this be? Simple: CGI. It doesn't look like the characters are actually in any kind of danger. It looks like a video game. You know, a racing game where you just put the pedal to the metal and speed the whole way through it without a care in the world. Crashing into the walls? No sweat. We'll be fine. That's exactly what I was thinking while watching this scene. Oh no, I hope Trinity's stunt double doesn't crash head-on into a computer generated car! Give me a break. And let's not forget about the CGI ghost twins that look out-dated by more than a decade. Very scary indeed.I must ask this question: What is the plot of this movie? By the looks of it, there is none. Just seemingly random events happening to people we don't have any reason to care about. The first Matrix film was about Neo being the chosen one and all that, but what the hell is going on here? There's a big section devoted to this Keymaker character who is supposed to be extremely important and legendary...but that didn't work at all. Remember in the first film how legendary Trinity and Morpheus were, even before Neo met them? Here, the Keymaker is just some dude we never heard of before and doesn't seem all that important. He's no legend.And what happened to the mind-bending aspect of the original? Why don't we go down the rabbit hole in reloaded? Instead, it's all matter-of-fact, changing sci-fi to fantasy. Remember how cool it was that the mechanical devices like the bug they plant in Neo seem to be living organisms in the first film? Where's that kind of thing in this film? We're treated to boring politics, needless exposition and back stories of characters that don't really do anything that warrants the need to know all this personal information about them.I won't even comment on the horrible acting, bad directing, and the Neo-Trinity sex scene. That speaks for itself, as does the bile you will puke up after seeing it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Great Visuals, no Filling...","This movie reminds me of the lastest 2 star wars flicks.  Great graphics and CGI and horrible acting and or lack of plot.  The original was much much better than this movie and while the special effects in Reloaded were phenomenal, I just couldnt bear to watch the great plot of Animatrix Renaissance and the original Matrix be so discarded in favour of pointless action scenes. (Why did Neo fight 100+ Smiths? no reason, he appears out of no where).  Morpheus and Trinity have such minor roles compared to the first one and the human base is such a disgrace, its full of poor people in rags...yet they have hovercraft ships?  Give me a break, they all look like they came from a slave camp or something.  Theyre civilized im sure they have a tailor and they said they have water purifaction, im sure they can take baths too.

decent and enjoyable,This movie was all in all pretty good. i still prefer the first one but this one had really good fight scenes. it was quite confusing so it required absolute attention (i don't really get it because i was only half focused). the soundtrack was good but not as good as the first one.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"it was just like neo said - ""whoa""","i was very impressed with this installment of the matrix.  it's not every day that a movie that lives up to such colossal hype.  this will be a very satisfying moviegoing experience for most, yet it is not without flaws.i like my bad news first, so here are my gripes:  first, and most importantly, the thrill and serendipity of the first film proved impossible to duplicate.  when i walked out of the first matrix movie, i was completely blown away.  after four years of waiting and months of drooling over the trailers my ability to be surprised was lost.  second, several sequences take too long for what they accomplish.  the worst of which is the zion techno/tribal dance scene.  would have been so much better if it were half as long.there are two other common gripes that don't bother me, but i'll list them just to be safe.  the dialogue is, just as in the first matrix, more like a comic book than a shakespearean play.  while this will irk some viewers, it helps establish the atmosphere of the movie.  also, the more complex effects sequences will simply overwhelm many viewers.  i don't usually ascribe to the ""more is more"" philosophy, but i have never seen scenes this complex pulled off so well.now to the good stuff.  the effects.  i knew they'd be good, but wow. they are, bar none, the best special effects i have ever seen in any movie. the philosophical and mythical aspects of the film have been expanded on quite a bit.  there are definitely times when a degree in philosophy would come in handy.  you don't have to understand it all to enjoy yourself, but this movie will give you plenty of ontological and ethical questions to chew on. finally, neither the atmosphere of the matrix universe nor the wachowski brothers touch have not been lost.  lots of cool close ups and camera angles give this film a very cool feel and texture.  overall, one of the best times i've ever had at the movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Much Anticipated Sequel Is Here At Last!!,"The Matrix Reloaded is another great film from the Wachowski Brothers. There is much more action for all of you buffs out there. The fightings scenes are well done, but also a little over done at times as they seem to be more Computer Generated rather than interesting filming techniques like in the first film. Nevertheless you will probably be amazed be the action. The story is much more complex this time and rather hard to understand. It's fine up until the end when Neo meets and converses with a special someone, but after that your mind will become numb trying to figure it out.

"unbelievable stuff, no letdown!","i´ve just come home from the premiere of reloaded, and it was great. i had read everything i could get my hands on in the months before today, and i was a little scared that the movie would disappoint me. but it didn´t - it was great. the fight scenes, the stuff they call ""virtual camera"", the ultra-speed flying... it was great, and, yeah, there´s only one word: cool. kind of the only stuff worth mentioning that speaks against an absolute high score was that cgi people STILL don´t look 100 per cent convincing. movie special effects have gone a long long way since star wars, terminator, and gollum, but to this day, you can still spot where characters are real and where they´ve been created. i´m waiting for the movie in which it´s going to be perfect, but ""reloaded"" still doesn´t make it.nevertheless, this movie rocks. i had tears in my eyes (once more) when neo pays back what trinity has done for him and again they show their love. the deadly jealousy with persephone is a great scene, and so are the first pictures we get of zion (the defense systems).all in all, this is great stuff. i already have tickets for the german premiere in 6 days, a matrix doubleheader pre-premiere (i´ve been to the netherlands just so i could see it a couple days before it starts in my homeland!), and it´s gonna be great. watch this movie, and wait for revolutions like i do. i´m dying to know more about neo´s new-found powers...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
uneven,"Alright... I realize that the second movie in a series has some difficulties to begin with. People already know most of the plot so to develop that seems pretty pointless. There is almost no plot development here but I think I can live with that.Comparing this to the first movie seems therefore unfair but what is one to do?Where the first movie was very philosophical this just seems like plain action. Not much thought behind the plot and different realities. Further the action scenes that were so different and new in the first one are still there to some extent but you can sense the computer technology behind the camera (so to speak). At some points it seems like the actors are hanging in string.So what do I think about the concept as a whole? I think it's very uneven, at points it's really good (mostly at the end). Sometimes it's a real drag though and I think it's mostly because of the lengthy fight scenes. It feels like they could be reduced by several minutes to give the movie a more healthy length.Too long Too ordinaryBUT I liked the last few minutes so I'll give it 6/10Movie-Man",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
9 on a scale of 10,"I liked this version of Matrix better than the original, though I know that is the exception. In my opinion the action sequences were stunning - in fact the best I have ever seen in any movie. They just keep taking it to the next levelThough the action was also corny, it was amazing to see what they can accomplish in cyberspace. Frankly, I loved the scene where NEO fights about 50 of the bad guys. Ludicrous? Yes. But, entertaining? A much bigger yes.Did I understand all of the plot? No way. But, at the same time, I'm not sure I needed to. This is about a big picture story of machines versus man. I can understand that and that's all that matters.I am anxiously awaiting volume III. Fortunately, I waited until II was out on tape before I saw it, so I can see III anytime without losing too much to memory.If you like pure, raw action you will like this movie.

Powerfully disappointing insubstantial eye-candy,"When The Matrix came out, it was a concept film. Keanu dodged bullets famously, and redefined cool, and all that, but the very concept of The Matrix/The Real World was truly overwhelming. It blew everyone away by forcing them to think.Reloaded, while taking special effects to a whole new extreme, lacks the force of concept. Rather, it's non-cept. The entire premise is rather reminiscent of the plot-lacking Mission:Impossible, all very well for drops of sweat crucially dropping onto gloves, but that's about it. With an unfortunate non plot ridden full of far more holes than Trinity's body, Reloaded disappoints sorely.As for the effects. Trinity, on the Ducati. Wow. This is worth ticket price alone. As with the original, Reloaded changes your views on just what technology can be done, used brilliantly. But it's a wee bit tired. So there are a hundred clones of Agent Smith - fantastic. So Keanu can fly. So everyone leaps through enormous distances and slows in mid air, turns, and kicks, before flying through solid walls. Yawn. We've seen it before. Done far better this time, but, really, what's new?The characters, too, are upsetting. The epitome of cool, Morpheus, is now a droning, evangelising Bible salesman. Trinity, well, rocks. So do the bad guys, who have fabulous lines. Persephone, we see too little off to even drool over. But Keanu - tsk, tsk. Walking around, shades wrapped around, he's confused as ever, asking painfully obvious questions, with conveniently small syllables. Duh. Makes you wish his one-time identity, Ted Logan, was 'the one'.Finally, Keanu. The whole ""Superman thing"". Please. I know you think it's fun.

"Pretty Gloss, But Less Underneath than First Film","What made The Matrix such a phenomenon was a perfect balance of visual-warping and mind-warping elements. Here the balance is terribly out of whack. The plot can essentially be summed up in a few sentences, but the extended effects scenes could take an hour to describe. And they're not even crucial to the plot. While I enjoyed this movie, it was more the enjoyment of a roller coaster than a supposedly thought-provoking movie. There are some interesting plot iterations and set-up in Revolutions, but they seem to be poorly tacked on at the end, a reminder that ""oh, yeah, and then this stuff will matter in the third movie"". The much-raved about fight scene between Neo and the Smith flock drags on far too long and looks horribly fake at some instances (very, very video game). Similarly, the non-action parts of the movie feel more like a middling RPG. ""Go here, talk to this person, get this, then fight some more people..."" The first third of the movie (set mostly in Zion) wants to be intriguing plot set-up, but just isn't. The extended rave sequence has even less plot relevance than the overlong fights. Also during this point the warning bells of ""this is like Star Wars!"" go off the loudest. My only other complaint would be the music. With the exception of one techno Latin chorus fight song (itself a poorer version than other examples), the music seemed limp and unequal to the visuals. The soundtrack lacked the driving force of the first one. (The psuedo-patriotic music that cues up during Morpheus' pep talk was particularly annoying.)All in all this is a fun movie. But the fun is at a far more superficial level. Yes, there are unanswered questions, but they just don't seem as important in the first one, where the driving force was the need to know the truth. The Matrix inspired both thought and energy, ironically Reloaded will leave you feeling drained and dazzled by mindless spectacle.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Reloaded with Blanks,"The initial Matrix is one of the most innovative science fiction movies I've seen. When I first saw it, it took me by complete surprise (c'mon, it's a Keanu Reeves movie), and it provided one of my more enjoyable movie-going experiences in 1999.  Like all great science fiction, it brought a new, terrifying, and wildly believable world to life.  All I could say was ""wow"". When I heard that this was only the first of a trilogy of Matrix movies, I had more than a little trepidation. How could the Wachowskis jump-start the second while improving upon the original?Well, the answer is, they couldn't. The second installment, The Matrix Reloaded, doesn't hold a candle to the original. But all of the principals from the first are present; what went wrong?Well it's the Star Wars Syndrome. But at least George Lucas gave us three great movies before stumbling, the Wachowski's mustered only one.

"a script excellent in places and pompous in others, overcomplicated and nonsensical plot despite some great action pieces and characters","Although far less well-rounded and structured than the first, it has some arguably superior action sequences, but even they become tiring and repetitive before their individual climaxes. I personally found the highway scene the most entertaining, and it's quite impressive the things that were accomplished, cinematographically and choreographically. With far more elaborate and unique characters than the first, it can feel like too much at times. And for the most part, it is. The script and dialogue is often brutally complicated and overlong, especially the Architect scene, which is later summarized beautifully in less than 20 seconds by Keanu. To that point it honestly felt like the writers were trying too hard. And the Zion party scene, good God, it went from tribal drums to a DJ-run dance club and dragged on for far too long. These aside, I particularly enjoyed Monica Bellucci, Hugo Weaving's enhanced personality, and the epic ""ending."" Unfortunately the most annoying thing about this movie was the ignorance of ""non-believers""; Neo can fly and fight hundreds of Agents without breaking a sweat, but still wears raggy clothes and is treated like a peasant. People speak about hopelessness and never acknowledge his existence, let alone his presence in a room.

You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.,"Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) continue their battle against the machines in THE MATRIX RELOADED, the second chapter of Larry and Andy Wachowski's MATRIX trilogy. As RELOADED begins, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus arrive in Zion with new crew member Link (Harold Perrineau), and discover that 250,000 dreaded sentinels are close to launching a massive attack on the underground haven for the liberated minds of humanity. When Neo seeks advice from the prophetic Oracle (the late Gloria Foster), their meeting leads to a sorely outnumbered fight with Neo's old nemesis, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). While the sentinels advance on Zion, various battles within the Matrix continue to escalate, culminating in an extended highway chase sequence involving Morpheus, Trinity, more imposing agents, and two new adversaries--the relentless white-clad Twins (Adrian and Neil Rayment).With RELOADED, the Wachowski brothers delve deeper into both the realm of the Matrix and the apocalyptic, machine-controlled future reality. Initially giving ample attention to both the romance between Neo and Trinity and to the vast underground city of Zion, the film eventually delivers one stunning set piece after another, with the amazing martial arts sequences and jaw-dropping effects of the first MATRIX elevated to even more astounding heights. In addition to the returning cast of Reeves, Moss, Fishburne, Weaving, and Foster, Perrineau and Jada Pinkett Smith make for welcome new additions, and Monica Bellucci offers up an unforgettably sensual appearance. Larger than the original scale on every level, THE MATRIX RELOADED is a thoroughly entertaining sequel that will leave viewers eager for the trilogy's conclusion, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Well, upgrades; so to speak.","Well, one thing is getting more evident as these few years pass by: while in the 70's Star Wars made millions of fans go to the theatres and buy merchandise; now, in the late 90's and early 21 st century, piles and piles of movies try up to be the inheriters of the Star wars saga: The Matrix, X Men, Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter. When the first Matrix came out back in 1999, it became an instant success: it had a provoking message, state of the art special effects and truly dazzling gravity-less fights. Within a year hundreds of movies referenced in bigger or smaller amounts, the fights that changed movie History. It isn't necessary to be the movie's Oracle, to understand that sooner or later the sequel (or maybe two!) would be coming with the underling of being truly essential to the story. And as they said many times troughout the movie, upgrades have been done. In every possible aspect... of technology. All the subtileness of the first movie is now gone to leave room for special effects fanfare and sound galore. However the storyline and provoking messages were lost among the four year lasting filming, that clearly only took that long for the sake of its dazzling action sequences and special effects; so it is sad to report that after four years of waiting, Reloaded is clearly inferior to the predecessor, because the Watchowskis pushed farfetched more than they actually could, so this sequel commits all the mistakes the lower sequels do: reference success movies as much as they can. Regarding that, Star Wars fans will rejoice, since the references to the galaxy far, far away abound -- the whole of Zion, the counsil and the counselors, the ships and the trio of heros. But the filmmakers weren't satisfied: they had to invade the comic books, specially the far better X2: Neo can take any hard hit like if he had an iron skeleton like Wolverine; he's telechinetic like Jean Grey; he controls bullets like Magneto, and if it wasn't enough he had to be superman either. The film can be nitpicked - as it is being gradually - but it is not that bad, popcorn at its most. So far the year has clearly a winner: X Men 2 over the Matrix Reloaded, Hugh Jackman over Keanu Reeves, and while The Matrix has dozens of fights and slightly better special effects, X Men 2 has Nightcrawler's homicide attempt on the president, that solely beats the entire Reloaded thing.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"Okay, everybody had high expectations on this one and it seems it did not live to it. I, for one, think differently.Actors: I have to say congratulations to Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne for their performance. The others were not that great, but still managed to deliver a good performance. Scenario: Not as toughtful or complex as the first one, but MUCH better than most sci-fi movie since the original. The ending is anticlimatic and the movie is set between the Matrix and Revolutions, meaning it has no true start nor end. Even so, it's enjoyable and I can't wait for the next one. Visual effects: Come on!The philosophical aspect, altough less profound, blends well with the action scenes, which are more present than in the first one. So in a few words, it is a great movie. So sad most people had anticipations so high that they actually did not enjoy the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Did I expect too much?,"After enjoying the first Matrix, I'd been waiting for this film with great expection, like many other people.The Matrix Reloaded, however, disappointed me.  The scenes that Oracle and Architect explain about the Matrix are too long and boring. I felt like I was in some kind of philosophy lecture rather than in a theater. Movies shouldn't explain verbally too much.  That's why it's called ""movie"" and not ""talkie"".The action sequels are amazing and spectacular but they are not as fresh as the first Matrix and they are also too long.  I got bored while Neo was beating the crap out of the agents but they kept increasing. The scene when Neo flies like Super Man is embarrassing.The scene that shows some dance party in the city also is uncessarily long.The editin is one of the biggest reasons why this film is so boring and rough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad by movie standards, but bad by Matrix standards.","Movie quality is a relative thing. While Reloaded isn't utterly terrible, it's by far the worst of the series.The plot is Reloaded's strongest point. It would be rather pathetic for the movie to have a bad plot, after all; it's simply picking up where the Matrix left off, and it's rather difficult to mutilate the storyline of the original movie THAT badly. Without giving away too many spoilers, let's just say that there are enough plot twists to keep you guessing, not an overload to simply annoy you, and the very end has a couple nice ones which will make you want to see Revolutions.The original Matrix movie wasn't just about action, although that was a major part of it. There was an almost philosophical touch to it all, especially with the dialog of Fishburne's character, Morpheus. While Reloaded has a bit of that, it makes certain that you realize this movie is 99% about the action. And that's a problem, because the action in this one is not up to par. Oh, the choreography is great and all, but fights get rather repetitive when, for example, literally about 40% of the fight between Morpheus and the Agent is slow motion. Neo versus Agent Smith(s) is repetitive as well, and most annoying is the slow motion once more for one simple reason: Neo and the Agents are CGI in many scenes, which would go unnoticed if they didn't show it in slow motion and zoom in on their plastic-toy-like faces! Basically, technology gets in the way of what could otherwise be decent action.Acting in Reloaded, while not quite as good as the original in a way that is difficult to explain, is still quite satisfactory. Dialogue is good as usual. These and the plot would all bring up the movie's grade enough to counteract the low ""Action"" score if Reloaded could put less emphasis on action. Granted, its plot makes that more difficult; the original Matrix had much more time in the real world despite never visiting Xion, while Reloaded takes place almost entirely in the Matrix, where the action is. Nonetheless, unless you don't mind a barrage of annoying special effects, it simply distracts too much from the better parts of the movie. A good movie, but a bad Matrix movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Well done...Although hope this will not spoil you,"The Matrix is definitely a movie to see a few times throughout the summer. And if you are into sensory overload then this movie should be done a number of times. The plot is probably the only thing that is overdone but can be seen as the movie progresses. The characters don't really look as if they have grown since this is suppose to be over a year later. The double talk is over done (if you like to go round and round). The action is good and the characters have really exceeded themselves in preparing for this round. Although I think that they should have tried to do with less CGI. Over all.. I think I will see this movie at least one more time before November. That is when ""the Revolution will be in real time"". I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Sequel to the Matrix in my opinion,"Amazing movie I've ever watched from the Matrix Series, my favorite scenes has to be Neo Fighting the Agent Smith Clones, the beginning scene, The intense Highway chase fight scene, and everything else in the movie is so amazing, this movie came out in 2003 (the same year revolutions & the video game Enter the Matrix came out) for its 2-part conclusion of the matrix trilogy, i still watched this movie after the 1999 movie when i bought the Deja Vu collection on iTunes, it has to be the greatest matrix movies I Have ever watched in my opinion, The One does the best fights ever done in this movie too, Red pill or Blue pill?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"First hour a snoozer, the rest great","I guess it's not very fair to put down The Matrix Reloaded, considering how hyped I got to see it. The first hour was very boring. The first movie didn't have a lot of action in it in it's first hour, but it was very interesting. The LONG speeches in the second one killed off my excitement. The battle with Agent Smiths and Neo (Agent Smith is one of my favorite movie villians) was allright. The action was great, but the fight a bit too long. The movie started to turn with the chase between the good guys, the agents and two awesome characters, The Twins.

what the hell happened?,"While I was a big fan of the first movie, I was startled at how incredibly BAD this movie  was.

The dialog is ponderous, pretentious, and  down-right silly. There is a painful sequence combining what looked like a beer  ad shot at a caveman rave, cut together with an embarrassing love scene. The film is packed  with minor, irrelevant characters (introduced in the sequel) and dull and distracting  subplots. Even the action sequences all start to look like really really fancy PS2 games.This movie is almost as bad as AI.On the other hand, I took a certain perverse delight in the movie.

The one i saw was great action cool characters and a plot that while it is a fundamental story of good vs. evil it has hints and secrets that you will have to figure out. I'm writing this review quickly so people will actually read it so bare with me.  The first time through the action will knock you flat then the second time it will do the same then the story will start coming together for you, so if you havent seen it then dont listen to the naysayers just check it out challenge yourself, mayeb you are smarter than the movie but who cares enjoy it for what it is and don't say it has no plot or point because thats insulting the creators of the film who im sorry to offened anyone on here made a better movie than i believe any of you given the resources could possibly create.In the end its a great movie and will be the most entertaining and thought provoking movie you will see until 28 days later, so check it out and ignore the imperfections because their few and far between.

As good as it possibly could be - which means great.,"Reloaded shows one thing for certain : the talent of the Wachowski brothers. Although nobody doubted their ability to create the most amazing action scenes, with guns, kung-fu or cars, the "" serious "" part of the movie ( explanations, dilemmas, or even love scenes ) are quite smoothly done -in my opinion better than in The Matrix .This means the Wachowski bros. have just created the new definite reference trilogy; a modern mix of all the ingredients the audience ( 10-30 years old as a target ) loves: sci-fi ( and they're very good at it ) kung-fu , car chases , swordfight , all of which done with unprecedented talent and efficiency, but also drama. One of my fears before seeing the movie was that it would be too much turned towards the "" Prophet Neo "" side, in a ridiculous sort of way. Well, this aspect is of course important, but it is not overdone, and Neo, even though he looks like some kind of Year Zero fighting priest, is a very good chararacter. Morpheus still takes himself a bit seriously, but that's part of the deal. After all, Star Wars took itself seriously too.In the end, I decided that the ""classic"" parts of the scenario, which is basically what happens in Zion ( the young and eager rookie, the old and wise counselor ) weren't too important, that the ""deja-vu"" from other movies ( the movie is much closer to Ghost in the Shell then the first one, and there is a Total Recall kind of twist ) were very well adapted and again, part of the deal : mixing genre movies with a great talent.As for what remains the main attract of the movie : the action, it is of course amazing, unseen before, and you get lots of it ( some scenes last over 20-25 minutes ) with extraordinary visuals and eye-candy.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Why all the gripes?,"I just saw this movie last night at a sneak preview, and i thought it was great then i came home and came on here and theres a bunch of people who are bashing it.  Now i will admit the first half hour or so were slow, and the philosophy while cool and everything really didnt add a lot to the story. But all that aside look at the action and the plot which many have neglected to mention has thickened and become much more involving, but i wont ruin the end for anyone.Now i will admit almost every scene in the film seemed to drag but if you think about any other movie, they always drag at some points and have a few interesting scenes.  But with this movie you have the scenes that drag that are still better than the good parts of most movies, that lead up to the scenes that completely blow away anything you have ever seen before.Also i think that they made these scenes long for a reason,not the dialogue but the fighting, it is meant to show how difficult and arduous the fight has become for out characters. Beacause after Neo's 15 minute fight with the Smith's he says ""that was the first time i have felt like dying"".So complaint after complaint if you really think about it there is a ryme to their reason, the fight scenes are meant to show difficulty in the long battle they are in, and the seemingly pointless dialogue all has a way of playing itself out in the end, i would use more examples but I dont want to ruin the film for anyone.Bottom line: I thought the way this film was made was amazing and well worth the money and time spent, and I will be very suprised if anything can even touch this , this year besides its own sequel and The Return of the King. 9/10 upon second viewing i think it will be 10/10(might have missed something).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

In an era of instant gratification, it seems few can find enjoyment in anything, much less a work of years in the making.

"Not as good as the first, but then how can it be?","Originally I didn't want to review this movie until I saw Revolutions, the third part of the trilogy.  The reason: Depending on how they resolve this cliffhanger I could either love or hate this movie.  The way they left it though, it looks like a bit of cop out, but I'll tell you no more.  Instead, I will review on its own merits, ignoring the cliffhanger.This movie had better action scenes, and better special effects, but other than that, the first one was better.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a great action movie, but as an SF movie it is rather average.  But then again, once the premise is laid out with such perfection, how can this one be better than the first?  In other words, the whole premise is told, and the conclusion will be told in the next movie, this one is all middle.  So what we have in this one is great action scenes.  There is a lot of philosophical talk in this one too, some of it is thought provoking, but it is not on the level of excellent Science Fiction.  We also get to see the city of Zion, an impressive piece of work I might add.  We learn more about human society, and about some of the rogue programs that never got deleted. We also get quite possibly the best car chase in cinematic history.  This movie is like a great a ride that seems to keep going a little too far past its welcome.  Everything's good until the last 15 minutes.  The cliffhanger ruined it a bit for me.  7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Over the top,"I had such high expectations of the movie that it could only disappoint me. And it did. Of course the action scenes are overwhelming and never seen anywhere before, but it is just too much. After five minutes we've seen all the kung-fu moves there are. Why the **** do they all fight like Bruce-Lee? If Neo can stop bullets with his hands, he has such a great momentum in his arms/hands that he should be able to erase a person with a single blow of his arm. And not be fighting for minutes. The whole movie thrives on two action scenes, of which the last is, though cinematic-technically brilliant, stupid. Why would they chase each other in cars if, for example, the 'ghost twins' can fly. I mean there are a lot of these inconsequent things ( it is a matrix, a visualisation of numbers in which every move and position can be predicted, so there is no need to chase or fight each other, the outcome is already known). But overall,  I enjoyed the last hour of the film most and there are some nice ideas displayed. I like the corridor with 'back doors' idea.  The first 30 minutes are sometimes toe-bending (what is that in english?) I mean very sh**ty.

Amazing action upholds an underachieving story,"I'm a huge matrix fan; my expectations for this movie were extremely high, given the quality of directing by the Wachowski brothers.  Bound, the directors first movie, was a breathtaking movie with an incredible storyline.  The original Matrix managed to sustain an excellent story while boasting spectacular special effects in an awesome sci-fi thriller.  And then there were three...Without the mystery and intrigue of the original (beginning with the fanfare that asked ""what is the matrix?"") the original needed something to captivate the audience once again.  In an attempt to replicate the originals success in this area, The Matrix: Reloaded attempts to grab us with Neo's dream/prophecy of his love, Trinity, dying to an agent.  This is a decent nail-biter but nothing special, and the movie fails to gain much momentum with a total action/storyline imbalance.The action in this movie is incredible, and there's LOTS of it.  This is countered poorly with uninspired scenes outside the matrix, mainly inside a dreadfully boring Zion, the last human city.  The love scene, the dreams, the partying and the propaganda going on inside Zion feel out of place. The pacing does not build up momentum and the ups and downs of the movie are sporatic, leaving the audience with tidbits of a great scenes that feel independent and out of place.The revelation as to the reason of the one and why he exists is ingenious and one of the best scenes in the film, but without the proper building blocks prior to it leaves this crucial piece of the story alone in the dark. Trinity's rescue is almost identical to Neo's and reminds me of the second Death Star in 'Return of the Jedi'.  In the final minutes of the movie, both the unexplained and the predictable coincide to leave us with a pathetic anti-climax that feels like we've reached the middle of the movie.And, from a broader perspective, that's exactly what it is.  The final two films are, in reality, one movie cut into two, which is a shame because the storyline feels underdeveloped.  Had both been together this movie could surely have been salvaged and turned out quite well.  But as a standalone movie it leaves us with several memorable scenes as well as some incredible fighting scenes- like pieces of a puzzle not properly put into place.In the end, we can only enjoy the groundbreaking action, wonder what could have been and hope the final movie in the Matrix trilogy can salvage a potentially Indiana Jones like series.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Some issues,"With the effect that `The Matrix' had on me, I should say that `. Reloaded' is not great at all. Some scenes are hilarious by their triviality: - The Karate ones are far beyond the Chinese movies (that only a fan of this kind of movies could tolerate), even though technically better-made - The `philosophical discourse' is rather ridiculous. If `The Matrix' was implied by post-modern criticism on Media (ref. Baudrillard), the speeches on causality, prophecy, destiny, and so on in `Reloaded' are rather a cheap blah-blah-blah - Somehow it reminded me of many other movies: Independence Day (Morpheus at the Temple and the US President at the military base), Aliens (Zion Defensive System vs. killing the Alien Queen); Doctor Quinn - The medicine woman (The bullet extraction and the brain surgery the woman made in the 19th century in the middle of nowhere), Star Wars (POD Race and the highway) - The `vision of Matrix' made by the green ASCII characters is too funny to take it! And the Oracle body-guard, what to say, has shiny yellow characters!!! - Even the music repeats from the first in the series! (at least during some scenes) - In the scene against the Smiths one can see that the guy is NOT Keanu Reeves! (Of course it's not him! But a better make-up of the stunt was required!) - The Superman thing is incredible! They could've thought of something better! - No mystery! No thrill, only waiting for the end! - Trinity's jealousy was out of nothing, but ridiculous.I am sorry to have so many negative comments. I was a fun of `The Matrix' (I watched it more than 35 times, I have the videotape and the DVD, whatever else materials regarding it, even 2 DIVx versions on CD's). I watched Reloaded a couple of times; to be sure I see a sequel of that masterpiece instead of some naive follow-up. I am sad of concluding that the movie is worse than any pessimistic expectation. Besides the charm of the plot, the talent of the actors, it is only a Karate movie, with Sci-Fi in it, and FX. Lots of FX.

Another Great Ride Down The Rabbit Hole,"Reloaded is very different from the first installment. This movie is much deeper and more thought provoking. The Matrix told a story and handed it to you in a neatly wrapped package. Reloaded goes much deeper down the Rabbit Hole.Some have complained about lack of plot in Reloaded. Those few I've spoken to that didn't like it just plain didn't get it. This movie is MUCH more sophisticated than the first, and has taken that neatly wrapped package, opened it up, and explored its contents thoroughly.

Because they can...,"The much awaited ""The Matrix Reloaded"" by Andy and Larry Wachowski is entertaining, great looking, bewildering, and ultimately an exercise in making a big budget movie, ""because I can"" rather than making a complete movie-- which The Matrix was. I liked the movie, although there is something missing in this one. ""Reloaded"" clarifies The Matrix, and then goes down the path of layered cyber-reality coupled with both Bibical and Buddhist references. What is the Oracle? And who is the Architect of the Matrix? Is Neo really the One?The acting is uneven. And is this surprising given the quality of the first movie. Lawrence Fishburne really chews up the scenery in a couple scenes as Morpheus. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss fare much better by underplaying their roles. My friend, Carrie-Anne, is very good-- I thought. Then again I am biased in this. As Trinity, Carrie-Anne is strong, sexy, and vulnerable. Keanu returning as Neo is efficient, and perhaps a little too stoic for the evolving role of the chosen One.The visuals in Reloaded are absolutely stunning-- the highway sequence is totally amazing. The fighting sequences are excellent. The one thing that was missing for me, was an emotional investment and payoff. Reloaded is high on cool, and very Zen-ed out. At times it is like (really when you think about it) The Wizard of Oz jacked on steroids and coke. However, Reloaded lacks some of the charm and humanity of The Matrix. This may be one of the dangers or pitfalls of catching a Messiah tale in Act 2. ""Reloaded"" is also a bit significant about itself. What made The Matrix great, is that it was a cool action movie with a rather novel concept. People just read significance into it. At times ""Reloaded"" is a convoluted philosophical sledgehammer. Anyway, I may be too far down the rabbit hole on this one...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Drags for a while, but it really does pick up by the end","So, I'll say it first: The Matrix sequels are failures of imagination. I think this hobbles the first sequel more than the second since the first takes place mostly in the Matrix and the second takes place mostly outside of it, but there's still a surprising mundane feeling to the basic plot mechanics that feel like a let down after the promise at the end of the first movie. That being said, you review the movies you get not the movies you wish you got, so, taking the failure of imagination in stride, here we go.It's been some time since Neo woke up and changed the rules of the Matrix. They're freeing more minds than ever and feel like they have the machines on the run. You know, for a sequel to a movie that started so incredibly well, the opening hour of The Matrix Reloaded borders on boring. The slow and steady reveal of reality in the first is replaced by just so much talking about how things have changed. We don't really see any of how things have changed, and we dive headfirst into the entire trilogy's problems which are its insistence that its philosophical musings are more important than the story. Instead of trusting the audience to find the ideas of choice and free will in the actions of the characters, the Wachowskis have the characters talk, and talk, and talk about choice and free will, about belief, and about the situation at hand. Surprisingly little is shown. Even the important information that the machines have started drilling towards Zion, the last human city, is conveyed through dialogue, a choice hobbled by the fact that so much effort went into The Animatrix and the short ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" which ends up acting as a prologue that's not actually part of the film. This push for a multimedia story was a mistake, and they should have really focused on telling the story as well as possible in the actual movies.After endless talk, an extended rave scene meant as defiance against the machines, and a couple of well executed but pointless action sequences, Neo revisits the Oracle and the movie actually feels like it begins...an hour in.But, of course, we also need another long talk about choice and free will, and then she gives him the first in a series of clues that he needs to follow to reach the Source. There's a very video game-esque feel to this where they have to go one place, talk to someone, have a fight, go another place, have another fight, and then get to the place. However, I've always thought that the entire Matrix saga is best when it fully embraces spectacle, and that's ultimately what The Matrix Reloaded does in its last hour. The fight in the palace, the chase through the freeway, and every variation along the way is incredibly well executed. There's a cleaner, glossier aesthetic to the visuals than in the original which robs the action of some of its visceral power, but it's still a great spectacle. The final confrontation with the replicating Agent Smith is tightly filmed in a white corridor, and it works.Now, for all my complaining about talking in these movies, I have to say that the one scene of talking I love is with The Architect. It seems like an odd choice since it's some of the most esoteric stuff told in a cadence and with a vocabulary that seems incredibly unnatural, but so much is revealed that recasts most of what came before. The idea that this is the sixth Matrix is one in particular that I love. The Architect's cold assurance of Zion's destruction is also great. It also completely undercuts the entire idea of prophesies (as another element of control), and anything that says that prophecies are junk gets a thumbs up from me (unlike some other movie I could mention). And then the movie fumbles again.The central love story between Neo and Trinity never worked. It didn't work in the first film, it doesn't work here, and it doesn't work in the third. There's not an iota of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss, and it really does help that the Wachowskis directed their actors in the sequels the same way that Robert Bresson directed actors to drain performances from them. The influence is supposed to be Stanley Kubrick doing eighty to ninety takes on everything, but the effect is unintentionally what Bresson did on purpose. Every actor except Harold Perrineau as Link feels dead and lifeless. It's not the sort of thing you do to sell a love story. Kubrick knew exactly what kind of performance he wanted from people, so he did takes until he got it. Bresson wanted a world-weariness for his films. The Wachowskis wanted to do something that Kubrick did because he did it, and the end result is an impassioned score over two actors staring at each other blankly. Neo flying to save Trinity, potentially sacrificing all of Zion in the process, even as The Architect talks about how obviously in love Neo is with her, falls flat.Still, as I said, these movies work best as action spectacles, and that this movie has in spades. Every action scene is incredibly well filmed and performed. The only real issue with the visuals in these is the primitive cloth simulations that make the CGI elements plastic. Everything else is vibrant and exciting on a facile surface level, and that's all I have ever really seen even the original as: vehicles for action scenes. The philosophy bores me. The characters are functional more than involving. The plot is an interesting mix of ideas, but it's the action that drives everything. Because of the strength of the action scenes almost entirely on their own do I actually like this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Cheap cheesy pointless and incredibly stupid,"If you would like to see a cheap and very low-quality parody on Startgate+Spiderman+Superman without even a slightest shred of logic but with long pointless sleazy daytime TV-type dialogs leading to the butt-kicking scenes with bad and unprofessional special effects - go ahead and waste your money.

if only I'd had lower expectations,"Right off the bat, I should make it clear, that this is a really good movie.Now, that said, I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd expected; which is pretty understandable Granted that my expectations were higher for this movie than any other movie ever.If you've read much about this film, like say, the entire May issue of Wired, then you can't help but have high expectations; especially for the fx.  The trick to this movie was to surpass the fx levels of the previous movie.  Since they'd already done bullet-time (and believe me, they still do), they had to go one step further.  Sadly, this step was CG. Really, the most notable part is the sequence in the movie known as the ""burly brawl."" This scene has Neo fighting off dozens of Agent Smiths.  The whole scene, save for some close face shots, was done with CG.  The goal here, to surpass the fx of the previous film, was to make the CG as seamless as possible.  And here, they fail.  Now maybe I'm just nit picking here, but man...again with the expectations.Aside from the ""burly brawl,"" there are still a few other flaws.  The first half hour or so of the movie isn't overly eventful.  There's this rave'esque scene in the caves of Zion that takes place while Neo and Trinity are getting their ""groove"" on, which seems rather pointless.  And honestly, not only could they have gone without it, but it might have brought the MPAA rating down to PG-13 had they gone done so.  Lawrence Fishburne's acting seemed a little canned at times; especially when delivering the speech that takes place right before the crazy Zion dance.That's it though; those are really the only major flaws.  The rest of the movie is amazing, if not thoroughly stunning at times.  The second half of the movie makes up significantly for the flaws in the first half.  The storyline starts to get rather deep, and you need to be thinking in order to grasp everything (definitely a repeat watcher).  And as you may have ready by now, this movie is really only half of a movie. The movie gets are far as it needs to go and literally ends with the words ""To be concluded"" on the screen.  Thankfully, we only have to wait six months for the conclusion. I urge everyone to stick it out through the credits at the end of the film, as there is a short but worth it teaser for Matrix Revolution at the end.Having spent time to thinking about and writing this, I wish I could go back and give it an eight or a nine.

"Imagine the first film, but without it's anti-establishmentarian soul, and with a cold hard hollywood black heart replacing it.","Now don't get me wrong, this isn't an awful film by any means, and it does have some cool action scenes as well as a deep plot, but it just comes off in the same way that Merovingian does - Smug and pretentious. I liked the first film, so don't think I'm a hater of the series or anything, but what narks me off about sci-fi sequels in general, is that instead of leaving aspects to the film to your imagination, the film's reality is shoved down your throat. Places and scenes that would have been better left out (EG Morpheus' speech in zion) are done, and they just come off as being there for the sake of it. Big words are used for the sake of making the film sound smarter than it actually is, proved when neo later condenses reams of someone's philosophical garbage into a single sentence.This film's very different to the last, which some might like, but others such of myself find off-putting. The first was alot more inventive and had an infinitly more interesting storyline. For number two, expect more of the same, but overkilled bullet-time, over-complicated plot, over-extravagant effects.Although with all this said, there are some brilliant fight scenes, and the car chase scene is filmed nicely, but these few gleams of brilliance don't make up for the pretension that is the rest of the film.I understood it, just didn't like it.

There is a lot of ""double talk"" in this one and you will have to pay close attention at times.  There also a few slow periods in the beginning.  Most of this time this is due to the director setting things up but in this case, some of it just seems to be a waste of time.

For example, Morpheus's speech before the rave scene was about as bad as they come.  All in all, it is an amazing movie that became victim to its own gross excessiveness.

Complex second Matrix,"If you've seen The Matrix (1999), then you'll appreciate this movie. If you haven't, you're going to be lost. There's a lot in here that depends on the plot of the original. So please, go see the original before seeing this sequel.The Matrix itself is basically everything you see - the entire planet, the movie says, is controlled by machines. Only a select few know this, and their mission in life is to free the minds of others who are enslaved by the Matrix, leading them to the city of Zion, located about the Earth's core.One of the chief rebels is Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne. Morpheus, in the original movie, thinks he's stumbled upon The One, the person who can save Zion and the rest of humanity from the Matrix. That would be Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.As the second movie opens, the machines have discovered Zion and are tunneling to it. It's only a matter of time before they tunnel through and kill all those inside. But rather than fortify the defenses of the city, Morpheus believes in the prophecy of The One. He defies the orders of the city's elders and brings Neo back to the surface (that is, the Matrix) so that he can meet with the wise Oracle.Are you confused yet? There are many themes here, some of which are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. One can view this movie on two fronts: as a gritty action movie or as a thought-provoking drama.Reloaded is replete with some eye-opening special effects, many of which were computer generated. In one scene, Neo combats the evil Agent Smith. Oh, but not just one Agent Smith - 100 of them at once. It's not like those cheesy kung fu movies where the villains take turns beating up on Bruce Lee; in this one, they attack simultaneously. Another scene features a fight atop a tractor-trailer on a crowded freeway.It's tough to convey all of the complexities of the plot. In fact, this is a movie that people - like the original - will need to watch multiple times just to catch all of the plot twists. What does it all mean? And even more important, what's it all leading to? This is the second movie of the series, with the third one coming out in November this year.Rather than delve into the intricacies of the storyline, let me give you some pros and cons. If you're a fan of the series, you're going to go no matter what I say, and if you thought the first one was a waste or not for you anyway, you won't be going to this one.Let's look at the acting. It's wooden. Keanu Reeves was born to play this role, as it requires little to no emoting. Plus, he looks cool in shades and a trenchcoat. I'll admit it, he looks very good, and in the non-computer-generated fight scenes, he looks somewhat plausible.His love interest, the mysterious Trinity, is played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Another one who simply cannot act, so she fits right in. Now, this may be a simple matter of personal tastes, but she's astoundingly unattractive. She's Neo's love interest, and yet the two of them have absolutely no chemistry. It's like watching a totem pole and a mop mate. Eew.Even Fishburne didn't come off perfectly. Some of his lines sound like they came off a cereal box top. Sure, that's no fault of Larry, but his delivery had the resonance of a funeral dirge. He's a very commanding figure, though, and he does deliver a solid performance as Morpheus.Okay, so maybe the acting isn't wonderful. Who cares, right? You don't watch these movies for the emoting. Let's see some tail being kicked!The action sequences are very good, although not quite as overwhelming as those in the original. There are some additions - Agent Smith can replicate, and Neo can now fly. The flying thing is key, but quite frankly he just looks like Superman with a different color cape. Even so, the sequences themselves are good. The problem is that sometimes they seemed to be thrown into the movie for no real reason other than to have an action scene. Another problem is that these scenes seemed to come right from a Nintendo game. You know, the type where you hit something like up and right and the B button to do a freaky Street Fighter move on someone? Plus several times in each scene, the action is paused so that the audience can get the full effect, since everyone's moving so quickly.Another big difference between this movie and the original is that although the original was pretty philosophical itself, it expressed philosophical themes with tangible objects, such as the pills and the spoon. You see? We normal folk can grasp those concepts when the themes are expressed in that manner. But the second film relies more on abstract concepts, and that might lose people who don't have doctorates in Jungian theories.The ending is a little bit of a downer, but since we know it's leading up to the third film, we shouldn't feel particularly let down. Yes, it's ""to be continued,"" but this movie more than stands on its own. Think of it more as an episode.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Wish I could've walked out.,"I wish that I could have walked out on this film.

The second time you see them they are a novelty. Each time you see them they are less special. After you've seen someone physically change into Agent Smith a dozen times, there's nothing special about it!All those things were in the first film, and were indeed special when first seen. In this sequel, the endless fight scenes that featured those ""No longer special"" effects were simply boring.If you just want to see a lot of gratuitous computer effects and don't care about characters or story, then by all means rush out and see this film!

Could've been a classic...,"... if it wasn't a sequel to ""original"" Matrix.First Matrix was more than a movie, it was really original and amazing.

Although I don't listen anything than rock, this scene and love between Neo-Trinity summarizes lots of things for a careful Matrix fan. (E.g. you would have noticed there were lots of african-asian-indian in Zion. Maybe that's because ordinary white guys from western countries can't get out of the Matrix so easily. They have a lot to blind them: career, relationships, luxury etc. Just remember what Cypher says in first movie: ignorance is bliss for them...)PS II: This film desperately needs Cypher.

The best and worst of the Hollywood mainstream,"This is a very unusual film.  If you pinned me down and forced me to say one way or the the other, I guess I'd have to say I enjoyed it, because I did. However, I also have *serious* problems with this movie, which, oddly enough, are completely different from my problems with the first one.The good:The philosophy of the film is no longer stupid.  The first was amateur at best and was often so grating I felt like the script had been written by 18 year olds overly stimulated by their first philosophy class.  Problem solved here.  This is a much more intelligent film than the first one, with some fairly deep meditations on free will and the social/personal nature of love (although the latter was thrown in almost at the last moment and didn't get the coverage it deserved).  Well done.Special effects.  Well, poop.  It's _The Matrix_.  They're awesome.  What did you expect?The acting.  Generally better all around, except for our friend Keanu. Fortunately he's either wearing sunglasses or generally not speaking most of the time.  We are spared the unintentional hilarity of another ""I know Kung Fu"" moment.  Thank God.The bad (and this is BAD):What the film says about us as a society.  Am I the only one who noticed that this film is telling us there are only two bases for a relationship between human beings: sex and violence.  Think about it!  The only time Neo and Trinity (the ""love story"" of the film) are EVER examined with any depth is when a) they're having sex or b) one of them is about to die.No, wait.  It gets worse.Naiobi is not merely a friendly and concerned individual; she's Morpheus' old lover.  Again with sex.  As if that's the only reason you'd help someone.Link, walking into his home after a long deployment, is expecting to see his wife.  The first words out of his mouth, which I won't repeat here, should be offensive to all women and any men who don't like to think of themselves as disgusting sexual stereotypes.Not to mention the nearly 10 minute long Zion dance sequence, which is probably the closest thing to pornography you're going to see in a mainstream film (and I saw this having seen _Irreversible_ earlier this year).  All the cool kids are having sex.  Why?  Because they're cool.*Sound of head banging against keyboard.*Go see it.  You're probably going to anyway.  And it's good.

"Come meet the new Matrix, same as the old Matrix.","I loved The Matrix. Honestly, I was expecting more from this. I just got out of the 8:35 showing of Reloaded on 05/15/03. Here' my report: Apparently, W Brothers tried to work in a bunch of philosophy into the movie. I noticed it only when Merovingian, The Oracle and The Architect spoke. While the plot didn't seem weak at all, it did seem as though the W Brothers didn't really care about developing it. Why bother with it when you have kick-ass fight scenes (by the way, they all truly kick ass)? However, all the graphics in the world can't make Keanu Reeves act. What were they thinking when they picked him to be a metaphor for the savior of humanity? Also, Hugo Weaving's character (Mr. Smith) gets a very nice ""upgrade"" (to quote Neo)and makes the change from the Bad Machine's Muscle to Pyshcotic Bad Guy very nicely. The cliffhanger ending is a plus as well.Overall, 7/10P.S: Do not bother to stick around for the trailer of Revolutions.

Totally unnecessary film.,"The Matrix Reloaded added nothing to the original movie. I saw it on an IMAX screen, which was overwhelming, but the film was boring. There was no further development of plot, or at least nothing that couldn't have been put in the first ten minutes of the next film. I'm certain that the story could have been told in two installments rather than three. The director just wanted to dazzle us with effects, but we've seen it all before. The freeway chase seen went on far too long. Even with the huge screen and overpowering sound, I nearly fell asleep. It takes more than effects to make a good film. No one would have seen this if it didn't have ""Matrix"" in the title.Hopefully, the Matrix Revolutions will be a better film. I feel that I wasted money going to see ""Reloaded"" on the big screen. Unfortunately, I wanted to see it for myself and not trust the opinions of friends who said that they were totally bored during the film.

beautiful sequel w/only a few flaws,"Although there seems to be mixed feelings about this sequel from other viewer's comments, I for one think it was a extremely good follow up. Especially considering that it will unavoidably be compared to the first one.  I really thought the ""Matrix"" was phenomenal.  The special effects seemed believably real and the ideas and storyline presented were captivating. ""Reloaded"", in my opinion, did a good job to owning up to this.However, I was bothered by a few things.  The major one being the fight scene between Neo and Smith.  I loved the first matrix because their wasn't all that excessive CGI fighting.  This fight scene, although good during some parts, is badly clobbered in CGI.  It's extremely fake looking in some parts which always drives me nuts and takes away from the movie.  It gave me creepy ""Spider Man"" flash backs (shudders).  Besides that one fight scene, though, everything else looked great and was just as good as the first in the special effects department.I also want to mention that the superman thing with Neo at the end of ""the Matrix"" had me worried but I believe they really pulled it off in ""Reloaded"" so that it didn't look cheesy.  But that's just me because other people would most defiantly disagree. :o)The second thing was the extremely long dancing in the cavern scene.  I don't know whether their motives for this scene was to incorporate the rave scene from the first movie into the second or simply to sex it up but it really wasn't that efficient.The other thing is the philosophical blah blah blah.  It may make more sense when watched a few more times but if you only watch it once it makes you go ""Huh?"".  But the philosophical blah blah blah and the dance scene don't last forever and are not bad enough to make this movie a horrid creation or anything close for that matter. Also, I do not believe the script was strained or forced as some people have said.  Everything in the movie seemed to have a purpose and had a nice flowing continuity.The other big complaint I here from people is the ending and the unanswered questions. However, this didn't bother me. The unanswered questions will very likely be answered in ""Revolutions""  and the ending was to be expected. Since they did ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" together and since both are coming out in the same year it makes sense that they would be tied so closely together unlike ""the Matrix"" and ""Reloaded"" (which was due to the fact they didn't know there was going to be a sequel).  All movies just don't come in a neat little packaged labeled happily ever after and The End.""Reloaded"" had action, shippiness, humor, intelligence, fun, and lots more. It was extremely good and I would recommend it to everyone who has watched the first one. If not you'll probably get confused. (and if you haven't then go rent it cause it's good!)  Although I wouldn't say it's better than the first...what sequel ever is???, the movie had a ton of great moments which out weigh the bad by far.  I would watch it again and again if I had a chance and I will defiantly buy it when it comes out months from now on DVD. I'm very thankful to everyone involved for making a sequel (and a 3rd one as well) regardless of the bad fight scene (spider man flashbacks again !!SHUDDER!!) because the matrix is too good to only have one movie. It's one of the few movies that actually require people to think but is enjoyable at the same time. ;o)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Liked the original better...,"I saw a 10pm showing of The Matrix Reloaded last night and enjoyed it, but I still liked the original better. I think the Matrix Reloaded is a victim of the original movies success. There is no mystery and like others have said bullet time is just old news now. The fight scene with The Smiths looks so fake at some points! I was really disappointed in some of the effects (like Spiderman and Attack of The Clones before it.) Why do they use those fake looking CGI effects when the other ones in the movie are just great?! I liked the characters in the first movie better also. The freeway scene and the fight scene with the weapons is great. The twins are awesome. I am still looking forward to Revolutions but Reloaded was a let down for 4 out of the 5 of us that saw it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A visually sumptuous and philosophically intriguing sequel,"The Matrix Reloaded (2003)The Wachowski Brothers continue their bizarrely fantastic sci-fi idea of 'The Matrix' with this entertaining, stylish, super-slick sequel that adds another dozen dimensions to the complex and intriguing storyline of virtual reality and all the other things that I would not be able to explain under thirty two hours.Neo, Trinity, Morpheus return to kick ass once again and we are graced with some spectacular sequences of action.

Wow!  I only would change one thing...,"The special effects were extreme!  When it comes to effects, I guarantee you have never seen anything that even comes close to this movie.  I enjoyed seeing more of the story from the ""real world"" point of view.  The only thing that I would have changed is the ... shall we say... physical exchange between Neo and Trinity.  That whole scene was way too long and showed too much skin.  Is it any wonder that teen / unwed pregnancy is so high in America today when hollywood continues to market eroticism and sexuality to teens.  I know the movie is rated ""R"" but I would bet the average age in the theater was 18 yrs old... Come on Hollywood, you can do better...  Any way, off of my soap box now.  The movie was amazing.

Sophisticated Sequel,"I am surprised to see this film criticised in some quarters. I found it intriguing ( you have to think while you watch this movie)and it also links to its predecessor in clever ways ( the scene in the first movie when the agents first interview  Neo is introduced in a way that suddenly gains a new perspective after having seen this movie).Most of the characters are better fleshed out in this film. Zion may not be entirely original in its look (didn't Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection do this first with their production design?)but it is nevertheless very well executed, and fits the story well.The fighting is tougher and rougher in this film, and the Oracle, Merovingian and Agent Smith are the main focuses of some amusing dry humor, with some additional droll contributions from Neo and the Twins.Contrary to some comments, the pacing is NOT sluggish - the action sequences are well worked into the storyline and the expository moments are well played by the cast, albeit both Trinity and Morpheus's roles are somewhat more subdued this time around. After all, this is a complex and ambitious story and therefore requires some extended dialogue sequences. You are expected, as the audience, to THINK!The action sequences are clearly more ambitious in this film, with less emphasis on the balletic quality of the fights in the first film, and more on making them more exciting and outrageous, and in this regard the film works brilliantlyDon Davis's score is the other outstanding feature of this movie. His score in the first film was pretty good, but this is clearly his best work to date, with certain sequences paying homages to Bond and the Terminator films.A throughly enjoyable and interesting film that in my view, actually met very high expectations when I first saw it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
the matrix overloaded,"the agent smith fight scene was laughable.  it didn't look any different than a ps2 game for the most part.  the dialogue doesn't improve on the first.  for a series of films revolving around a character's quest to find and regain the human spirit, this movie shows a distinct lack of humanity or emotion.  if they're supposed to be fighting the machines, why does the entire film operate like it was made by one?  it might as well have been a sci-fi channel original.  watch it.  enjoy it if you don't fall asleep (as my neighbor in the theater did during the car chase).  just don't expect anything ground-breaking (unless of course you are convinced that the technology used for ""bullet-time"" was created for the original matrix. afterall, it wasn't in Gap commercials years before....)  it rehashes the same ideas from star wars, terminator, and countless other sci-fi films and just wraps them up into a nice, shiny, green, net-nerd package.  admittedl y, this movie is at least a little above the average summer fare, it just doesn't live up to the overbloated hype it gets.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The thrills and action have increased and improved since The Matrix, and I wa especially impressed by the multiple-Smith fight and the speedway chase. However, I found that the original movie was 10 times smarter and philosophic than this second installment. I found Reloaded to be filled with confusing double-talk that just kept going around in circles, whereas in the first Matrix, it was more linear, and it had a greater sense of being placed at the right spots in the movie. This is where Reloaded is a little unbalanced. The philosophy itself was also deeper in the original Matrix.

Definitely Nowhere as Good as the First,"I thought this would be wonderful. It was not. I was highly disappointed and I think every fan of the first Matrix will be also. This movie is missing the wonder and mystery the first movie had as we learned of the world as a Matrix. While there is some philosophy in this movie on the nature of the relationship between man and machine and on the questions of fate and choice, the movie feels like a soap opera or some cheap serial or miniseries from tv. There were some parts that were just plain stupid. The action sequences ran on way too long. Having multiple copies of Agent Smith seemed laughable. The Albino ghosts were ridiculous. Instead of the actions scenes being amazing and state of the art as in the first film, they, to me at least, seemed tiresome and laughable; I guess because the Matrix action sequences have been copied or spoofed so many times now. And the whole storyline with Trinity and Neo and Niobe and Morpheus seemed like some soap opera. And what was with the rave party at Zion? Stupid. And the ending! The movie stops right in a middle of the scene, like someone forgot to put in the rest of the film!This is worth seeing once, but, unlike the original Matrix, I will not be watching it again and again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good Action.,"The fight scene with Neo and the Smith's was awesome!  Way better than any fights from the first Matrix, and the highway scene, was sick!.  However, the introduction to all these new random characters (key maker & matrix creator etc.) in the masses, a huge  ""free-minded"" civilization in Zion, and most of the movie taking place inside Zion, where it gets boring (like the scene where they all dance and neo and trinity get it on) is really bad. Makes this a huge stretch from the original. The action in this is by far the best, but the plot is twisted and stretched from the first movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great.. but not for everyone,"I really liked it, but a large proportion of the audience reaction was confusion or indifference or both.Some of the cgi could do with work - pausing on a certain hood jumping agent for example, was a mistake, it worked much better when moving quickly.Probably the biggest problem to my mind is that some of the fights were a little too overwhelming, it is hard to keep a pitch of emotion going for so long, although I think the more commonly reported gripe is going to be that the plot was confusing, didn't make sense or was boring, although I have to disagree with that opinion 8)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Enjoyable But Not a Masterpiece,"There was no doubt in my mind that Reloaded would be a patch on the original. As an avid fan of the first film i felt it nessesary to see this film.As a film on it's own it is fantastic but, as everyone will no doubt do, it is only average compared to the first film.The fact that the original had already set up the story line there was never going to be a plot good or compelling enough to equal the first film's grand nature. That said the actions scene in this lesser sequal are far more impressive than anything the first film had to offer (although it is blatantly obvious when the SFX take over from the amazing wire work).The only downside i feel with this film is that it takes far too long to get going. The major fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths doesn't take place until an hour into the film. before this point there is a god awful rave scene in which scantally clad rebels delve into dirty dancing territory and a confusing if not mind boggling chat with the oracle (can't explain, too tedious and time consuming). But after putting yourself through the cumbersome exposition you get some the greatest fights in film history. including one of the best car chases i have ever scene (next to Bullet and Ronin).But again after the midle hour the film starts to lack again in what appears to be the anticlimax of the year. And then were are treated to Neo's chat with the Architect (which sounds like the actor has swallowed a thesaurus, SPEAK ENGLISH).But what i have come to realise is that this movie and The Matrix Relolutions can be classed as one film and i believe that splitting it into two sittings was the best way forward.It is easy to say that Relolutions will be one of the best films of the year. Sadly Reloaded isn't. I can't blame it on the lack of philosophical value as the first film mangaed that to the max but the rushed ending makes you feel as though the directors are just wanting you to get to Revlolutions and forget about this one as soon as possible. Which is a shame because this could have been a great film had they spent more time and thought on it.Gripping experience but deffinately lacking, and it shows. That said it is still one hell of a good ride.4/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Mind Blowing,This sequal while flawed exceeded my high expectations.

"Deep and Exquisite Plot, Reloaded Deserves More Than One Viewing","This movie should be applauded.  The amount of detail and thought that was put into it is astounding...The supernatural as poorly behaved programs? The visual representation of a multiverse concept in the Architect's room? The huge number of references to religion and mythology (e.g Trinity, Persephone, Nebuchadnezzar, etc, etc, etc)? The classic literature parallels to Orwell, Rand, and even Shakespeare? The virus-based (or multithread-based) replication of Agent Smith?  How good IS Hugo Weaving?  I think Smith is probably one of the best villains since Hannibal Lecter... and the movie isn't even based on him. Amazing. The concept of the matrix as an onion?  How many levels will there be? The perfect clash between the raw and virulent lust for love and life in Zion vs. the green-hued, sanitized, no emotion Matrix world? I could go on and on and on.  There are so many concepts to hash out, so many covert points to dwell on, so much that I will probably have to buy the DVD and watch it about 6-8 times before I can even get a grasp on some of it.Plus, the CG, although not perfect (will they ever be?), are so good that they can't be justly compared to anything out there currently.I am awestruck.

Typical Hollywood Action Movie...,"Plotless, actorless, and just plain boring for the most part. There were a few good scenes, the Freeway chase, the Neo vs Agent Smith x 100, and that was really all that kept me going. Yet I still found myself wondering if I'd done the right choice by seeing The Matrix 2.Sadly, I somewhat was correct. Yet the funny thing is I had very low expectations for this movie. And the Wachowskis did a wonderful job of making me disappointed I saw this movie. The plot was nonexistent, the dialogue and acting were almost as bad as a porno movie's acting, and well, there was the recycled SFX. I remember reading a few interviews with the Wachowskis and how they said that the SFX in Reloaded would beat the first Matrix movie. Well, they were blowing smoke up where the sun don't shine. The SFX were nearly all the same from the first movie, minus the Twins. (Who should've gotten more screentime, considering the amount they get in the previews). The fight scenes were way too rehearsed to even be close to believeable. I nearly fell asleep during the Seraph/Neo fight... And the ending, we can't forget that! And how poor it was. Very poor...even Back to the Future 2's ending wasn't that bad.To see a sequel executed on all 10 cylinders, go see X2. That movie expanded on the original and did it with pinache.

I found this a thrill ride, and it met what I expected of it. Keanu was great, Carrie-Ann did her thing, Lawrence was still rough, ready and steadfast in his belief...and the new additions were entertaining. The movie went at a nice pace for me, I don't know what many are upset about.One thing that made me love this film to death was that I worked in a big-time computer company so as I watched this, I was entertained by this film..that is where my head was. A re-loaded program with a little bit more. Come on folks...it's not more than that and lives quite nicely to that expectation!!!Maybe I'm giving away the whole concept behind the film, or maybe I'm just relating this to my company's C++ and SQL Programming, the daily Microsoft monopoly screw we're all experiencing, the Apple Guys vs. The IBM guys and the two guys in my office who swear by Compaq or Gateway, the McAfee Guys and the Norton Utilities Guys, Firewalls, Hidden codes and hidden program designers, freelancers who know more than anyone, etc., etc...""The Matrix Reloaded"" is what I can relate to and loved every minute of it. And that ""ending"" thing....didn't bother me, I can't wait until November. (Here's something ELSE to consider...before most of us were born, many folks went to the movies and saw ""serials"". Many of those were Westerns and they ended with ""To be continued"" just to bring those theater patrons back to the movies the next week. Hey, maybe....this is a homage to that. If so, good for them!)So I say...take a chill pill. Either you ""get it"" or ya don't. Either you can relate it on a computer geek level or you just watch it for the kick-butt Karate scenes and special effects. Maybe that's not enough for ya. Maybe ya don't get the ""Zion"" thing, maybe ya do, maybe it's not important to you. But its ALL good.

A good feast for intelligent minds...,"I can´t believe that all of you are talking about the same movie, are you sure you all saw the matrix reloaded with Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne? and the great great Hugo Weaving of course.

I finally came with an answer...all of them are part of a lesser mind, the kind needed to be controlled by a system, the same they need to be happy with such pieces of trash like X-men2. The main reason most people don´t like this excellent mind-bending, actions packed, adrenaline filled roller coaster is because...they do not understand it. And rather than accept it is far out of their league to get it, they chose to repel it. Shame on all of you.More than a review, this sounds like a manifesto against all the bad rep this movie is getting. But I believe it is a movie worth watching. It has nothing to do with hype and high expectations, it has more to do in how people do not fulfill the expectation of the movie towards them, but fear not...In time, this one will become the biggest cult sequel ever. Well, hoping minds are not lesser than these days.The so called ""poor plot"" is excellent, with an extreme finesse that it really becomes fragile and strong at the same time. The action sequences are top notch, and anyone complaining about the ""fake and obvious CGI""...let me tell you...Unless you are able to find, not just people who look alike..but people looking exactly the same as Hugo Weaving, train them to jump in the sky and make it look real, go ahead, be my guest, otherwise just zip it.

Bummer,"When i first saw The Matrix, like many people i was completely amazed. I've since seen it several times since, and marvel at its construction every time. It was a great movie which would probably stand up brilliantly in years to come... were it not for this sequel, which dilutes the quality of the franchise [hate that word]. Too busy, too long, too fragmented. And much of the dialogue is of the type which you spend your time avoiding  at parties.I can recall almost every scene from the first movie, and yet immediately after seeing Reloaded I had already forgotten half of it.  I feel that a few important characters from the original have been betrayed, as well as some concepts, so that if you go back and watch the first movie again it will seem more hollow and pointless.BTW: I'm surprised it doesn't bug more people that so many innocents get killed in both movies... how can our heroes be so casual about slaughtering of captive minds?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

2 Powerful Flaws,"I don't want to be negative, I really did enjoy the ""Matrix Reloaded"", but there were two inherent flaws that broke the movies back as far as living up to the first. 1. The ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolusions"" should be one movie. I haven't seen the third installation, but I can oly imagine that if it has as much fat as the second did, it's mandatory. 2. The reason the first Matrix was so wonderful is that it didn't spell every single thing out and it made us care about it's hero and whether he was going to succeed or not. In this one, I didn't care about Zion. Honestly, the movie over sold it to the point that it was all for not. We all know evil will fail so get to it already. Talking about it over and over again doesn't make me care. Morpheus was right about Neo, why wouldn't he be right about this. No suspence. As far as Neo. We know that he can do everything. We now know he can overcome. The only thing interesting in this is how will he overcome all those Agent Smiths? Cutting all the fat from the second so that everything doesn't go on and on about how important Zion is.....we get it!...and making it one movie would have kept it's reputation up as a smart science fiction.

"Sometimes complicated, but always entertaining and spectacular","The Matrix Reloaded starts just like the original with Trinity, who shows her deadly moves and her beautiful body in a leather suit. For the rest of the story Neo and the rebellions of Zion have to figure out how they can stop 250,000 probes, who want to destroy Zion, in 72 hours. While this happens Neo has nightmares about Trinity and realizes that her fate is in his hands.I saw the movie last night in the cinema with 2 friends of mine. It was quite amazing what my eyes saw in those 2 hours and 20 minutes. These special effects are the best I've seen, for now, together with LOTR and Star Wars: AOTC. There are some new things: we get to know Neo in superman style which is pretty cool when you see it, Neo and Trinity can't miss each other for a second, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Monica Bellucci join in, Agent Smith has found a way to replicate himself, the rest you have to find out yourself.The Matrix Reloaded surpasses his original mostly on the technical level. There aren't so much gunfights like in the first one. The sequel stresses the kung-fu scenes more now and they are magnificent and will take your breath away. This movie is also a bit more humorous than the original and I have no complaints about that. I like to smile and laugh.The only bad point in the movie is that it's quite complicated sometimes and some scenes aren't really cut out to be in a sf-movie like this, I think. If I'd compare it with the first Matrix it's just as good. The action and visual effects are better, the characters are still good and the humor is also better. However the story in the Matrix Reloaded isn't better than in the first, some things I didn't understand really well and there's a little too much kissing between Neo and Trinity.

"good, but a little disappointing","The Matrix reloaded filled me with high expectations, because I really enjoyed the first Matrix. I watched the film a half year ago when it just had come out. That the movie was going to blow my head off with special effects was pretty obvious, and it did. Not literally of course.The special effects were astonishing, just like in the LOTR films. The fight with about 60 agent Smiths was pretty cool, but it lost its coolness after it took too much time. The highway scene was really terrific and it didn't lose its coolness. And the Wachowski brothers build their own highway just for this movie. Well done.The story was still good, but there were some things that really bugged me, like that dancing scene in Zion, or the French accent of the Merovingian. There was too much kissing between Neo and Trinity, even though they are in love. The sex scene, well that was ok, because I understood the message of it. Someone on the site explained a lot of the movie and the scene took part in his explanation, and I understood the movie and the sex scene a whole lot better by it. And the humor in the film, oh man. I've got no problem with a laugh in a pretty serious movie, but this humor was as dry as the environment of a dromedary.A thing I enjoy the most about the Matrix is the story and the philosophy behind it. The first movie really showed that side of the story, this movie also gives some philosophic information, but the problem is that the Wachowski brothers make it too complicated, and they shouldn't have done that, because it wasn't necessary. And even though I like thinking about a movie afterwards, this was just too much mumbo jumbo.With a conclusion this movie is worth a 7 out of 10, no more, no less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Don't rush in?,"Like many people I was unsure about this film on first viewing. There is no doubt that the SFX are awesome and the fight scenes are dazzling but I just was not sure about the film as a whole. Although the production team has easily out done the previous film in terms of action, had they gone too far? There are parts of this where Neo does things not humanely possible and it is obvious that the character is computer graphics and not Keanu. Yet it entertains so should I moan.I watched it again because despite my feelings that it was inferior to the first I could not get it out of my head. There is a lot of dialogue that is just far too much to take in one go - this has led some critics to call it too philosophical. However when I watched it again just 3 days later I came out of the cinema fulfilled and desperate to see the next installment. You leave with so many questions and everything pieces together second time round.This is definitely another innovative film by the Wachowski brothers, I hear people criticise the film for going too far but that is the whole point of the plot- you have to take the Matrix as they describe it in the first film and this one. When out of the Matrix the characters are real and accessible. This will no doubt be categorised as unequal to the first as most sequels are but I would disagree, this film is the ultimate escape fantasy that deals with present and possible problems with a background of science fiction and action. Watch it twice and marvel at the genius!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
if you wanna,"Lacks the fantasy and story line of the original. At time is quiet boring and drawn out. Dull. Action scenes are good - not great! They have not raised the bar to unreachable heights this is nonsense, c'mon Wachowski brothers! It's basically dull - action - dull - action... with no real plot or story between.The car chase scene? I was still waiting for it then realized i had just watched it 10 minutes ago. If you wanna see a cool car accident/action scene watch Final Destination 2.I wasn't the only disappointed customer, i heard others in the theatre and toilet afterwards sounding a little dejected.

they reloaded... with rubber bullets,"Some aspects of this film are jaw dropping, the motorcycle chase springs first to mind, but overall I was somewhat disappointed which I suppose was inevitable as it had such a great predecessor.The story didn't engage me like the first one did and so that impacted upon the whole film. The twaddle of Councils and ethics (a la Star Trek or Star Wars) dragged the story and the pace down and left me yawning in places.On a positive note there were awesome fight scenes and humour was well used. Two new ghostly baddies enhanced the film, it's just a shame they weren't used more in place of the philosophical ponderings of Councils and officialdom.Bottom line is that if you're already a Matrix fan I don't need to tell you to go see it. If you're not, see the first one and then decide. If that doesn't grab you, this one certainly won't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Yawn!,"What an amazingly boring piece of tripe!  Isn't it sad when the most interesting characters in a movie aren't the main characters?  With Lawrence Fishburne looking more and more like Marlon Brando every year, it's not surprising that he didn't have many physical scenes in the film (just imagine how much special effects to get his fat butt moving would cost!).  I can't say much about the chemistry between Neo and Trinity either--maybe that's because there isn't any!  The fight scene with the multiple Mr. Smiths was interesting for the first 5 minutes...the last 20 minutes of this fight scene were, well...boring as hell.  The truly sad thing about this film is that I actually got interested in it about 30 minutes before it ended.  I wish I had been able to see (and pay for) that much of the film.

Nice saga,"The Matrix Reloaded, released in 2003, expands upon the revolutionary universe introduced in its predecessor, offering a complex and visually stunning continuation of the saga. Directed by the Wachowskis, the film takes bold strides in both narrative and action, attempting to deepen the philosophical underpinnings while delivering even more ambitious set pieces.Visually, Reloaded is a spectacle that pushes the boundaries of what was previously thought possible in action cinema. The Wachowskis, along with their visionary cinematographer Bill Pope, continue to innovate with breathtaking sequences, including the iconic highway chase and the intricate choreography of the Burly Brawl. The film builds upon the original's bullet time with even more sophisticated techniques, solidifying its status as a visual pioneer.Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo, and his portrayal continues to be a compelling anchor for the story. The character's evolution takes center stage as Neo grapples with the extent of his powers and the responsibilities that come with them. The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, remains strong, contributing to the film's overall narrative depth.While Reloaded delves deeper into the philosophical questions introduced in The Matrix, including fate, choice, and the nature of control, it also introduces new layers of complexity. The Architect's discourse on the cyclical nature of the Matrix and the role of The One adds an intriguing dimension to the story, but it also challenges the audience with its abstract concepts.The film's pacing, however, is a point of contention for some viewers. The intricate plot, heavy with exposition and philosophical dialogue, can be demanding, and the film's place as the middle installment in a trilogy leaves some storylines unresolved, contributing to a sense of narrative incompleteness.Don Davis returns to compose the score, maintaining the electronic and industrial soundscape established in the first film. The music complements the film's tone and enhances key moments, though it may not reach the iconic heights of the original's soundtrack.In conclusion, The Matrix Reloaded is a visually stunning and ambitious sequel that attempts to deepen the narrative and philosophical themes of its predecessor. While it doesn't replicate the groundbreaking impact of the first film, it remains a noteworthy chapter in the Matrix saga, pushing the boundaries of action filmmaking and challenging audiences with its intricate storytelling and philosophical musings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Ok, but it was the worst out of the Matrix trilogy","The Matrix Reloaded, I thought, was a big disappointment. Due to the first film's excellent success, this just got the audience in a shock. I mean it did open huge in the box office but the audience after seeing it were very indeed shocked. I remember seeing a week after it came out, people were leaving the theater. I mean a lot, and the theater was packed! This film was alright, I guess, but they definitely should of left out the Zion dancing part, Neo and Trinity getting it on, and Neo's corny lines. The first film had a great and descriptive story but this film was pure action with maybe 4% of a story.

A Great Sequel---8/10,"The Matrix Reloaded fails to be as good as it's predecessor, but it is still a great movie. There is some amazing action sequences (which is really the point of the Matrix movies), including the highway chase which punches you in the face with sheer energy and excitement. The so-called Burly Brawl is really cool as well, in which hundreds of Agent Smiths take on a single Neo. Speaking of Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving makes a character almost as cool as Darth Vader.The film has it's fair share of flaws, though. Zion is not a very exciting place, for instance. Nothing really happens there, except for an overlong party, full of slo-mo dancing, and a cheesy speech by Morpheus. I was just waiting for him to yell ""Can you dig it?"". Aside from that, the story writers tried to cram the story lines into conversations that would take a computer technician and a thesaurus to try and understand.Still, The Matrix Reloaded is a great sequel to one of the best sci-fi films ever. It's no Empire Strikes Back, but it is definitely worth the watch for the action sequences, Monica Bellucci, and, of course, Agent Smith. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Surpassed Expectations or Disgusted Patrons?,"What is going on with this movie? Honestly, I'm unsure.This movie is neither as good as those who type with caps lock down insist it is (U HAVE TO GO SEE THIS FILM OR U R DUMB!) nor as bad as the cynics claim. It does seem to diverge significantly from the first one, but more on that later.Ebert is right. The ""philosophy"" is far too shallow to try to analyze. They seem to touch on a lot of free will/determinist issues somehow aligning free-will with humans and determinism with machines, than questioning those notions, than questioning those questions. As Plato demonstrated, dialogue is necessary in the search for wisdom, but I think we need better lines than ""you mean...programs hacking programs?"" It is bizarre how for the first half-hour of the Matrix Neo was portrayed as very intelligent, until the brother's W decided making him an idiot would force the supporting characters to have to explain everything to him, and thus stripped him of his intelligence. Somehow, though, I feel as if the first movie was genuinely intelligent for at least the first two acts.I agree that the political intriguing in Zion seems pretty unnecessary, though we will have to see what sort of effect it has when the third movie comes out. It might prove to be worthwhile after all.The Link backstory however there is no need for. Where was the backstory for Apoc or Dozer in the first movie? It wasn't there because it detracts. Oh, and message to the W brothers: consciously acknowledging how stupid Neo looks flying doesn't excuse presenting it in such a ridiculous fashion.CGI does not look real. Does anyone else think that special effects peaked with the original Star Wars trilogy? I would have much rather seen a stunt double.Was Monica Bellucci attractive in this film or what? I have trouble believing a woman like that could have difficulty finding a man who would be passionately attracted to her.The 100 Agent Smiths. What a great idea on paper. Really, imagine sitting around a room and one of the Watchowski's goes ""let's have Neo fight an infinite number of Smith's"" it must have sounded hilarious. But yes, it does look very boring.I generally liked the Architect scene. That alone was worth at least a couple bucks.As far as the ""cliffhanger"" ending. It was not a cliffhanger at all. What is left unfinished -- that we don't know the fate of zion? The third movie has to be about something. Also, consider the first movie which quite obviously leaves even more unfinished. Some people do not understand the function of the middle part of a trilogy. It has to leave room for a third movie. Go check out the empire strikes back. It has virtually the same ending! The claim that this is the first half of a two part movie is ridiculous. It attempts and succeeded at fulfilling its story arc.The love scene & the rave scene. Gratuitous? Pandering? That certainly seems to be the case. I have heard that the dubya's threw it in as an attempt to appeal to the female population. I have to question anyone's intentions who simultaneously seeks to appeal to 10 year old boys and adult females, but really is this not symptomatic of a general trend towards more skin in our culture? Is this really anything new? Are we not already living in a civilization where sex sells and money is the body line? I suppose now is not the time or place to discuss such nevertheless pertinent issues.So, to rate the Matrix on a scale of 1-10 I would point out that it is a matter of perspective. It is neither an all out masterpiece (A La Jesse Ventura's Abraxas Guardian of the Universe) nor a complete bomb (Jean Luc Goddard's Leon).On a scale of 1/10 I give it a ""vague"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The extended dance sequence reminded me of a Coors Light commercial, and really seemed out of place here. The endless repetitions of the odd philosophy lessons not only got old, they got annoying.I enjoyed the Greek myth allusions, and can see many ways they can wrap up this movie trilogy in fine fashion.

Well-crafted sequel to a modern classic,"It's hard to believe it's been four years already since ""The Matrix"" was released. Much has happened in the world since then- the election debacle of 2000, the dot-com collapse and of course, 9/11. Given recent world events, it's tough to greet the release of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" without feeling a sense of nostalgia for the bygone era that produced it's predecessor. The first film, a mixture of the cyberpunk literary genre, superhero fantasy, kung-fu and John Woo-style gunplay, with a touch of Zen philosophy thrown in for good measure, arrived on the scene with little hype or fanfare. The movie was quickly embraced as a modern classic, a superb synthesis of popular cinematic styles that staked out new territory with its visual effects, especially the now-famous ""bullet-time"" concept that has subsequently been parodied or imitated in too many films to count. ""The Matrix"" won four Academy awards, including a well-deserved victory in the visual effects category.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is, in many ways, a far more ambitious picture. There is much to enjoy here, from the introduction of numerous new characters, to a more complex plot, to the last screen performance of actress Gloria Foster (The Oracle), and of course, fabulous visuals and action scenes. There is a scene involving a slice of chocolate cake that I found to be brilliant and very rich. The end result is a movie that is as thought-provoking as the original.

It's all Choice,"Neo Morpheus and Trinity continue their assault on the matrix. Though the situation gets worse when the machines have located Zion and closings in. So Neo goes sees the Oracle who instructs Him to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of a program known the Keymaker to shut the Matrix down. Reloaded had allot to live up to with the world phomenom the first film left on the public. A sequel was very attipactined by everyone unfortunately it doesn't leave the same impact that the first did. While the the first manages to rely on it's unquire effect mix with it's philosophical theme. Reloaded tries to double down on the symbolism and relay to heavy on it's action. Many of the actions are rather subpar the practical fights are great they flow well and they are fast, but this movie far to clean. With Neo there's never no real danger what so ever with him, the first it felt like he could actually be killed so your not as invested. The fight scene with smith in the park he's surrounded by all these smiths it should be Awesome. It's ruined by the fact that one it goes on to long to the point it's comedic. Two the cg is bad it stands out really bad in this they relayed way to heavy on it here just a moshpit of smith's it's more funny then intense. The highway chases is more where it's at, because you actually buy Trinity and Morpheus are actually in danger. And the mix of practical and cg blends better. As for the characters Neo and Trinity relationship just as the last there's no emotion they express so little that yeah they work for each other. But neo is an idiot in this he withhold so much from everybody things that are kinda crucial. Trinity while still badass is still as dry as Sand. Morpheus is pretty much the same philosophical motivation p, stoicism who believes in Neo if you like in the first you'll like it here and viscera. Another side point is while they keep things going in the Matrix the whole subplot with Zion in danger it nice that you see this place,but they barely cut back to it. You get like one shot of the machine approaching you don't feel danger it's just padding for the conclusion with Revolutions.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
HELL YES,"I'm usually pretty cynical, and I was as hyped up as anyone that this would be the most amazing movie ever (ok, maybe not as hyped up as the guy who showed up dressed like Trinity...).  But despite how ready I was to get disappointed this movie not only met expectations but set the bar even higher!Most of the effects meet the standard set by the first Matrix, and you couldn't possibly expect more.  But then more is exactly what you get and a new standard is set.  Absolutely amazing.The story line does not disappoint either.  In fact it gets cranked up even more than the action does over the first film.  Flat out, if you think you know what the world of The Matrix is all about, what's happening and what it all means... think again!  Like the characters you're in for a rude awakening and another mind-bender even bigger than the original.I can see a lot of people being disappointed or frustrated by the story. But I think they need to realize that this movie is a continuation of the exact same story started in the original movie and that the shifting of perceptions is one of the major themes.My friends and I had no shortage of conversation on the hour and a half ride home after this one.  Discussing everything from plot points and themes in the movie to real-life philosophies about AI, free will, and destiny.In short, it's an amazing film that is at least an order of magnitude greater in both visual and mental stimulation than its predecessor.

Takes action scenes to a new level!,"If I were rating this movie on action alone I would give it a ten out of ten, however, I am going to deduct two stars for gratuitous sex and one star for being just a bit too confusing, resulting in a total rating of seven out of ten.In my opinion the dance scene in Zion is completely unnecessary.  No doubt it justifies an R rating.  If I could take that out I would rate it a 9 out of 10.This is the middle movie in a trilogy and it is designed to be a cliff hanger.  It is.  I thought that the plot was set up about as well as it could be so that Reloaded could stand on its' own as a story and still be a middle movie.  The series of scenes where Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity attempt to rescue the key maker are wonderful and simply amazing.  It is quite a challenge these days to actually develop action scenes that have new elements to them.  In my opinion Reloaded was able to do so and delivered a ten out of ten for action.  The scenes on the highway are an exciting concoction mixed out of the inherent danger of a car chase, evading the agents, and trying to escape from the Twins.The new characters, such as the Twins, the key maker, and the other programs, were very interesting.  As the plot unfolds the writers unwrap information about the Matrix and its inhabitants which add some surprises, similar to the revelations in the first movie.I would also rate the acting up a notch from the Matrix, especially Carrie-Anne Moss.  The supporting cast was very well chosen and did a great job.Overall, this movie was well worth the wait.

"A lot of fun, but..","I watched the Matrix Reloaded almost a week ago, and has spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to make of it. It is definitely a lot of fun and the action sequences are absolutely thrilling. I especially loved the car chase, which reached its climax in the mind-blowing truck crash. That was and extreme moment and I remember hold my breath for a while there. Outstanding special effects all through, however I think the ""Neo beats the crap out of 100 Agent Smiths""-scene goes on far too long. It seems as if Larry and Andy have let themselves get carried away with their capabilities, and they don't know when to stop. The rave/love scene was absolutely beautiful and visually it matched the rest of the film perfectly.Some passages in the movie are edited together a bit confusing and therefore it can be hard to keep up. The scene with the Architect went very fast, and he sure did used a lot of strange words. For me it became necessary to read the subtitles (which usually doesn't happen), and they went by extremely fast. Hopefully I'll get all the details watching it a second time. The ""ending"" was horrible and not very elegant. Naturally it had to end with a cliffhanger, but still some kind of an ending would have been appropriate. I would still go and watch the final chapter of the trilogy without the ""To be concluded"" at the end. All in all I'd give Reloaded 8 out of 10. The first film was definitely a 10, but Reloaded has been ""reduced"" to a great action movie.However, I can't wait to see Revolutions, hopefully it'll be worth the wait.Mikkel Drewsen, Sønderborg, Denmark.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"A great movie, but a bad sequel.","Matrix. In fifty years, people will look back at this film and say that it was the first movie of the 21st century. By now, it's so big that it has stopped being a mere science-fiction flick, and has become a cultural phenomenon rapidly growing into a subculture on its own. Combining some of the artistically most interesting aspects of pop culture - Philip K. Dicks science fiction, John Woos blood opera, the unique visual style of Animes such as Ghost in the Shell, and William Gibsons cyberpunk aesthetics, to name a few - into a breathtaking two hour ride, it can be safely said that it influenced whomever saw it, as the massive amount of 'matrixesque' action flicks that came out since then shows.And now, Matrix 2 has been released.Wrong. Matrix: Reloaded has been released.I've heard many dissapointed voices stating that the movie is ""too shallow"", ""too deep"", ""too unspectacular"", ""a pure FX flick"", and so on. Many of these complaints stem from our usual attitude towards sequels: When a second part of a movie is announced, we expect the same film with a stronger budget and a weaker plot. Reloaded doesn't fit this scheme.What made Matrix so great? In one phrase, I'd say it was its sleek looks, its cool action, its twisty plot, and its mind-boggling environment - the Matrix itself.Comparing the two movies, we quickly realize that, while we still have plenty of 'cool' scenes, a big part of the movies aesthetics concentrate on the more 'gritty' feeling of the real world, as we saw it on board of Morpheus' ship in part one. There is still lots of action, but instead of gun ballets, the emphasis is shifted towards hand-to-hand combat. The plot, while still full of surprises, does not focus so much on a single person discovering the true nature of the world he lives in, but instead rises to a 'bigger' scale. Trying not to spoil anything, I'll say that the environment of this plot isn't comparable to part one. There, the Matrix was still the main characters 'home', which he gradually left, now, it's a place he visits sometimes, a backdrop for his further actions.Thus, Reloaded is, while still in the frame of the franchise, not directly comparable to Matrix, part one. Don't try, or you'll inevitably be dissapointed, because some aspect you held dearly have doubtlessly been moved out of the spotlight.All this does however not tell you how good or bad the movie Matrix: Reloaded is.Well, the dialogue is average at best and wooden at average. The special effects are, while very well executed, just not as breathtaking as those in part one. For once, the old lie seems to hold true: It's not how much you have, it's what you do with it. Also, there is no complete 'wow' moment such as the legendary lobby scene in part one.The plots scope, which tries to encompass what can only be described as two separate worlds, is getting blurry from time to time, leaving the audience either puzzled or losing its connection to the actors, which raises another point: The acting. Excluding the brilliant Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, the cast consists of average actors. They just don't manage to make you truly, *truly* believe they are who they claim to be.Yet, Reloaded is an awesome movie.As with Matrix, one has to realize that Reloaded doesn't only rely on actors or dialogue to transport the plot, but also and primarily on its pictures. Every scene, every carefully picked camera angle, is filled to the brim with metaphors and symbols; nothing that would not help to emphasize the main motives of the movie. This is what makes Reloaded a piece of art: The sheer richness of its metaphorical vocabulary and the virtuosity with which the Wachowskis use every device, as weak as it may seem individually, at their disposal to further it into a truly incredible variety. This variety is however also what makes the film difficult and at times confusing, especially since it ends with a true cliffhanger, not solving the questions it poses - at least until fall.All in all, I can understand why people dislike Matrix: Reloaded, yet, one has to admit it being a good movie. I prefer the first part because of its more stringent plot, but will definetly watch Reloaded again. And again. And again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels ever made,"I haft to say the matrix reloaded, is the best sequel I have ever seen and possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen, It is visually and mentally amazing, it has the best special effects to date and mix with a mind blowing story line makes it one of the greatest movie experiences to date.I had two friends in front of me that wouldn't shut up, one violent prick hitting me the back of the head and FU%#EN mobile phones going off (dear god I hate them) and I still found it one of the best movie experiences I have in a long time.The matrix is a 10 out of 10 flick and is one of those rare movies that surpasses its original, what is a extraordinary feet sense the original was so amazing. The only down points of the movie is the giant party at Zion, it went to long and diverted to far out of the story line, it did have a point to lead to the love scene with Trinity and Neo, but the length of the scene is very distracting.

Primary characters become redundant, secondary characters are under-developed/unlikeable. Shambles of a movie and comes close to destroying the whole franchise.Matrix revolutions: decent attempt at a rescue, characters play their parts in the plot well, secondary characters are still douchebags but overall a fairly decent flick.In short: watch reloaded because you have to to enjoy the whole story.

"starts a little slow, but then gets better every minute","When the first matrix came out, everyone thought it was fantastic. They were right. And because it was so fantastic everyone wanted more. But the brothers Wachowski weren't too keen on making a sequel, let alone two, because how could they surpass the first Matrix movie. But hey, they've given you what you want : you wanted more of the same, you get more of the same, so stop bitching that the Matrix Reloaded is just more of the same, without the effect the first one had. It's impossible do that, because everyone knows by now what the Matrix is and they just can't follow more white rabbits or taking blue or red pills any more.So let me comment the movie now : the first half of the movie is most of the time a show gallery : much kung-fu fighting, much bullit-time frames, not much story, with as lowpoint the dancing people scene/ neo-trinity lovemaking. It was just too long. The second half of the movie was the best : still the show gallery, but more impressive, with as absolute highpoint of the entire movie the chase on the highway. But this time there was more story, more information about the matrix, although probably many people got lost in waterfall of words and lines in the Architect-scene. But as i said in the title, the matrix reloaded got better and better, so that's a good sign for the Matrix revolutions. All in all i give this movie a 8.5 on 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Movie Made The Matrix Actually Interesting,"Here comes the wonderful movie that is the Matrix. Interestingly, in trilogies, the second ones are always bad and are excluded, but this movie is a good example of how this can be explained not by the movies/works but by the effect of being remembered and admired. So why is this movie the real movie? From what I can see, it was not liked by most people.Of course, there is also watching the Matrix series just for the cool fighters, but that is not our topic. Our topic is not Matrix anymore because they already handled this simulation idea beautifully in the first movie. What is a simulation, staying in it, getting out, realizing the assumptions and living accordingly, our never-shaking ideas in life, the air we breathe are really things that can be easily doubted even with the idea of a brain in a jar. However, this movie goes much further and adds a new dimension to this simulation. Because as we see in all simulation works, it is possible to get out of the simulation, but what is important at this point is what comes after. I haven't consumed much simulation media so far, but usually there is a team that has found itself in a small spaceship in a huge settlement of aliens or robots like in Matrix and has escaped the simulation before. One of the most important points here is: How did so many people escape? What did the first person who escaped do without any resources or materials? How did he save other people and how was this ship created from nothing. These are important and not to be taken lightly questions and Matrix is a movie that can answer these questions, so I respect it very much. So what is the plan then? It is not a smart plan to take people out of the simulation one by one. In this context, those who come out of the simulation hope that the only way is the chosen one and that he will bring an end to the war between humanity and robots, but they do not know how. This is a big deficiency that will be answered later. In this movie, the team is trying to make the first encounter with the Architect, the creator of the Matrix, happen. When Neo finally confronts the Architect, we get all the answers we expected.The Matrix is actually a loop, that is, it is very difficult to keep people in a simulation consisting of artificial intelligence, for this reason the Matrix is developed many times, and in the end it is realized that the best Matrix is neither good nor bad, what is important is giving people the right to choose. Indeed, ""free"" will has always existed in people's lives in this dimension. How much of our free will is free? How much of our choices really belong to us have made people think for a long time. People have preferred the Matrix, where they can make choices, for better or worse. This is very true for the human mind, and indeed, despite being played with the same probabilities, the game of Blackjack seems to bring much more profit than roulette. Although your chances are always low, when a choice is made, people think that they have put forward different things and that these choices have consequences. Here, the issue can actually evolve to a different place. The choices people make reflect their identities and they can exist with these identities. In other words, people make choices in order to exist. When they do not make choices, they do not feel their humanity. Thus, making choices has long solved the problems of robots keeping people's minds in a loop. Of course, until this movie, the chosen people who have come so far are again faced with a choice where the answer is actually clear, either to reset everything and set up a ship with the people they choose and start the cycle again, or to save the person they love. The important point here is that the logical thing is to reset the loop because it seems like many more people will be saved, but what actually makes a person human is not their logic, but their emotions and sociality, and here the chosen person breaks the loop by choosing to save the person they love, and things start to become very different. Thus, we can actually understand the answer to the questions of who were the first people to leave the simulation and how did they happen, and an important point is touched upon. In fact, this is definitely the key point of this series. We notice a Matrix, we notice the assumptions we are in and get out of it, but we cannot get out because the designers of this Matrix know that we will notice this and create a loop accordingly and bind us to this loop.The images of this movie, which has a wonderful story, were also very beautiful and it was an entertaining movie. They did a good job with the effects, but since that was not the focus of the movie, I may not have paid much attention to them. The music of the movie is again few, the few are nice, but on the other hand, I liked the choices they made from the songs that already existed, for real.I think that in the later movies of the series, the actors bring better life to the characters as they get a better grasp on them, especially the character Neo seems to have come a long way from the first movie to this one, along with our friend Trinity. Well done to the entire cast.This is definitely the movie that makes Matrix what it is. The first movie is loved because it came up with the idea, and the last movie because it was the ending, but this movie is much better than both movies, at least with its story. Also, I saw that there were so many details in the movie that I couldn't even count them when I watched the videos later. I congratulate the directors and scriptwriters for this amazing story that opened people's eyes, and if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend you all to watch Matrix and go.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Cheesy, a bit amateurish, action-laden sequel to the greatest sci-fi flick ever with a few strong points","Where The Matrix, the original, was mysterious, enticing during every moment, dark but beautiful, poetic and just oozed greatness... this one was a whole lot more ordinary, predictable from the action scenes to the dialogue (the dialogue which was quite amateurish in places) and obvious rather than subtle. Where the first one was intuitively unravelling its meaning, this one flat out explains a lot.There's way too much action. The action scenes are actually rather stylish and pleasant, but only for a while, and in this one they just linger and linger...and linger. To the point the viewer may feel a sense of detachment from the flick altogether, and the cheap techno in the background doesn't help making up for the cheesiness. It almost feels like a caricature of the first one, like a totally different team picked up the franchise and expanded it artificially. For example the high way chase scene is seemingly endless, the whole Zion part at the start is in bad taste and Morpheus' speech on the kitsch side... just the name of this sequel, 'The Matrix Reloaded', gives out that tone of being so action-heavy and announces itself as being that big blockbuster.Now there are some really good elements to it though. The movie's opening scene dramatically catches the attention of the viewer (and its resolve at the end is quite interesting). The Merovingian played by Frenchman Lambert Wilson is a great character and the scenes involving him are a treat. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith continues to be awesome to watch as he brings that strangely ironic/facetious presence to the screen. And the architect scene towards the end is surely a bit too pompous in a sense yet not devoid of substance and a lot of the lines he delivers are Matrix-worthy in quality.6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
PAY ATTENTION TO THE DIALOGUES,Yes...This is the best sequel in film history .  The most intriguing part of this film are the dialogues. If you listen and understand them u give it a 10. If u don't understand them u give it a 1. Anybody who gives it a different rating is fooling himself by tryin to fool others. I have read a lot of reviews which say that the there are only 2 scenes ( fight with smith & freeway chase)  that make up the movie........if only they understood the last half an hour....which by the way make the essence of the film. Just 2 things more : 1. see the film as 1st part of MATRIX 2 & 3. 2. do not see the film if u don't fully understand the following sentence.......Choice is an illusion created between those with power and those without.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Soulless,"The plot of this film, where the machines take over the world and seek to destroy humanity, can sort of be applied to the state of filmmaking. Special effects are crowding out human emotion. Now that ""bullet time"" can be seen in even straight-to-video films, do we really need to see it over and over again? And do people really get off on hand-to-hand fighting? This film, despite it's excellent editing and special effects, is ponderous and pretentious, with leaden acting (the dialogue is spoken as if it's italicized). We're led to believe that Neo makes his choices based on love, but that's only implied, not shown, as little emotion flickers across the face of any of the characters. Will the success of these types of films mean the end of movies that are actually about character and emotion?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Worth repeated showings,"My first impression during the first part of the movie was ""where is the non-stop action?"".  Instead we are given about a half an hour of exposition. New characters, the city of Zion, grumblings about Morpheus, life with the wife and kids.  I guess the Wachowski's felt it was necessary to flesh out the world that was first introduced in the first Matrix.  I am also sure that part 3 will be all about Zion and the characters we have just met.  So keep it in your back pocket.Once the action begins, it carries you through most of the movie.  It FELT like the movie began to drag everytime a philosophical discussion began. Being a philosophy nut myself,  I would've been ok with it, except the discussion was drawn out too long and sometimes was somewhat incomprehensible  ""Some things change, some things do not""  (what?).  But I feel confident that I will eventually be able to figure it out watching it again.  So that is what I came out of this movie thinking.  I will probably like it better the second time, now that I have overcome my anticipations and can settle in and accept what the movie has to offer.  Nevertheless, the philosophy could have been simplified and trimmed down to keep the dialogue scenes from dragging as much as they seemed to.So enjoy the terrific special effects, TRY to understand the dialogue, and then watch it again to really comprehend it all.I give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing at Best,"Let me begin by saying the first Matrix movie is one of my favorites. I wasn't looking for anything shockingly new, but I had high hopes for Reloaded. And the movie never comes through.First off, the first half of the film takes place in Zion. Does that sound interesting? Well, it's not. Endless stretches of awkward conversations and exposition, all of it moving at a snail's pace. Remember how the first movie, even though it had a lot to explain, made it seem exciting none the less? Well this story isn't interesting. And they spend 10-15 minutes in some kind of massive dance. Ugh.The good news is Reloaded picks up and starts to remind you of why you paid $10 to see this picture. Once Neo meets Smith in their well-publicized clash, the movie becomes very energetic and well-paced. That sequence, along with the freeway stuff, pays off as expected. But does half of a really cool movie make up for the awful half? I say no.One of the most disappointing sequels I've seen.

"""Matrix OVER-loaded"" Desperately straining to match the original, it tries to cram in way too much psuedo-profundity","As a ""stand-alone"" action movie ""Matrix 2"" ain't bad. It's technically clever and inventive. As a sequel to ""The Matrix,"" however, it falls quite short. The first ""Matrix"" dazzled audiences with its special FX, to be sure. But more than that, I believe it conveyed a model of human breakthrough that inspired people consciously, and on unconscious levels. Whatever it was, SOMETHING about the first ""Matrix"" movie captured people's imaginations on a level much deeper and more profound that mere special effects wizardry.""Matrix Reloaded"" was very obviously under tremendous pressure to duplicate and advance that earlier success--- both in the technical crafting of the film, and the transcendental vibe that sparked out from the first movie. This ""Matrix Reloaded"" script strains to be ""heavy,"" and strains to over-load with fluffy philosophy, profundity, and meaning. It tries desperately, and that vain, panting effort in the script is evident. It tries too hard. To quote the recent movie ""Super Troopers,"" ""Desperation is a stinky cologne.""Funny thing--- if there was no ""The Matrix,"" this flick would probably be a 9 or 10.

Measures up to the hype,"There have been many comparisons to The Matrix and Star Wars, so I know I'm not being very original when I point out some more.  For one, like The Phantom Menace 4 years ago, The Matrix Reloaded has to measure up to very high expectations.  In many people's eyes, it does not, but for me it worked well.It is disjointed in some parts, particularly the dream scenes and the Zion celebration.  And it lacks the mystery element of the first one, an inevitability of sequels.  Still, overall, this is the right continuation of events and character arcs.  Keanu Reeves is a stronger, wiser Neo, and he actually delivers the lines well, something he is not usually known for. Carrie-Anne Moss gives us the softer side of Trinity, although she can still kick her way through any number of enemies.The most interesting and subtle parallel to Star Wars here is the use of love.  Like Anakin in Attack of the Clones, Neo makes a decision that goes against what is expected of him, upsetting the design of things, all because of his love for a woman.  Amidst all the special effects, The Matrix movies, like the Star Wars movies, are humanistic stories, dealing with the imperfections that make humans free.The actions sequences are awe-inspiring.  The car chase in the last act does indeed surpass The French Connection and Ronin before it.

The things that were said, the ending, it changes everything we knew about the MATRIX. The whole situation is far more complex now (ie more interesting).Wow...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
What happened?,"I loved the first movie. Being a long time fan of both speculative sci-fi and Hong Kong movies, as well as a big fan of the Wachowski's first film (Bound), I saw The Matrix the night it opened. And it blew me away. It was the most potent, flawless combination of brain candy and eye candy I've seen to date. So I should have expected that the Wachowski's would find it impossible to match that feat, much less surpass it. But I would have been happy if they'd at least come close.First of all, if you were as turned on as I was by the more cerebral aspects of the first film, you'll be severely disappointed by Reloaded. The only cool idea in the film (actually, the only idea period) is definitely too little, too late (near the end). There is next to no plot, just an eventually tiresome sequence of (admittedly elaborate) action scenes. But the film still might have been worthwhile if not for the often painfully fake animation in these scenes. Until computers can generate images of moving humans that are indistinguishable from real ones, all filmmakers should avoid like SARS using fully animated people for fight scenes. Animated monsters or environments can sometimes achieve verisimilitude, but only because we have no real monsters to compare them to, and environments aren't in constant flux and motion like a living being. But we are simply too aware of exactly what a person, especially one in motion, should look like. There are whole sequences in the multiple Agent Smith fight and the car chase where everyone--worst of all whoever the center of attention happens to be--is animated, and it's depressingly obvious. I spent agonizing minutes during these scenes trying to block my awareness of it, to no avail. And I'm not some FX tech geek who gets off on exposing the clockwork, so to speak. When I see a movie like this, I want nothing more than to be duped. But the abundance of truly weak illusion ruined (for me, at least) every scene it was used in. And that's pretty much all the action scenes. And that's pretty much the whole film.I have some more minor complaints as well. Such as: while I'm not a big techno music fan (although I giddily jumped out of my seat when Meat Beat Manifesto came belting out of the walls during a scene in The Matrix), I thought the use of music during fight scenes in the first movie was invigorating, brilliant, and unequalled in effect. Unfortunately, the music used during fight scenes in Reloaded is like a watered down, safe-for-your-grandmother mix of beats and typical orchestral music (which equals feces).I wanted to love this movie. I expected to love this movie. But I didn't even come close--and I don't think this is a case of letdown due to unreasonably high expectations. The Wachowski's really seem to have sacrificed brains for beauty, and flawed beauty at that. This is a shame, especially when they've demonstrated in the past that they are capable of both simultaneously (Bound was just as smart and gorgeous as The Matrix, although in a more low-key way). Not just capable of it, but masters of it. I can only hope that Revolutions will return to the cleverness and visual purity of the first part of the trilogy.I think it's still probably worth your money to see, though. Especially if you're not bothered by transparent computer animation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Well worth your time,"It's only been out a few days, and already there are the diehard fans that hate it outright and the others that love it unconditionally.  Here's the thing, sure there are a few scenes that seem a bit too computer generated, such as the Agent Smith fight scene, or when Neo is flying around, but you need to realize that the film can't be as ground-breaking as the original in the effects department.  It is stunning, visually, but the original introduced so many new cinematic effects and ideas that there's no way that Reloaded could match that without seeming like an entirely different film, and not the smoothly transitioned sequel that it is.  The massive party scene at Zion could be completely removed from the film, as at four and a half minutes, it seems to drag on forever without being at all necessary to the plot.  The fact that there is a party enhances the feel of the film, but not the closeups and cuts to Neo and Trinity having sex.

"Disappointed, but it's worth the ticket price.","Big disappointment, independently from the doubt that you could give the Wachos because of a sequel we know little about, The Matrix: Reloaded doesn't meet the expectations. On its own, it is a great action movie, one that anyone loving that style would appreciate above average level. But reality does matter in this world, and Matrix has created such a cult and expectations, that one cannot watch this movie and say ""that was exactly the sequel I had expected"".Half the fights are pointless, given the context and the characters involved, the key information is given well after a ton of useless context-building information, between two ""damn-already-5-minutes-passed-quick-let's-Kung-Fu-around-because-we've-got- film-to-use"" fights: the meeeting with the Merovingian, the Architect or the Oracle are important moments where someone talks too much diluting the key information. There's a strong feeling that the non-action scenes were inserted to explain the plot (again) to some retarded pea-brained teenager, the other half inserted to please some hip-producer-whisperer gurus: the dance scene, the love scene, Morpheus vs. Lock, the kid Neo saved in the Animatrix's episode ""Kid's story"", Monica Bellucci's completely pointless role, and others.

They went on waaaay toolong, but the producers knew that they were the only thing peoplewould take away from the movie, so they put in a lot of them.Most of the other special effects are okay (notably the ships) butthere's nothing really clever about any of them, and they go out oftheir way to avoid any really impressive, world-building, effects.For example, the way the transitions between the doors is handledis awkward and doesn't add to the world.

Best Film Of The Year,"""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the best film of the year I've seen so far.................. The whole movie was GREAT, I LOVES the part at the Zion (when everybody danced and Neo/Trinity are busy with their own stuff), the fighting senses were AWESOME (cool computer effected). I can't wait to see part 3, and I hope there's going to be part 4 (perhaps they'll make another video game). My advice for you guys is that if you didn't see this movie yet, go see it now, DON'T WAIT......",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
As good a sequel as you'd expect,"Have you noticed that about 90% of the reviews here start off with statements like, ""I was a big fan of the original but the sequel..."" or ""The original was unique but this one...bla bla bla.""Talk about dull and insipid reviews! Exactly what were people expecting? Let's get something straight here and now: the original was incredibly entertaining and incredibly stupid as well, and don't deny that. It managed to be appealing on two very contrasting levels. It was cerebral and heady but also had enough fighting and shooting to appeal on a basic primal level. For every plot twist you were trying to decipher you were equally interested in seeing some major butt kicking. It was a heady, confusing and intricate plot blended with big, dumb fun. The acting was incredibly (deliberately?) bland and wooden with zero humor. Q: Who were the most enigmatic and entertaining personalities in the first film? A: Joey Pants and Agent Smith - the ""bad"" guys. Ironic that the agent (the least human character) turns out to be the funniest and most entertaining character in the series. So please, don't go on lamenting the salad days of the original, because that film was far from perfect and the sequel manages to give the people what they want and bring the storyline and effects up to date.Yes, Matrix Reloaded further utilizes the now over-used and over-exposed special effects techniques that, unfortunately, have been embraced by everyone from Saturday Night Live to car commercials. That's the trademark style of these films, and you can't blame the filmmakers for being ripped off in the interim. Like it's predecessor, Matrix Reloaded offers it's share of dumb scenes as well, such as the incongruous erotic dance scene. And some action scenes actually go on a bit long.But the film still manages to stimulate and lure you in with bigger, better action and effects, a continuing intricate (and still confusing) plot line, and fresh, amazing visuals that may seem familiar (if only in style) but are still unlike anything you've seen before.Go see it and enjoy it, and be prepared to be equally blown away and annoyed as only the Matrix can deliver.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Leaves you wanting more!,"I loved the first installment and was not disappointed with the second, although was a little frustrated with the ""to be concluded"" at the end.

More of the same,"This endless story of The Matrix has got here one further episode. The only merit of this movie consists of a series of well made sequences (computer made) which are breathtaking indeed and very successful. But I don't include in these the long, dull, boring and repetitive ballets of martial arts fights already much seen and reseen in this kind of movies without bringing anything new or original. This story of two parallel worlds (with ubiquitous characters present sometimes in them both at same time) is told in a confusing and incoherent way (even taking for granted the fanciful movie script itself) which is aggravated by some speeches of cheap philosophy like those uttered by such characters as Merovingian or The Architect the latter near the end of the movie. When we get to the end we realize that the story is not finished yet and another movie is announced with more of the same. Well, if it were not for the good technical direction we would have here a negligible movie that intrinsically is neither better nor worse than the average movies of this kind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"All the good stuff from the first, and more.","Kudos to the Wachowski brothers for doing it right. The Matrix - Reloaded is definitely as good as the first and technically superior. The amount of care given to the story and not just relying on the FX will make Reloaded a huge success. The chemistry between the characters is much better now that the introductions are over and the actors are allowed to have had fun here, as evidenced by more interjections of humor than in The Matrix. I have mixed feelings about the new characters that are introduced, and unfortunately the new male characters, outshine the female ones hands down. Harold Perinneau Jr. is a great addition as Link, the new pilot of the Nebachanezzar, and the real life twins Adrian and Neal Rayment as ""The Twins"" are cool, eerie, and funny. But Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe and the very beautiful Monica Bellucci as Persephone are distractions and seem to have little to do with the story-line. More sexual tension between Niobe and Morpheus, (they are ex-lovers) should have existed in my opinion. Regardless of the storyline, characters, and acting, however, the special effects, fight scenes, and action sequences take center stage here. They are, in a word AWESOME, and definitely worth spending $9 to have the privilege of watching and experiencing them. See Reloaded as soon as possible, but watch The Matrix beforehand for a better experience. I give this one a 10 rating, which I don't normally do lightly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

It is sort of how Alien and Aliens are both great films, but they feel much different.  Much is the same with this one.  They are both good, but this one feels really different.The only complaint is what I said above in not so many words: some of the long winded speeches are hard to sit through because they don't make sense, because they are talking about the future, but when you see it again, having known what happens, the speeches make perfect sense.

Changed my life,"It has been said of Shakespeare that one of the reasons he was such a genius story teller was that his plays were multi-layered and appealed to many. Back in those times educational standards were far more polarised between classes who could afford education and those who could not. You would have had a theatre packed with both rowdy fairly unintelligent folk who stood near the stage, those in between, as well as intelligent upper class who sat above them. They all came to see Shakespeare's work. This was unusual for a playwright to have such a wide appeal among the classes. The reason it worked was because there was something for everyone  action, romance, philosophy, wit, intelligence etc.I believe the matrix trilogy to have a similar trait. Why? Well because they truly changed my life. I was not someone who would ever consider going to see a movie about philosophy (much a less read a book on it), or a movie that asks us to question reality, systems of control, choice, love, purpose etc. I would have been ignorant of a work that drew upon such 'nerdy' questions. I was drawn to the Matrix by the action like a moth to light, and once I was there I was zapped by its themes. Soon, I wanted to know more. What did such a scene mean? I wanted to know more about things in my own life  my work, my blind religious faith, my ignorant acceptance of the world around me. I woke up I guess. No other movie trilogy has had such a profound impact on my day to day life than the Matrix saga.I think that's amazing. Such ideas bred by a popular entertainment piece. I was once an action movie sci-fi freak and would have never wanted to read or talk about such notions. I'm changed due to these movies  and for the better. I can only speak for myself but I thank the wachowskis for waking me up and showing me a different view of reality.Neo  I can't go back can I?

AWESOME Followup,"I saw the Matrix Reloaded this afternoon. I can say that I loved it... but not everyone is going to like it as much as the first one. I personally think it was better, but you have to MAKE it better by thinking about the philosophies thrown at you and trying to put yourself inside the movie.There is no doubt that the visual effects are superb, but the best parts IMO were all dialogue parts... I cannot believe some people say the script is weak... perhaps it is weak for those who are a bit weak intellectually themselves. I do wish however that Trinity kicked more butt than she does, but oh well... she kicks more butt than she did in the first one.Oh, and if you watch all the way through the credits, you will see a few bits from the concluding Matrix to be released in November. I can't wait till then!!! I have a feeling I will be seeing the Matrix Reloaded once or twice more though in the theatre... after I think about some of the stuff and read up on the philosophy of the Matrix up to the second movie.

They have improved each technique and every facet of the first movie. It is a slam dunk.  The Matrix has definitely solidified itself as being one of the most successful movie franchises in history.  Already, it belongs with such other notable trilogies as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings.  This is before the 3rd installment has even been released.

There are a few moments of flat dialog, particularly from Reeves, but that's not enough to dampen the vibrancy and life in this film.

Reloaded has no story?  What?,"For everyone that is saying that Reloaded is nothing but special effects and has very little story, I think you need to go back and see the movie again. But this time, don't expect to see the first Matrix movie... expect to see something new.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is an underlying theme to this movie that seems to have eluded most people.  The last 20-30 minutes are very profound and totally change the way you have to think about the Matrix and what Neo has to do.This is not to say that the movie is perfect. I think there was a drastic overuse of bullet-time effects and alot of the kung-fu was pretty anti-climactic.  Some of the dialogue was poorly written too (I'm not talking Star Wars Ep1 or 2 poor, but more like really confusing and long-winded poor).  The movie still managed to captivate me, however. Learning more about the humans' current dependence on machines and seeing how Neo begins to deal with the philosophical ramifications of that fact and his place in the Matrix is a necessary addition to the movie.  If it bores you that much, well then you don't really care about the meaning of the movie and just wanted to see special effects.  But those of you with that line of thinking should more than satisfied by the AMAZING freeway chase.Bottom line, Reloaded is not like the first movie.  People say there is too much dialogue, but I think that's the point... to make you think more about what the Matrix really is.  There are plenty of clues throughout the movie--especially toward the end--to stimulate you into thinking about what will need to happen in the 3rd movie.  So don't just tune out until an action scene comes up, like all the people who say the movie was awful obviously did. Like the Matrix itself, there is more to it than meets the eye... believe it or not, you have to think about some action movies. Pay attention to this one and you'll thank yourself when Revolutions comes around. I, for one, can't wait for it now.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Equally as mind-blowing as the first, you cant compare them","To those saying ""it was no good"" or saying ""it was weird"", it is probably because they don't fully understand the film. People probably had this vision of what they thought Reloaded was going to be, so just because it doesnt match their vision, its no good. Thats just plain stupid. This movie has the best CGI I've ever seen and the burly brawl was awesome, lets not mention the freeway scene, which I can say is the best car scene in movie history(as promised by the film makers). And more importantly, the movie has an awesome story. The concept of decision was a good storyline to introduce. The concept of making two decisions(in programming a 1 or 0) was an awesome touch. only true computer programmers(ie: geeks) will fully appreciate each touch that went into the movie. The concept of ""backdoors"" was cool, and the thought that each thing in the matrix is a program was cool, oh, and how they said programs can go into exile either then being delete was cool, making programs think.The only thing I can see wrong with this movie is...that it stops in a very harsh way. That was just wrong. The movie has its ups and downs just like the first one. They can't be judged together because they deal with two different concepts of life. The first one dealt with personal conflict and meaning of existence. The sequel dealt with the origin of existence and why/how we are here.The Matrix Reloaded delivers the best action and story since Star Wars(original trilogy).I can really only see 2 things i didnt like about the movie 1.) no gunplay, too much kung-fu, but i understand 2.) we have to wait another freakin' 6 months for the rest of the storyout",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Disappointing and a missed opportunity,"I enjoyed the first film, thought it broke some new ground in a few ways and was entertaining at the same time.Luckily, I chose to go to Reloaded on a cheap ticket night - good decision, I was less than enthralled by the way the film was put together and found myself yawning during quite a few scenes. It's a shame the hype surrounding the 'Burly Brawl' was not lived up to - it was just a computer game on the big screen - you could admire the skill of the programmers, but there was no subtlety or 'wow' effect - as there was the first time we saw 'bullet time'. Car chase held my attention, good effects and good editing, but when it came to some of the fights - give me an old Bruce Lee film any day. Despite the vague storyline and the lengthy filler scenes during which I lost the will to live and just wished the machines would get on and finish the job, I actually came out glad that I'd seen it but thankful I'd not paid full price.But you can't help liking poor old Neo, he's a nice enough chap and Reeves hams him up beautifully.

I know some might think this is sacrilege, but I think this is the sort of Franchise that could have the legs of ""Star Wars."" I also predict that if the Wachowski brothers don't have too many more hits left in them, (or even if they do, who knows?) they will come back to what made them famous and help us and everyone who loves ""The Matrix"" and explore it in a few more films, TV series possibly, and games.

What a great ride....,"And I thought that my new Nissan Murano was a great ride....The Matrix Reloaded is almost as good (no spoilers).The Matrix Reloaded is the second of three movies starting with The Matrix and completing with Matrix Revolutions (to be released in Nov. 2003).The film, for the first 45 minutes, starts slowly by trying to develop the storyline and characters.  There are some scenes here that could have easily been dropped on the cutting floor without affecting quality or the story line.The rest of the film is just one wild ride after another with Kung Fu, an AMAZING car chase, and special effects.

The Story and the Effects Still Grab in this Sequel,"I didn't see ""The Matrix Reloaded"" until the fourth day early show, and it was still sold out enough that I had to squeeze into the third row, along with the babies, toddlers and little kids there despite the ""R"" rating, and next to the guy with serious sleep apnea snoring problems.While I re-watched ""The Matrix"" to bone up (and get re-enthralled -- I was just telling our IT guys at work when the whole computer system crashed all day that they needed to visualize the circuits connecting), I haven't yet read through the philosophical explanations at the official site, let alone listened to the discussions with spiritual authors on National Public Radio, or yet watched the background short films in the ""Animatrix"" collection, so I had to ask my son (who was at the first 11 pm pre-opening day showing) for some explanations that I just didn't get -- I hadn't even gotten that Neo is an anagram for One.What I did get, besides the return of fun fight scenes and visually complicated sets, is that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss still look really good together and that Neo's and Trinity's love anchors the tale (and provides for droll grist with villains and prophets).Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus shrinks a bit in stature because we now see him in the fuller context of the politics of Zion, the last human city, and its relationship to the Matrix, plus entanglement in a jealous triangle (one of several going on). Because an original element in the Wachowskis future universe, compared to most sci fi movies, in addition to choices, is human emotions.Doubtless there's already a few PhD theses on the strong role of women in the Matrix universe -- what will they make of the fact that Trinity never gets on top now that we finally get a discreet sex scene? No ambiguous falling in love with androids in this war with machines, like in ""Blade Runner,"" but rather Zion celebrates human sensuality, complete with a multi-ethnic, city-wide prayer session that ends in a rave to the beat of taiko drums with a touch of ""Carmina Burana"" (if I could be sure that those frequently recurring drums were on the soundtrack I'd get it, but Warner Brothers prefers marketing to teen-age boys with pedestrian metal tracks from which only the closing Dave Matthews Band re-mix stands out). Interestingly, the women all seem to find Salome's seven veils to dance in, while the men are still wearing their grubby long johns (not that Keanu looks bad in those).Yes, we have the return of Bullet Time and balletically choreographed martial arts, which works well except for the connecting shots where the CGI turns the actors too much into cartoons. The battle with the multiplying Mr. Smiths is a particular hoot. The freeway chase is noteworthy more for its length than originality of strategies, partly because I couldn't figure out how the Sentinels or the Albino Twins could be destroyed, though its second half turn-around did have me ducking.One weakness is, as the ever welcome Harold Perrineau (of ""Oz"") comments, Neo does spend too much time ""doing his Superman thing"" with flying heroics that could either be a tribute to those movies or just plain retreads.Stay through the ten minutes of credits for a preview of ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" as ""Reloaded"" ends with a serial-style cliffhanger.(originally written 5/18/2003)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

the loaddown on the matrix,"Get it? The LOADdown? Where'd I get such a dazzling sense of wit, you ask? I'll tell you. I just saw the Matrix. Basically it's an action man's porno. Some real hot action scenes that don't necessarily connect to each other. Agents just show up every so often so there can be a fight. There's even some actual porno in the beginning. So that's the other thing. No longer can you say it's only rated R because of Columbine, unless Columbine means huge group orgiastic sex scene and a couple three f-words. My recommendation: show up 40 minutes late, you'll skip the sex and the boring boring Zion/rastafarian Ewok village (did I mention boring?) ""important"" ""plot"" ""development,"" and make it just in time for the action scenes, which really are incredible, though in a lot of them they cheated, and you're basically just watching the Wachowski brothers play a really really expensive video game.

"If you've heard that The Matrix Reloaded lacks deep plot thought and time-worthy dialogue, you have been deceived.","I went to see this movie the day it opened.  Of course, I'd heard all the negative reviews on the radio saying it's plot was lost amongst special effects and the dialogue was only time filler.  I can understand where some people may be coming from with such statements, but I certainly didn't agree.  For one thing, if you've seen the first movie, you will remember the style of dialogue, much like ""pop philosophy.""  It was the exact same in this movie.  If you liked Morpheus' riddling way of speech, you'll be equally pleased with his role in this movie.

Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, they don't make for the best social conversation roles, which is why this movie was so highly criticized, but the Wachowski brothers were one step ahead of them and threw into the mix our aged friend - Councillor Hamann and of course, the intriguing Merovingian.  The insomniac conversation between Councillor Hamann and Neo proved a thought provoker, but not nearly as catching as the Merovingian's ""causality"" theory.  For those looking for deep conversation, ignore the cynicism and see for yourself, this movie is first rate.I can't write a proper review without touching upon the plot v.s. special effects conflict.  Yes, the special effects are dynamite and in some cases could be distracting from the plot, but that's all.  It doesn't serve as a coverup for lack of plot, merely a visually stunning addition to an already terrific movie.  The plot is there and as colorful as ever.  Not only that, but with the many given curveballs, it's not predictable, and when the movie's over, you'll be wondering ""how could anyone even think of something like that?""For my closing statement, I'd like to give one last mention of praise. This movie, compared to the other, serves up a double dose of atmosphere.  You remember what the Matrix looks like don't you?  That dimly lit world of flourescent lights, almost as though you just stepped into a Walmart. This feel stays with the second movie but with an added bonus - Zion.  It's magnificent, to go back and forth from sterile and clean to primitive and dirty.The ambience and atmosphere-amazing. The plot-flawless. The effects-stunning. The dialogue-thought provoking. Overall, this movie gets **** from **** on my record.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding!,"If possible, this installment of the Matrix trilogy is better than the first.  It had action, plot, partial-nudity and incredible special effects. Speaking as a jaded moviegoer, I was totally impressed with this film. To amply illustrate my point, I despise Kenau Reeves (as an actor), and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole movie.  I have to give credit where credit is do:  Keanu did a passable job as a protagonist, although Carrie-Anne Moss made watching him much more bearable.  Trinity (Carrie-Anne) is absolutely irresistible in that black lycra outfit!  Excellent movie:  even worth paying the excessive prices movie theaters charge these days.  Gotta see it on the big screen with digital surround sound.  Otherwise, you're are going to miss some of the visceral impact of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Decent sequel with a couple of problems.,"Is this movie good ? Yes.Is this movie as good, but not better then it's predecessor ? Yes.Does it have good Action sequences ? Yes.Can it drag and not accomplish as much as it could ? Yes.Does it have a cool ending ? No.This sequel is as good, but not better then the original classic before it and for what small problems it contains, it ends up losing a couple of points.The film doesn't really have a real huge storyline like the first one due to everyone already knowing the main premise and all. The Wachowski Brothers just want to compete with the summer movie market of blockbusters by rushing through all the philosophical discussions and simply just wanting to show constant struggles and please the ""adrenaline junkies"" who can't have enough peril in their lives.There are some cool new characters that even steal the show ( The Twins are cool bad guys that should have returned in the third one because they're so awesome ! ); there are troublesome bad guys like The Merovigian, who you just want to die because he's so cunning and slick as a whistle, as well as the return of Agent Smith.There are other characters who appear, but you don't get to know that much about them like Niobe and Ghost ( played respectively by Jada Pinkett Smith & Anthony Wong), but you get to know more about them if you play the video game spin-off ""Enter The Matrix,"" but thats a shame because not everyone here plays video games ( I do personally, but still ).Either way if you want a cool, slick flick that doesn't require too much thinking, but yet can still make you ponder & stay interested, then by all means watch this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Best Sequel Since Empire Strikes Back!!!,"The Matrix Reloaded was truly the best sequel since the amazing Star Wars Episode 5, Empire Strikes Back.  It had everything a sequel needed... incredible action (better than the first), character development as well as new characters introduced, and an amazing, thickening plot.  As far as the ending of the film, everyone seems to have forgotten that Reloaded and Revolutions were supposed to be released at the same time, but due to the complex and technical level of the special effects Revolutions was not completed on time.  So all of you nay-sayers of the ending must remember... its not an ending, but simply a time to catch your breath before you experience the rest of the story.  This story, I might add, is an original idea... something Hollywood hasn't had in quite sometime.  The Wachowski Brothers imagined this whole thing; they didn't take it from a book or a re-make of an older film.  I know it sounds like I am the Matrix PR guy, but I am tired of complaints from movie-goers who feel the need to condemn anything that didn't come from the Sundance Film Festival or some eclectic crap like that.  This movie blew me away, just as the original Matrix did in '99.  It was well worth more than the $8 ticket price, and I will definately go see it in the theater a few more times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Middle of the story with lots of new questions :),"This movie was visually a work of art through motion and sound. Loved every moment of it, and the movie theater atmosphere was excellent. The story leaves you with an incomplete feeling, which can be easily forgiven since we know that it's just half the story (or should I say 2/3's). I watched the Matrix before going to see the film, and it puts it into perspective as being the middle of the road.The action sequences were just fun to watch, and it is a comic book fantasy brought to life. It has the perfect cliff-hanger ending which just makes you beg for more. I will be seeing this one again, and will be waiting for the conclusion in November at the edge of my seat with excitement. I give this movie a 9, becuase with the fore knowledge that the story is incomplete, I can not yet say that anything did not fit into the plot, because in the conclusion more information may become available which makes everything reasonable.The only recomendation that I would like to make is to watch The Matrix before going to see Matrix Reloaded, and to see Reloaded more than once, as there are many details that can be easily missed that flesh the story out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not the greatest film of all time.,"I have to admit that when I first went to see Matrix I wasn´t really that impressed by the film. I had just seen Dark City, a truly intelligent film. A couple of years later I had to rent Matrix because my girlfriend had missed it and this time I finally realized that Matrix was a great action film and truly entertaining. It may even be called innovative. So I had some hopes for Reloaded.I realize that the Wachowski brothers felt the need to explain their universe in this film. I also realize that they had an need for trying to explain the motives of the main characters but still. Reloaded has some great action and amazing effects but it is also an extremely uneven film. It felt like at least half of the film was made up of endless and pointless monologues, (Morpheus was worst, talk about pretentious.)I also have a huge problem with this kind of parodichal acting, especially when you have a corny dialogue. And believe me, it really is corny.I have a degree in philosophy and always find the kind of fake philosophy that Reloaded represents as a bit naive and funny. But one wonders why they made such a fuss about the philosophical aspects of the story when it is clearly made to entertain teenagers? The 16 year old I went to see Reloaded with simply didn´t have a clue what they where talking about. And when it comes to alienating your audience, that might be the worst thing you can do.And when it comes to suspense, how exciting is it with an character, Neo in this case, who simply can´t lose? And in this film he really is the Matrix version of Superman.I have to say that my expectations are considerably lower for the next outing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
So underrated,"The Matrix spoon-fed audiences Philosophy 101Reloaded threw the audience in the philosophical deep end & assumed they'd learn to swim on their ownSo I understand why so many dump on this movieFor a knucklehead like me, it took me several re-watches to ""get"" the meta-type meanings interwoven with aspects from different philosophies & computer scienceSo I really wish people would just give it several rewatches and really try to understand the philosophy behind itBecause once you ""get"" it, Reloaded is an amazing movie (with some really bad CGI)The entire Trilogy is a philosophical journey for the characters and the audiencePhilosophy struggles to understand who we are as humans and why we're herePhilosophy is a very human notionThe machines struggle to understand human philosophy because the machine's understanding of what they are and why they exist are explained by computer scienceThat's why in Reloaded metaphors are spoken both in terms of both philosophy and computer scienceWhat confuses both Neo & the audience is when the machines try to explain to humans what life is using human philosophical metaphors that have been bastardized by the machines' own philosophy based on computer science.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Gave me that same feeling.,"You know that feeling that you had when you left Matrix 1?  Well, if you don't know what I'm talking about, that feeling where you look at things with more focus... study people around you... and wponder if you yourself could actually be in a matrix.  Whenever a movie makes me leave the theatre feeling (not just blown away) but impacted in a way only that movie could have impacted me... it did something right. (for example, Goodfellas left me talking in Italian mob style for a few minutes...).Matrix definetly did this for me... again.  Although some of my friends were a bit dissapointed, I got that same 'feeling' as before.  I think it works as a very good sequel, and gave me the same mind-f%#! as before.There are a few things I left the theatre wondering about, and I cannot say them here cause I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen this yet. But where are the boudaries of the Matrix I wonder?  And that guy with the knife... what about him?Obviously since this movie is such a cliffhanger, you have to give thumbs up to the fact the 3rd one will be released in just six months.  So even though these questions bug me, maybe that is what was intended.8.9/10p.s.  and I think it lived up to the special effects we all wanted to see",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Loved it,"Trying to top your best efforts is always a difficult position to be in, as I believe the directors found after the release of The Matrix.Like most people, I had very high expectations for Reloaded when I went into the theatre, and although there were ups and downs, the Brothers delivered.This time around, there's more comic relief, more politics, more explanations, more philosophy, and much, much more Kung Fu.  The hand-to-hand combat is a turn off for some people, but most are ready to admit that whether they liked it or not, the execution was superb.The philosophical moments managed to flow well (for me, at least) without becoming boring because of clever background choices and a stirring music score.  It still may be above the tolerance of some people, I think.  I didn't get all the details during my first showing, so I'm left with several questions unanswered; perhaps after seeing it a few times it'll make more sense.  I'm told the video game will offer many explanations as well. The entire experience is familiar from the original movie, where many things weren't apparent until after I'd seen it a few times.The surprises were, well, surprising :)  There's a lot revealed, but even more only hinted at, leaving me hungry for the third movie in November.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Not as good as it could have been, but still a solid 8/10","The Matrix Reloaded starts off a bit slow. It takes quite a while for the 'real' action to get started, but once it has started, its awesome. The best scene has to be the freeway scene, the palace foyer scene and the stick fighting scene. The ending including the talking with the architect is boring and the movie could have been narrowed down to about 2hours. Besides those bits, the movie is great. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
See it twice,"The first time I saw Reloaded, I found that I was comparing it to the first Matrix movie.Well there IS no good way to compare the two movies, and that's what I think people need to realize.The first Matrix shattered all sorts of previous ideas of how movies were made.  The special effects were like nothing we had ever seen and those special effects have been copied over and over ever since (check out the previews for ""Jason vs. Freddie"" if you don't believe me!).Reloaded does a good job of shoring up elements that were just touched on in the first movie.  We get to see the much talked about Zion.  We see more on Trinity and Neo's progressed relationship.  We see Neo's vulnerabilities. He may have these incredible powers in the Matrix, but he's still just a man.  He's obviously uncomfortable with the power he has been given and he obviously is unsure how to use it.  Keanu Reeves does a great job with this, and the W brothers did a fantastic job of writing dialogue that is custom feet for Reeves.I think the Zion dance scene is hot without being trashy.  I like the fact that people in Zion are darker--this small detail shows that the W brothers know what they are doing, ethnicity wise.I also like the fact that the main characters are interesting looking with character, weariness, and aging showing in their faces.  These are characters that have lived through an enormous amount of pain and suffering. What are they SUPPOSED to look like?I have ONE small comment about the fight scenes.  There ARE a couple of times when it seems like there is a contrived reasoning for a fight.  I don't fault the W brothers as much as I fault the audiences with their limited capacity for drama.  I suspect that the Ws probably put those scenes in to please the audience, rather than because they were completely necessary.  No matter though because the fight scenes in Reloaded are beautifully choreographed.  Enjoy them.A 10 of a film!!  Go see it TWICE.

Not Brilliant but acceptable,Don't believe the hype. Story line was weak. I'd give the story a generous 6. Effects a 10. The action scenes were amazing.. not like anything you've ever seen before.

Neo is the best on screen superhero I have ever seen. When he flys it is awesome, especially when he has to save a certain lady.  Morpheus is no longer the all knowing leader of Zion, in this film they expand on the character to show he is maybe a little obsessive and is just one of a number of Captains.

Great sequel!,"Yes sequels usually flop but The Matrix Reloaded managed to avoid that general trend.  After the end of the first Matrix i was thinking how cool it would be to see Neo kick ass now that he discovered his powers.  well he did lots of that in this second installment.  There was lots of explanations and discussions about the Matrix, which could make this movie seem a bit dragged out for those of you out there that don't like to use your brain.  but overall i think the writers did a good job of explaining everything and making a logical plot.  Of course there are still many unresolved issues at the end of this movie (unlike the sort of triumphant feeling you get after seeing the first one), but that is to be expected in the second installment of a trilogy. The special effects/fight scenes were stunning.  and they didn't just have one or two cool sequences.  instead there were TONS of really intricate, complicated, mindblowing scenes which must have took tons of time and effort and money to create. If you haven't seen it yet, don't even bother to read all the mixed opinions... i've heard both ends of the spectrum.  i don't know why the hell anyone could possibly bash this movie.  if you don't like it, then just don't watch it again.  it certainly doesn't deserve a 1 rating!screw everyone who bashes this movie for no good reason.  go watch The Matrix Reloaded and decide for yourself. can't wait for Revolutions in Nov!!! :-D",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A worthy Sequel,"This sequel is a worthy follow up to the original.  With expectations set so high, it was a difficult challege, but one, that on the whole suceeded.

The first film set up the situation, the rules, the characters, andwith this film, they are set free, and thus we are presented with aworld of superheroes, battling evil and giving us kick-ass action. Thankfully, not just non-stop action, the film takes time with manydialogue scenes, and although some of them seem confusing orrepetitive, it only goes to pace the film so that the amazing actionscenes don't dwarf the plot.

More action...Less story...And that's just fine,"Basically this movie has so much action it's incredible. The FX are even better in this sequel and so is the action.

This movie does a good job, it's unlike the original but I believe it does justice to it. The acting again is pretty good, but Keanu Reeves doesn't do as well as he did in the first one, which I think was his best movie.

I have read some other comments on the movie by other people and they all seem a little dissapointed because they compare the film to the first one. I believe they're all wrong. The Matrix 1 was a fantastic film in it's own way. The basic storyline invlolved little more then the transformation of Neo from computer hacker to the possible saviour of mankind. Reloaded HOWEVER is in all ways very different. It's almost impossible to compare Reloaded to Matrix 1. Reloaded works on so much more levels than the original, the relationship of neo and trinity becomes more apparent, the architect (which is a brilliant scene) explains the earlier versions of the matrix and more and the most important aspect: Zion. The main reason that Morpheus fights as passionately as he does.For me the idea of the matrix fascinated me ever since 1999 and now, after seeing Reloaded, i am once again in complete and utter awe of the wachowski brothers.

"Decent, but disappointing.","Uh...I'm not sure where to start, so I guess I'll be brief.I had pretty high expectations of this movie, but then, I'm sure everybody did. It seems the Wachowskis may have given Reloaded just a little bit too much hype, because, honestly, this movie did not live up to my expectations, or the hype. Now, I'm not going to deny that the movie is worth seeing for the special fx alone. They are spectacular. There's no two ways about it. The car chase is quite possibly the best I've ever seen in a film. The 100 agent smiths fight was also spectacularly done. Let's not forget the rest of the gunfights etc. Bottom line, the special FX rocked the house, but the story left a lot to be desired...But, with any luck, this will be remedied once Revolutions has been released, and the story will make a bit more sense after that.Also, I'm aware that Reloaded and Revolutions are in fact one movie, but as a movie by itself, Reloaded leaves a lot to be desired.

"Quite brilliant, but clearly the second in a trilogy","You'd need to have seen the first Matrix to make head or tail of The Matrix Reloaded, but it doesn't detract from the Wachowski brothers' genius. There are engrossing themes but not all are sewn up in the same way the first one's were. But some questions you may encounter this time are: how deep is the Matrix?; are Neo's powers part of his fate, or one that he chooses with his free will?; does civilization end to begin again with a new v. 2·0 of the program or can we, indeed, steer us away from destruction?; and what is reality outside the Matrix (I won't elaborate on this, but it's an issue I was left with in the closing moments)? Maybe these are appropriate things to be thinking in 2003.That, and how beautiful Monica Bellucci is.But this sequel does not appeal to the (remaining) senses as deeply as the first film had done. I didn't walk away from The Matrix Reloaded with the same, 'What if that were our reality?'  the same immersion  as the first one gave me. Instead, it was a few hours' worth of stunning set pieces that had me marvelling at the movie's special visual effects, a great score, and General Motors' product placement in the car chase scene. But I was not immersed. So often you come out of a film bringing a bit of its world out with you. Not here.Maybe it's the absence of surprise that comes with a sequel. I don't blame anyone for that: it's perfectly natural. In fact, I applaud the Wachowskis for not detracting from the movie's original style, tying it in to the spirit of the Matrix and understanding fans' demands. I applaud them for giving us more of their world. And that may be the aim, for with this bridge (do not think of The Matrix Reloaded as a film that can stand alone), they have sufficiently whetted my appetite for the finalé.In some ways, while the first one could even be seen spiritually, the second reverses some of the ideas to generate doubt within the illusion of the Matrix  and the third may bring clarification.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Two Thumbs Up!!!,"After 4 years of anticipation for the long awaited follow up to 1999's blockbuster hit, `The Matrix: Reloaded' has finally arrived to resurrect the mind blowing story it's predecessor successfully delivered to us years before. Upon watching such films, one has to attempt to categorize this complete tale that has plagued our minds with perfection for so many countless hours in front of the screen. The matrix has set the ground rules for near perfect science fiction films, and action suspense. Its follow up has more to offer than it's 4-year-old tale of awakening and truth. Reloaded continues the story of the war against artificial intelligence by giving the audience more of what was once seen before. We are witnessing more fights, more intense action and more amazing special effects, with a mighty kick to boost us up beyond comprehension to a whole new other level of filmmaking. The film adds a deeper story to Neo's ability and everyone's purpose in the story of it all. But witnessing such a successful sequel, I couldn't help but notice the endless opportunities the franchise has. The story is deeper, and more sophisticated with endless tones of enjoyment.The story is really moving ahead by really spicing everything we've seen to a whole new product. For people who were satisfied by the effect `The Matrix' gave them back in 1999, and for those yet to experience it, `Reloaded' is the story that was simply waiting to be told in it's purest form 4 years ago. I think it has to be acknowledged that the first part was simply an introduction to the characters with a touch of the real story getting underway. Like the Starwars franchise, these films are better appreciated when one views them as the complete story they are and not the separate chapters sequels label them to be. If you saw `The Matrix' then don't stop at the beginning, push through till the end and then label the story by preference. `Reloaded' is cracking stuff with a cliffhanger to make you go wild, it's still your Hollywood film that boasts as one hell of a good follow up, but it's one of the only films that allows the audience today to choose how much you get involved with the story, and which area you decide to focus on.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The storyline is great, most of the action sequences are amazing if not a little over the top and the ending if definitely a cliff hanger of epic proportions but its missing what made the original a classic, atmosphere.  While the original film had it in bunches this film seems to have it in places.  The Agents don't seem as unstoppable as they did in the first film and the movie doesn't have that greasy look that the first film did which helped give it that wicked feel.  But I'll admit its hard to tell the middle stanza of a 3-part story and have it stand on its own as a film.  The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few films to do this very well.  Late last year I felt that The Two Towers suffered from the same thing.  The Matrix Reloaded is definitely rife with eye candy and will boggle the mind and the senses, but don't expect it to be as good as the original, it just isn't.  But good none the less.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Could've Been Better.,"Compared with the previous one, this one does not offer a similar powerful opening. The magnificent special effects are overall amazing, though; but they also blur some narratives as well as the characters that the film tries to forge. And for some characters they seem not necessary for the story. In short, two major flaws: relatively fragmented narratives; and most characters losing their intensities and lives.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The disappointing films season has started,"I was really keen to see this film and rushed to the cinema.The story started VERY slowly.It then resembled a ""Mad Max"" tribe thing going on in the Sion community.The fight scenes seem to go on for ages making you wish Keannu would finally understand that hitting them didnt work. After a while you realised that the scenes werent coming up with anything new. Very dull.The story was missing the mystery that made the first film a success. It seemed to go on for ages and ended 10 mins from the finish, or so it seemed.The motorway chases were okay but not groundbreaking. A little too much CGI possibly.In summary, the story was very slow and unoriginal. They were trying just too damn hard this time I think. If you like the ""XXX"" kind of film then this is for you. Lots of shooting and fighting etc... If you like the sort of film that discovers a new way to present a film (The Matrix) then this one is not for you and you should wait for the DVD.Dont get me wrong, it aint that bad, but it aint wot I went to the cinema to see.

open ended,"Reloaded was quite a lot to take in, but a good movie altogether.  The end opens it wide for the third installment of the series and provokes more questions than we actually get answers.  I recall that most of the theatre left saying ""What just happened?""  I think I'll have to see it a second time just to be able to fully answer that question.  About my only criticism is that, while the special effects are uncanny, a scene or two begins to look more like a cartoon than real life.  But, for the most part, the special effects are breathtaking. The Wachoski brothers and John Silver once again prove to be geniuses.  Go see it!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first!,"I went to an advanced screening last night, and I am glad I did!!  Being an avid Matrix / Sci-fi fan I was very psyched about the film, but I had heard a few negative reviews and that had put me in an apprehensive mood (some reviews said it was like Star Wars Episode 2...too wordy and convoluted with an almost religious fervor).  But the opening sequence glued me to my seat.Now shortly after an opening fight sequence, the exposition started and we get caught up on what went on since the events in the Matrx.  I really loved the political conflicts that went on here, you get a sense that not everyone is on board with the whole idea of Neo being the ""One"".  These sequences are helped along by the cast doing a great job of acting (not just fighting). Reloaded does a great job at juxtaposing the bright world of the Matrix with that of the grey Zion.  You also get the sense that in the Matrix, our heros kick butt, but outside of the Matrix they are very vulnerable.  As for the fight scenes in the movie....WOW.  Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen.  Simply jaw dropping.  From the characters using almost every weapon to their gravity defying kung-fu fighting, these scenes can best be described as intense. One thing I would have liked to have more of though was the music.  Some scenes you had to strain to hear the music over the sound effects...but this could have been the theater I was at.Overall I would say Reloaded out does the first movie in everyway.  The action sequences are better, the story is more indepth and there is a greater sense of urgency.  Although not as ground breaking as the first, think of it as an ""upgrade"".My rating 10/10. (If you like the Matrix, check out Dark City and Ghost in the Shell, both great movies which more than likely had an impact on the creators of the Matrix movies.)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing,"This movie was a serious disappointment.  I loved the first one and had high hopes (maybe too high) for the sequels.  First off, the acting was absolutely horrible.  The acting in the first one wasn't spectacular but in Reloaded it was so bad it was almost distracting.  The action sequences were technically spectacular but had absolutely no intensity or any sense of drama at all.  They were almost meaningless.  I've heard many mixed reactions to the plot (and the ending).  I won't comment on them here, but I seriously hope they can wrap things up in Revolutions in a satisfying manner.

Good movie but bad editing.,"I did not hate this film but this wasn't the same kind of movie that the first Matrix.  In one word ""what its the difference?""  EDITING, the thing for what they won an Oscar last time.  The combats are to long, some dialogs are to long and the party and love sequences are too long.  For the good things I will say that the story is very good, the quality of the combats (even if to long) are amazing and the characters, like always, are very cool.  Over all I liked the movie but I am disappointed that this movie don't respect the tempo of the first one.  I saw many times the first movie. Why? Because every time I started looking this movie at someone house or on my DVD player I got sucked in and I wasn't able to stop watching until the end. For Matrix reloaded I see many times were I going to be able to close the TV and go back to my life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"If you're not ready, stay plugged in....","I thought the movie was excellent. My honest opinion is that the Wachowskis created a movie for those who ""really"" would like to know how far the rabbit hole goes down and not for the average thinker. This was an above average IQ type film to me. It took me seeing it twice to really grab everything it had to offer. With this being only one half of the story (Revolutions is out in November), it's hard to judge, but leaves you waiting for more. The special effects were excellent, but could not be compared to what was being ""said"". If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest watching and listening to the first Matrix movie again, and going into this one preparing to listen. The watching is secondary in this film. There's a lot of Hollywood hype surrounding the film, but unfortunately this isn't for everyone. You will NOT be spoon fed the plot or the story.

Matrix Reloaded saves itself from that, mostly, with millions upon millions of dollars in cool digital effects.  Oh, and some crazy martial arts action that Hong Kong would be proud of.  Really, though, the best part of this movie is the (honestly, hold the laughter, please) deep philosophical questions that get posed.  They deepen the meaning and relation of The Matrix as an entity with our modern technologies.  Some real, applicable man/machine issues are presented.  These scenes are few and far between, but they're thankfully cushioned by cool stunts, lots of bullets and the next generation of the Bullet-Time Effects.

This movie was definitely worth seeing, if not just for the fight scenes. The philosophical aspect to the movie was also very interesting, if you could be bothered diverting your attention away from all the Kung Fu action.

disappointing,"Yes well i can't help to say that it was a disappointment to watch. First to focus on the visuals, i felt like i was watching the matrix - the video game.

I'm not an expert on this and considering the money put in to it, it's probably the best they can do, but it's too much.Then on the story line or philosophy that probably was somewhere in it but totally inconceivable!! I mean does anyone remember what the 'creator' says in the 'choice room'? the (thin) red line of it i get, but i think I'll have to watch it 5 more times to really get it and then find out that he doesn't really say anything, because they just haven't put enough thought to it.Well i don't want to really wreck it down to peaces cause i love Keanu in this role, although his character had more personality in the first movie cause of his vulnerable and ignorant traits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Better as a sequel compared to X2.,"I have just watched The Matrix Reloaded and I have to say that I liked it in general. Like X-Men 2, Reloaded is a good film on its own. But like X2, if you compared it to the original film, then you might have the tendency to nitpick on certain things.So let's get the nitpicking out of the way.In terms of the special screen effects, I thought there were no new breakthroughs except for the fight/chase scenes involving the Evil Twins. I guess the original Matrix film had really set the bar pretty high and so, in order top that, Reloaded really had to have something that's really mind-blowing. My personal view is that it didn't in general.In terms of the plot, I thought the original film had more to say. But again, this is probably due to the fact that since The Matrix was the starting point of the story, it had to be meatier in content. Reloaded does take the story ahead (quite significantly so, if I might add), but it left me feeling that it could have been so much much more (again, this is due to the high standards set by the original film). Nonetheless, IMHO, it's not as bad as what some naysayers have made it out to be. Like I said, if you look and listen carefully, you'd realize that Reloaded is actually quite a significant piece of the entire puzzle. This, at least to me, show that the Wachowski brothers are truly geniuses. I just wished that they had gone a little deeper (more elaboration).Other areas -1). Was Neo's ""Superman thing"" an overkill? It was literally ONE too many - He did it four separate times. Three of those were necessary - Neo used them for functional purposes - and so these were okay. One was absolutely UNNECESSARY - we already had an idea that Neo could fly at the end of the original film - so no ""introductory flight"" was necessary. The impact of his flight ""power"" would have been greater if it appeared appropriately rather than just for the sake of showing it. And incidentally, I thought it Neo had some other ""new"" power, it would have made the show better - remember the mind-blowing bit that I said was missing? I was most likely referring to the lack of something new from our main man, Neo.2). Was the Zion party too long? Hell no. It signifies the humanity and human spirit, in the midst of machine domination. This is one from the literature books...classic. But then again, in the country that I was watching Reloaded, quite a bit of the scene was cut...along with the scene with Neo and Trinity frolicking...was it too long? Damn, hell no, give me more of the bodies PLEASE!All said and done, I gave Reloaded an 8 out of 10 to reflect the fact that I thought it was still good. The Matrix was a 10 - minus 2 for Reloaded for the above shortcomings. I'm hoping that Revolutions would be a 10.Incidentally, I gave X2 a 7 out of 10 - the difference between the two sequels is that while I'd go watch Reloaded again in the theatre, I wouldn't go watch X2 again in the theatre (I'd wait for this to come out on DVD to catch it a second time).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Damn good sci-fi,"Alot has been said about this movie, possibly more being written about this movie than any other in history. As a sequel to the Matrix it did not quite live up to my expectations.

So the experience definitely was not as satisfying as the first. As the movie stands by itself, it still is pretty damn good sci-fi and a huge amount of fun. I really liked the way the storyline was presented; it left us with clues throughout and it only came together at the climax. I have watched way too many sci-fi films of late where I could predict what would happen after just 20 minutes.The action is probably where the movie really shines, it is riveting stuff from start to finish; with the Neo vs 32402039840328 Agent Smith's scene probably taking the cake.So in conclusion, my only real dissapointment here is that it did not quite have that same ""wow"" factor that the original had.

"Very cool, opens some new doors, but whats up with the pacing?","Just a brief comment... Having just seen the movie, getting home very late while following a trail of my own mail (including netflix dvds) on the way home because I was dumb enough to leave it on the roof of my car...... but anyway, its late and I really just want to say one or two things before I pass out.First of all, this is a very good film.  The action is of course visually breathtaking, but enough will be said about that.  I found the scene with the oracle to be quite touching (considering the actress who played her has passed on shortly after filming).  Many new doors are opened and the storyline (at first seemingly somewhat simple) has now become quite complex and can turn out many different ways.  The one thing I would like to mention is:  Did anyone else get the feeling that half the movie was directed by one person and the second half someone else?  Did the Wachowski brothers take turns?  It just seems to me that the first 1-1.5 hours had a very similar pacing to the first movie and then suddenly the second hour or so just went in total fast forward.  I was dreading some kind of fatal deus ex machina, but they managed to avoid that.  It just seemed rather odd how the pacing suddenly changed.Still, all in all an excellent addition to the Matrix mythos and Revolutions (tho due to a theory I'm formulating, I think the next/last episode should be called ""Evolutions"") should be very interesting indeed.pt",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"great entertainment, worthy sequel","Wachowski brothers follow up brilliant Matrix with a solid sequel. Of course not as good in as the first film in my opinion in the story and acting, however it made up for it with greater special effects and fight scenes (according to more budget i guess). Keanu Reeves was fine as Neo, one of only roles i really liked him in. Laurence FIshburne was great to see, the films best performance just like the first one in my eyes.

Making Film History-Again!,"First of all, I am a HUGE Matrix fan! Although many people complained about this film not being as ""fresh"" as the first, I disagree. When we first saw The Matrix, we were being introduced into something totally new, and now we know that the Matrix exists so obviously there won't be something totally shocking in the second film like finding out that the world we thought was ""real"" was actually a computer program. So I think a lot of people went into the second one with a ""twist"" expectation. However, the action in this film is just plain amazing! The big brawl with Neo and Agent Smith was with lack of a better phrase, stunning!The car chase in the film was also one of the best chases in a long while. A few critics complained that the bullet-time was getting old in this film, but although they might have a point I still think that no one can do it like the Wachowski Bros. and no matter who else decides to do it in their films, The Matrix is where it all started.

Fie on the naysayers. (no spoilers),"I didn't expect anything from the first movie, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Apparently, that is how most people felt. Then, with this movie, everybody went into ""This movie can't possibly be as good as the first."" Good for them, but those of us who strove to maintain objectivity got more out of Reloaded than those. My perfect example: There was a half row of idiots behind me in the theater, snickering at every character development scene throughout the movie... from the first second of the flick. I wanted to turn around and tell them ""I'm glad that you felt it necessary to spend money to watch a movie which you had already formed an opinion about. Now could you please let the rest of us enjoy it?"" This is a symptomatic case, I think. As far as the movie itself goes: Reloaded makes the first movie even better. This is a much more cerebral movie than the first, so I don't expect it will enjoy as much acclaim. This is too bad, but the lowest common denominator always rules at the movies. The viewing experience I can most identify Reloaded with is ""Eyes Wide Shut"". For the first two-thirds of the movie, you think you know what's going on and it isn't all that exciting. And then, in one second, your brain is blown away as you are finally presented with the point of the movie, and it rules. Reloaded is one of the best movies of the past five years. ""The Matrix"" built up hopes for the continuation of the series, but I doubt anybody had any real idea of what the Wachowski brothers could do. Reloaded is superb, and I would recommend it to any thinking moviegoer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"I disappointed either, but still great","The Matrix Reloaded is worse than The Matrix, but it is still great, despite it has some flaws. Automatically, people compared it with The Matrix and disappointed. However, this is not just another action movie, another thriller or another science fiction. This is Matrix! The opening scene repeats the first movie, but somehow impresses you. The dream of Neo is very inventive. Action in The Matrix Reloaded is not forgettable, not mild, not less. Content, story, atmosphere or action is peculiar to Matrix world (or should I say the directors) which, to me, make it difficult to say bad. Sometimes, people call some action movies non stop action, although, they are very slow paced or include less action, but The Matrix Reloaded is a great action movie apart from everything, but not shallow or hollow at the same time. In contrast, I disappointed in 2003 when I saw it for the first time at theater, because many action scenes consist of fighting, martial arts rather than gunfights like the first movie. I had expected much more gunfight scene. The action scenes in the first movie were recalling John Woo films, this is a different kind of action, but welcome. Those scenes are flowing, the choreography is almost flawless. There is Daniel Bernhardt who is a B movie star. When I was a child, I used to watch his movies. I wish they casted some other B movie stars such as Frank Zagarino, David Bradley, Marc Dacascos or Gary Daniels. By the way, at first, Wachowski Brothers had chose Jet Li for Seraph character, but they failed to agree with him. Jet Li in Matrix. It sounds great of course, even if the screen time of this character is very less. He was not an interesting character either, so in fact not a big loss. Zion was the most disappointing thing in the film. The Zion people are like party people rather than desperate people who wait for being saved. They look happy (and passionate!) The dance scene was bizarre and sometimes unnecessarily sexual, what was the point? It looked like a video clip in MTV. Do Wachowski Brothers try to show that they try to enjoy the life, because they may be killed by the sentinels soon? I don't think so and if it is, not a good idea. The fight scene with tens of Ajan Smith is the longest fighting scene of all times probably, it is too exaggerating, in some moments CGI is eyesore, it seems like animation, some acts are far-fetched, but it is very fun, I watched this sequence times without number. My favorite fighting scene is the one takes place in Merovingian's place. Thanks to Yuen Woo Ping, it is very flowing and great. The most interesting and creative new characters are The Twins. However, they seem a very hard case, very formidable adversaries, they have the potential, but they are not. It seems that the directors are not interested in those characters enough, also their screen time is less. And the car chase scenes. I disappointed a lot when saw it at theater, because I had expected much more, but I still watch it often. It looks showy, for example sunglasses whatever they do, unnecessary slow motions, a heavy music etc. but one of the longest and also best car chases of all times. In The Matrix Reloaded, the question ''what is Matrix?'' is almost answered after Neo enters through the door. This part is very complex, but the essence of Matrix. If in fantasy genre, there is The Lord of the Rings legend, in science fiction genre, there is The Matrix, even if Revolutions was pretty bad.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still captivates,"Very rarely are sequels as good, if not better, than their original. Normally we groan with mortification upon hearing a sequel being made to one of our favorite movies.  Such was not the case for Matrix Reloaded.  Now, I still thoroughly enjoy the original and hold it above Reloaded, but in no way does Reloaded fall short of the mark.The special effects are just as spectacular, the acting even better (with me growing to appreciate Keanu's talent more and more), and the cinematography incredible.  The set design for Zion was just absolutely fabulous.  I've read some weren't impressed with the storyline.  I, however, found it intriguing and in keeping with the Matrix theme. To me, anything else simply would have been a cop-out and not held up to the ""feel"" of the movie in and of itself.  I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for anyone.Now, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with certain scenes.  The CG was just entirely TOO obvious and, at times, looked like the animatrix rather than the Matrix.  Had I been watching an animated version, I'd have been impressed, but since this was supposed to be ""real people"", it only detracted from the experience for me...but not much.  Furthermore, some of the fight scenes WERE a bit overdone; but at the same time, I would have been seriously disappointed had Neo wiped out Smith in a kick or two.  So, again, this didn't detract much from the overall experience.  However, one aspect of the movie DID grate on my nerves...the unnecessary fight scenes thrown in just to...well, have a fight scene.  This definitely got old after a while.Aside from some of the minor flaws, Reloaded was incredibly entertaining. With humor, action, good acting, wonderful scenery, and awesome special effects, Reloaded proved it can hold up to its predecessor.  It's difficult going into a movie where you KNOW there's going to be a third one and you know who will be IN the third one...leaves little room for surprises.  Well, so you would think.  Reloaded was able to look beyond its upcoming sequel and pull you into the here and now; surprising you with its little twists and turns.Overall, this movie was just fantastic and a must see for Matrix fans, or even fans of action in general, and definitely will be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year (apart from Revolutions that is).  Out of 10 stars, I give Reloaded a 9...only taking a point away for the slight ""problems"" I had with the film.  This is truly a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A british perspective Matrix Reloaded= ground breaking,Hi allI am from London england and just saw the matrix reloaded today on thursday 22 may and there is only one word to describe this movie groundbreaking. this movie is unbelievable big up to everyone that worked on the matrix movie. and to those geeks that are dissing reloaded you need your heads checked this movie is brillant!martin,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Very good, with a few disappointments","Reading other review I would say that everyone expresses some dissatifaction with the movie but have a hard time putting a finger on it.  As others have pointed out the first movie was so good, that it could be called a perfect or complete movie.  The second movie does suffer from some bad acting, which all happens in Zion.  There is a very long dance scene early in the movie that adds nothing to further the plot.  Also toward the end Neo is presented with an explanation of event that is slightly hard to follow.  Remember to stay through the credits to see a sneak of the third movie.  Finally is a guide to character references:Soren-Søren Kierkegaard(?), an existentialist which believes stresses freedom of choice and responsibility for the consequences of one's acts.Kali- Hindu god of deathPersephone- Wife of Hades.Seraph-Seraphim are angels.Morpheus- God of dreamsNeo- new, anagram of oneMerovingian- protected the quest for the Holy GrailTirant-French for Knight I believe.Malachi- Messenger of God.

amazing.,"I understand that a lot of people came out of the theatre saying, what the hell was that? Yet almost no one even understood it (i don't blame u the architect talk was a bit confusing). I came in the theatre expecting an amazing movie, and what did i get? An even better movie, yeah I'll admit that the ""rave"" scene felt out of place, yet, as a huge matrix fan, i felt that it was necassary, every scene was. I've heard alot of talk about how its slow and that there's too much talking. There was alot of talking, but thats because the movie, seperated in categories of action and dialogue, was simple, there was action, tehn talking, then dancing/sex, then more talking then action action and more action. I'm sorry if you haven't enjoyed the movie and rather watch ""she's all that"" a movie that takes the intelligence of an infant to understand than watch the matrix realoded a mind blowing movie with a plot that will keep you thinking, what if?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It was wonderful,"This was a great sequel! One of the best sequels I have seen in a while! (Besides X2) The movie just started off with action and great techno music just like the first! (Although, I have to admit, the first movie had a better soundtrack) Overall, I give it a 10/10. I was waiting for this movie right when I left the movie theatre for the first movie. heh And I can't wait for the Matrix to have me in November! The movie series is wonderful and I think everyone should watch it. I don't understand why some people don't even like it. How could anyone not like it? It has action and it based on our wonderful world of technology but more advanced! It makes you think about the future and what it could hold for us.

"Great, but only half way through...","If you're about to see this, do yourself a favour and immediately see Matrix Revolutions (the third one). These two are actually one film -- cut in two. The ending of M2 seems strange (and so does M3 seen separately). Which makes all the reviews for the two undeservingly poor. The two films are far better off seen back-to-back. As they where shot. And enjoy! And why not treat yourself with a Matrix frenzy -- watching all three in one go?...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"This fanboy's wet dream may not be for everyone, but who cares? It's for me.","The Matrix probably didn't need a sequel, or two of them, for that matter. It might have been best if the Wachowski brothers had chosen to let the original stand and live on in the minds of fans around the world.There's not a lot in Reloaded in the way of plot -- just two hours of kung fu and car chases and flying and shooting and, oh yeah, did I mention flying? Characters go and do things, not because they think it's best, but because they're told to. When the characters question why, these inquiries are deflected with a wink and a ""just do it. You'll see."" You get the feeling that this is the message for the movie-goer too: ""Shhh. Don't think about it. Look: Trinity is wearing leather pants. And here's some kung fu.""That being said, the Matrix Reloaded is a fantastic piece of special effects and action wizardry. It's beautiful and deadly and so slick it threatens to slide right off the screen. Everyone should see it. It's fun, full stop.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
sub par sequel,"I anticipated this sequel as did many others.  Even though I had just watched the original movie earlier this week, I felt lost and unconnected to the story.  Suddenly Trinity and Neo have a deep love and will die for one another.  And we find out more about new characters through short excerpts into the lives of the people living in Zion. This is intended to make the story more emotionally connected, yet seems false because the two lovers barely have a conversation.  The movie is not all bad though, the special effects are quite amazing.  There are double the action sequences in this reloaded version than in the original.  The Wachowski brothers thought that amazing the audience with their computer graphics would be the way to go, however, without a strong story to back them up, the action almost gets boring.  With no real ending but a TO BE CONCLUDED at the end of the movie, the Matrix Reloaded is frustrating, and lacks the originality of the first Matrix movie.  I think this will disappoint, but I do recommend seeing it, perhaps when it comes out on video. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Bellucci! Bellucci!! Bellucci!!!,"First off, I would like to say that Monica Bellucci is an absolute goddess.I went to the Matrix Reloaded for the action sequences. However, I am a supporter of action sequences that actually have meaning to the overall story, as in the original Matrix. The first 45 minutes of this movie holds nothing but needless action scenes with surprisingly little intrigue. From the point where Neo fights Agent Smith on, this movie is what is should be. The story gets going, and the fight scenes are there to support it. That French dude was a pretty cool character, and the twins were absolutely amazing. I just wish they were in it more. The highway chase scene is one of the best I have ever seen in my life. Agents, Albino Twins, awesome fight scenes...you name it this scene had it. Therefore, despite the confusing/lackluster story, I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. Not as good as the Matrix, but the awesome action scenes make up for what the movie lacks in character and storyline intrigue. As for Bellucci, she was a tier above gorgeous in this movie. Although her part is relatively small, it is extremely intrical to the storyline. Can't wait to see her in Matrix 3!!!P.S. be sure to stay after the credits for the very first preview of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Wow...better than the original!,"This movie will leave you wanting more, but happy with what you got. The story takes some turns and leads us nicely into a final installment that will hopefully answer some questions...Agent Smith and his agenda?!?!The fight scenes are amazing! The problem with the first Matrix was that all of the fight scenes in which the characters moved fast were all in slow-motion. I thought this took away from the intensity of the scene. The characters on screen seldomly moved faster than the average person. Reloaded fixed this. Many scenes displayed hands, feet, weapons moving far faster than the average human can handle. This makes for a very amazing feeling of awe at every turn. If a computer was hooked to my brain, all you would have seen was the word ""Wow"" repeated over and over again.I will be seeing this, like many others, again and again. Any person who dislikes this movie is probably just one of those people who dislikes whatever is popular, and likes things just because they are unpopular.

GOOD!,Started off a bit slow (well...real slow...even in the fighting sequences) and a few things (such as the tribal rave in Zion and the cake & the girl's panties) were needless and shouldn't have been put in - but a great followthrough to a great movie! 10 out of 10!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"While visually wonderful and continued to be groundbreaking for its time, narratively hugely disappointing contrived sequel that wasn't necessary. Explosive but empty","The original Matrix is one of the greatest films of all time. It was revolutionary in its production techniques, it was totally original in its style (late 90s industrial gothic martial arts), and most importantly it was an incredibly intelligent story about reality and spirituality packaged into an exciting and enjoyable hollywood action movie.The Matrix Reloaded retains 3 of these things. It takes the action sequences and production techniques available at the time to a new level. It maintains its original style and atmosphere (Marilyn Manson and Linkin Park on the soundtrack - yes please!). However, where it falls short and what makes it ultimately fatal is that there is very little intelligent story. There is a surface level plot, which is much thinner than the original Matrix and could probably be summarised in 10 seconds, though it does mostly make sense within the universe. But there is absolutely no intelligent depth to this one. There are a couple of soundbites that suggest a deeper message and make you think for a second. But other than that the film feels totally vapid without a meaningful belly. All of the action (which is what carries and which is most of the films running time) though visually stunning, especially for its time, feels empty without the depth of characterisation and purpose that made the original Matrix so wonderful. Because the Matrix is so unique and the first film so great, it isn't just disappointing that the second one fails it is very sad and tragic for fans of the original because there is nothing else like it that we can rest our hopes on.The original Matrix was perfect in every way and was complete, it did not need a sequel. While I don't know if this is true, it feels as if due to the success of the original it was decided that sequels would be made. So they retrospectively concocted a way for the story to continue. It doesn't feel a natural or organic furthering of the story, the whole thing feels contrived. And unlike the Fantastic Beasts universe for instance which was contrived for the fans after the conclusion of the original Harry Potter series, but which is actually very good and almost as much work and passion has gone into it as the original, The Matrix Reloaded feels like very little work was done on the narrative (and all effort put into the action sequences), so in short the whole thing is a drag.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is a movie about race,"I didn't go into the theater with high expectation, but in the end I found myself fascinated by the complexity of racial, sexual, and cultural politics in this movie, not to mention the best ""space-ship-battle"" since the Star Wars. Two ultimate white guys (Neo as Christ and Smith as Satan) have to neutralize each other in order to save the Zion, the haven for the colored people as well as those who are ""computer programs"", Oracle, her Chinese bodyguard, and that lovely Indian girl.  Although Neo is the One, he couldn't have done it without the help of Trinity, and Zion couldn't have been saved without soldier-like men and women in rank and file. Machine is not the enemy of humanity. It is the Agent Smith (conservative white hegemony) whose existence serves only to destroy both human and machine world.  Neo (liberal white) exists only to cancel out his counterpart, Smith. Both Neo and Smith are nothing but our dream of good vs. evil, whereas the real heroes are every one of those (black, white, and AI) who know what the word love means.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Who stole the peanut butter?,Very good movie I thought. It was obvious to me before I saw this movie that it would not be as ground-breaking as the original so I just went in expecting a good flick with some good fighting.

"this one is great, just pay attention","first of all : before you nag about the movie, make sure you have understood the dialogue between the architect and neo. this is the breakpoint of this movie, this dialogue completely twists the first movie and all you have seen of the second movie, leaves you completely puzzled and lets you eagerly await the 3rd movie. this one scene alone makes those follow-ups worthwhile.apart from that, come on people, its a great action-flick aswell. the first 30 minutes suck badly, but then the action starts and never stops. the kung-fu is great, the shooting is great, and hugo weaving as agent smith has to be one of the coolest villains ever in movie-history. his cold agression is just mindblowing.so for christs sake, try to understand what the f*** is going on and lighten up. 6 of 5, definately.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Outstanding! A refreshing movie that really surprised me.,"I still can't understand why people disliked this movie so much. It's got the same style the first one featured, much improved dialogue, more characters, more depth... it just couldn't get us by surprise as the first one did. After all, this IS a the second movie of the trilogy. There is no end and no beginning. That may be odd for some people. But that's its purpose. I believed that, after the first Matrix, the other two were going to be predictable and only a visual feast. But I was wrong. The same way ""The Matrix"" surprised me and made me think for years, I'm already blown away by the depth this movie shown. The whole idea of free will and what are the motives of human beings is, at the same time, incredibly interesting, depressing and refreshing. The first movie questioned reality and control. This one questions choice and motive. I was glad to see The Matrix Reloaded could also make me think about the universe and my role in it as the first movie did. I was thinking it was going to be impossible, once we think everything is clear when the first movie ends. Besides the philosophical content, this film is also a breakthrough in terms of special effects, of course. Never in my life I was so amazed by the quality of the fights, the settings and mostly the way the camera moved in a movie. The Wachowski are truly masters when it comes to that. I feel like I could watch their fight scenes forever. They are always creative, provoking and extremely well-done. People complain about the ""Rave Scene"", the love scene between Neo and Trinity and other minor things. I really don't understand how can you dislike the whole experience The Matrix Reloaded is just because of those (which, in my opinion, are not misplaced, just a little too long). Some may also be confused because part of the story is told in the ANIMATRIX and in ENTER THE MATRIX(computer game). I've seen ANIMATRIX but I haven't played the game yet. It's nice to see how it all fits. Anyway, believe me, not having watched it won't spoil your movie at all. Time has never passed so fast for me. The movie started and as I blinked it was over. And I watch MANY films. I've had a lot of fun and my brain was trying to keep up with the plot the same way it did on movies like MEMENTO. Mix that with the visual feast and you have a masterpiece. 10/10, indubitably.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Action galore,"Beastly movie with as much bad-ass-ness and even more amazing action scenes than the first. But thematically and story-wise, the first one is much better. Still, this is an extremely entertaining movie with action sequences that seem way before their time. So many memorable scenes and jaw-dropping moments.There are definitely flaws. Inserting completely unnecessary love-triangle garbage. More than once (the kiss scene is horrendous). It didn't really bother me, but many of the scene transitions are noticeable abrupt and sudden. And a really bad CGI scene, complete with a cartoon sound effect of hitting bowling pins.Those flaws should get me to lower the score, but I can't emphasize enough how amazing these action scenes are.

Thomas Young is a hater,"I watched the movie opening night and was immersed in it. To put it straight, the bigger the fan you are of the first movie the more you will be blown away.

And for the ending, well I wont go there but put it this way, I need to see the movie again just to absorb all that happened cause some new sh*t goes down!

Reloaded With The Best For The Year!,"Now, this is definitely the year of the matrix. The Wachowski have proven that a sequel to the Matrix will make it a sensational hit this year.Heart pumping action that will leave your popcorn stay frozen in the air, and a whole lot more aspects that way surpasses The Matrix.Of course, many would find that the remark of ""To Be Concluded"" annoying or a movie categorized as not worth watching. Hey, get a life, if one could wait a whole damn year to watch Lord of the Rings, what's a matter of 6 months.

The most satisfying sequel I have ever seen.,"What can I say?  I would like to say as little as possible...  I believe this movie is probably most enjoyable when viewed with a firm knowledge of the plot and underlying themes and messages in the first movie, and with as little advance information of the sequels as possible.The movie rewards anyone who recognized the Christian, Buddist, philosophical (Existentialism, Nihilism and Predetermination in particular) and literary references that were abound in the first film, and while you can appreciate the movie without viewing on that level, it is a refreshingly entertaining mix of mind-twisting philosophy, mind-numbing fights and mind-blowing visuals effects.  Trying to understand everything can prove exceedingly difficult, but the engimatic presentation of the film prevent it from ever being frustrating.I greatly enjoyed the first film, and had high hopes for the sequels. Despite my high hopes and the usually subdued quality of the second installment of a trilogy, this movie completely blew me away and left me feeling throughly entertained.  For me personally, it was the single most fulfilling cinematic experience I can recall.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"I'm going again! 4,5* out of 5*","Last night I went to the first public screening in Holland. I had high hopes, since I've been looking out fot this movie for like 3 months. So I bought the tickets 2 weeks before the release just to make sure I would get in. Yes, I'm a fan. I think the movie was absolutly brilliant, I loved it from beginning till end. Starting with a scene somewhat similar to the one in the  first Matrix since Trinity is kicking some serious ass, this film clings you to the screen. The fights are superb, I've never seen anything like this in my live. Of course there's alot of computer work in it, but you don't really notice that, it still looks realistic.I wasn't the only one in the audience who thought about it that way because multiple times the crowd spontaneously started to clap. So the fighting, stunts and car chases are 5*. The story :Sentinels are digging there way through the earth to destroy Zion. Our heroes have 72 hours to stop them. They have to find the keymaker to get to the Source and destroy the Matrix, will they succeed...? I think that the story is less cause the philosophy is a bit over the top. Sometimes dialogues are hard to comprehend, and you sort of lose your concentration. Especially when a conversation starts with a corny sentence like : Why are we here?. The dialogues are sometimes corny and boring, but sometimes witty and sometimes even funny. You get to laugh more in this one than in the first. The actors do a pretty good job, Keanu Reeves IS the One, I can't imagine anyone else playing him. The love between him and Carrie Ann Moss's Trinity is believable and Morpheus is a true leader. Agent Smith is climbing his way to the top of best villains ever. The newcomers Niobe (Jada pinkett Smith) and Persephone (Monica Belucci) add an extra, especially Monica Belucci who steals the scenes she's in. Another thing I loved were the outfits, they are just perfect, and create a certain mood. So overall I loved the movie, I can understand that some people, especially the critics, are somewhat disappointed. But that's because they keep comparing it to part 1. The Matrix was new and original, of course the sequel isn't as much of that, but how can you expect that? It's a sequel so you can't come up with another new philosophy and a whole new storyline. They also say there isn't something new in it like bullet time, there wrong there is this whole new thing with visual graphics and it isn't a obvious as bullet time but it is there. The fights are much better than in the firstI'm going again! 4,5* out of 5*",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Key Error,"Chances are that this has been pointed out in the past, but to all those pseudo-philosophers who say ""Whoa - we really are in the Matrix"", there is one key error in the film. Morpheus tells Neo that humanity is enslaved in order to harness human's bio-electricity to run the machines. He points out that their source of food is the liquified remains of others from the Matrix. The Matrix is therefore a giant perpetual-motion machine - which is, of course, impossible.Morpheus does add in a throwaway line that the machines use fusion as well for their energy needs - my thinking is that this would be their main energy source.Anyway, if a Matrix really was needed, why not use a creature less troublesome than humans? Surely sheep and cows produce bio-electricity too.Regardless of that small issue, I  suspended my disbelief and sat back and enjoyed the movie. I venture to say I'll enjoy the second and third installments too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Intended"" Sequels Have a Place, Somewhere","If you asked 17 year old me to review this movie objectively, you'd have probably gotten the faded, half-coherent ramblings of a fan-boy. The hype was real and the clout the Wachowski's garnered from the first film in the series can't be denied, but having watched Releoaded at least a dozen times since my youth, I can honestly say neither the visuals nor the dialogue hold up very well. The first film is timeless, whereas Reloaded now, it seems, was untimely. The CG just wasn't quite there yet, and mixing it with practical effects just turns what was a cheap wine into vinegar.This movie is not without merit. The dialogue, while somewhat incoherent and obtuse at times, can be engaging when it's not completely expository. The practical action sequences are proficient, and the highway chase, with its mix of practical and CG, works well. That said, seeing Neo fight hand-to-hand with faceless minion with sword #5 can become laborious, when seemingly nothing is at stake.Neo and Trinity have about as much chemistry as a Betty Crocker oven from the late 80's, while the erotic scenes have about as much taste as a cake from said oven. There's something missing, and leaving these scenes out would have done wonders for expediting the story.The first film in the trilogy should and could have been left as a stand alone, but once Hollywood smells money, taste can and usually does go out the window. The ""have your thesaurus ready"" dialogue attempts to be exclusive, while in actuality it alienates not only the most interested and seasoned vocabularies, but also those for whom one ergo is too much.Decent sequel, decent movie, but falls short in spite of a larger budget and more lofty special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Mind Bending - But Everything Makes Sense in the End...,"This movie is like an enigma rolled into a fortune cookie.  It is a puzzle that is right there in front of you - plain as day but too much focus is put into the wording of the little piece of paper inside that we forget all about the hard little shell that contained the ideas presented.  And once the ""cookie crumbles"" what are you left with? In the case of this movie a very satisfying mind trip that makes you rethink everything you thought about the ""Matrix"" and Zion. Is Neo the ONE?  Yes, but as mentioned in the first movie - he is a ""second?!?!?"" coming.  I loved the idea presented at the end of this movie - where everything comes down to choice - and every choice has its consequences.  What is best about this movie is that it took everything you thought you knew about the Matrix and turned it on its ear.  Are all programs necessarily bad?  No.  Is Neo truly the messiah some of his followers think he is or just an anomoly in the system as the programs view him.  In the end it came down to what sacrifices was Neo willing to make - do we risk all of mankind for a freedom that those inside the matrix would never want to be part of?

Guess We Had To Have This Part,"With The Matrix an excellent, exceptional prologue to the trilogy, and the Revolutions promising to be a worthy epilogue, it is perhaps sad that Reloaded is such a plain movie. Admittedly, there are a series of very well-executed special effects in the movie. The fighting is great, though where Neo battles a crowd of identical opponents with a pole, the Brothers seem to have watched too closely how Sauron unconvincing batted enemies around in that other blockbuster. Where this movie goes wrong is in over-exposition. On at least four occasions, secondary characters are given ample opportunity to explain at length what the movie is about. These bits are just plain boring, though the underlying philosophical questions are fascinating in themselves. Also, there's a fair bit of utterly pointless sexuality, as well as a very lame secondary love plot. Nevertheless, this movie tells the middle part of the Matrix trilogy and as such is worth seeing, if only to connect the other two. If you liked the Matrix and are eagerly expecting Revolutions, you'll have to see this too. If you're not that interested and thought Matrix was the high point in cinematic history, you might be better off skipping this episode and just hope to make sense of part three.

Not as Good as the First,"Here's my impression after seeing it on opening night.1.  Some neat special effects, but very slow moving.Unlike the first Matrix, which had you riveted to the seat, the beginning of this movie was heavily laden on dialogue and building on the interaction between Trinity and Neo.  Way overdone, the movie pace actually slows down and is way overdone in this regards.The fight scenes are similar to what we saw in Matrix 1, however, speed it up and add some explosions, and that's what you are seeing in the Matrix Reloaded.  Some of the scenes tend to be dragged out beyond what is necessary.2.  What's up with Smith?He had such a great part in 1, that he is back in Reloaded with some new special effects.  Quite exciting earlier on, yet nowhere within the movie has it really explained how he got there and how he returned.  In addition, the viewer really can't figure out how he can do some of the things that's going on.3.  My two cents, is that the most unique part was the last 5 minutes.

Now we have to wait until next season (Revolutions) to see what happens- which by the way I THINK I KNOW BUT I'M NOT TELLING!Trinity is beyond hot- every man's dream. Warm, beautiful, caring, sexy, kicks ass- Neo is a lucky savior indeed. I have to say though, my favorite character was Link. He was the most human and has a great line- (""Where's my...) Nope, won't give that one away either.Good story but not as universally appealing as the first one. Kind of like the new Star Wars movies or just Star Trek in general. Better than Attack of the Clones by far but nowhere near as good as Two Towers- (not much is).Can't really judge this one until we see part two- (I mean three but part two of this ""series"").

Brilliance Reloaded,"I went to see the movie expecting to see a decent action flick, convinced that there was no way the sequel would live up to the original. I walked out surprised, stunned and overjoyed by a cinematic experience that met and surpassed anything I could have hoped for.

A filler in the series.,"As any Matrix fan would want this movie has lots of bullet time and plenty of action. What it doesn't have is an original plot which is what the first one used to become such a success. The story never made me think twice about it, and in only one place was there a good twist in it. Overall if you like the first movie you will most probably enjoy the second one , but you won't like it as much as the first. I would summarize by saying this movie is most probably a filler designed to make the 3rd one better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A movie hard to understand,"I tought the first Matrix movie was one of the best movies ever but altough I did not have so big expectations on the second  part in the serie. That beacuse I did not belive that the ""brothers"" could make a story so good as in the first one and I never really understood why they were going to do a second and a third part.But after I saw the movie I have to say that I was pleased. The movie was great. Not as good as the first one but it was good. The movie had some great action scenes and som great special effects if you dont count the coputeranimated sequense when Neo is fighting the clones of agent Smith.The story is great I have to say. But it is kinda hard to understand. All the take about the Matrix works and how it was made and Neo part of everything is hard to understand the first time. But if you see it two ore three times you understaand and suddenly everything make sense.And the the amazing plot turn in the end of the movie is one of the greatest. I hope they use it in a great way in Revelutions.This movie might not be so good the first time you watch it but if you give it a nother shot I think that everyone will find it to be one of the best action movies of all time. Not as good as the first Matrix but a worthy number two.I give this movie 9/10 and the nine has a big +",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

its perfection is its failure,"In terms of sheer visual beauty this movie is amazing. from the clothes, to the fighting sequences to the unflinching expressions of cool permanently present on every characters face, it has it all.Where it fails is the underlying substance beneath all the glitter. The storyline doesn't progress until far too late in the movie to devoid me of the desensitization for the special effects.And when you do start seeing bits and pieces of the story in between all the choreographed fighting, your reaction is either so what? or who cares.. until possibly the very end.This movie simply tries to be too perfect. The first matrix was a better movie precisely because of its flaws , because of the cheesy dialog, because of the sparsely used special effects, because of keanu reeves' silly acting. but this movie seems devoid of any  idiosyncrasy , it's all been glossed over and airbrushed to monotony, every character portrays only a limited set of predictable emotions (not much more than their supposedly ""free will"" lacking matrix generated enemies) and worst of all, all sense of novelty is gone until the very end, where we at last see a glimpse of intrigue - of something unexpected that we could not extrapolate ourselves from the first movie.in short, the last 10 minutes of this film are what's important. and it's unfortunate that so much special effects and visual beauty are wasted in the beginning. i hope the third movie fulfills the prophecy of excellence offered by the last few moments of this second installment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More questions than answers-a good thing.,"First off, it is difficult for any movie to live up to the kind hype and anticipation that Reloaded has faced. That said, it would have been hard for me to be more satisfied than I was seeing Reloaded tonight.Living in Japan, I was subjected to a lot of post release info coming from the States, much of it critical. For those of you who insist that this movie was just too cool, I contest that you are missing the point. This is a comic book fantasy adventure in which the characters are designed to be cool. Even The (dense) One becomes cool after his indoctrination with Morpheus and Co.This movie is outrageous fun. With regards to story and suspense, I believe that it surpasses the original. Ultimately, we are left with lots of questions to keep us excited for Revolutions this autumn.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Lots of action!,"Reloaded is a cool movie.  There's a ton of action, cool characters, and the plot was a little bit hard to understand (for me).

"90% Pleased, 10% huh?","The movie didn't disappoint- a thoroughly fun ride from start to finish. A couple of sequences were choppy- the much-ballyhooed freeway chase was well done, but the subsequent few minutes were awkwardly arranged- almost to the point where I asked my friend if it were a preview for the third movie.The twins are now the new 'Darth Maul' of the movie world, as ""cool villains who didn't get enough face time.""  The development with the Smith character is intriguing, but the underlying info you learn about the Matrix, well... It reminds me of another recent movie, but out of respect for those who haven't seen it, I'll decline to compare it directly.A mini-trailer for the third film follows the credits, so if you're curious, don't leave before it's done.Any Matrix fan should (and likely will) enjoy this film.

quite amazing,"It took me two viewings to make up my mind about it and now I must say I find it quite amusing and amazing. Of course, the mind-blowing experience of the first Matrix could not possibly be repeated but still I think it was a good film. The first 40 minutes or so, however, were terribly boring and absolutely superfluous - the Wachowski brothers could have used the money and screen time for something else. Especially cheesy were the scenes with the ""fan club"" of Neo and the ""they need you / I need you"" line - as if we have forgotten that we are watching a Hollywood production.The rave scene at Zion was also absolutely pointless, not to mention the fact that at certain moments Zion reminded me of a number of other films seen before. I mean, the Wachowski brothers have shown that they have the vision and imagination to come up with something better than that.Fortunately in the Reloaded there were certain attempts for comic relief, which against the background of the dark future and the upcoming major battle were very welcome. I truly enjoyed the gallery of new characters in Reloaded.I very much hope to get to see The Twins in the last part - I found them quite amusing. The ""Burly Brawl"" scene and the highway chase were by far the two peaks in the movie and are definitely worth every cent spent on them.In conclusion, I can hardly wait for the conclusion of the trilogy and in the meantime will perhaps go several more times to see Reloaded.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"More about action, less about characters and plot","The Matrix Reloaded was a hugely hyped film that was meant to do the impossible: to be better than the brilliant original. The novelty has already gone while the main strength of the original, despite groundbreaking fx, was it's great story. That story has now already been told. Mr Anderson turning into Neo, The One, becoming his true self and finding out the stunning truth.So, what is left after this? More action. Lots more. Surely, more spectacular and over-the-top, but more is not always more. The movie fails in introducing interesting new characters and the dialogue is extremely dull, lacking the humour and spunk of the first movie. We're supposed to believe Neo and Trinity (and I still don't get why she is called that) truly love each other with a sex scene? I'll prefer the Han Solo-Princess Leia romance anytime. And where are the little comic reliefs like the Mouse character in the first movie? Furthermore, where is the suspense? Do we really fear for Neo's life now that he has found out about his superpower, taking on 100's of Agent Smith clones and flying around like superman? I'll prefer an unprepared Luke Skywalker challenging Vader in ""Empire"" anytime. It was like the Wachovsky Brothers took out everything likeable about Anime (character develeopment, little distincion between good and evil, insecureties and weaknesses of the hero) and substituted it for bland American comicbook Superheroism.The plot can be summarized as the following: sentinels heading towards Zion plus Neo having to find Keymaker that is needed for access to the Matrix Mainframe. This, between the boring dialogue (except perhaps for the dialogue in the ending with the maker and the chitchat with that French dude), is filled up with an extended version of the trailer. Yup, that's it. The trailer already showed small parts of all the action scenes, leaving no surprising action scenes. All in all, a disappointment. What went wrong in a production that was so obviously dedicated (making us wait 4 years) in creating a superior sequel. The only comfort I can take in it is that they probably wanted to save the best for last.So, all we have is action? Are they any good? Certainly. The Attack of the Smith Clones should become legendary and is unseen in film history. The car chase is extremely complex and long. Furthermore, more kungfu than guns which is a good thing. My only problem was that Laurence Fishburnes moves looked a bit slow.One more thing: that whole techno/tribal dance thing in Zion, after Morpheus speech, it was rather ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I like techno, but it just seemed out of place.So, sequels still suck, most of the time....bummer! 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Outstanding effects, some magic lost","It's going to be expected...the beauty of the first film took you inside a normal guy making realizations about the ""reality"" of this world and our way of life. We as the audience could relate to him.In Reloaded, all that's gone and it's far more driven by modern intrigue and war between human and the machines. Not that this is a bad thing, but again, it takes away the viewers sense of being able to relate.However, as a sci-fi action (oh my, the action) film, it's one of the more spellbinding films I've seen. The effects are stunning, primarily because they have to use real people throughout the majority of the film, not just relying on computer generation.The story is generic, but still acceptable and we do not lose sight of Neo as a person, as opposed to being just a warrior or ""savior"". This film is far sexier than the first and more bold in terms of adult themes, which I was thankful for. I hate it when good films are downplayed to reach a broader audience. The creators of the film keep the mood and genre very consistent with what you'd expect. They also did a good job of making Neo seem unstoppable, as he seemed to be in the end of the first film, but still vulnerable because of his human nature.I gave this one a high rating, for pure entertainment value alone. I will be curious to see the third installment, so the full story is complete. However, I suspect it will be much of the same as Reloaded.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A hard one to judge.,"Neo: Why are you here? The Oracle: Same reason. I love candy.Everybody was shocked and surprised after they saw The Matrix (1999). It had an amazing opening, jaw-dropping special effects and an original plot to die for. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) became a well known modern bad-guy and Keanu Reeves was turned in to a true Hollywood star. I'd doubt that anyone hated the first film. It was just far too unique and amazing and could be compared to the likes of Star Wars. Now it seems the sole film will become a trilogy within a year, and the question many people are asking is if it was a decent idea. The Matrix: Reloaded answers any questions you have about the film. What was the answer?A new plot is started in Reloaded. As told in The Matrix, there is only one surviving human city named Zion. Zion is heavily relied on as it preserves 250,000 humans who survived the start of the war (Machine VS Man). The story of Reloaded begins in the mini series, Animatrix. A ship and it's crew, named Osiris, are chased up to the surface of Earth where they find the machines are beginning to drill down towards Zion along with 250,000 sentinel machines. One sentinel for each human. The Osiris crew quickly alarm Zion before falling from sentinel attacks. This is where the film, Reloaded, starts. While on their way back to Zion, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) begins to have dreams of his lover's (Trinity played by Carrie Anne Moss) fate, which doesn't seem to be a great one. Morpheus (played my Laurence Fishburne) begins to rely on the proficy to save mankind from the threat the machines are sending, and a time limit is set for how long they have to save Zion. Unfortunately for Neo, Morpheus believes Neo is the only person who can save Zion, as Neo, now The One, has complete power over The Matrix. And so they set off on their adventure, meeting new enemies and even more Agents and introducing a new operator named Link.Reloaded takes a while to start the action, beginning with a 30 minute segment where Zion and other crews are introduced to the viewer. But once the 30 minutes are over the viewer is pretty munched, with Neo, dropped in to an all action movie with kung-fu fighting, inspired by comics and other films, and the greatest special effects and CGI you will ever see in a decade. There are fight scenes which honestly could compete for the greatest film scenes ever. However, it seems the movie has been slightly hyped up. There are some scenes which seem to go on forever, pretty much explaining every single little detail about what the film's based around and having static lectures for roughly 10 minutes, which isn't really very thrilling at all. I also realized, except for Neo's dreams of Trinity's fate always flashing back, there never seems to be much suspense. The end is also slightly confusing for the dim-minded.. As well as putting on a cliff-hanger which will make you want to swear at the Wachowski Brothers. Although most of the action scenes make up for this anyway.I honestly don't think i can judge this film properly, as the follow up to it (named The Matrix: Revolution) needs to explain what the hell was going on in Reloaded as the plot simply just cuts off at the end with a nice ""To be concluded"" message. Reloaded has many ups and downs. Mostly ups, but the downs are quite big mistakes. However, i don't feel let down because i understand what was happening. While the action may of been excessive, it was all beautiful and amazingly crafted. None of it could be predicted, so came as a large surprise. BUT, there's too much static discussion and the story is incomplete which may let down people a lot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"This movie may cause fear for those who have seen the first, as how can you top the twist and the original idea of the Matrix?  Fear not.

The action sequences are riveting- I have never seen anything like it before and I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  But the best part, the real guts to the film is halfway through, when you are pulled into the new understanding of the Matrix and the Oracle,as Neo is. And yes,there is a twist- one that will make you confused and wonder how well you really understood the first movie, and what this means for Neo.

more mythos,"The  reason why I liked the second Matrix as much as I did (and do)(after a LONG consideration and few conversations) is that the story became much more deeper than in the first one. The first one was basicly nice fighting and strange camera tricks with some background information. This second one gave direct and many indirect hints about the Matrix mythos (which I'm not very familiar with, (read: not a hard-core fan)). Of course there were few quite lame clichés but after all it has more clever plot than 90% of the movies in same genre. The best thing about the plot was that you can't be sure (at least after one view) 'bout watch going on with the Matrix, you can only speculate on it.So, as an action/etc. movie:****½ as a movie generally: ***",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I guess it was too intelligent for some people,"After reading many of the hilarious negative posts about Reloaded I've drawn three conclusions:1.  Some people don't accurately recollect why they liked ""The Matrix"".Matrix is a very thin movie with many cheesy moments.  It was what it was - a creative, unique, introductory action film.  It was not an epic, and it certainly did not have a very detailed story.  To claim that Reloaded ""doesn't live up to the original"" is preposterous.  Reloaded takes the themes and ideas of the original and expands them many times over. Further, there is simply no comparison between the action in Matrix v. Reloaded. It is more complex and dynamic in Reloaded.  If you don't believe me, watch Matrix again.2.  The dialogue was operating at a level far above the intellectual capabilities of many people who saw this movie.I often hear people say they want intelligent, thoughtful action films. Well, here it is - just about as intelligent and thoughtful as action films are ever going to be, and then its attacked for have ""boring"" dialogue, with ""too much"" philosophy.  I found the conversations, ideas, and concepts in Reloaded to be fascinating and addicting to listen to.  I didn't want the conversations to end.3.  Some sci-fi fans will only accept their vision of the future.The W brothers gave you their vision of the future.  Whether WE liked it or not didn't matter one lick to them.  I found the Zion celebration to be fascinating.  How do you know how you would party if you were part of the final 250,000 humans on earth?  And what was wrong with Morpheus' speach? I thought it was powerful, concise, and accomplished its goal.Last thought - any suggestion that the ONLY reason the W Brothers cast a large number of African Americans was because they seem ""cool"" is disgusting.  The acting in this movie was of the highest quality, and the W Brothers should be commended for having a vision of the future where white people don't run everything.  My question is where are the Latinos and Asians?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie is fantastic/ misunderstood.,"I cant stand it when people bad mouth a movie that had so much effort put into it.I cant believe some people think this movie is bad. It was fantastic!

But my second viewing changed all that.The script for the movie is a masterpiece. Did anyone who didnt like it ACTUALLY understand it? I bet you didnt. They dont give out the secret right to your face. To get the movie, follow and link the 3 key scenes- The oracle, the Mirovingian and the Architect. You'll be shocked and think of all the posibilities that can come out.The Action was...well, mind breaking. I loved the stair case fight scene.Also, People say there is no story? What about ""The empire strikes back"". Its the most popular, and let me tell you the story ""Rebels run from empire...Han goes to cloud city...empire is also there + secret at end (the ""I am your father"".""Thats it.

Reloaded,"Watched it yesterday with my girlfriend.

What a movie!,"The Matrix Reloaded is sure to displease many people. Which is a shame, because on its own, Reloaded is a roller coaster ride of a film with spectacular effects, great actions sequences, an intelligent plot, and a twist ending. But when taken as a sequel to the modern masterpiece The Matrix, the movie may seem sub-par. Parts of the film drag and the emotional investment in the characters is not as strong as the first film. The plot will definitely be too intelligent for many people. I don't say this to brag, but it has shown to do so already. I have heard many people complaining cause they just don't understand the plot, Neo's inner struggle, the technical issues, and the battle between control and choice. Reloaded is a masterful film, the Wachowskis own film to end all films so to speak. It is meant to be a somewhat intellectual action oriented sci-fi romantic war film, and it does each thing and still entertains, and I loved it.

Acting 7/10 acting is great and full of expression but is not the best acting I have ever seen. Story line 7.5/10 as I said, play the game and watch the Animatrix and you will understand Reloaded better but if you just watch Reloaded without playing the game or watching the Animatrix you'll probably not understand it very well.

"Great film, not a dissapointment at all!","First of all, I want to apologize for my poor English. With that said, let me say something about the movie.When I first saw it, i thought it was great. I didn't know anything about the plot and I didn't read reviews about this film, because i wanted to see it with an open mind, I wanted to judge it by myself. And I think that was a good decision. By now I have seen this film two times in a cinema and several times on DVD and I have to say it is a great movie, a masterpiece! It takes the whole story on a higher level. And that's the problem that many people have with this film. They just don't get it, they don't understand it. Many of my friends didn't even get the story of the original Matrix when they saw it the first time. And this time the story is even more complex and harder to understand, because there are so many details in this film, and you just have to see it several times, and even if you do, there is no guarantee that you will fully understand it. Another thing, many people had a problem with, is the fact that this is just the first part of one movie. Because I believe that you can't figure the story out by watching just the second installment. The first movie was complete. It had a beginning and an end. People didn't know and didn't expect a second and even a third part. Now, Reloaded hasn't a clear beginning and it surely has no end. And many seem to have a problem with this. You just have to wait for the last part. But even then I don't expect everyone to figure everything out.About the action - it's just great. An improvement to the first film. The choreography of the fighting is something I have never seen before in a movie (well, Tiger and Dragon was pretty cool, too). Maybe some fights are a bit too long, but thats something I can live with. The freeway chase is simply a true masterpiece of mindbending action, and it is again something I have never seen before. My mouth was the 14 minutes that it takes wide open, because I just couldn't believe that it is possible to shoot such scenes.To all who haven't seen the film yet, I would recommend to see it with an open mind. Don't trust all the bad reviews. I believe that you will be compelled to stay in front of your TV, even long after the credits began. And if you saw it, wait for revolutions and then you can decide whether you'll like it or not.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie is the first sequel to The Matrix,"A letdown on so many levels.The biggest to me is that at the end of the first Matrix, Neo had what appeared to be a transcendent experience. He could see the Matrix for what it really was, and could stop bullets and fly because he was no longer bound by its reality.In this sequel, he's instead essentially become a superhero with powers. That's nowhere near as good.The CGI they used for Neo is so painfully obvious and BAD. The bullet time in the first movie looked so great and surreal because it was REAL footage. Here, it's not only obviously fake in places, in battles they FREQUENTLY switch to slow motion so you can get a good long look at just how fake it is.The highway scene is cool, but contains a shockingly apparent continuity error (Morpheus' sword location) that you marvel a movie with this kind of burger could have such a flaw.Pacing: Reloaded could really have used a trim. The most notorious scene is the rave. Personally, I think the whole scene should be cut, including Morpheus's speech, but it certainly should have been trimmed to the bone and kept the same message they were going for. Well, unless that message was to bore the audience silly.The overall pacing is so bad, I wonder if they just ran out of time to edit.Well, they're making a Matrix 4, and my attitude is exactly what it was when Star Wars Solo was announced: if I hear a whole bunch of real life people harping on how fantastic it is, I'll take an early look. Otherwise, maybe check it out when it shows up free on one of the streamers.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the original.,"I have to admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of the original. The first time I watched it was long after it had been released and I had heard so much about it that I think my expectations were too high. Upon repeat viewings, I grew to appreciate it more and more. It's still not in my top ten but an enjoyable movie none the less. After seeing Reloaded, my appreciation for the original increased ten fold.I'm sure I will be burned at the stake for saying it, but I really didn't care to much for Reloaded. Not from a visual stand point, it looks amazing, and not because of the acting. I just found myself losing interest in the story. The opening was slow. With the exception of the freeway scene, which I loved, the action scenes seemed to drag on a bit long. and I felt that they were to few and far between. The story itself just couldn't hold my interest.I guess, to make a long story short, I think that the first one was a great stand alone movie that didn't need a sequel. I almost felt as I watched this one that it was only made to make money. If I didn't need the closure because of the cliff hanger ending, I probably wouldn't see the third one. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, the direction the story is taking just doesn't appeal to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Whoa! What a ride.,"This movie is totally awesome it's just as complex as the first movie but adds more action to the movie. Alot of harsh film critics are saying that too many special effect scenes seems to hurt this movie but I beg to differ. As a movie buff I feel if you can go and watch a movie and forget about your personal, work, etc... worries for 2+ hours that this movie has entertained you and therefore did it's job. This is a great movie I highly recommend.10 out of 10 on this awesome movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The sequel fails to deliver,"I have to admit that the movie was pretty enjoyable.  I also have to admit that I was disappointed.  Although most big summer movie blockbusters don't always have exactly a lot of good acting or plot, and the first movie didn't exactly have the best acting either, at least the first matrix wasn't corny. Normally though, no matter how bad of acting or how corny the plot may be, with a summer blockbuster you can fall back to the action.  But I was disappointed in that too.  One of the coolest fight scenes you can obviously see that Neo is actually computerized.  And almost all off the other scenes almost seem to be imitating all the movies that ripped off the matrix. The action scenes no longer seem like Matrix authentic, it seems that they have sold out on their own originality.  Although the movie was watchable, even enjoyable, it did not leave me wishing to go see the next installment. Instead, it left me wishing that I hadn't seen this installment.  It has ruined the matrix experience for me.  I know longer can look at the Matrix and think, wow.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good story.  Decent Acting.  Great Effects.  Killer Ending.,"So the summer of sequels begins.  Some are legitimate extensions of an original story.  Some are just cheap copies of the first, a pathetic attempt by the Big Movie to rake in the dough.  The Matrix: Reloaded definitely falls in the first category.Firstly, if you haven't seen the first film, don't go see this one until you've rented first.  You will be lost, confused and probably emotionally scarred.  It doesn't pick up right where we left off, but it assumes you already know the main characters.  We have Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and the new bad guy you love to hate, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).  We are introduced to a number of new characters, too many to mention, who help us dig deeper into the Matrix world. We are taken into the Matrix, onto various ships, including the Nebuchadnezzer, and into the real world.   Again, Neo, the Messiah of the film (or as another character refers to him as ""The Anomaly"") is the main focus.  He's supposed to save the humans from the machines.  Things build from there, with some interesting twists and turns.This movie is very heady.  Matrix I had a lot of metaphors, analogies, and references to religion and philosophy - including Christianity.  This means Matrix II has all the more.  Here you get caught in extended philosophical discussions between characters.  If you're not paying attention, it will overwhelm you.  These discussions, though may seem slow, are essential to the story.  Unlike most movies, this one does have a point and the Warchowski are going to make sure you get the whole picture.  There is some references to Christianity, eastern mysticism, Buddhism, and a hodgepodge of philosophy.  It will probably take more than one viewing to absorb it all and figure out what belief is part of which system.Now this film is heady, but don't worry, Hollywood didn't leave out the eye candy.  If you pay attention, you'll notice everyone in Zion (yes, we get to see Zion) is good looking and at the right weight.  Very realistic. (Please note sarcasm)Once again the brothers are pushing the envelope with special effects. Don't worry.  They succeed.  The Burly Brawl was intense.  If you're concerned about spending money on this film, the entire freeway scene is worth the price of admission alone.  Everything is well choreographed and very intense.  You get engulfed.  You're immersed.  You have to see what will happen next.  And, there is one part of the Freeway Scene that just nails what your thinking - hint:  it's with Link.Acting is on par with other quality films.  I still find Keanu a little plastic.  I think he's trying to be stoic.  But he does a decent job.  He is Neo.  There can be no other.  Everyone seemed to gel.  No one seemed disconnected from another.  Everyone was working together.The story does get a little slow with all the dialogue, but its OK.  The story still moves, doesn't get to the point of dragging.  I did realize this is a kind of Terminator meets Tron meets your-college-philosophy-prof movie. An interesting mix.Over all this is a good film.  It's enjoyable.  It has a cliff-hanger ending.  It's a good thing we only have to wait six months for Matrix III. Another three years would be too long of a wait.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One word: Awesome,"Oh boy, was this worth the 8 bucks I paid. The story is very interesting, the fight scenes are.....oh man, can't explain them, and the special effects are wonderful. Yes, there was some humor, but they were like, you know, little things. the only thing I did not like about this movie was the ending. Ended abruptly, and kind of p***ed me off. But, I'll be seeing The Matrix: Revolutions in September any ways.10/10. Excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Matrix Reloaded,"" fails to make necessary emotional connection to its jaw-dropping visual effects, resulting in a dramatically flat 'middle' trilogy.","The first Matrix was technically brilliant as well as narratively sound.  In this 2nd installment, ""Matrix Reloaded,"" fails to make necessary emotional connection to its jaw-dropping visual effects, resulting in a dramatically flat 'middle' trilogy.  In the first, the cool action sequences served to introduce our characters as super beings, once in the Matrix.  In this one, while the action sequences are still pretty cool, now feel long and pointless.  Combine this with the film's ambitious effort to bring Greek mythology, Christianity, Buddhism, Marxism and nihilism together in a cryptic way as not to reveal too much in light of the next, conclusive install resulted in an even film.  The success of ""Matrix Reloaded"" should be attributed more to its brilliant marketing strategy than the film itself, which grossed some $160 million opening week worldwide.  This one rates 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Kalkon! (Turkey!),"This movie was really bad. The story behind seemed fascinating, but they messed it up quite badly by overdoing everything. I sometimes had to close my eyes in embarrassment for the actors. People in the theater also laughed at the overdone scenes that were very very long. The key maker part of the story was so incredibly pathetic. It somehow reminded me of some of Spielberg's worst movies from the 80's (Indiana Jones 2). Anyway, If you like computer games, go see it. Some of the effects are cool but some are rotten (like the ghosts). If you're 14  years old this movie will probably make you thrilled.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Interesting but flawed,"The Matrix revolutionized the action genre with its amazing storytelling and incredible action sequences. The Matrix: Reloaded continues the legacy of incredible action sequences; however, the storytelling has suffered over these years. In the previous film, action complimented the ideas the plot needed explained; the notion of matrix reality vs. actual reality was enforced greatly thanks to fights that culminated in short lines (""You think that's air your breathing?""). Reloaded faces the challenge of developing new ideas about the matrix as well as the reality outside it. Unfortunately, explanations come and come and come...Long conversations and speeches seem independent of the action in the film, and, as a result, the film has an odd pacing which contrasts greatly from the constant adrenaline rush of the first. I felt I needed a flowchart to fully grasp the characters and their places in this story. The confusing and tedious storytelling aside, the plot continues to be intriguing and I anticipate the third installment. The following of the first will guarantee this saga success, despite some problems.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but didn't blow me away","Just some specific points....Too much....WAAAYYY too much exposition.  Sometimes it did sound like they were repeating themselves and I actually found myself glazing over and becoming impatient, simply becase I thought I'd heard it all before.Agent Smith as always was a pleasure.  I missed him when he wasn't there.The action was good, but I didn't really discover anything new or groundbreaking, except for maybe the freeway scene, which was very exhilerating.  But I just think back to when I experienced ""bullet time"" for the first time in the original, I was just blown away and left speechless. Nothing really did that for me in this one.  Not that I didn't enjoy the action, though.Some people didn't like the cliffhanger ending and wanted some closure. I must ask, why?  The third one is coming out in six months.  Relax. You'll have closure then.  The cliffhanger is to build excitement and more anticipation for the third one.So I enjoyed it, but I wasn't left speechless as I was with the original. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Phew!  I think I sat too close! -  6 of 10,"There is a lot going on in this film.  That's one of it's problems.  Much too much to follow and it only got worse.  Too many characters with too many agendas.  The dialogue was too pedestrian in parts and too complex in others.  Some performances were a bit stiff.  With that said, there are some good points:  Neo is back with the core cast.  There are some great fight scenes, fantastic special effects, funny moments, and did I mention the fantastic special effects?  Seeing it on the big screen is a must in my opinion, but you won't be _completely_ in awe of this film.

Average,"An ok sequel that needed either to be a full on action extravaganza or deep with plot to match or even surpass its predecessor.  Unfortunately, out of 130mins running time you get around 30 mins of action backed up by a really weak plot (i.e. find key to open door) saturated in nonsensical technobable.The movie features 2 main action sequences which were great but the computer graphics were as obvious as they were in Spider-man.  But what is annoying as that all of the great action was inside the known matrix which kind of left me thinking who cares.  I mean, so what if Neo can fly really fast or fight off 100 agent Smiths.  Its all a virtual reality where they keep telling you that you can do anything.The biggest let down had to be the attempted plot twist when Neo meets Colonel Sanders in the central computer mainframe.  They should have spent a LOT more time getting to the room instead of listening to the Architect ramble on.  The movie was starting to pick up some decent momentum only to be struck down with more dialogue.Who cares, who cares, who cares.Overall an average movie 6/10 that",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good,"I thought The Matrix Reloaded was good, but for some reason it did not meet my expectations.  It had many more fight scenes and more awesome slow motion scenes than the first.  But in the first Matrix even without all the action sequences that Reloaded has, the storyline was better and I was more taken in with it.  Reloaded has a lot of surprises and it definitley holds your attention until the end.  Neo and Trinity seemed to have more scenes and more fighting in this film.  I give Reloaded a 7 out of 10.  Although it was still a great film it was just did not pull me in like the original. Of course there is always Part 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first one.,"Although Keanu is wooden (its come to be expected). This is a very well written second movie. It suffers the typical 2nd part syndrome of leaving you hanging.

A marketing trick,"The Matrix Reloaded. As everyone I really looked forward to the sequence to the Matrix. Despite bad reviews I went and see the film with the idea to just enjoy the best action scenes money can buy, and I did.The Matrix Reloaded didn't give the rush of excitement as the first one did. Why? The inbetween scenes where a little bid too long and the editing was unlucky. It is both a sequel and a lead-in towards the Matrix Revolutions. Movie rules would say that can't be good, and it isn't. The newness which was there in the first, wasn't there in the second. Then why can the most expensive movie up to now not be good. My thought is :marketing. The longest and most expensive trailer ever. For where there is good there has to be bad. They make the second movie in the trilogy likeable but not good, so the third one is at least going to be better than the second. They know they are not going to be able to repeat the level of the first one because it was the newness which made the Matrix good. All the money in the world can't bring that. This is their solution. The producer's solution to just make more money. In Holland we call it milking the cow until its empty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great Expectations,"First of all, I should state that I'm a big Matrix fan (like most of the reviewers here, I suppose) so I may be a little prejudiced for that matter.Truth is that ""Matrix Reloaded"" didn't come up to my expectations. I believe that all this ""hype"" that preceded its release, raise my expectations too high. I'm not saying that ""Matrix Reloaded"" is a bad, or even an average, movie. No. Absolutely not, definately not. I enjoyed it very much. It just that, IMHO, it can't compete to the original. Sure, the action scenes and visual effects are more complicated and more breathtaking than in the original movie, but these were only a part of the original's success. (Gaeta's work in visual cinematography and bullet-time worth many oscars, that's for sure.) I got the feeling that most actions scenes were there because the audience expected them to be, and not because the plot ""demanded"" them in order to evolve - a tottaly different approach from the original ""Matrix"", where every action scene had its purpose. The thought of Wachowski Bros saying ""the story in this chapter goes too slow, let's put an action scene here and here"" crossed my mind several times. So is the story the problem? No. There were many interesting answers and even more interesting (new) questions. The plot by itself evolves nicely. In my opinion, the problem lies in the fact that ""Matrix Reloaded"" action scenes and plot don't mix as they should. I give it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Pros & Cons,"PROS* Much improved and extended fighting sequences. When I say 'extended', I mean to the point where they almost get saturated. You think they'll go on forever, but at the same, never for a single second do they get dull nor repetitive. The best fight sequence would be the one where Neo is ass-kicking a seemingly never-ending supply of Agent Smiths.* Awesome special and visual effects. The special effects alone are worth your ticket admission. You could be five or five hundred years old and still be in awe at the amount and quality of the special effects they've included here. The much-lawded highway car-chase sequence is no doubt the tip of the iceberg here. The other special effects are equally as impressive.* Neo's flying scenes (the black Superman!). Come to think of it, Keanu Reeves made a better impression on me here. I disliked him in the first Matrix, but I must admit that he looks waaay too cool in these flying sequences.* Brilliant, involving sound effects. Although it's perhaps irrelevant to comment on the sound effects about any recent movie, the ones in this particular film were worth enough to make me applaud them. For some reason, everything seemed much louder and more realistic. Then again, perhaps it was just the cinema. The song played over the final credits was so loud, I had to leave the session.* The inclusion of more off-beat humour. In the first film, it was Agent Smith who was the unlikely character of providing most of the off-beat humour. This sequel contains more wisecracks from more characters, Agent Smith himself not withstanding. There were times when the entire audience cracked-up, specially at the compliments Agent Smith gives himself...* Some questions from the first film are dealt with here... although not exactly answered. There are obscure explanations here and there, but it would take repeated viewings to pick-up on them.* The feeling that you need to watch this film about 300 times to understand just what the hell is going on (I love those mind-benders!). The scene where Neo is given some insight information from Colonel Sanders made me wish I studied Advanced Computer Studies back at school so I could know what he was on about.CONS* The introduction of too many, seemingly unecessary characters. The beauty of the first film was that it seemed the entire world revolved around Morpheus and his team of rebels. Now it seems the opposite has happened, effectively eliminating that 'warm/fuzzy' feeling. Then again, we must wait for Revolutions until we make any sort of remarks on just how 'unnecessary' they are.* Some extemely cheesy dialogue, especially in the Morpheus-giving-motivating-speeches department. We all know Morpheus looks awesome sitting in that red chair, but it gets a little bothersome when he's still sitting in it, talking about fate and danger's lurking outside.* The more dance-oriented soundtrack felt waaaay out of place here. The Zion scene made me cringe. Gone too was the beautiful score with those 'goosebump' qualities the first film had.* Generally, some scenes felt like they were supposed to included in the Deleted Scenes feature of the DVD (the movie could've easily been edited down to an average running time of 90 or whatever minutes).* The unmistakable feel that the Wachowski Brothers have somehow jumped on the action-film bandwagon. The first film contained a logical balance of action and mind-bending concepts. Although this second film contains both, it seems they weren't really blended efficiently enough.* The obvious influence of other recent blockbuster films that's been incorporated here: Attack of the Clones, Minority Report, The Lord of the Rings, Blade - they're all in there somewhere. The special thing about the first fim was the fact that it was in a league of it's own. Another sign the Wachwoskis are probably jumping on the bandwagon...* A rather erratic screenplay. Sometimes you find yourself going on a roller-coaster ride when trying to keep up with the storyline, not always to positive effect. The plot is highly inconsistent, always throwing something out at the most unorthordox moments. Ultimately, the over-hyped cliffhanger isn't as compelling as promised. Ironically enough, I thought the movie would've ended at another point just prior to the ending we were given (where Neo is about to 'enter'). On the other hand, it is unfair to dismiss the script for anything until we see Revolutions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
a B film,"It's a B movie.

A shallow movie for a gullible audience,"This may be the worst big-budget sci-fi movie I have ever seen. Ever. Worse than I, Robot, worse than Lost In Space. Yes, it's that bad. Just try to endure the ""Cave Rave"" scene through its entirety and you'll see what I mean.When I first saw the original Matrix, I wondered how the Wachowski brothers could top themselves with the second movie in the series. Well, they didn't. It's like they decided to skip #2 and go directly to #3 when it came to upping the ante. This movie sucks. It sucks real bad, and I'm disappointed that I wasted two hours of my life watching this dreck.For starters, the dialogue is horrible. It seems that the directors chose to mimic the original Star Trek t.v. show for cheesy speeches and boring conversations between characters. I don't think there is one line of redeemable dialogue in this flick; it makes all the actors sound like they didn't pass the fifth grade.The special effects, while passable in some places, are simply horrible in others. The fight scene between Neo and the dozens of Agent Smiths looks like it was copied out of a cutscene from some video game made in 1998. And the exploding trucks after the chase scene looked just as bad. CGI technology has gotten to the point where these kinds of goofs are inexcusable. Heck, Jurassic Park looks better.The action in the first Matrix was well-paced, while in Reloaded it seems like the directors wanted to showcase all the money they received from the studio by filling every action scene with as much CGI and exploding debris as possible. The chase scene on the freeway should have been fun and exciting, but it turned boring after about three minutes. Ditto for the Merovingian mansion fight.I've heard many people say that Reloaded is the one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made, and I am at a loss as to how they were fooled into believing this. Maybe it's the fact that Reloaded (and the rest of the series, for that matter) disguises its humble action/adventure origins in a cloak of grade school quasi-philosophy. Seriously, if you think that the Matrix series has some kind of deep, in-depth psychological meaning, then you need to go back to college and take some real philosophy courses. I do understand the point that the Wachowski bros. are trying to get across, but don't insult my intelligence by telling me that the Matrix is a serious discussion in subjective reality. It's not even close.The only good part about this movie is Monica Belucci and her cleavage. It's too bad such a great actress got stuck in some of the worst scenes.Calling this movie a science fiction classic belittles real classics such as Metropolis, Soylent Green, Blade Runner, and Akira. You're just comparing apples to oranges.On a side note, I've only seen this movie on the DVD that came with the Matrix collector's edition (the one with the resin bust of Neo). I have to say the sound quality on this disc is horrible. All of the quieter parts are so muffled I have to turn up the volume just to hear any dialogue, only to have my eardrums ruptured once the music or explosions kick in. Strangely enough, this is only a problem on this particular disc; it doesn't happen with the other discs in the collection. Anybody else have this issue?",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
