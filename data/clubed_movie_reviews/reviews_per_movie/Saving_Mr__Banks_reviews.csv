"Truth, not all the truth, yet nothing but the truth, Walt Disney's Saving Mr. Banks is a Best Picture Hopeful with all the good credentials","Walt Disney Pictures rarely aims for the Best Picture crown, being more a company focused on profits and sustaining its wildly popular brand. To make you haters hate more: they've earned $4 billion this year already and this includes the $200 million loss of Lone Ranger). They usually only distribute the movies that have a shot at Academy Awards immortality, with The Help (A Dreamworks film) being the latest example of a nominee and No Country For Old Men being their latest example of a winner.But with Saving Mr. Banks, Disney is going the whole nine yards. With a stellar cast, seemingly endless budget (Giving John Lee Hancock a much-less stressful job in directing), high production value, and heavy dosage of drama that hides beneath the happier movie trailers, this film stands as one of the better dramas of the year and a sure-fire Oscar-contender. Touching upon the tissue-happy themes of forgiveness, family, and seeking happiness in a miserable world, prepare for waterworks throughout the two hours.What makes this movie work more than anything else is the screenplay that didn't start in the studios of Disney, allowing for a more accurate portrayal of the true story behind the making of the masterpiece Mary Poppins----even if the entire world knows that with the backing of Disney some details will be left out. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith weaved out an engaging story full of crisp dialogue and skillfully avoids becoming too overblown or too overdramatic. And whenever the movie gets close to being all-out depressing, we get treated to humorous moments here and there to keep the audience in check.In a movie about artists that are addicted to their craft, you need actors that work with the same type of fervor. Emma Thompson despite not getting top billing gets the most screen time, gets the toughest job, and delivers the ultimate performance. She becomes very dislikable and yet sympathetic at the same time, and it is impossible to see anyone other than Thompson deliver this type of impact. Tom Hanks in an Oscar-baiting year does a superb job portraying the icon planet Earth knows and loves as he gives Walt Disney a humanized performance that separates the flawed man from the myth the Disney Company has feverishly worked to this day to protect. The rest of the cast does not disappoint, and we even see Colin Farrell potentially impress some Academy voters as the loving yet extremely defective father figure.Disney's protection of its brand is the sole reason why Saving Mr. Banks could never ever ever ever ever ever be produced or made by anybody else. But luckily for all viewers, Disney doesn't pull back many punches in delivering the story behind the complex and conflicted making of Mary Poppins. It will be deep in the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards but ultimately indeed deserves the praise—even if you won't see all the details behind the true story on screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprising in the Most Delightful Way,"i attended a pre-screening of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" last night in Dallas. while i had been looking forward to the film, i had my reservations. after all, Johnny Hancock (director) was behind ""The Blind Side,"" which i found much too schmaltzy and watered-down for my taste. also, this was a movie about Walt Disney being produced by his company - so how honest would it be about the story behind the making of the masterpiece ""Mary Poppins""? would it settle for predictable mellow-drama (yes, i meant to spell it that way) and glorify dear Uncle Walt as perfect and demonize Mrs. Travers as a cold, soulless spoilsport? thankfully, the answer to that is a resounding ""no.""while it surely takes artistic license with history, the film as a whole is surprisingly great. there's not a weak moment throughout, not a second where i wasn't entertained and wanting to find out what would come next. this film (rated PG-13) surprises with many of the thematic issues it tackles, including alcoholism, loss - and we even get a brief glimpse of a smoking Mr. Disney (hey, it was the 60s).Emma Thompson has always been a strong performer though her screen time has waned over the last decade and a half, but here she gives a performance that is worthy of awards attention. As Mrs. P.L. Travers, she is an author as protective as her life's work as a mother is for a child and is dealing with demons nearly forgotten. Mr. Hanks too carries his own playing the iconic and visionary Disney at the top of his game, trying to honor a promise to his daughters while also add to his impressive repertoire of cinematic achievements.this is not really a film to take your Poppins-loving tykes to. this is the Disney film for mom and dad to enjoy. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" will probably be remembered as one of the best films of 2013, and for good reason.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A comedy-drama with a spoonful of sugar,"From the studio that brought you Mary Poppins, Disney has released a biopic about the author of the original novels, P.L Travers. Saving Mr. Banks is the story of her battles with Walt Disney, who wants the rights to the film adaptation, in a dramatic comedy that is both witty and sentimental.Mrs. Pamela P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has been hounded by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and the Disney Corporation for 20 years for the film rights to her book and she has refused constantly. But by 1961, she has run out of money and agrees to go to Los Angeles for two weeks to work with the writing team to see if a deal can be struck. Her conditions are that the film cannot be animated, there are no songs and she has final script approval. Travers quickly clashes with creative team and Walt himself, a man who promised his daughters he would adapt the book.As this is going on Travers reflects on her childhood in rural Australia, with her father (Colin Farrell), a loving man who feeds his daughter's imagination, but an alcoholic with probable depression and how these events influenced her writing.Saving Mr. Banks is a film armed with excellent screenplay and a top notch cast. As well as the likes of Thompson, Hanks and Farrell, Saving Mr. Banks also features Bradley Whittaker, Jason Schwartzman, Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak and Ruth Wilson. They all offer strong performances and have given us very well defined characters. Thompson dominates as Travers, a no nonsense woman with poor social skills and a British Bulldog stubbornness/determination and injects a deadpan humour with the witty lines she was given. Thompson also brings out the emotion, the serious aspects of the character, as the shadows of her past still linger over her.One of the big themes of the film is the writing process, both the individual, personal aspect and the collaborative effect of a film adaptation. Saving Mr. Banks shows that many writers use they personal experience and life and become a part of the author. It is hard for writers to let go and particularly for Travers, as she has so much invested in Mary Poppins, so much of herself in it. Her books allowed her to have some wish fulfilment.The screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, director John Lee Hancock and editor Mark Livoisi worked brilliant to blending the story of Travers butting heads with Disney's creative team and her backstory about her childhood influencing her writing. There are plenty of transitions, allowing Hancock to have some fancy pans. One particular noticeable sequence is when the creative team performs one of the songs and Travers has a flashback. The film slowly reveals how Travers childhood and her father became a part of her writing, used in the books and become a part of the themes of her books and philosophies. This is particularly the case with her parents and their inabilities to cope, both Travers' father's alcoholism and mother's inability to cope with the stress, leading to her theme of responsibility. For a film that is about the writing process, Saving Mr. Banks never really shows about the writing process that Travers goes through, but explores the writing process of adapting a work, from one medium to another.The final theme and a big part of the comedy comes from the clashes of cultures and personalities. Travers is a brash personality with formal, conservative approach and lives a modest lifestyle in London and a rustic life in Australia. This in comparison to the overtly friendly American and their glamour and excess, from the fashion to the food, particularly sweet treats and the hard sell from Disney in Travers' hotel room.Saving Mr. Banks has a excellent screenplay, solid direction and balances the comedy dramatic portions extremely well. The film makes sure there is plenty of sentiment, particularly with the score by Thomas Newman. It is a safe film, but still a pleasing experience. It is perfect if you are a fan of Mary Poppins and you will have the songs stuck in your head.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Saving Mr. Banks is a terrific, adult movie that will change the way you view Mary Poppins forever.","This movie is much more than and definitely deeper than one would suspect from the 'syrupy' trailers most people have seen. The understory, gradually revealing the early life of P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and depicting how the people in her dysfunctional family led her to write Mary Poppins, is the true core of this movie. I will never see Mary Poppins in quite the same way. All of the acting is superior, and the score is excellent. This is not the shallow, childlike movie that many will expect. I would not recommend it for children 11 and under, depending on the child. Otherwise, I highly recommend this movie, even if you are not a big fan of the original Mary Poppins film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great tribute to Walt,"Saving Mr Banks tells the story of Walt Disney's battle to get the rights to make Mary Poppins into a movie. I wasn't expecting to like this but was completely blown away.It is beautifully put together, is hilarious in parts and very touching and emotional at other stages, but is not overly sappy or cheesy.There are some outstanding performances here. Emma Thompson plays Mrs Travers beautifully - a cantankerous and stubborn lady, yet you can't dislike her. Tom Hanks does a good job of playing Walt Disney - a tough role for anyone but he seems to suit it, so long as you can get past the terrible fake southern accent which is worse than Dick Van Dyke's attempts at an English accent in Mary Poppins.However the stand-out performance is, surprisingly, delivered by Colin Farrell as Mrs Travers' father. He brings amazing range and emotion to a character that is simultaneously a loving, sweet father and a man caged in by life and personal demons.Go see it for yourself when it comes out at the end of November. I'm looking forward to watching it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
No need for sugar - this goes down just fine,"Once upon a time (seeing as though that's how all fairy tales seem to  start), there lived a boy from Missouri, called Walt Disney. This boy  had a piece of paper with a mere sketch of a mouse upon it. Who ever  would have thought that this was to be the start of such a great  legacy?  In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"",  to his California studios to discuss the possibility of acquiring the  rights to her book - a discussion that Mr. Disney had initially sparked  twenty years prior. For those two decades, the proud author refused to  depart with her precious work in fear of Hollywood's mutilation of it  and repeatedly told Mr. Persistent to go 'fly a kite up to the highest  heights'. However, when sales of her book begin to dwindle and with a  rough economic climate ahead, Travers reluctantly agreed to travel  across the Atlantic to hear what the impresario had to say. This untold  backstory of how Travers' classic work of literature made it to the big  screen provides the substance for John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks.   Here, we have an American icon that plays an American icon. Two-time  Academy Award winner Tom Hanks delivers extraordinary sense of  character as he renders Mr. Walt Disney with expert attention to  detail. ""There's a lot of voice work, the way he walks, the body  positions, the way he holds his hands, the way he touches his  moustache. How he phrases things and lets sentences roll off the end"",  Hancock remarks - and so Tom Hanks becomes the public face for Walt  Disney and we learn of the man behind the mask (with two fluffy ears).  Our central protagonist is Mrs. P. L Travers, played by Emma Thompson  (who similarly boasts two Academy Awards). ""She was a wonderful case  study, requiring so many different shades. She was just so complex.  She's one of the most complicated people I've ever encountered"", says  the British actress. Her rendition of a tetchy and cantankerous author  who's plagued by the memories of her past is brilliantly executed.   As narrative flashbacks delve into Mrs. Travers' childhood, we soon  realise the true depth of her literary creation, Mary Poppins. Mr.  Banks explores the bond between a young Travers (then Helen) and her  drunkard father, Travers Goff (exceptionally played by Colin Farrell).  Like a puzzle, the story is pieced together, bit by bit and we learn  that her deep-seated adoration for her father is what lies at the heart  of her magical masterpiece.   Demonstrating that her novel holds such personal significance, Travers  continues to exercises a stubborn reluctance to hand the rights to her  book over to what she considers to be a dollar-printing machine. The  straight-talking novelist is repulsed by Disney's empire and this is  only intensified when the entertainment wizard showers her in all kinds  of ridiculous merchandise. As Walt Disney haplessly pursues Travers,  unsettling the adamant writer with his vision of the film, it seems  that he will never obtain the rights to make the movie of Mary Poppins.  We are, of course, watching this in hindsight and the knowledge that  the book was made into a successful film adds a magical quality to the  experience and permits laughter as it plays on dramatic irony; and  there are some real gems for the Disney die-hards.  Walt Disney made a promise to his daughter to make the movie of Mary  Poppins. As the likelihood of fulfilling this promise fades into the  distance, the entertainment-guru reaches into his own childhood and  discovers a new, more personal connection to the emotionally troubled  Travers. In order to break away from a life dictated by her past,  Travers agrees to sign the waiver so that one the most lovable films in  cinematic history can be made.  This biographical dramedy stands as a poetic tale of hope, which  ultimately gives testament to the might of the mouse house and conveys  the magical idea that everybody has a story to tell. Making memories is  what Disney is all about and for its 125-minute runtime, we re-visit  old memories and we also create new ones. With all the conventions of a  family film (after all, this is Disney), Saving Mr. Banks is  supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! (Couldn't resist).",,Anonymous,Biography
"""Now I Got Ya!!""","As with 'The Day of the Jackal', anyone with a basic knowledge of history will know how this ends; just as anyone familiar with the film that eventually emerged from this 1961 meeting of an irresistible force and an immovable object will know both the outcome and who won the creative battles.We actually learn early on when she laments that ""I want to keep my house"" that Disney had Travers over a barrel; while the fact that there was never a sequel to 'Mary Poppins' tells us all we need to know about what she actually thought of the film that emerged!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good movie, too bad it's a fib.","The truth, a little of the truth, so far from the truth. I read the original novels, and they are indeed pretty far from the Disney Treatment (capitals are in order) they got; yet, I really love the movie (Mary Poppins, that is), but I can also see why Mrs. Travers loathed it. And I read about the real encounter between Walt Disney (a way more unpleasant person than pictured here) and Mrs. Travers, and once again, this is its Disney Treatment. Once again, I liked the movie, a lot; yet once again I see where someone could loathe it. The Disney Treatment is responsible of the popularization of many famous or obscure tales (as an Italian, I'm thinking of Pinocchio); and, at the very same time, it is responsible for their massacre in an orgy of sugary coating. That Pamela Travers had to suffer this twice, is way too cruel. Summing it up: 9 to the movie per se, 5 to the Disney Treatment of reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, funny & eye-moisteningly wonderful.","Despite watching the trailer and knowing the broad story, Saving Mr.  Banks still managed to surprise me. It's a beautiful, tender film that  manages to be sad without being mawkish, funny without detracting from  the emotion and with far greater depth than expected.  Unfolding the story of Walt Disney's attempt to persuade P.L. Travers  to sell him the rights to her beloved Mary Poppins, Saving Mr. Banks is  a delightful film that is deceptively emotional and flows smoothly  enough to be entirely engaging.  Travers (Emma Thompson) thwarts Disney's (Tom Hanks) attempts to secure  the rights for twenty years until a flatlining bank balance and a  mildly panicking agent persuade her to at least consider Disney's  proposition or lose her home with certainty. Whisking her to Hollywood  and bombarding her with all things Disney, the master of the House of  Mouse spares no expense or effort to woo Mrs Travers and persuade her  to allow him to keep his promise to his daughters to film the books  they loved so much. But nothing prepares him for the stubborn, exacting  curmudgeon who challenges him at every twist and turn and demands and  demeans in equal measures.  After the recent Captain Phillips, in which Hanks was astounding, there  is a very good chance that he may join an exclusive group (of twelve so  far, including co-star Emma Thompson) of actors to be nominated for two  Oscars in the same year. Even more rarely, he'll deserve both  nominations! Quite simply, it is impossible to imagine another actor in  the role of Uncle Walt. He oozes charisma and his smile is used for so  much more than merely expressing happiness. There is a genuine warmth  to Hanks' performance and this is one of those rare occasions where I  temporarily forgot I was watching him. He's been a very good actor for  many, many years, but this year I've had to reassess my opinion of him  and state that he has transcended his deserved 'movie stardom' to  become a very fine actor indeed.  Unsurprisingly (and most welcome), Hanks is matched every single step  of the way by Thompson. There is a magical thawing in her Travers in  the course of Saving Mr. Banks where she pokes her head out of her  hard, crispy chrysalis and threatens to become a warm(ish), witty  woman. Early on in the film, it is difficult to like Travers as her  demands become more extreme, her retorts more cutting and her demeanour  downright unpleasant, but Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay  weaves the story of the film rights with the tale of Travers' troubled  childhood to give reason for her crustiness and context to her literary  creation. It is this aspect of Saving Mr. Banks that surprises most and  completes the film.  Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) approaches each side of his  female protagonist's life very differently and her buried history is  shot in muted, dusty colours with a jagged Western romanticism that  tempers the bleak happenings that shaped the girl into the woman. Colin  Farrell is on his best form for years as Travers Goff, the drunk father  who lives in his own fantastic world of imagination and adventure to  escape the harsh reality of the real world. He is a man who fails  consistently and knows it, but loves his daughter unequivocally. As  with Hanks and Thompson, the chemistry between Farrell and Annie Rose  Buckley (playing Ginty, the young Travers) is effortlessly beautiful.  The casting is just one of the joys of Saving Mr. Banks, with Paul  Giamatti chief amongst the supporting actors as Travers' driver, Ralph,  a doleful puppy in human form that responds to every brush-off and  verbal slap with another smile and encouraging word. In the studio  Bradley Whitford as screenwriter Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason  Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers bring more gentle humour as  Travers' desperate, unwilling adversaries. There's no lazy leaning  towards slapstick or cheap shots, rather Hancock steers their scenes  gently allowing both the frostiness and the occasional sprinkles of  sunlight to sparkle with sincerity.  There are hints of Travers' adult life beyond her books but, though  comments remain, it feels as though the backstory was excised for the  final cut and so I came away from the film feeling that something was  missing. The final act is perhaps a little too tidy; it glides towards  a resolution too smoothly and nothing is made of the rumoured aftermath  of the deal, but these are minor niggles in a beautiful film that  carries one along and moistens the eyes occasionally.  Saving Mr. Banks is an unqualified success. It is a joy to watch and  leaves one hoping that Mary Poppins earns yet another screening in this  year's Christmas TV schedule.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"No, Mr Disney","Emma Thompson is great fun to watch, always. Here, she plays Mrs Travers the one who dared to say no to Walt Disney. The movie, made by the Disney studios, would have us believe that Walt Disney was, well...Tom Hanks. No. Impossible, incredible, almost laughable but thanks to the power of the stars one can sit through it, thoroughly entertained by this work of fiction. The imperious character played by Emma Thompson as a theatrical rather than a cinematic experience is nonetheless engaging and moving. The flashbacks were, if you permit the impudence, a total miscalculation. They come back with annoying regularity and instead of adding, they detract from the central story. My favorite parts were the meeting between Mrs Travers and Saint Walt Disney in London and Mrs Travers inviting herself and sitting at the premiere of Mary Poppins.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of my favorites of the year,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is easily one of the best movies to come out this year. It tells the tale behind the making of Disney's beloved classic ""Mary Poppins,"" but it is so much more than just a typical 'making of a movie' movie. While many of these types of films aren't as good as the movie they are about, this one is different. It feels like a companion piece to the beloved classic. It allows us to appreciate the trials and tribulations Disney had to go through to make his magnum opus. However, it is also more about P.L. Traverse and why she loves her character so much and why Mary Poppins holds such a special place in her heart.Director John Lee Hancock does a great job of making this film something truly special. He balances witty humor with emotional depth, but does so without being too sappy or melodramatic. The film is also well written by being more personal than just being a movie about making a movie. The themes of letting and moving on are handled well and really becomes relatable to anyone watching.The performances are top-notch. Tom Hanks makes a pretty good Disney and he isn't sugar coated either. The real standouts are Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell. They give strong dimensional performances that makes us truly care and sympathies with the characters.Overall ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a truly great and beautifully told film. Its individual parts may not be the years best, but as a complete film it is the whole package. It's a movie that exemplifies why we go to the movies and what Disney stands for as an entertainment corporation. It is a movie that is equal parts heartfelt, witty, charming, entertaining, and emotionally satisfying. I give it 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emma Thompson radiates in John Lee Hancock's 'Saving Mr. Banks',"Beautifully ambitious and eagerly constructed, the success of Walt Disney Studios' homage to its heritage is anchored magnificently by the crowning work of Emma Thompson's career. John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks is a tenderly affectionate tale featuring one of the year's finest ensembles. Following a classic three act structure, when the film begins, it undoubtedly lifts off and hooks you almost immediately. Held back by a few poor choices in the editing room, there's no denying the glamour, chemistry, and witchery that the film sets on you. Saving Mr. Banks is feverishly delightful.Written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, the film tells the story of P.L. Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins,"" who in the early 1960's met with Walt Disney and his creative team to decide whether to sign the rights of her beloved book to the magic studio. During the production, Travers reflects on her childhood and her relationship with her loving father, played by Colin Farrell, intertwining the magic of her beloved novel and the guilt of a troubled past.As an unbridled, even at times downright vicious P.L. Travers, Thompson hasn't pursued and thrived in a character of such complexities since James Ivory directed her to an Oscar in Howard's End over twenty years ago. Travers' mannerisms and moral guidelines are captured charmingly by the creative team. Thompson and director Hancock clearly worked closely together to nail the nuance of the central character's focus. She buries herself in the time, and that of designer Daniel Orlandi's stunning costume work, to be the perfect entity of a fruitful tale. Playing the young Travers, Annie Rose Buckley is cute as a button and has some real juicy moments to sink her teeth into. Unfortunately, some directorial choices hinder any substantial connection between her and the audience to muster any real attention.Marcel and Smith's script is pure gold. There is such a dynamic and balance of charming and witty comedy tied in with heart wrenching and polarizing drama. Their assembling of the movie era, capturing subtle inequities of the business, and painting a magical story, will likely stand as one of the screenplays of the year. There is a heavy yet almost invisible component of layered despondency that the two writers choose to include that make the film truly sing.Upon hearing the casting of Tom Hanks as the iconic Walt Disney, I have to admit my reservations were at an all-time high. Hanks, who has excelled in his career playing the everyday man, and floored the bulk of America with his performance in Captain Phillips this year, absolutely nails his role as the film executive tycoon. His choices of character beats, that don't put down the material nor distract the audience from the story being told, is spot on nearly every moment. He maneuvers his way with his charisma but allows the animosity to fester in the viewer. I was thoroughly impressed.Where the film missteps greatly is in the direction and options that John Lee Hancock chooses to execute throughout. ""Banks"" essentially tells two stories. One of the present time during the production of ""Mary Poppins"" and the other of P.L. Travers' childhood. Hancock chooses to tell these two stories simultaneously, awkwardly transitioning from one time period to the other, and ripping us away from the story we're desperately invested in. In many ways, his direction will be seen in the same reactionary split of Tom Hooper's Les Miserables. There will be some, likely many, that will have no problem with his bumbling alterations in certain scenes and there will be some, like myself, that sees that he's still has a long way to go. Not gunning him down as a complete disaster, he has about three instances where the potential and vision are clearly realized. Hancock knows how to tug at the heartstrings. When a scene works, he accomplishes it with the utmost confidence and brilliant demeanor. A tightly paced and pivotal scene involving the song ""A British Bank"" showcases Hancock's best varieties, and also that of co-star Colin Farrell.For my dollar, everything connects and rises during the creation of ""Let's Go and Fly a Kite."" The cast comes together and unifies in such a harmonious fashion and Hancock chooses to utilize all the supporting players including that of the wonderful Bradley Whitford, the witty BJ Novak, and in his best turn yet, Jason Schwartzman. Hancock operates these three men in an ingenious method. Paul Giamatti is a compassionate force, especially in his exchanges with Thompson while Ruth Wilson makes me absolutely adore the ground in which she walks.Besides the dynamite work of Thompson, I lived for the miraculous music of Academy Award nominated composer Thomas Newman. Brilliantly hinting at some of his other composed works, everything about the music in Saving Mr. Banks purely resonates because of Newman's continued abilities to insert his own personality into his work. You can't find another film musician this aware of his talents and continued drive to elevate his own material. It's the Oscar slam dunk we've been waiting for in Original Score.http://www.awardscircuit.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Short on charm,"Being a big Tom Hanks fan, I wanted to like this movie...I really did. I just found his portrayal of Walt Disney to be one dimensional. I can't for the life of me, figure where, or why, he came up with his sort-of-southern-gentleman kind of vocal inflection. Being old enough to have watched ""The Wonderful World of Disney"", his mannerisms seemed forced. Add to that, the jarring reversal of character by P.L. Travers and I found the movie to be rather bland, unfulfilling and overly long. Also, knowing how the REAL story actually turned out, I was interested in seeing how they would cobble a happy ending onto this version. As it turns out...not too well.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delightful,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an exquisite film. It draws you in with the delightful reality of Disney as well as the triumphantly stark reality (inasmuch as it is reality; I do lack her background) of Mrs. Travers. I purposely leave out parts of the film for the sake of the movie-goer, but let me say how delightful the songs are, the people are, the displays of emotion-- my part as well, as I nearly cried and fully laughed at certain points throughout. The film speaks to me and it feels complete in its currency-- tuppence, if you will-- in taking Mrs. Travers' story and embellishing it with the truth of the creators' (both Travers and Disney, for the part he has in the creation of the film) lives. The lives of the characters-- and I do mean most people seen on screen, in particular the driver and Mrs. Travers' mother-- are well-told and well-lived, and spark a certain comfort and warmth, even in the cold of their realities and harsher backstories. I believe the film has done its job beautifully, and I wouldn't change it for the world. Even the animated penguins, although for me there is still my deep and abiding love for their real counterparts.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Critics Miss the Point,"There have been complaints about this film on the basis of historically inaccuracies ranging from the dialogue between Disney and Mrs. Travers, the relationship between Mrs. Travers and the studio to the simple motif of Mrs. Travers dancing with the writers. This film is not an historical document, rather a story about an author, her book and a studio. The film portrays the Mary Poppins books as an attempt by Mrs. Travers to rescue a version of her father and give him a better story than life provided him, a point made touchingly by her bursting into tears in- front of the writing staff due to her perception that they had made Mr.Banks 'unspeakably awful'. The writers return the following day with a changed ending, one where father went kite flying with the kids and they were together as a family. Abstracted from the history of events, this film is a charming depiction of two people with difficult childhoods forming an uneasy friendship through a tortuous collaboration. In reality, Mrs. Travers never did let go of her father or her books and had a poor relationship with the family that survived her; what sense of hope or satisfaction would an audience derive from such an ending? I would like to think that this isn't weakness or evasion, but Disney's way of trying to give the relationship between itself and Mrs. Travers the parity and respect in film that it deserved to have in life.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It Can Be Feminist to Depict a Witch as a Witch,"""Savings Mr. Banks"" is worth seeing for Emma Thompson's peerless performance as ""Mary Poppins"" author PL Travers. That Thompson was not nominated for a best actor Academy Award is a crime. Thompson's performance is one of the most compelling and convincing performances I've ever seen.Thompson plays PL Travers as a witch, and I'm using the nice version of the word. You know what word I really mean. Thompson's Travers is thoroughly believable. This isn't a cartoon villainess. This isn't Cruella DaVille or Maleficent. This is a woman you could imagine having as a boss or a neighbor. You'd do everything you could to avoid her. She doesn't learn any lesson. She doesn't reveal that we are all warm and fuzzy if you just get close enough.Some have criticized ""Saving Mr. Banks"" for this reason. They say that it's sexist to depict a successful woman author as being a witch. Baloney. It would be sexist to depict her as warm and cuddly. Women can be unpleasant. I know plenty of women like Travers. It isn't liberated to insist that all women are nice. Plenty of women are not nice at all.I found Thompson's depiction of Travers to be so powerful that the rest of the film didn't measure up, for me. Part of the film takes place in 1961. Travers is in Hollywood, working with Disney studios on their film adaptation of her book ""Mary Poppins."" Part of the film is a series of flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. In the flashbacks, Colin Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic father. The flashbacks didn't work for me. They had the feel of an afterschool special. Everyone was so good looking, especially Colin Farrell, even while suffering the health effects of alcoholism. Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the author as a child, is cherubically beautiful. The scenes depicting the alcoholic father disappointing and humiliating his daughter, and breaking her heart, did not affect me at all. They felt paint-by-numbers – oh, this is the predictable scene where the little girl realizes her father is a loser.The 1961 scenes in Hollywood worked much better. Paul Giamatti is amazing in the small part of Travers' limo driver. He brings a wallop of humanity and poignancy to his role that really swept me off my feet. The two develop a real rapport, and they could have taken up much more of the film. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are also brilliant as Robert and Richard Sherman, who wrote the songs for Mary Poppins. In one scene, Travers objects to Robert Sherman's walking with a cane. The film doesn't mention this; I wish it had. Sherman was only 19 or 20 years old when he participated in the liberation of Dachau. He was shot during the war. That's why he walked with a cane.Tom Hanks as Walt Disney didn't really work for me. Walt Disney was a totemic figure from my childhood. I remember him, in his TV appearances, as rather godlike – avuncular and yet distant, impenetrable. While watching Emma Thompson as PL Travers, I got the sense that I was watching something like the real PL Travers – a real, complex, human being. While watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I got the sense that I was watching Tom Hanks play a sanitized version of Walt Disney. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was very brave in its depiction of Travers, but very vanilla in its depiction of Walt. Giamatti as the fictional limo driver had more depth and complexity.The movie is most valuable as a character piece. It tries to say some big things about how people live through sorrow, like Travers' childhood, and survive that sorrow by creating art about it, like ""Mary Poppins."" That big idea really didn't wash for me. I know it's possibly true, but that message just didn't grab me, so the movie was not a ten, but it's certainly worth viewing for Thompson's performance, for her interplay with Giamatti and the Sherman brothers as played by Schwartzman and Novak.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maybe The Best Movie I've Seen All Year,"As a child, one of my favorite movies was always ""Mary Poppins"". Being young, I obviously couldn't articulate exactly WHY I liked it so much (I'm sure the catchy music had a lot to do with it), but I wore a tract in the VCR with it, that is for sure. After seeing ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, I was astounding to realize perhaps part of the reason why ""Mary Poppins"" stands the test of time: because the message behind it is one born out of real-life issues.For a basic plot summary, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" focuses on P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the ""Mary Poppins"" children's novel. For 20 years, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been pursuing the rights to make the book into a movie, finally culminating in him flying Travers to Los Angeles to begin work on the project. When Travers wants full creative control and clashes monumentally with Disney's version of the film, it is revealed (via flashbacks) how personal the Poppins story truly is to Travers.The reason why this movie is so touching and genuine is because it works on two different levels:On one hand, it brings back incredible nostalgia for fans of Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Just hearing the iconic music again and seeing how key plot/character points came together is exciting.On the other hand, those (though probably few and far between) who haven't seen the movie will still be intrigued by the fascinating backstory of P.L. Travers. More specifically, the role her father (played by Colin Farrell) played in her life and how that relationship shaped her persona even into adulthood. Some fascinating human dynamics that prove out the old ""truth is stranger than fiction"" maxim.The hallmark of ""Saving Mr. Banks"", though, is its ability to have audiences laughing, crying, singing, and feeling all in the span of two hours. The complex characters, catchy tunes, and use of flashbacks prove a potent mixture of drama and fun. This is truly a film for the entire family.Until recently, ""Prisoners"" had been cemented atop my ""Best Movie of 2013"" list. ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, is just as good, if only in a completely different way. I'm sure I'll enjoy some more genre Hollywood fare this holiday season (""Hobbit 2"", ""Anchorman 2"", ""Grudge Match"", etc.), but I have a feeling that when all is said and done, this one will still be at the top of the heap.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Disney Propoganda,"Nothing notably compelling or new to be obtained from this, except an excellent performance by Colin Ferrell. I want to like this, but the more reading I've done into what actually occurred to get the rights for this film the more I don't like this film. It's Disney patting itself on the back (again) for working so sympathetically with the owner of an IP they're interested in and providing her with the emotionally healing she's always needed.It's really upsetting what the reality behind this story is. Mary Poppins the film is enjoyable, but I just wish Disney would stop lying about who they are to the world. Just be honest,",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
How the worlds favourite nanny came to the screen,"Well, there are not many people I know who don't like the film 'Mary Poppins'. So why not see how and where it all began by watching one of the most incredible films of last year, 'Saving Mr Banks'. Starring Tom Hanks as movie maker Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as writer P.L.Travers, author of the Mary Poppins books, this stunning movie tells of the meetings between Walt Disney and P.L.Travers and his determination to obtain the screen rights to her books to make the film we all know and love today. Tom Hanks is, of course, superb as Walt Disney but Emma Thompson gives, in my opinion, one of the best performances of her career as the stubborn author. The film is made by the Disney company so, although it is based on reality, it has been given the Disney sentimentality and sweetness that wasn't actually there in truth. The movie ends following the premier of Mary Poppins and sees P.L.Travers crying, the viewer is given the impression that it is because of her recalling her relationship with her father, but in truth the real P.L.Travers was seen crying at the premier but it was due to her actual hatred of the film, the musical numbers and mostly of the animation, of which she was steadfast should never be used. Keep watching the credits as the director has very cleverly included clips of the original tape recordings of the meetings and you can hear the real P.L.Travers making her feelings known. Given the differences between reality and the various fictionalised scenes this film is a definite 'must see' and I join the many critics who feel that it should have been given more accolades at the Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not the real story,"Walt Disney was nothing like the man Tom Hanks portrays in this movie.Disney was an American icon, whose studio and theme parks have played significant roles in American pop culture. However, Disney was an enigmatic man unlike anything shown in this movie. Disney was far from the beloved, grandfatherly executive Hanks plays on screen. In fact, Disney was known to be a difficult and sometimes unpleasant man who paid low wages and worked his animators to exhaustion. In short, life in the Disney creative offices was not the great big party depicted in Saving Mr. Banks.I understand it's a family movie, and clearly most people have enjoyed the show. But I have trouble getting on board something that plays very loose with how things really went down.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well done,"I was able to view an advanced screening of Saving Mr. Banks. I will have to rate it as an excellent movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it certainly brought back memories. I enjoyed it very much. The film was on the most part incredibly true to era. I felt the transitioning from one time period to the other was done smoothly and poignantly. Obtaining the screen rights for the making of Mary Poppins and the childhood of P.T. Travers are intricately woven. The entire point of the movie could not have been made without this aspect. It was brilliantly done. I see many Oscar nominations here. Tom Hanks was outstanding as always as well as Emma Thompson. Colin Farrell was remarkable. The interactions of all the characters was beyond well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An actor's movie,"A very well done docu/drama about the making of Mary Poppins.The movie has enough to entice you, make you smile and make you appreciate what goes into making movies from the perspective of the producer and story writer. The acting, sets and 60's period costumes are wonderful. Not a movie children will enjoy, or even understand, but worthy of adults who want to see something that is rather anti-climatic and lends itself quite well to the subject matter.A good portion of SMB provides us background details which prompted the writing of the books in the first place, while the other half focuses on the challenges and frustrations both the studio and Mrs. Travers endured when they tried to come to terms with the screen adaptation.Stick around for the credits to see the actual pictures and hear the tape recordings of the events.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unexpected,"As a dedicated fan of Mary Poppins, I was immediately overjoyed when finding out about Saving Mr. Banks. I found myself teary-eyed from the trailer alone. The movie itself was not what I was expecting from the trailer. It was not as happy and go-lucky as I thought it would be. However, that was okay. It was fascinating to watch as the story behind Mary Poppins rolled out before my eyes. I was impressed with the acting and really felt like I could understand how the actors were feeling. Tom Hanks is a great Walt Disney, looking and sounding the part. Emma Thompson played a fantastic P.L. Travers and should be applauded for bringing Travers' spirit and doggedness to life. Overall a great movie. The only downfall would be the dragging on of certain scenes. As others point out, the ages are not quite correct and other small details, but for a movie based on the truth, it is true to its purpose. A heartwarming film for all Disney fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Waste of money (Unless you're REALLY into the story),"For someone who hasn't read the book, this movie was a ""wth"" in the end for me. I only went to it because I thought Tom Hanks and Disney meant something cartoon-ish and funny. It turned out to be a looooong story of a Producer trying to coerce an author to give up the rights to a movie he wanted to make. And how he pampered her. In between scenes there used to be flashbacks to the authors life which inspired her to write the book (Mary Poppins) which she wouldn't let go, for all the pampering. In the end she gives up, just like that. This goes on for 2 excruciating hrs. So unless you're a fan of Mary Poppins, this movie is worthless",,Anonymous,Biography

Who, of course, learns to see how the Walt Disney movies can make everything magically right.As we say in Finland ""Who other would lift the tail of the cat instead of the cat itself"" and somehow it fits with this movie. Disney is a smart brand making itself seem flawless & ""the good guy"", and it's almost scary how well it does that.Don't get me wrong, I love Disney movies.

Saving Mary Poppins from Disney and giving the legacy back to P. L. Travers.,"It really depends on how much you like Mary Poppins as to how much you'll like Saving Mr. Banks. If you think it's the greatest film ever, then this is perfect for you. If you think anything less, it's difficult to see the point. Since I think Poppins is average at best, it was something that bothered me throughout Banks. What is it about this story that means it deserves a high budget film? As the film is built on the dramatic ironies that Pamela Travers' requests were eventually rejected, is this just the story of how she was yet again disappointed? Ostensibly, it was made because it gives the chance to portray Walt Disney on the big screen. I had already read the script and it felt designed to offer Oscar clips. The character is even introduced into the film with his cabinet of awards behind him. The script was okay, but the flashbacks bogged it down.The film is quite like last year's Hitchcock. A very basic celebratory perspective for the mainstream audience who don't know much about filmmaking. It's quite disappointing to see filmmakers create such banal representations of themselves rather than revealing some interesting secrets of the business. However, Emma Thompson is the shining beacon and saviour. She puts her heart and soul into Pamela and delivers one of her finest performances in a long time. It is the cast that makes this film, I get giddy thinking about seeing Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, Paul Giamatti and Tom Hanks sharing a frame together. There's only a few weak links, most notably B.J. Novak who doesn't appear to suit his role and Colin Farrell's ever-scowling wife in the flashbacks.Fortunately the flashbacks aren't as bad as expected, but they don't benefit the film, especially as it introduces the inspiration for the Mary Poppins character and doesn't develop upon it at all. Hanks is good as Disney, projecting that essential warmth with ease, but he doesn't capture your heart until the humanising speech about his childhood near the end. He's a delight to watch, but not exactly Oscar worthy. Unfortunately the film does feel too often like a made-for- TV production with unimaginative cinematography and sets. Clearly John Lee Hancock is a director-for-hire. I didn't see The Blind Side but I assume it's dealt with similar bad habits of PG cinema with its far too basic representations of English and Americans with alcoholism as the worst sin. It feels like the intellect in the language used is the only thing pushing it towards anything resembling high-calibre filmmaking but sometimes it doesn't fit.It has interesting points about the power of fiction, storytellers and childhood, but it's too sugarcoated to take with sincerity. But then, nostalgia is a powerful thing and it will work for many people. It certainly justifies the need for the film to dive down the road of the character's childhoods, either in 30% of the film for Travers or a simple speech from Walt Disney. The image of Disneyland in the 1960s resonates even if you haven't been down that road. While the first hour is vanilla and dry, it gets to a point in the second half where it hits poignant moments such as Pamela hugging a Mickey Mouse doll and it ends up quite moving and gently satisfying. I guess if Saving Mr. Banks does anything, it hands the Mary Poppins mainstream legacy back from Disney to Travers, but is it really worth an expensive star-studded film and a £10 ticket for that? It'll be on Sunday morning TV forever now at the very least, double-billed with Poppins no doubt.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bring tissues because Emma Thompson & Tom Hanks are just too good,"Tom Hanks is Walt Disney and Emma Thompson is P.L. Travers, the author of the ""Mary Poppins"" series in ""Saving Mr. Banks,"" a 2013 release.For twenty years, P.L. Travers has refused to sell the rights to her book Mary Poppins to Walt Disney. Finally, her agent tells her that she doesn't have any new sales or residuals coming in and she really ought to take Walt up on his offer. He has promised her final say on the film.Reluctantly, the uptight, very proper P.L. Travers goes to Hollywood and proceeds to make Walt Disney, composers Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak (Richard and Robert Sherman) and everyone else insane with her demands and criticisms. Despite his best efforts, Disney cannot get her to warm up to him, and after a period of time, she still hasn't signed over the rights.In a way, Disney understands because ""the mouse"" (that would be Mickey) is very personal for him, and when he had the chance, he wouldn't sell the character. But in another way, he is mystified. Travers herself doesn't understand what drives her stubbornness, yet she keeps having flashbacks to her own childhood in Australia with her sweet albeit drunken father (Colin Farrell), her unhappy mother (Ruth Wilson), and the woman who came to make everything all right (Rachel Griffiths).The film should really be called ""Solving P.L. Travers"" because it's the story of a woman coming to terms with her life and being able to let go of the past. Emma Thompson is absolutely wonderful as an unlikeable woman who becomes more likable as we gradually understand her, and Hanks is fantastic as Disney, a remarkable man with great vision, and also one who is used to winning people over...at the moment, his charm and forceful personality aren't working.Paul Giametti makes the most out of his role as chauffeur to Travers; Kathy Baker, an excellent actress, is delightful as Walt's secretary; and Rachel Griffiths, as a Mary Poppins prototype, has a tiny part. Melanie Paxson is delightful as another Disney employee, as is Bradley Whitford.A very moving film, with plenty going on underneath the light story of making Mary Poppins. Watch it until the final credits are finished - you won't be sorry.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A pack of lies,"If anyone wants to know the TRUE story of P.L. Travers' and Walt Disney's negotiations regarding MARY POPPINS, read Caitlin Flanagan's article ""Becoming Mary Poppins"" published in The New Yorker in 2005. Walt Disney was an S.O.B., and treated Travers abominably. Obviously the company is trying to soften his image with this insipid film. I've lost all respect for anyone involved with the project.This paragraph from Flanagan's piece says it all: ""The première was the first Travers had seen of the movie—-she did not initially receive an invitation, but had embarrassed a Disney executive into extending one—-and it was a shock. Afterward, as Richard Sherman recalled, she tracked down Disney at the after-party, which was held in a giant white tent in the parking lot adjoining the Chinese Theatre. ""Well,"" she said loudly. ""The first thing that has to go is the animation sequence."" Disney looked at her coolly. ""Pamela,"" he replied, ""the ship has sailed."" And then he strode past her, toward a throng of well-wishers, and left her alone, an aging woman in a satin gown and evening gloves, who had travelled more than five thousand miles to attend a party where she was not wanted.""",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
No! No! No! Mr Disney!,"The ""Mr Banks"" of the title is not a comrade-in-arms of Private Ryan but the stern paterfamilias from ""Mary Poppins"". The film's subject-matter is the negotiations between Walt Disney and Pamela Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"", about the film rights to her book. It is sometimes assumed that all writers hate film adaptations of their works, and only sell the rights because they need the money, but this is by no means always the case. Dodie Smith, for example, loved the Disney cartoon of ""101 Dalmatians"", even though it is by no means 100% faithful to her novel. In the case of Travers, however, this assumption appears to be quite correct. According to this film she disliked the idea of ""Mary Poppins"" being filmed, only entered into negotiations because she was in dire financial straits, and drove Disney and his studio executives to distraction with her cavilling and nit-picking demands.Alternating with the scenes set in sixties California are those depicting Travers' childhood in Edwardian Queensland. (Everyone assumed Travers was British, but she was actually Australian by birth. Her real name was Helen Goff, ""Pamela Travers"" being a stage name adopted during her career as an actress). The film's thesis seems to be firstly that the fictitious Mr. Banks was inspired by Travers' memories of her own father and secondly that the theme of the novel is how Mary Poppins ""saves"" Banks by revealing his better nature and preventing him from being a strict, bad-tempered, authoritarian old patriarch. Only when Disney shows that he appreciates what the novel is all about does Travers drop her opposition to a film version.Unfortunately, the story told here does not always seem to bear out that thesis. In the first place, I don't recall from my own memories of the books that George Banks was such a domestic tyrant; that seems to have been Disney's conception rather than Travers's. Secondly, Mr Goff, as played by Colin Farrell, is far from stern or authoritarian. Although he is, like Banks, an employee of a bank, he is a kindly and loving father. His faults are very different ones; he is perhaps too indulgent with his children, and he is an alcoholic who has damaged both his health and his career by heavy drinking. He is a sensitive, imaginative man, but it is implied that he is not really suited to a career in banking and that the incompatibility between his personality and his profession may be at the root of his personal troubles.Both Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks have been praised for their performances, even talked of as possible Oscar candidates, but I was less impressed. Thompson has described Travers as ""a woman of quite eye- watering complexity and contradiction,"" and there seems to have been a lot of truth in this characterisation. That was not, however, the impression I was left with from this film. Her Travers seemed to me to be far from complex, simply an upper-middle-class English spinster with the personality of a pedantic, pernickety schoolmarm. (""No, no, no, Mr Disney!"") Thompson's performance is technically a good one- if you wanted a one-dimensional portrayal of an upper-middle-class English spinster with the personality of a pedantic, pernickety schoolmarm it could hardly be bettered- but there was no way in which I could imagine this woman as a creative artist of any kind. This came as a disappointment, as I have greatly admired Thompson in some of her earlier films, such as ""Much Ado about Nothing"", ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Howard's End"" and ""An Education"".As for Hanks, Hollywood's resident Mr Nice Guy achieves a convincing visual likeness to Walt Disney, but struck me as far too avuncular. By all accounts Disney was a shrewd, not to say ruthless, businessman and difficult to work for, but these aspects of his character do not come across here. (To say nothing of all those rumours of racism, anti- Semitism and Fascist sympathies). Disney's determination to film ""Mary Poppins"" is explained by a promise he once made to his two daughters, not by the money he stands to make if the film is a success. (By the time the film appeared in 1964 Disney's daughters were aged 31 and 28 and probably no longer worried about a promise their father had made to them as children). ""Saving Mr Banks"" also tactfully omits the fact that Travers hated the film of ""Mary Poppins"" and refused permission for any more of her books to be filmed, which explains why such a massively successful film was not followed by any sequels.There are some good supporting performances, notably from Paul Giamatti as Travers's chauffeur Ralph from Farrell and from Annie Buckley who plays Travers as a young girl. I felt that the Australian scenes were the best part of film, and wondered if it might have been more interesting had it been made as a straightforward biography of Travers without concentrating on the Disney angle. But of course, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" was made by none other than Walt Disney Pictures, who were not going to miss the opportunity to generate some good PR for their company. If some other studio had produced it we might have ended up with a more honest film. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

great performances and fun though overly pat story,"This highly fictionalized, sentimentalized version of P.L. Travers experience contending with Disney over the adaptation of her Mary Poppins book is quite entertaining. Much of this is due to some excellent performances. The always-excellent Emma Thompson is terrific as the prickly Travers, and Tom Hanks, who I don't always care for, gives a nicely understated performance as Disney. I loved his reaction to Travers trash talking of his movies, in which he looked, just for a moment, like he'd been sucker punched.There are also excellent performances by Colin Farrell, in flashback, as Travers charming father and Paul Giamatti as a genial driver. I was particularly impressed by how much Giamatti caught the style of a 1960s character.The script has sharp dialogue and shows the actors off to good advantage, but even before reading the wikipedia article on the movie I knew it had to be pretty far from the truth. Many scenes are just way too pat; it's clearly a work of fiction inspired by a true life story.You can see some indication of that during the credits, when the movie plays an actual recording of Travers talking to the Disney writers. She's not nearly as hostile as Thompson portrays her, and sounds more like someone collaborating on a project than someone trying to shoot it down.Travers real-life reaction to the Disney movie of her book would, I suspect, be echoed in her real-life reaction to Saving Mr. Banks. But it is entertaining. It also makes me curious about the original Poppins books; I never even knew the movie was based on a book series!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Was Quite Touched,"I don't know what the truth is. I decided long ago to not see movies as historical documents. If that were the case we would dismiss about 95 percent of those films that feature historical figures. I had the misfortune to see ""American Sniper"" this past week. If you want to see something playing around with the truth, watch that. Yet there is all this adulation going on. This is a human film which extrapolates a series of events that involved obtaining the movie rights to Mrs. P. L.Travers' book ""Mary Poppins."" She is brought in from Engliand and does everything she can to keep from releasing her baby to the movie mogul Disney. But where this turns into a nice film is the back story. There are intermittent flashbacks to her childhood where she doted on her father, an alcoholic and dreamer. He has trouble with the real world and yet must live in it. He caused great pain to his wife and family but can't kick the disease. Mrs. Travers has become cynical and short and unkind over the years because she seems to have some self-loathing. The movie contains one scene after another where the producers and the writers must walk on eggshells around her. She is explosive and angry all the time. Only when she is alone, do we see her fragility. There were several moments in this film where I got tears. That happens to me so seldom. If the film was manipulative and somewhat inaccurate, they got me, and that's OK. Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are wonderful as always.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A spoonful of sugar too much,"Another 'inspired by a true story' movie surefiring its way to this years Academy Awards, tells the story of the odd cat-fight between P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson), author of the famed Mary Poppins books, and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) en route to the production of the live action feature. After 20 years of constantly pressuring the author on selling her book to Disney, Travers finally reluctantly agrees given her financial plight. However, she stipulates the need for her to have control over the end product with script authority and veto power. This creates tension with the scriptwriter and the musicians (especially given Travers is reluctant to agree to any music at all). With this uneasy relationship slowly boiling over it seems like the picture is destined for failure. However, the experiences of the writer bring back painful memories of her youth, which give insight as to the origins of her beloved flying nanny.The movie juxtaposes the prickly P.L. Travers with the overbearing optimism of Disney and the Californian sunshine. Watching Disney especially, presented as a jovial and considerate person, as opposed to the troubled Travers, managed to arouse my inner grumpiness, cheering on the Australian-born children author in her endeavour of being an full-fledged pain in the buttocks to the animation studio and her employees. Ultimately somewhat let down that Travers lets herself be corrupted by the twinkle toes of Hollywood, especially with the externally honest, internally two-faced Disney in mind. Thus, I must admit I failed to catch on to the rampaging mirthfulness of the movie, instead finding myself irritated by the positive light being shone on the American way of being, as contrasted to the straight-faced jabbing sardonicism of the foreigner.Emma Thompson remains a shining light throughout, in thick or thin, in drama or comedy, delivering arguably the best and most complete performance of the year (regardless of sex). Beautifully layered thanks to her starkly English attitude as well as some very well intertwined flashbacks, much can be forgiven and forgotten. Nonetheless, when Disney slowly seems to be winning the fight for the heart, I found myself pulling back emotionally at the insincere American entirety of the movie. Especially given the presentation of Walt Disney in this movie is a far cry from reality, sugar-coating a man who deserves no such accolades. The internal conflict that drives the movie slowly irritates, with the only emotional impact owing to the sidelined back-story of P. L. Travers and exceptional acting by Thompson.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply A Beautiful Film,"At times this film will overwhelm you with its simple power and leave you sobbing uncontrollably as you grieve for a lost childhood and magical memories of an early film viewing experience. This is cinema for the soul of our past and it touches us deeply with its truth. Hanks and Thompson are nothing less than superb in their respective roles and undeniably do some of their finest work in this film. In every scene they play together, we are reminded of just what great actors they truly are. As we watch them bring the profound depth of their characters to life, we experience a journey into the past and a hope filled time that promised such a beautiful future. Marry Poppins was imperfect masterpiece and this film is as well. But the way both films touch our souls and as adults rekindle that faint glow of hope, well, it is quite sublime indeed. The question is asked somewhere on the IMDb, ""Is it necessary to view Marry Poppins prior to seeing this film?"" The answer is that no life is complete if the magic of Marry Poppins hasn't been part of it. If one's heart is touched by that film, then Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely treasure. If Marry Poppins is nothing more than a cinematic requirement that offers little more than catchy tunes, then simply don't bother. Unless you can open your heart and break through the calcified cynicism that prevents you from seeing the profound beauty in these two films, both can be easily dismissed as sentimental fluff.

A Pleasing Tale Involving Creative Minds. ♦ 87%,"Because each and every character in this motion picture reflects creativity towards the audience, through their dialogs and actions. Not to mention, with one of the best cast ensemble this year (only second to American Hustle), Saving Mr. Banks is one of the best movies of 2013.I actually could relate to P L Travers' anxiety over Walt Disney's idea of animating her novels into a musical. Her past, connected to the mystical stories she wrote is bound together seamlessly with the present proceedings. Her childhood and her admiration for her father is one part, Disney's coaxing for the movie rights is another. In the end, they speak hell of a story which samples life, disorders, emotions and desolation. Coming out as a conclusion is that you always have to let go, no matter what.Emma Thompson is the star of the film. I won't speculate about the Oscars, but the way she carries her air as Mrs. Travers is mind-blowing. How she insists upon her co-characters about almost everything are the best conversations you'll hear this year-end, mostly when she makes us wanna hate and love her at the same time. Tom Hanks looks like he had 467 tans before his scenes and I think her very well attributed to the role. Special mention for Colin Farell (amazing), Bradley Whitford (charismatic), Jason Schwartzman (genuine) & Paul Giamatti (a different role well done) with B J Novak (slender).The best sequences of the lot are the musical ones where Whitford, Schwartzman and Novak sing, dance and thus try to cajole Thompson. Terrific!I appreciate Hancock's imagination and bringing in the details and paying careful attention to them; including the disorders of Walt Disney is one thing. I cannot go fact-checking, but intrinsically, the long list of messages this film conveys is sufficient for consideration (both awards and viewing). And it is incredibly pleasing; never bores.Fantastic music and score, supportive supp. cast, brilliant art setup and a clever cinematography makes this 2013's best comedy drama.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! The performances, the music & the narration will keep you delightfully engrossed. 8.7 out of 10!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Purposeful and Appealing But Far Too Conventional,"Disney's live-action wing takes a look at the difficult, complicated working conditions that led to the creation of the studio's 1964 classic, Mary Poppins. Emma Thompson succeeds memorably as P.L. Travers, the complex, seemingly-joyless British authoritarian behind the source novel, while Tom Hanks is, surprisingly, only okay as Walt Disney himself. The tough, contested relationship between these two, opposite sides of the same coin, forms the core of the story; Disney pushes to make the film uplifting and creative, while Travers fights to maintain her characters' dignity. On the surface, it's a good example of how the powers of dedication and creativity can overcome difficult circumstances to make a brilliant piece of work - perhaps one that's even better than they'd have made amidst calmer waters. I felt that the scenes inside Disney's idea factory, superficial as they proved to be, were the film's best. Writers, songsters and artists giving it their all, only to be shot down by a stubborn client on a technicality and come back for more - that's the intriguing stuff. The frequent dalliances into flashback and character moments, though effective in a classical sense, felt too formulaic and artificially sweetened for my taste. A fine enough ride, though I was hoping for something slightly more off-the-beaten-path.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'd rather watch the actual Mary Poppins Disney film,"Saving Mr. Banks offers an interesting viewpoint of how Mary Poppins was made into a movie, but unfortunately, I didn't really care about the characters. Emma Thompson does a fantastic job, because I couldn't stand P.L. Travers, and I felt like Tom Hanks' Walt Disney is just another smooth salesman trying to pull one over on Mrs. Travers and close the deal. It's fascinating to see how much drama there was behind the scenes, but I'd rather watch the actual Mary Poppins Disney film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"SAVING MR. BANKS (John Lee Hancock, 2013) ***","Five-time Oscar winner MARY POPPINS (1964) remains Walt Disney's most popular and critically-acclaimed of all his live action films and this latest such entry from the same stable should serve as an eye-opener to its legion of fans on how films were made back in the day and a delightful nostalgia trip for seasoned film buffs. Emma Thompson is perfectly cast as the beloved character's stubborn literary creator P.L. Travers who is ever so reluctant (a 20-year struggle, in fact!) to sell the film rights to animation mogul Disney (Tom Hanks – who despite being 10 years too young for the role – acquits himself well).The vivid recreation of the Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland and the entertaining tit-for-tat discussions between Travers, co-screenwriter Don DaGradi, songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman and Disney himself are countered (and, ultimately, bogged down) by dismal flashbacks set in the Australian outback in which we see Travers' childhood completely under the influence of her boozing dreamer of a banker father (Colin Farrell) – which is what the odd choice of title for the film itself is all about. The over-reliance on the Musical's admittedly catchy songs does get repetitive after a while and, as expected, a certain amount of whitewashing of the reportedly unsavory main characters was involved.Having said that, the film's two best sequences for me were when Travers' beleaguered chauffeur (Paul Giamatti) reveals to her that his daily weather reporting to his passenger – which bugged her no end – stemmed from the fact that it affected his ""handicapped"" daughter's mobility; and towards the very end when Disney unexpectedly flies to London (in an 11th hour attempt to get a still defiant Travers to sign) and confesses to her that his own relationship with his newspaper editor father was no less fraught. I also liked the idea that the end credits not only display photographs of the protagonists from the era depicted (which only serves to highlight the fact that none of the actors employed really resemble them!) but the voice of Travers is also heard via recordings she herself insisted upon of the entire consultation process!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Must Watch very well done,"The comedy drama brings to light the battle for the rights of the film Mary Poppins. The remarkable likenesses to the characters is no compromise for the amazing acting that have me from one minute laughing to the next almost crying. The unveiling story explains so much more about the 1964 classic film. I loved the witty character of Mrs P.L Travers who from the very begging kept me laughing. The flashbacks to her past as a child were done remarkably well. I loved how Walt Disney had such optimism despite the negativity of Mrs Travers, from the many snacks and sweets on there table to there apparently wrong perception of the Banks Family. A fascinating story captured unbelievably well by the the fantastic cast and crew a MUST watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A barrage of obnoxious!,"Get ready for rapid-fire obnoxiousness by the P.L. Travers character, vehemently portrayed by Emma Thompson. It gets to be so much that it gets hard to watch the movie for more than 15 minute snippets at a time! But I was intent on watching it because of the very decent cast. Sadly, the writing and directing falls into very corny traps that's undermines the ornery-quotient. The filmmakers didn't seem to know what they wanted to convey in their movie, so it's a rollercoaster ride of jerk-falsely-high handed-Brit and goofy-materialist-unsophisticated-American bouncing rather abrasively off of each other.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"Trying to keep his promise to his daughters to make a movie from their favorite book, Mary Poppins, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) finds it most difficult dealing with the author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) who is extremely set in her ways regarding how the movie should be made.I never saw MARY POPPINS so I was at a disadvantage knowing what Mary Poppins was all about (how un-American of you not seeing the movie). We see that her novel has everything to do with her childhood and alcoholic father played by Colin Farrell. It takes Walt Disney quite a while to put all that together and his little talk with Ms. Travers near the end of the movie is nothing but pure gold. For a while - mostly in the beginning - I felt that Tom Hanks was miscast, but he won me over and I was convinced he was the perfect choice to portray Walt Disney (big of you).I do believe that Emma Thompson overplayed her part for most of the movie. I couldn't help thinking that before each scene she squirted down a few juicy lemons to make sure she came off as a priggish know-it-all uncompromising ultra-phony pseudo-intellectual. Or to put it another way she came off as a Real Bitch. And, that lemon juice did the job. But, to be fair, after that talk with Walt Disney she saved herself and I was okay with her. Yes, I knew she would turn, (hey, we all did) in time, to becoming a normal human being, but it did take a while.Anne Rose Buckley who played Ginty when Mrs Travers was a child should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for something. She was perfect.An excellent supporting cast of Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Goff (Travers' mother), Colin Farrell as Ginty's father (Travers Goff), Paul Giamatti as Ralph who was Ms. Travers' driver in LA, Bradley Whitford as Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers who along with DaGradi performed all the musical rehearsals (really good too) for the movie.The technica-color aspect of the movie for most of the first half seemed to be a colorized version seen when movies were only made in black and white back in the day. Or maybe there was an over-abundance of make-up on the characters. Take your pick.Though I never saw the MARY POPPINS movie, this movie provided the connections between Mrs Travers' childhood and the Mary Poppins story. And, now the title SAVING MR BANKS makes sense.The little talk near the end, that Walt Disney made to P.L. Travers should go onto Youtube (there are some things there , but not that talk) so we can hear it over and over again. If you watch this movie on DVD, play back that talk a few times. It won't get old and it was the whole essence of the movie as far as I am concerned. I don't know if the real Walt Disney actually spoke those words but he should have but having known many nice things about Walt Disney he may very well have spoken those words. They were pure gold. (9/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Should kids watch: That's up to the parents. We do see some uncomfortable scenes whenGinty sees her father in an alcoholic state. Also Ginty saves her mother fromcommitting suicide in the lake. Language: No.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Brilliant!,"I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks and so I always watch his films. This film is brilliant.....perfect even! Watching this film makes you realise the difference between good acing and great acting. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are superb together and the casting choice for this film was genius! The whole film is a joy from start to finish.Apart from focusing on Marry Poppins itself, there are Flashbacks to the writers early childhood and the struggles she faced. Walt Disney tries to break through the hard barrier of the writer.I could watch this film over and over again. The scenes when the songs are being written is a joy. A great family film but also equally enjoyable, if not more so for adults.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
History swirled and remixed into colorful cotton candy,"The original ""Mary Poppins"" was steeped in warm-n-fuzzy, so it makes sense they'd go with the same approach for the making-of story. And that tended to dictate what goes on in ""Saving Mr. Banks"", at least to me. I wouldn't go so far as to say this is revisionism (hell, maybe it is), but I didn't make it to the end credits feeling like this is actually what happened (didn't Travers hate ""Mary Poppins"").But it's a good story, and enough to sweep you along (flashback overuse aside). The best thing here is the cast, each one fitting in very well (with Hanks and Thompson the clear standouts).But somehow, still sappier than even ""Poppins"".6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A spoonful of saccharine,"This is one of those movies you slightly despise yourself for enjoying. There's not much to it. After a 20-year battle to secure the movie rights to MARY POPPINS, Walt Disney then has another battle to make the movie his way and not the way the author P.L. Travers thinks it should be made.Walt is played by Tom Hanks, looking as always like Tom Hanks. Pamela (there's a wearisome joke about her insistence on being addressed as 'Mrs Travers') is played by Emma Thompson as an elegant curmudgeon pitched somewhere between NANNY McPHEE and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY. There are frequent flashbacks to her childhood in Australia, a rural idyll wrecked by her father's battle with the booze. Colin Farrell looks a bit uncomfortable in the underwritten role of Dad, handsome and playful, a drunk but never a mean one. Rachel Griffiths is terribly wasted as the stern well-meaning Ozzie Auntie who we are meant infer is the inspiration for la Poppins. Paul Giamatti makes a meal out of the role of Mrs Travers's studio chauffeur, and Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak get some fun out of playing the Sherman brothers, who write the songs which Mrs Travers does not wish to hear or see in the film of her book.A spoonful of saccharine helps the movie go down. The story's fatal flaw is its predictability, not helped by the fact that most of us have a faint idea of how MARY POPPINS is going to turn out, cartoon sequence and blissfully daft songs and everything. But the tone of this movie is almost as charming as the tone of that movie, and Thompson and Hanks play their roles exactly right, however predictably. So - I'm going to have a go at emulating grinchy Craig from STRICTLY COME DANCING and give SAVING MR. BANKS a grudging 7 out of 10 (Bruno will probably give it a 9)!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An excellent movie of Walt Disney magic and what stories are all about,"I visited America last year and among visiting several cities and historical sites I also managed to fit in a visit to Disneyworld (Florida) and Universal Studios. During my time there it struck me just how much stories played a role in the innovative and determined spirit of the American people and how much present day heroes took inspiration from the stories of heroes from the past. One such a hero is Walt Disney.This movie inspires one to keep dreaming, to keep innovating, never to accept no for an answer and to build a better future with your vision. It is the feeling that Disney establishes in its parks and it is the feeling that you experience after listening to the stories of great heroes.This movie is about the true power of stories: the love of stories and the ownership we feel about those stories, the good stories of our life and the bad stories of our life and which stories we choose to accept as the one defining ourselves.Emma Thompson is delightful as the uptight P.L. Travers. She manages to play the uncooperative and disagreeable role superbly without sacrificing any likability. Tom Hanks is an equal treat as the imaginative Walt Disney and really makes the giant come to life. Several songs from Mary Poppins brings back a touch of nostalgia and gets new meaning within the context of the story. A quirky script dispersed with several comedic gems ensure many laughs. We aren't dealing simply with a comedy here, however, and underneath P.L. Travers' tetchy behaviour lies a more complex story that is also beautifully explored. It successfully brings about laughs and tears.This movie is what movies are all about.As for me, the movie reminded me that no matter how much one might love stories, the purpose of a story is not just an object onto itself to be admired as a created piece of art. A story only truly finds meaning when it serves to augment, flavour and shape our own stories.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Barely Poppins,"Saving Mr. Banks is the story about the making of the Disney classic, Mary Poppins. And just as that film sentimentalized P. L. Travers' children's novel, so does this film sugarcoat the true behind-the-scenes scenario. By the tablespoonful!No, this film treatment doesn't make it go down any easier. There is no genuine dramatic tension as Saving Mr. Banks simplifies its tale by constantly cleansing the facts for more wholesome family enjoyment. The script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith melds two stories unsuccessfully. It presents Mrs. Travers' troubled childhood memories set in Australia, 1901 with her displeasure at having her novel become a major Walt Disney musical extravaganza in Los Angeles, 1964. Neither story quite gels. Mrs. T. may have had daddy issues, but director John Lee Hancock never has a real grasp of the facts or the fiction. The direction is stilted and heavy-headed as facts are treated with melodramatic flourish and never fully presented or realized.*Generally speaking, the acting is good. Emma Thompson plays the uptight author with a determined haughtiness and ongoing petulance that gives her character some nuance. Tom Hanks' Uncle Walt is less of the clever manipulative businessman and too much of the sweet Grandpa type. Their relationship, which was and should have been more volatile, is downplayed and lacking the needed ""gravitas""' as P. L. Travers would have said. Providing that gravitas is Colin Farrell as the author's alcoholic father. The actor gives especially fine support along with the always dependable Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the songwriting team known as the Sherman Brothers.Saving Mr. Banks does hold one's interest, especially when it stays within the problems involved with the making of the Disney classic film.  The film is always entertaining and interesting fodder, but a classic for the Disney vault it ain't!  GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com* NOTE: Just one example of playing loose with the facts: Mrs. Travers disliked the finished Disney version of her novel, although her reaction to the film at its premiere is precisely the opposite effect than Saving Mr. Banks indicates.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fairy-tale ending a complete lie,"The end of the movie shows Travers watching Mary Poppins with what appears to be acceptance and even enjoyment.That's not at all what happened.

Takes perseverance,"This movie takes a lot of perseverance to get through. The first half-to-three quarters of the movie is quite painful and difficult to endure. The character of PL Travers is so irritating you feel like walking out.Furthermore, there is a seemingly unrelated story being told at the same time, set in Australia. The sheer nails-on-blackboard painfulness of PL Travers and the random, perplexing nature of the parallel story seem like recipes for disaster.However, there is a moment of clarity and profundity, where everything falls into place. From then on the movie makes sense, Mrs Travers' character ceases to be a pain, the movie is quite emotional and interesting. Moreover, it ends on a high note.It's just a pity the good stuff takes so long to arrive.Ultimately, I only liked the movie because of how it ended. The destination was good, but the journey was painful and one I could easily have given up on.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

You need a spoonful of sugar to really enjoy this,"Acting is superb by both leading parts as well as supporting roles. Its the story that I take issue with from the point of view that it dragged, didn't spell out the dysfunction and or took too long to get to it and that more of Mr. Disney would have made this picture a must see. Tom Hanks has you seeing and hearing Walt no problem. There is also some great scenes with the song writers suffering through their work but not because it was hard but being interfered with. One thing puzzles me however. Trying to get Disneyland to support any movie is already a challenge and this one had carte balance to go into Disneyland and just showcase the place and make it part of the healing process for the people involved. I got excited just seeing a glimpse of the happiest place on earth or the Magic Kingdom as it is called. Let me add I used to work there too and they let a good opportunity go unclaimed. It would have made this movie a must watch just to visit with Disneyland let alone the subject matter of Mary Poppins etc. Yes to seeing this movie and it is worth a ticket. Watch out for the hype of many reviewers over praising this for fear of offending the Disney power machine. It is not Oscar material. Definitely recommend a snack, tasty drink and sorry to say your cell phone for the slow parts. Catch the end credits for pictures of the real players at the premiere BTW",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delightful journey through the partly imagined gestation of Mary Poppins,Take it for what it is: an imagined take on the journey from page to screen of the most famous nanny in the world.

Emma Thompson does a good job,"Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) is turning his favorite book ""Mary Poppins"" into a movie. The problem is that the stubborn author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is unwilling to comprise on anything. Script writer Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), musical writers Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak) and Richard Sherman (Jason Schwartzman) must suffer under her unbending will. Her driver Ralph (Paul Giamatti) tries to befriend her. Travers is not actually upper class British as everybody assumed but a little girl from Australia. Her parents Travers (Colin Farrell) and Margaret Goff (Ruth Wilson) had many problems. Then one day, aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths) comes to help the family.It's a movie that has trouble early on when Travers is annoyingly stubborn. Scenes where a bit of comedy could be injected is inevitably deaden by her meanness. It would help if an early scene could show her suffering and therefore justify her harshness towards others. It's not simply that she is stiff and proper. That could actually be funny. There is an anger in her that needs justification. Once it digs properly into her past, she becomes more human and her character becomes more compelling. Emma Thompson does a good job especially since her character does have changes. Tom Hanks should add a bit more sour to the sweetness of his Walt Disney. The rest of the cast all do a solid job. This movie tries to straddle a more serious story with its Disneyfied version and it does it as well as expected.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"With a grating lead and some bland direction, nothing can save this one","Saving Mr. Banks is one of those films that commits the fateful cinema sin of producing exactly what you expect from it and is therefore entirely and utterly predictable from the film's start until it's signposted ending. What makes Hancock's film a true misfire however is that this predictable journey is centred around one of the most horrendous and unlikeable leading ladies (we are talking Nurse Ratchet like unlikeable here) I've been unlucky enough to witness and no matter where her life resolution takes us it's mighty hard to care.There were quite a few pundits within the movie industry that bemoaned the fact British actress Emma Thompson missed out on being nominated for an Oscar for her work here, but all I can say is thank goodness for common sense prevailing. Thompson's role as cantankerous and razor tongued author P.L Travers may be close to the real life thing but it doesn't enhance the fact all Thompson had to do was look sour, be ungrateful and generally be rude to everyone and anything, an acting feat that can't be overly hard to pull off. Surrounded by solid support everywhere you look, Travers overshadows all other players thanks to her cancerous hatred towards most things in her life and it is supposed to be OK because she has daddy issues? That is also where Saving Mr. Banks fails.Giving audiences an inside look into the authors troubled childhood in Australia is a nice touch but the way in which it is structured, through flashbacks featuring a questionably acting Colin Farrell and later on Australia's very own (cantankerous and rude in real life) actor Rachel Griffiths, is a play by the filmmakers that feels gimmicky and misused. It's clear that Traver's childhood wasn't a fairy tale but it's also clear that it doesn't give her an excuse to be the lady she was and doesn't justify a life of frequent rudeness. The film does succeed in showing us again why Mary Poppins is such a fine cinematic classic with raucous rendition of songs a highlight, and it's nice to see Hanks enjoying himself as Mr. Disney but you wouldn't say it's one of his crowning achievements.Filmed with an overall air of TV movie quality and with a script that often fails to justify a reason for us to be spending such a large portion of our time with a sour old lady, Saving Mr. Banks greatest achievement is making the audience wish they were watching Mary Poppins instead; a film filled with wonder, joy, characters we care for and a sense of originality which is virtually all the things Saving Mr. Banks doesn't have.2 cups of tea out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect in (almost) every way!,"Anyone who gave this movie less than 8 stars either missed the point or has no soul.This was perfectly casted and acted, telling the story of author PL Travers and her battle with Walt Disney over the filming rights to Mary Poppins.I'll admit, when my wife suggested watching this, I was less than enthusiastic. But within minutes, the quality of the acting won me over, along with the compelling storyline. I had no idea who Travers was, nor of the hardship she faced as a child. While I'm guessing it was somewhat embellished for the film, there's enough truth in those frequent flashbacks to give an idea of what could have happened. Emma Thompson brought real energy to the role, playing the part with passion and gravitas, but to real comic effect. Tom Hanks was brilliant as Disney, and even Colin Farrel surprised us with his excellent portrayal of the author's alcoholic but loving and devoted father.The film adds another dimension to the timeless classic that is Mary Poppins, and I'll never think of it in the same way.It was equally moving, funny and thought-provoking, and well-worth watching for the performances alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Enjoyable Movie,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I found it very moving in places; quite sad. Tom Hanks played the role of Walt Disney perfectly in my opinion. What made Hanks' portrayal even more interesting to me was, only a couple of months ago, I watched an excellent four-part documentary on the life and career of Walt Disney. The documentary was a wonderful insight into the man...Walt Disney. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, captured Disney's essence.However, I did notice on the sign at the Maryborough railway station as the family were about aboard the train that would take them to to Allora the spelling of the little township of Yandina was incorrect. On the sign the town was spelled ""Vandina""; a ""V"" was used instead of ""Y"". Just a small observation.It didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.

Disney and Poppins recreated,"Disney and Poppins were part of my childhood, to be sure. Doesn't mean I want to go back there, but this was a pleasant excursion. Thompson and Hanks are perfect as the leads. Interesting that two characters who, these days, garner mixed reviews are so sympathetically rendered, but in a real way. At the centre of this, Mary Poppins is retold from the perspectives of its creator, the scriptwriters and musicians who had to work with her (tough work) and Disney himself. Real life, real and imagined pasts and the world of Poppins are successfully intertwined. Ultimately, this is a film which knows what film-making is about, communicating a real story in a creative, entertaining and ultimately moving way.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Serious thanks to Hanks' Banks film,"Whatever SAVING MR. BANKS' ultimate financial fate - which most sources seem to indicate will probably be comfortable - it was doing something close to ""land office business"" when I saw it New Year's Day afternoon on 42nd Street with a very youngish mixed crowd who almost all stayed well into the credit crawl. The very clever gimmick of having the original tape of the actual Mrs. Travers at the reading of the script with the other authors - which was dramatized in the film itself - played over the crawl made them almost impossible to walk out on.The film itself was not, IMHO, a major work of art: they pretty much give away the main element the audience should be figuring out in the film's title and and I have read that a number of the strict historical details are seriously distorted (the cynical will always insist that there was never any real chance of P.J. Travers' withholding the film rights that Disney wanted to her most famous work since she needed the money) but the broad strokes - including that one - are made most believably credible and three perfectly lovely performances from Emma Thompson, Collin Farrell and Tom Hanks (not to mention Paul Giamatti's utterly charming driver, two women in Disney's office and the boys playing the Sherman Brothers - especially B. J. Novak) make it a very enjoyable outing.For me however, and I suspect many of my age, the greatest reason for seeing the film is the rehabilitation (humanization) of Walt Disney's personal image and reputation after all that came out after we grew up about how right wing the man was in his personal/political life. The film speaks to his artistic legacy and it is as charming as the legacy is important. I'd much rather remember the founder of the Mouse House this way than the way I had come to think of him - and I rather doubt that Mrs. Travers would have serious objections either.No-one will deny that the lady reserved the right to formally/officially dislike the Disney MARY POPPINS the way GBS rejected THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER operetta based on his ARMS AND THE MAN, but you will want to see the publicity photos of Travers with Disney and the Sherman Brothers at the end of the film which somewhat soften the image.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Story of Devotion Between Creator and Creation,"On its surface there's little more to see here than a success-spoiled entrepreneur battling against the will of a difficult creator but, to those who can see it, the film offers so much more in the way of delving into the heart and reason behind Travers' passionate defence of a story; into which she poured so much of herself and those from her life whom she loved and adored. What's remarkable is how powerful even the opening keys of songs so invested in the hearts of millions can be, even out of the context of the classic film itself, and it plays to the credit of this finely executed and deeply emotional piece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A very touching film... but how true is it?,"SAVING MR. BANKSAs soon as I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew I wanted to see it. I am a big Disney fan and love all the classic Disney animated movies. I also love some of the live action movies too, especially Bedknobs and Broomsticks and Mary Poppins.This film is about a famous author named Pamela Travers. Pamela's biggest seller was the Mary Poppins novels. The film is centered around the period in her life when she stopped writing and Walt Disney kept contacting her about giving him the film rights to the book. Pamela was not interested and hated the idea of Walt bringing Mary to life as she hated his movies. She is not a fan of his animation. Finally her accountant talked her into flying to America to meet with Walt and maybe sign the rights over to him. She agrees on the condition that she has final say in ever decision that is made about the movie and characters and one of the stipulations was ""No animation"". Pam makes it very hard work for Walt and his team.This is a drama about her American trip, but even more it is a drama about her childhood. The film makes it look like she was haunted by her past. Her relationship with her father who she adored and his troubles. The movie is very well made. It is very sad. Saving Mr. Banks is not a feel good movie. I left the cinema just feeling sorry for her even though her character is not very likable. You grow to really like her as the film goes on, but she really is a mean old woman. But I am thinking she was only mean because he is so attached to the character in her book that she does not want to let go or even give anyone else the chance to portray her. There are some very funny moments in the movie though. Some of the things she says and the way she acts towards Walt's' film makers was brilliant. Pam was a woman that took no mess. She knew what she wanted and had no problem saying what she thought. She has some fantastic comedy moments.The film stars Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as Pamela Travers. The whole cast was brilliant. I thought Tom did a great job as Walt. He played with passion and conviction. The star of the movie for me though was Emma. I thought she should get top billing for this as her performance was by far the best. Her character was very believable and she played it to perfection. Colin Farrell played Pam's father. I am not a massive Colin Farrell fan, but I understand he is a good actor. He did a very good job in this too and for an Irish man he really can pull off an English accent well.The film does drag on a little bit. There is far too many flashbacks for my liking. I know that we are learning about her childhood and the troubles her family had but it just felt that the first half of the film was stretched out a bit because of it. But it did help with the connection of the characters. I suppose the main problem I had with the movie was the ending. I have read up about Pamela Travers and from everything I have read, it turns out the ending of this film is not 100% accurate. I don't want to put spoilers in my reviews so I won't mention anything that happens, but I am just disappointed that they did not stick to the truth fully but then no bio pic ever does. I suppose that being made by Disney was also the reason for it they will not make themselves look bad. But anyone that knows anything about Disney knows that they have had a very controversial past but this does not take away my memories of watching their cartoons as a kid and adult and loving every second of them. They know how to make a decent family movie and I love them all the same.My favourite part of the movie was the credits. As you watch the film you see the Pam told Walt that she will only help them with the film as long as every meeting was taped. During the credits, you can hear one of the recordings from the meeting. It was awesome watching a movie about this woman and seeing the hell she puts these guys through, and then to hear the real recording at the end of the film. It was a brilliant touch by Disney and really nice to hear it it was also topped off by the photos that they showed of the real Pam Travers with the real Walt Disney too.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Stop! Mary Poppins is not for sale! I won't have her turned into one of your silly cartoons.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delightful,"If you missed this, it is now on Netflix. Delightful movie. Well worth seeing. It is about Walt Disney convincing the author of the Mary Poppins books, P.L. Travers, to allow him to make Mary Poppins into a movie. She did not want Disney to make a Disney movie out of Mary Poppins, but that's the only kind of movie Walt Disney made. She needed the money. She was even more difficult to deal with in real life. Terrific cast, Tom Hanks as Walt and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers. Something left out of the movie - Travers had script approval rights but not film editing rights. Clever man that Walt Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I loved it. The real Mary Poppins.,"I was very surprised when my wife told me we were going to watch a movie about Mary Poppins. I rarely watch movies, I love reading books. Of course I had seen Mary Poppins probably 20 or more times over my life. Definitely a classic of Walt Disney's. So if you find out we were going to watch a movie about the movie, I settled in and hoped to enjoy it. I was not disappointed at all. I cried, I left, I was frustrated, I smile. This was needed in my life. I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did with my family. You won't be disappointed",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emma Thompson delightful,"I had read so many lackluster reviews about this film that I went in not expecting much. So I'm glad that I was pleasantly surprised. I ended up enjoying this flick quite a bit.I think what really made this film work was Emma Thompson. I laughed quite a bit during the film and 95% of the time it was because of her. And when she was watching Mary Poppins for the first time and getting emotional, it made me tear up as well. So I thought she was quite effective in the role. She was quite superb. However, I thought that perhaps she was a bit young for the role. Tom Hanks too. They both looked about 10 years younger than they should have. At least when you compare them to the real life people from that time. Speaking of Tom Hanks, he was good but not spectacular. He also kind of played him as cold, and who knows maybe Walt Disney was really that way, but it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way.And I enjoyed the flashbacks and understand why it was important to the story, however there was too many of them. It would get a bit annoying just constantly jumping back and forth. I don't know if there would have been a way to make that more seamless. But the flashbacks kept me guessing. I knew going into the film that the ""real Mary Poppins"" saved them. Presumably the father (since Mary Poppins is there to save the father). I had my theories that the mother would die in an accident, and then later on that she would kill herself. I knew something horrible would happen, but I just didn't know what. I'm glad that the film doesn't make it too obvious. That you'll keep guessing.So overall I enjoyed it, but it wasn't perfect. My favourite part was when P.L Travers danced to ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
No words for it other than BEAUTIFUL,"This has been my favorite movie for over three years now and I cannot even begin to describe how much I love it. It's hilarious and heartbreaking wrapped into one. It's the literally translation of bittersweet and it has been a comfort to me on many lonely nights. It's about forgiveness, forgiving others and mostly forgiving yourself. It's about letting go of the past and leading a life not dictated by what haunts you. It's about the magic of storytelling, and to me, what Disney is all about.""That's what we storytellers do, we instill hope again and again.""As someone who has idolized Walt Disney and been a huge fan of the history of Walt since seventh grade, I know that there are some fibs here and there, trust me. It's true that it shouldn't be used as a source of research, but let me be very clear when I say that SOME REALLY QUITE HARMLESS LIES DO NOT MAKE THE MOVIE DISHONEST OR BAD. IGNORE ALL THE REVIEWS SAYING THAT SINCE IT IS NOT 100% ACCURATE IT IS BAD.please do yourself a favor and watch this movie, I don't know how else to put it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
so disappointed Dsney should be ashamed,"I took my daughter to see this movie thinking it, being a good choice to lighten a sad week after loosing her stepmother. So sad that Disney couldn't just let you know the mother died. I don't think that kids of any age should have to deal with suicide during a Disney film. Thank you Disney for destroying the faith that I have had over the last 54 years that you could make a sad time a bit more bearable. We had to leave the movie and my daughter cried all the way home. Thank God she is a young adult. I would have hated myself should I have taken my daughters half sister, the daughter of the deceased. Poor poor choice Disney",,Anonymous,Biography
The foundation of Disney dreams,"Fascinating story and performed well by all the actors involved. So the story wasn't totally accurate, but it never said it was either. Sad in some parts and always engaging. It will pull on the heart strings of many dads out there, including my own. It's great to get and insight on what went on behind making some of the most iconic movies of all time. Tom hanks proves once again that he can put his hand to any type of character and bring out the best in them. As does Colin Farrell and the brilliant Emma Thomson even though I believe the producers first wanted Meryl Streep to play P.L Travers. Meryl is amazing but I think Emma done a fantastic job with the very sad character. I will have to give Mary Poppins another watch now.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks & Thompson marvellous,"The true story of Walt Disney working with PL Travers (the extremely fussy and headstrong author of Mary Poppins) to create a screenplay for her novel.Tom Hanks is very charismatic as Disney and Emma Thompson is fascinating as Travers.

Saving Mrs P.S Travers,"...or ""uncovering Mary Poppins"" would perhaps be a more appropriate title for this great film. If nothing else, this would certainly be much better than the stupid and totally irrelevant one the film had in my country ( ""The magic umbrella"") associating in a most naive and superficial way this touching psychological drama with W. Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Perhaps that's why i did not care to watch it till yesterday, thinking that i have had enough of magic umbrellas in my childhood. I never thought that the film had nothing to do with ""Mary Poppins"" as a fairy tale and her magic umbrella itself, but it was instead focusing on uncovering the real drama that inspired the good witch's story. In this movie we actually watch two,at first glance irrelevant to each other, stories. One that took place in the beginning of last century in Australia and one that takes place in the beginning of the -60's when Mrs Travers, the author of ""Mary Poppins"" tries to come in terms with W. Disney about how the book would be transformed into a movie. Though it's difficult to understand at the very beginning why she is so unbearably stubborn and insisting on how the characters of the book would be shown and illustrated in the film and overall about the film itself, soon, as her own life's story unfolds making clear what her fairy-tale's characters really represent, her attitude and her almost repulsive behavior become more understandable and she herself more likable and compassionable. After all for many of us our childhood's demons are still a part of our life, consciously or subconsciously controlling and influencing our personalities and we all have a Mr Banks or an Elias Disney (Walt's ""demon"") to save/make up with, don't we? The film is really good and exciting to watch. Perhaps the excellent revival of the sixties and its characters contribute a lot to this. And of course the revival of these characters through the great performances of -my beloved- Emma Tomson in a ""contra role""-that is to say a role we are not used to seeing her in- as a typical aging English shrew, as well as that of Tom Hanks (great as Walt Disney) and the rest of the cast, make this revival absolutely convincing. In Brief, ""saving Mr. Banks"" is a really good, truthfully tender and touching film which does deserve your attention!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Close to the book,"I grew up in Soviet Ukraine and my first encounter with Mary Poppins was through 1983 Russian movie. Still I liked book - the original - much better. When I moved to the US I was really anxious to see the Disney Mary Poppins movie. When I did I was disappointed, almost let down. To start with, this minuscule character Bert - why is he given such huge part in the movie? Then, where are Neleus, Miss Andrews, talking dogs and babies? SO much had been left out. The movie 'Saving Mr. Banks' is very good and Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are very good in it, But between you and I, the 1963 movie is not even 10% as good as the book. P.L.Travers is indignant the whole film, and sometimes I began hating her for that, but she is so right and every bit justified in her indignation. BTW, she continued hating the film, despite the release of the rights to charming and very persistent Mr. Disney. In my opinion, the book is better fitted to be turned into a mini-series, each episode showcasing another aspect of MP's awesomeness and magic. Hopefully some day they will make those mini-series and do the great magical book justice.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Big Disappointment,"Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson...how can it miss?It did.Performances were first rate, especially Ms. Thompson. How CAN that woman play such a frumpy and unpleasant character and still be so beautiful and desirable? The woman is an artist. That wasn't the problem. Hanks was adequate and nothing more.The story spent WAY too much time on the deeply depressing relationship between Ms. Travers and her father and WAY too little time on the relationship between her, Disney, and Disney's team. The movie is frankly a downer, BIG time.I can't recommend it. Sensitive people and those prone to depression NEED to avoid it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pondering Into the Disney Legacy,"Following three years since its release, I can't help but express how thought-provoking Saving Mr. Banks turned out since the day I first watched it on opening night. The 1960s became one of the last prominent moments in Uncle Walt's lifetime that he witnessed before he passed away, but it's really about how one movie almost never came to be. About how the Mouse met the Magical Nanny.The story follows P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the renowned author of the Mary Poppins books. In 1961, when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) asks for her to fly to America to meet her personally about his film adaptation of her book, she reluctantly accepts to meeting him. Despite her tragic and bitter past life that greatly dictated her present self, Travers learns from Walt's experience that it doesn't have to be that way and what really matters is letting go and keep moving forward.Director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side) definitely showed the tribulations and conflicts Travers had when overseeing the production of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins adaptation. It may have gotten off to a troubling start with her not being open to how each character in her book should be portrayed as well as showing disdain on a few songs, even the animation that Walt wanted to include, but upon seeing the progress of where the direction was going, there were signs that she was beginning to warm up to it. I loved how a few scenes began to jump ahead back and forth on a recurring basis between glimpses of her childhood and then into how that reflected onto her books.Tom Hanks' take on Walt was pretty uncanny in how he segued into sounding like him and Emma Thompson's portrayal as P.L. Travers showed angst and bittersweetness, yet is misunderstood as a troubled individual that had a rough childhood. I was also left in awe on how in one scene Disneyland was shown as it once looked in the 60s. Looked pretty nifty as though you've traveled back in time. Overall, it's a dramatic and tense element deep beneath the inner workings of light-hearted Disney.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Brilliant,Brilliant and Brilliant Again","Oh brother, what a movie! What meaning! What class! What acting, especially on the part of Emma Thompson who SHOULD win the Best Actress Oscar, hands down. Have you seen ""Poppins"" in the movies or on the stage? I saw both and fell in love with this delightful story based on imagination but seducing in reality. This film will most definitely seduce the duce out of you. It's heartwarming, sensitive and charming. I don't care if someone's 7 or 75, the story of ""Mary Poppins""will get into his/her soul and stay there. How wonderful is the human mind whose imagination is so powerful,it captivates the world. And Mr. Disney knew Miss Travers's imagination would do exactly that and refused to give up despite the aggravation the lady caused him and his staff. I'm so happy that Walt refused to let go until he got what he wanted because by doing so,he changed us for the better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An exemplary example of the complications of creation and collaboration.,"P.L. Travers: No, no, no, no, no! ""Responstible"" is not a word! Richard Sherman: We made it up. P.L. Travers: Well, un-make it up. Richard Sherman: quickly hides sheet music to ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.""1964's Mary Poppins was as iconic as a film could get: its quirky songs were hummable, its language inventive(""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious""--You get the idea), and the spirit of P.L. Travers' original work was enhanced through those songs and the ineffable magic of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks). Saving Mr. Banks chronicles Walt's 20 year courtship of the stodgy Brit author (Emma Thompson) for rights to the film.Of course, the film is partly a promotion of ""the happiest place on earth,"" (Disneyland) and partly a syrupy paean to the Disney goodness concept; however it is also a seemingly honest depiction of the difficulty Walt had convincing the conservative Travers to sign over the film rights. Half the fun is watching the songwriting brothers Sherman, playfully played by B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman, try to convince Travers (who had final say) that a spoonful of catchy tunes could translate her beloved Mary Poppins to the screen.As director, John Lee Hancock assuredly navigates between Travers' hard life in Australia and the travails of creating a film, Saving Mr. Banks is as much about the challenges of creating popular art as it is about the challenges of bringing an author to deal with her work on film. Or more to the point, to deal with the memory of her charismatic, poetic, alcoholic father, whom Disney astutely, albeit late, sees as the center of Travers' ambivalence about giving her creation over to Disney.No matter the accuracy of this version, when the author has the power to sign over rights or not, the producers' role is challenging and frustrating. Walt does not give up even if he has been at it for 20 years, and the film successfully shows why Disney is arguably the most powerful name in cinema.To the film's credit, Travers remains a crusty Brit to the end, no Hollywoodized version of a convert to Disney Studio's sweetness, and Walt is as I remembered him: avuncular and determined to bring happiness and goodness to the world, especially children, through art. See this film to get the challenges of popular art and the supremacy of goodness and a belief in something like a miraculous nanny.",,Anonymous,Biography
"After all, Disneyland is make-believe.","Saving Mr. Banks reminded me, strangely enough, of The Buddy Holly Story. It was a carefully crafted, thoughtful, entertaining, at-times heartbreaking story, with engaging performers breathing life into people who are long gone. It was well worth the time expended, and I'm better off for watching it.Unfortunately, it, like TBHS, has very little to do with what really happened when P. L. Travers and Walt Disney crossed paths. I read about Buddy Holly, and that excellent film, with Gary Busey honoring Holly while reinventing his vocals, is one of my favorites, made all the better because it was made in the late 1970s, when crap was king in movieland.Saving Mr. Banks, to its credit, has several layers.Psychology, addiction, self-loathing, honesty, and deceit. At times the viewer squirms at the painful stuff on-screen, and other times, it's fascinating watching Walt Disney hammer out, then lose, then (repeat to exasperation), an agreement with Travers.I never once believed Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, but Hanks is so likable, you just nod and smile at Tom with his slicked-back toupee and dinky mustache.I remember Emma Thompson, a naturally lovely woman, playing Nanny McPhee, a twisted sort of Mary Poppins. Here, she is the progenitor of Poppins, and she is a fresh breath of infuriating.So, I say watch Saving Mr. Banks, enjoy the nice people, gasp at Colin Ferrell's self-destruction, recognize Australia as just outside LA, and don't read how the screenwriters created an entertaining and thoughtful fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Quite Remarkable,"Author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) reflects on her childhood after reluctantly meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who seeks to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen.There were things about this film that I thought were a bit much. Mostly, the attempt to connect Travers' childhood with her later writing and such. There is no doubt that she took her name from her father, but I am not at all convinced that he inspired her as much as the film suggests. As near as I can tell, she was only 5 years old when he died and probably had few or no memories of the man.That being said, I thought the performances were good and really brought be back to what it may have been like to work with Walt Disney in the 1960s. At first I was not convinced that Tom Hanks could be Disney, but I soon warmed up to it. In fact, I think he was better at Disney than he was for the role of Captain Phillips.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Old-Fashioned Tear-Jerker,"This film recounts the story of how the 1964 Disney classic film ""Mary Poppins"" came to be. Author P.L. Travers was adamant in keeping her precious character Mary away from Hollywood until rough financial times force her to concede. But, she would not make it easy for the man who wants the movie made, even if he was Walt Disney himself.Emma Thompson plays the bitter curmudgeon P.L. Travers so well, like it was second nature. We see her literally giving Mr. Disney a hard time (like, how can you make a film without the color red?), yet we completely see where she is coming from. She plays someone so unpleasant, yet we will still be charmed.Tom Hanks is too much a superstar with a distinct look to completely disappear into another iconic Hollywood figure Walt Disney. However, if you see beyond the actor, Hanks captured the essence of the man Disney - - his joie de vivre, his passion, his optimism.Colin Farrell plays the flawed father of Travers whose life and death haunted his daughter her whole life. Farrell comes up with a rare, deep and sensitive performance that we have never seen from him before.Fans of ""Mary Poppins"" will surely enjoy this look back at the process of how the movie and those wonderful songs were made. This is an good, old-fashioned film that will truly move even the hardest of hearts.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good,"Quickly rushed into production but still solid thanks to Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is good when he is bad and good when he is good. It's worth watching this movie just to see Tom Hanks. Other thank Tom Hanks, the real centerpiece of the film is its acting; three performances in particular stick out. The movie is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them, just as I can accept Tom Hanks.

Paul Giamatti assumes the life and soul of a character.,"The jewel in Disney's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is Paul Giamatti in the quiet, efficient role of Mrs. Travers' limousine driver. You may not put face to name at first but you know you are watching a premier actor assume the life and soul of his character. Emma Thompson and Tom Hank are a delight playing off each other in this half real and half fiction approach to story telling of the making of ""Mary Poppins"" in the 1960s. As a movie experience, the film holds your attention even though it offers little insight to what really happened in the wonderful world of make believe. The story weaves in and out of the of the minds of the great children story writer, P.T. Travers, and the indomitable Mr. Disney.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Testament of two giants,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a biographical drama film directed by John Lee Hancock that tells the story of the production of ""Mary Poppins"" by Walt Disney, and his struggle to obtain the rights to the book from the author, P. L. Travers. The film is a captivating exploration of the shrewd nature of Walt Disney and the stubbornness of Mrs. P. L. Travers, who are both played to perfection by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson.Tom Hanks portrays Walt Disney as a charismatic and persistent businessman who knows exactly how to get what he wants. He uses his charm and wit to convince Mrs. Travers to sign over the rights to ""Mary Poppins,"" despite her initial resistance. His character is depicted as someone who is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals, even if it means going behind Mrs. Travers' back and making changes to the story without her permission.Emma Thompson, on the other hand, plays Mrs. Travers as a stubborn and difficult woman who is fiercely protective of her creation. She is portrayed as someone who is unwilling to compromise on any aspect of the story and is resistant to the changes that Walt Disney wants to make. However, as the film progresses, we learn more about her backstory and the reasons behind her stubbornness, which makes her character more sympathetic.The chemistry between Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson is one of the highlights of the film. Their interactions are witty, intense, and often humorous, which makes for an engaging and entertaining experience. The film also beautifully captures the nostalgia and magic of ""Mary Poppins,"" with flashbacks to Mrs. Travers' childhood in Australia, which inspired the creation of the beloved character.Overall, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a well-crafted film that provides a fascinating insight into the making of ""Mary Poppins."" It is a testament to the shrewd nature of Walt Disney and the stubbornness of Mrs. P. L. Travers, and the actors bring these characters to life in a way that is both entertaining and compelling. If you are a fan of the original ""Mary Poppins,"" this film is a must-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Bit Slow At Times,"I am torn on Saving Mr. Banks. I don't know if A. I like it B. I hate it or C. Meh (more than likely C). Sadly, I did not enjoy Tom Hanks as Walt. I like to believe I know a good amount of history on Disney/Walt, so I was excited to watch this film for that reason. On a historic stand point, I really enjoyed the film. From Walt's infamous throat clear to the the images of the Burbank studios, it's defiantly based in Disney history. At points, I thought the film dragged on a little and painted a pretty rough image of P.L. Travers. I am glad I watched Saving Mr. Banks, to better understand some more Disney/Marry Poppins history, but one watch is enough for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect in every way,"""Winds in the east, mist coming in. Like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store. But I fear what's to happen, all happened before."" We hear the these iconic words over the first notes of the first song from Mary Poppins, and as the camera panned through the clouds (just like in ""Mary Poppins""), I began to grin. And, between a few tears, that grin stayed on my face until the very end. I have never in my life fallen in love with a movie so quickly. For those of you unfamiliar with the plot, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is about the ""Mary Poppins"" author P.L. Travers, played here by Emma Thompson in a brilliant performance. It is about her childhood, her inspiration, and her difficulties as an adult with her haunting memories of an alcoholic father. She published her famous children's' novel in the 1934 and 30 years later was released as a movie. What audiences of that time did not know, was the struggles it took for that to happen. Walt Disney was adamant that he wanted the rights, but Mrs. Travers simply refused to give them to him. For 20 years, he pushed and for 20 years, she denied. There are a select few movies that cannot be described in words. My favorite movie, the 2012 musical adaptation of ""Les Miserables"" is one. ""The Mosquito Coast"" is another. The power of these films is something that needs to be experienced, not told, but I am giving my best effort here. Every single performance is a gem. Emma Thompson is incredible. I honestly can say I have never seen a a more convincing portrayal of a real human being than hers. Tom Hanks does not look or sound like Walt Disney, but he captures his charisma and spirit perfectly. Very similar to Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock last year. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are delightful as the Sherman Brothers and it gives me real comfort in knowing that Robert Sherman himself (Jason Schwartzman's character) was on set ensuring that the story be told right and the performances be accurate. Ralph Giamatti is a subtle wonder as the very American chauffeur. But I have perhaps saved the best for last. Colin Farrell portrays his character so accurately that it is almost painful to watch. Disney Studios has done a horrible job marketing this movie because, contrary to what the commercials imply, it is NOT a family movie. If you want a family movie, watch ""Mary Poppins"". The themes are so mature and powerful here, a child would not enjoy or understand this movie at all. However, for those of us who have grown up with ""Mary Poppins"", this movie is beyond anything I could possibly say. The transitions between Travers' childhood in Australia, and the present in Los Angeles were so smooth you never felt you were taken out of either story, as is sometimes the fault with that idea. The script is excellent. So many beautiful monologues and quotes, I couldn't even count. The music is excellent. Thomas Newman's score very much captures the style and essence of the 60's while slipping in bits of the ""Mary Poppins"" repertoire, all in all making it practically perfect in every way. Also, what I found particularly effective, was their use of a few ""Mary Poppins"" scenes. I am so thankful Disney Studios made this film because they have the rights to the original material and used it well and sparingly. One of the best films of the year and of all time. Every expectation and hope I had was completely blown out of the water and topped, a feat which I thought impossible, because I set the bar very very high. I could go on, but it seems to be time for my evening tea. Milk in first.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice amusing film,"This story of the discords between Pamela L. Travers the author of novel ""Mary Poppins"" and Walt Disney about the adaptation of it to the cinema is shown in a vivid succession of sequences going to and fro between Austrália in 1906 and London / Los Angeles in 1961 in constant flashbacks to show us how Mrs. Travers (like she always demands to be called against any familiarities) had a traumatic childhood mainly because of her father alcoholic behaviour despite the fact that they loved each other deeply. This explains her disagreeable and sometimes rude behaviour and way of treating other people. We don't know if this movie respects the truthfulness of what happened in fact concerning her relationship with Walt Disney and his collaborators while preparing the movie and that was full of disagreements. Anyway a work of art even when biographic doesn't need to respect truth in every detail and can use fancy to enhance it aesthetically providing it does not wrest the central meaning of the reality that happened in fact. Although some scenes are a bit caricatural the movie in its whole is totally acceptable and Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks do a wonderful job as the two main characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saving Mr. Banks was an absolute joy and brought tears to my eyes,"Christmas day with my beautiful daughter, we enjoyed the local movie house at the Pacific Commons shopping center in South Fremont, California.Saving Mr. Banks was a must. I loved Mary Poppins as a child and when my brother and I were young we watched this movie together at the movie theatre and we enjoyed it so much. I remember the laughs of joy we had out loud in the movie theatre with this movie. It remains a favorite child hood memory.Watching Saving Mr. Banks with my daughter was so fun. It took me back to the one day my brother and I enjoyed Mary Poppins. I shared this movie with my children when they were young with video and television at home.I learned something about Walt Disney I never knew before about his child hood up bringing. I learned the parallel of Giddy's child hood special memories of her past.This movie shows the sensitivity Walt Disney had and the compassion to reach his objectives. The man was brilliant in how he reads into the meaning and the story behind Mary Poppins. His humble and gentleman ambition to help Giddy see her drive for the real Mary Poppins to be just right as the image in her mind and heart. His incredible skills in communication and foresight with vision for yesterday, today, and tomorrow. He caught my heart. Tom Hanks is a natural for all things super and fabulous. I love Tom Hanks is a unique character in all his trade.Mary Poppins, Emma has beautiful blue eyes so expressive. Her love for her family and her father. The story is gripping, it had my heart.Giddy grows into a very talented artist, and so elegant and proper with all her success. Saving Mr. Banks saves Giddy and a new partnership with Walt Disney.Another favorite character is the limo driver me in this movie.

Fine time at the big screen,"The struggle to bring Mary Poppins to the big screen. Visionary Walt Disney tries to convince the author to sell him the rights to the book but for 20 years she refuses. Finally, and when forced by financial difficulties she flies to LA to explore options about how could this work out.Much of the movie is a clash of two worlds with 'Mary Poppins' being the battlefield. The conservative British woman (who is actually Australian) cannot relate to the happy clappy Los Angeles culture they try to convey on the film and remains adamant that it is best that the book does not become film.Then again, she has to come up against the larger than life bon viveur that is Walt Disney. His patience, perseverance and tolerance of her eccentricities will prove a very formidable foe in this battle for rights.Although a feel good movie, I can forgive it purely because it cast Tom Hanks. Two vastly different but equally delightful character make this the heart warmer one needs in this time of year and the best thing about it is that you do not have to take sides; both are very lovable.Intelligent and witty it brought Mary Poppins to life in an innovative way.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow. Just wow.,"I am amazed by this. I clicked on this just because I needed something to watch and it was on my watchlist. I wasn't really aware what it was about I just knew it had good actors and it had to do with Walt Disney. I started watching it and couldn't stop. I mean I didn't want to stop...I had to pause here and there to do things around the house but man! It was super difficult.
Once I got to the end, I cried. It's such a heartbreaking movie, really. The music and the story behind it. Now I completely understand the name ""Saving Mr Banks"". I'm telling you it's so good. I 100% recommend especially if you are a Marry Poppins fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sentimentalized Biopic, but Affecting Nonetheless","SAVING MR. BANKS tells the story of when author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) went to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) about negotiating the film rights to MARY POPPINS. As she negotiates - often fruitlessly - with Disney's creative team, her mind flashes back to her childhood in Australia. Through such flashbacks we learn the extent to which MARY POPPINS is based on her autobiographical experiences. Thompson's performance is a memorable one; her reactions to Disney's idealized world are classic, especially when she repeats the words ""No! No! No!"" in tones that recall Margaret Rutherford. She is also vulnerable in an alien world, which pushes her towards a friendship with her driver Ralph (Paul Giametti). Hanks' Disney comes across as an avuncular personality with a penchant for getting what he wants, but not without a considerable degree of understanding. The portrait is an idealized one (apparently Disney was much more ruthless, and did not really get on with Travers at all), but works well within the overall film. There are sentimental moments, but the ending is particularly affecting, when the film juxtaposes clips from the 1964 version of MARY POPPINS with Travers' and Disney's reaction, as they watch the premiere in Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saving Mr Banks: The inspiring truth behind our beloved global nanny,"Mary Poppins is indisputably a cinematic icon which has captivated the imagination, the childhood and hearts of millions of children worldwide. Saving Mr Banks now gives you a front row seat in an emotively gripping insight of the true story behind the genesis of such a global treasure.The premise of the film is the strenuous attempt of Disney to acquire legal rights from P. L. Travers (the original author of the 1934 book) in order to produce the cinematic adaptation of her book. Travis, however, is resilient against such an acquisition due to her impression of what the book will become in the hands of the movie giant.The emotive core of the film revolves around the hostile resistance of the unashamedly stubborn, British, attitude of Mrs Travers (Emma Thompson), juxtaposed to the unequivocal persistence and creative energy of the Disney team headed by Walt Disney himself (Tom Hanks). This relationship in turn relates to the childhood of Mrs Travers, specifically the relationship with her father.The scripting was elegant throughout and short of a few stereotypically clichéd 'Disney moments' I felt the interplay created through the collision of characters lead to a compellingly complex, dynamic and in parts intentionally distressing dialogue progression. Indeed through this dialogue the audience find themselves unravelling the profound genius and cutting realities which dictated the life and writing of Mrs Travers, and the poetic decorum of Walt Disney.Quality casting of the major characters helped construct the solid bedrock for the success of the film with both Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks portraying their characters masterfully with their effortless charm and charisma. The leading pair were unquestionably aided with strong performances from Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson (the father and mother of the young Mrs Travers respectfully), B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman (the Sherman Brothers), to name but a few.John Lee Hancock's directing skills were apparent with consistently well shot, beautiful scenes, authentic to the societal and architectural language of the times. I would have been intrigued to see more of the film studios and methods of film production, as Disney's work was revolutionary. However I accept this may have diverted from the main drive of the film which was emotional rather than educational.In summary Saving Mr Banks is an all age appealing example of emotive expression through cinematic performance which carries an intrinsic energy created through the humble truth of the plot, blended with a consistent, subtle comedic edge interspersed throughout. It is Disney doing what Disney does best, instilling imagination into the minds of the audience, an art they seem to have perfected.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
You are the only American I have ever liked!,"I must hand it to Disney Studios! They managed to fool me for a while with this film! To begin with, it felt like a sincere and sensitive story concerning the making of a Mary Poppins based film by Walt Disney. The author P.L.Travers was portrayed as a stiff lipped Brit. Her main fictional character was a magical nanny and yet somehow, she seemed to be set against the movie being made as an animation or a musical film. It seemed that Walt Disney and his people had to manage the difficult and unyielding attitude of 'Mrs. Travers'. Thankfully, she wasn't portrayed as a totally boring person and had some absolutely hilarious insults up her sleeves; the kind which are funny provided you are not at the receiving end. So, all in all, this felt like a movie with some heart.However, this is not a perfect film. My first problem with the movie is of course the lies and misrepresentation of a lot of facts & events. I always find that off-putting in a movie, especially when even without reading up any history about it, I can figure out the lies all by myself during the watching of the film. This is lazy lying! If you want to lie to the viewers, at least work harder so that unless they do a background check, they can still believe it! My other gripe is that the characterization of Mrs. Travers was a bit too heavy handed and that of Disney a bit too generous. The latter was to expected since it's a Disney film. What I found more disturbing was that after a certain point, the meanness and sarcasm of Travers felt a bit too forced even though the creators tried to justify it by telling the story of a very sad childhood. A difficult childhood does not justify rudeness with honest and hardworking people who are simply doing their job.The film does raise an important point though. Which is better; truth or fantasy and well-intentioned lies? I'm not much for the fantasy genre, where everything gets taken care of through magic. I believe that even if life is harsh, children deserve to know the truth as much as the adults because that's the only thing that would prepare them for any future misfortunes. However, I also believe that children must be taught not to let themselves become too cynical. They must have a bit of fun now and then. This might enable them to deal with the vicissitudes of life better. So truth and detachment are both necessary tools for our survival kit; tools that adults need as much as children.So, despite its shortcomings, the movie did give me food for thought since once again I watched life from two entirely different points-of-view. For this reason and because it reminded me not to be too cynical, I'm glad I watched it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
As true to life as Mickey Mouse,"I normally avoid ""based on a true story"" or ""historical"" movies like the plaque. It is one of life's great enigmas that a movie ""based on a true story"" is generally more fictional than a movie based on a fictional work. In the later, by definition, everything about the fictional work is documented, in writing, 100%, and there can be absolutely no debate as to whether a movie is accurate or not to its source. On the other hand, a movie based on a true story may well be 98% fictional and no-one can prove if it's right or wrong. Basically, with a historical movie, the world is the screen-writer's oyster.In the case of Saving Mr Banks we have a small number of historical facts. Walt Disney existed. PL Travers existed. PL Travers wrote a book. Walt Disney filmed it. The rest is pretty much pure conjecture. We might speculate that PL Travers was a difficult woman, and that maybe her childhood was the basis of her books, but frankly that is anyone's guess.Anyway, onto the movie itself. There are a few good things about it. I was pleasantly surprised by Tom Hanks, who normally plays Tom Hanks and in all of his movies I have seen has not been called upon to do anything else. I liked the very subtle nuance of his accent, and his understated performance. Emma Thompson is annoying in most things she does, so it's a lucky break she gets to play an annoying character here. Paul Giamatti is a delight playing the only character with any warmth, depth and humanity - the irony here is that his character, the only one that seems ""real"" and sincere, is entirely fictional.Really it's not much of a story, much ado about nothing. The back story about PL Travers childhood in Australia is a load of cobblers, a truckload of clichés and flights of fantasy piled on with a Caterpillar bulldozer. Take the mother's attempted ""suicide"" for instance. For reasons which are difficult to fathom, PL Traver's character, who one minute is 10 feet behind her mother, finds it necessary to go back and get her horse to follow her mother to the river. And what mother drags her child into the river. I mean, give us a break. And as for PL Travers magically coming out singing and dancing during ""Let's go fly a kite"", Heaven spare us.To its credit I watched this movie to the end despite its many flaws, not so much because of the nominal ""story"" but in spite of it. In hindsight the reason I persisted is that it recreates a time in American history when things were simpler and when Disney created fantasies, for better or for worse, a time I am old enough to recognise. It is really only in this respect that the movie is historically accurate and kudos to the makers for at least getting that right. I also enjoyed relearning about the Sherman brothers, who, let's face it, contributed more to mankind than PL Travers ever did, and are surely candidates for the basis of a far more interesting movie than this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty emotional,"I have to start off by saying that I haven't seen Mary Poppins. And really, it's not needed. I thought on a purely emotional level, the film works quite well. The problem is that so many of the childhood/past scenes come off overly sentimental and are not that interesting. It's all so obvious in their execution. The scenes with an older Travis fare much, much better, and much of it is due to Thompson. She's the living heart of this, she's a little hard to take at first (the character as intended, of course) but Thompson plays this character so incredibly well. It's truly an amazing performance through and through, I just wish the film was more consistent. And I'm not a huge fan of Newman's score here, or rather, how it was used.",,Anonymous,Biography

How could she not want one of the world's greatest filmmakers to adapt her work? If I wrote a book and Disney asked me to let him adapt it, I would say yes right away!But SMB made me understand and sympathize with her reason. That's something you'll have to see the movie for.I believe that Mary Poppins is the best movie Disney produced in his lifetime.

To this we have flashbacks to the Mrs Travers family life in Australia and that of her bank manager father and his drink problem.We also have Walt Disney whose children loved the book Mary Poppins, trying to obtain film rights by using his charm and guile.Maybe Tom Hanks is maybe a bit too winning and charming as Disney, a man who had a bit of a dark side. In real life Walt Disney had little time for Mrs Travers.Emma Thompson nails Mrs Travers as the difficult to get on with author, desperately in need of money but reluctant to let go of her book.The film also has good acting turns from Paul Giamatti and Jason Schwartzman.

The East Wind,"Greetings again from the darkness. Surely it's a coincidence that Disney Studios has released this movie just a few months ahead of the 50th anniversary of the classic Mary Poppins film. Regardless of the promotional angle, the story of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) going all out to woo stuffy Brit writer PL Travers (Emma Thompson)actually turns out to be a well made and pretty interesting story of two stubborn people butting heads. Even better is a behind the scenes glimpse of the creative process of bringing the Travers book(s) to the big screen.Director John Lee Hancock is the perfect fit with his track record of glossy, feel-good, inspired by true life stories with The Blind Side and The Rookie. We never lose sight that this is a Disney production of a Disney story. The only Disney blemish shown is a quick shot of him stubbing a cigarette in an ashtray. Mr. Disney was an expert at hiding his smoking habit from the public ... well at least until he died from lung cancer in 1966, a mere two years after the premiere of Mary Poppins. Mostly Walt is depicted as working diligently to provide the trust and security that Travers sought in protecting her most precious flying nanny.The real star here is Emma Thompson's portrayal of Travers. Her desperate need for money is mentioned once, but the story is more concerned with her innate need to protect the legacy of her story ... no animation, no mean Mr Banks, no Dick Van Dyke, and no silly songs. Watching her interact with the songwriting Sherman brothers (Jason Schwartzman, BJ Novak) and the Disney screenwriter played by Bradley Whitford is the most fun this movie has to offer. Her ""no, no, no"" mindset is quite frustrating for the quite successful Disney creative team. The armchair psychology is really where the movie falters a bit. Watching Walt struggle to mesmerize Travers with his Disney magic feels a bit forced, and when combined with numerous flashbacks to her childhood leave the audience way ahead of figuring out the key to her heart and mind.Once the daddy issues come to light, we get Hanks' best scene in the film. As he finally connects with Travers by laying bare his childhood (and fatherly) challenges, he eloquently explains the importance of imagination and storytelling for both children and adults. A desire to re-write or re-imagine our childhood seems to be at the core of many adults. It seems many dwell on the negative aspects of childhood, and even here, Travers' dad (Colin Farrell) may be the nicest alcoholic who ever inspired their kid to be a writer.PL Travers (born Helen Lyndon Goff) wrote 8 Mary Poppins books between 1934 and 1988, but was so unhappy with the film version that she never agreed to a sequel and it wasn't until the 1990's when she agreed to a stage version (no Americans allowed!). She passed away in 1996 at the age of 96, and the actual recordings played over the closing credits show just how well Ms. Thompson captured the strong will of the author.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Spare me the pleasantries,"This was, no question about it, a beautifully made film. Two hours and ten minutes of great acting from all involved. Emma Thompson was brilliant in the role of the obnoxious stuck up old Brit who is really a very sad old Aussie. But then again, it was to be expected; maybe they should make a prize above the Oscars for people that we know are Oscar material and need to go further still. Tom Hanks, an old version of him, is perfect for the role of the gallant Walt Disney, while Colin Farrell plays the role of the drunken dad. Perhaps the Irish actor he should steer away from drunken roles; we all know how Hollywood casting holes are.There is a however, however. The story felt too much like Driving Miss Daisy - you know, old grumpy woman that has a good heart and a story, resilient driver, people that make the effort to ""get her"", etc - and I don't know Mr. Disney, but could he have been so nice? It is a story about the weird interaction of interesting and famous people, one that explains, it's true, the creation of a real movie: the Mary Poppins musical movie starring Julie Andrews. But it felt quite a bit fake, I have to tell you.It is noteworthy to say that the film was based on a biography of Travers that also prompted two documentaries that I have not seen. Perhaps more of the truth would lie there, but even from the Wikipedia page for the film I can see that things were not quite like in Saving Mr. Banks.Bottom line: well played, well created, but ultimately a good actor extravaganza on a ""making of"" story of an acclaimed American movie.

Just beautiful.,"I am writing this with a blocked nose and tears still in my eyes! What an absolutely wonderful film, one I think is in the top 5 films of 2013. Absolutely beautiful. It moved me so much. What really stuck with me was that Helen seemed scared of losing her father saying ""don't leave me"" and I think we all have that fear of losing someone dear to us.As far as the story goes, seeing as its based on a true story I can't really say much on that other than it was truly inspiring and moving. I loved the way you saw snippets of her childhood and how it affected her in the modern scenes.Cast were absolutely top class. Emma Thompson was simply exquisite as Mrs Travis/Helen. She just blew me away in that role. Her cinema scene was so touching. And when she reverted to childish way such as building a band stand out of leaves it was so endearing. She captured her prudeness and how stubborn she was and then slowly developed her heart into a much more open and warm one. Tom Hanks was just how I would imagine Walt Disney. He was pleasant, wise and charming. I liked how Tom Hanks drew in Walt's last years with the coughing. Disney was a chain smoker all his adult life and died in '66. Colin Farrel as her father was brilliant, one of the best roles I have seen him in. He was brilliant. Her and her father riding on the horse was such a beautiful scene. Paul Giamatti as her driver was great, I think he was the key to Helen changing her ways. He was great. All the actors and actresses were wonderful.I think, for me, the acting was the thing that made the film. Wonderful acting from everyone. It just made the film the emotional roller coaster it was.

Mary Poppins for saving Mr. Banks.,"During the trailers one would see Saving Mr. Banks as a biopic solely depicting the production challenges of beloved Mary Poppins that occurred due to the lasting friction between Disney and Popping's creator P.L Travers. But Honestly, it isn't just about that. Yes, maybe the backdrop is, but Saving Mr. Banks in a subtle way is largely talking about the price an author or for that matter any creative person has to pay in order to bring a masterpiece to life that touches millions. Saving Mr. Banks is very simple in narrative deals. It efficiently depicts the insecurities of the author for whom Mary Popins was not just a book that she created but family. It all justifies her reasons for keeping Disney on hook for 20 years from producing it.Saving Mr. Banks is largely about a lot of phases from Traver's life condensed into a 2 hr package, gelling up perfectly into a smooth screenplay with a hint of old Hollywood. Backed by a very strong performer Emma Thomson, Saving Mr. Banks has given a vivid picture of PL Travers, reaching the end of Middle age but who is still a hurt little girl by heart. Tom Hanks looks clean in his act, if not memorable. I am surprised the Oscars did not save a nomination seat for Emma Thomson, that is one resentment. Saving Mr. Banks has great comic timing, it is funny and dramatic in the same sequence that makes it realistic enough for the audience. In the end, it is first a movie for creative minds who understand the pain and challenges that inspire their work. It is a movie for people who love biopics, who are ready for unconventional story telling material. It is a great family movie and above all, it is a flick that brings a smile and tear at the same time. GO for it. 3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

'Don't you ever stop dreaming. You can be anyone you want to be.',"The cinematic version of story of PL Travers' book-into-film that was to become Walt Disney's Mary Poppins, written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and directed by John lee Hancock, is light and fluffy and fun – and a bit too long. It boasts a fine cast and for the most part is credible.The plot has been described as follows: 'When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.'Emma Thompson offers a fine caricature of PJ Travers, Tom Hanks is Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, but the credits for stunning performances go to Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson as the parents of Travers as young child.

The attention to detail was spot on. The story itself was fascinating. And there were many unexpected comedic moments to lighten the tension of the unfolding drama. You think that the screenwriters are exaggerating Travers' peculiarities and extreme demands (slight spoiler--at one point she says the picture must be made without the color red, or the whole thing is off!), but no, the writing sessions between Travers and Disney's team were recorded on tape, and one such tape is rolled during the credits.

Worth a Look,"I didn't see Saving Mr. Banks until it came out on Cable TV. I thought it might be a children's movie but it was not. It's the tale of a woman dealing with her past ghosts and how Walt Disney through his determination and perseverance made Mary Poppins come alive in film. The story is touching, seen through the flashbacks of the author life as a child, as she works with Disney's Hollywood team to create a version of the movie she would approve of. We see her first as a cantankerous woman, living a solitary lonely life in need of money to save her house. Through the movie we see her mellow through the process of reconciling her relationship with her loving father by learning to forgive his weaknesses and herself for not being able to save him. We also get a glimpse of the erasable Walt Disney who through his own deficits in his childhood made a world full of fantasy to brighten the lives of children and adults. Through his team and his process he breaks down Mrs. Travers's objections to his creating a musical fantasy out of her book and thus the wonderful movie of Mary Poppins came to life for us all.The team of scriptwriters that put together this tale did a wonderful job. I was truly touched by the story. I also want to give credit to the wonderful acting. I especially loved the little girl who played Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley) she had a wonderful dramatic range, and really took you into her heart. Emma Thompson's skills really get you to like and understand the woman inside PL Travers. Tom Hanks brought a life of wonder to his portrayal of Walt Disney. The twinkle inside of Travers Goff and the tragedy of his inability to deal with the reality of living was played excellently by Colin Farrell. I really liked Paul Giamatti portrayal of Ralph; I only wish they had included his daughter in the day Walt Disney took Pamela to Disney Land as she was the link that allowed Pamela to open up to Ralph. All the acting was great and I know I've left out many of the others actors and actresses that contributed to making this a fine movie just for the sake of space here, they all did a great job. If you didn't catch Saving Mr. Banks in the theater like me, definitely worth seeing it on Cable or Netflix.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

View Saving Mr. Banks.  Enjoy it for what it is—another Walt Disney fairytale.,"Saving Mr. Banks is a nice film: nothing outstanding and nothing inefficacious. It's not much fun either. The anchor that keeps this film from soaring is the inherent conflict in the story. To get permission from Mrs. Travers, Disney has to grant her total creative control over the film. Unfortunately, Mrs. Travers is a prig. Her demons thwart Disney in all phases of preproduction: scripting scenes, musical selections, and art-direction suggestions. She nit picks every detail to a faretheewell. For three examples: no red color in any scene, change the leading man, and no animation—a deal breaker in her contract. What we do not know is how much of this narrative is fiction or how much is factual.Nonetheless, what's maddingly confusing is: why would Walt Disney grant such total creative control to this neurotic person who does not know the difference between ""a sprocket hole and an f-stop"" in motion-picture scripting and production, as it were. Why would he risk millions of dollars and his studio's reputation on such a prodigious gamble with a rank psychotic novice to whom he has to kowtow? It does not make sense, no matter the actual or fictional facts. Accordingly, such a crucial and addlebrained decision by Hollywood's consummate producer cast a pall of doubt over the entire narrative. However, in truth, he'd promised his two daughters that he would produce a film based on Mary Poppins. Accordingly, he was driven by his promise. Notwithstanding, logic and business sense demands that at some point he should have cancelled the project. (Fortunately he did not and Mary Poppins was a great film.)Mrs. Travers' psychotic mien does not engender empathy. We cannot like or identify with her, and without audience empathy, the character is flawed. Perhaps this is a real-life portrayal. Nonetheless, the script could have eased her irrational obstinacy to make her character more empathetic. Occasionally, we see a scene that hints at PL's empathetic humanity: she dances a few steps with Richard Sherman, sits on the grass and chats with her chauffeur, and finally decides to enter the bar at the Beverly Hills hotel—perhaps to order an adult beverage, or to talk with a patron. Alas! She fails on both accounts. She orders tea. And with true cinema-magic, the bartender just happens to have a silver service under the bar and complies with her request.Another key player that drags parts of the film in to a morass of negativism is the alcoholic Travers Goff—PL's father. He loves PL and dotes over her, but in the end embarrasses her. Seemingly, he ignores his wife (who attempts suicide), new-born child, and PL's younger sister. He dies of some unknown reason related to alcoholism. It's here that PL's neurosis is conceived. Clearly, Goff is a flawed character on whom we look askance. No empathy here. Good riddance, we might suggest. For reasons not clear, the fatherless family seems to prosper enough to hire a nanny, Aunt Ellie: PL's Mary Poppins character no doubt.For the record: I checked my atlas and found that the Goff's home in Allora, the ""End of the railroad line,"" is about 120 miles southwest of Brisbane, Queensland. Having spent some time Down Under, I cringed at the scenes of PL and her father frolicking in the bush. This area has a surfeit of highly-venomous reptiles: the Brown, the Tiger, and the Tiapan, for examples.I would suggest that the scenes in Australia are surplus. The film would have more coherence without the frequent crosscutting between ""now"" and ""Australia."" PL's neurosis could have been readily established with other techniques early in the scenario.Other points that puzzle us are:  Answering P L's question, we're told that Robert Sherman was shot. Really? By whom? Why? When? There are no answers. Seems to me this is a key script point. If not, why include it?  PL is an Aussie. Why does she keep it a secret? Most Aussie's I've met are damn proud of their heritage—even those who are the prodigy of the inmates from the former penal colony.  Why does PL use a nom de plume? Her birth name is Helen Goff. Towards the end, Disney, frustrated with PJ's shenanigans, confronts her in her London flat with a cogent analysis of her psychosis, and he concludes with the dictate that she ought to forgive her father. Voila! Pamela Lyndon Travers' demons are excised, Mary Poppins is completed, and is a phenomenal success. This scene stretches credulity: by what chicanery did Walt Disney phantom the details of PJ's childhood? How did Disney garner his psychological skills? Why should Travers accept the analysis from the armature psychologist, Disney?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saving MR Banks,"I have seen a lot of movies in the last few days and Tom Hanks is always a great watch he is the best one of the greats. it was a great look into the life of a Great American Entertainment juggernaut, I enjoyed this film immensely and would see it again any time Great film for the whole family I give it a 10 out of 10 Stars. I had no idea that Mary Poppins was Based on a true story. It is worth a rent from your local Library. God Bless Tom Hanks I look forward to many more years of films starring this awesome actor.

Lovely,"I love watching movies which shows the real events. I watched this movie with lower expectations and I liked the movie. The story was good but I didn't like the changed they did from what really happened in reality, the screenplay was good but uneven by the end, the direction was good and the performances were fabulous. Two things I thought could have been better were pacing and the climax. The pacing was uneven, at some scenes movie was fast and another scene it was too slow. About the climax, it felt rushed to me. After seeing a properly developed story this type of climax felt rushed.Overall, you should give a try to this movie.

Great behind the scenes story,"By 1961 Walt Disney had been pursuing the film rights for the Mary Poppins stories for 20 years. Author P. L. Travers had been reluctant to agree, fearing how her characters will be shown on screen. Facing financial difficulties she is persuaded to travel from London to Los Angeles.Entertaining film and an interesting insight into the making of the original Mary Poppins film. This is thanks in no small part to the performance by Emma Thompson as the abrasive and awkward Travers and Tom Hanks as Disney. A useful companion to the Mary Poppins films.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
You don't need to go fly a kite as this film flies high on its own,"Many of us consider Marry Poppins a classic, one that has endured and still entertains audiences today. Saving Mr Banks takes an interesting look at the author behind Mary Poppins and the film adaption. Not many would be familiar with the background and difficult personality of the author. We also learn the inspiration behind the timeless classic.The film excels in getting you to dislike and maybe even hate Emma Thompson's character, P. L. Travers. She is disagreeable, stubborn and peculiar. Even though she is in need of income to save her home she is not willing to make a deal until all her demands are met. One important demand is the absence of animation which is central to many Disney films. Over the course of the film she warms up to the writers and Walt Disney who write the songs that we all know and love. When she cancels the deal and flies back to the U.K. she is visited again by none other than Walt Disney.We learn that her hopes for the film as in the books were not to save the children but their father which fictitiously based on her father. Mary Poppins was the nanny who saved everything that her real nanny or aunt could not do in her life. She lost her father as shown in her flashbacks. The real reason behind this classic creation endears her to the audience as we are told Mr Banks will be not just be saved he will be honored. While Mary Poppins brought joy to many to many children's lives the author also sought to bring joy and solace to her inner child and fathers memory. Excellent acting from Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Thompson who deliver star performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Absolutely wonderful, a must watch!","Saving Mr. Banks is extraordinary and impeccably ""Disney"". It is charmingly funny, heart touching and a beautiful story giving insights into the creation of Mary Poppins. I was not expecting to like this movie to this extent, but as it progressed I was immersed and completely awe struck. The weaving of the past and present was beautifully executed and brought authenticity to the story also justifying the hardened exterior of Mrs. Travers in the film. As for the characters, Tom Hanks, Collin Farrell and Emma Thompson were marvelous. If anyone could bring Walt Disney's personality to life, it was definitely Tom Hanks in saving Mr. Banks. Although we did not see as much of his personality as we saw Mrs.Travers', I found him to impersonate the role rather well. Even though Mrs. Travers is portrayed to be difficult and unable to be pleased, we continue to love and sympathize with her. We understand her need to project her father positively despite his setbacks. Mrs. Travers loves her father endlessly and in many ways wants so desperately for her real life to have had an alternate ending. When Walt Disney provides this to her through the film, she is relieved and finally pleased. For the first time at the end of the film we see her be able to peacefully come to terms with her past without feeling like she has disappointed her father. At the end of the film we see Mrs. Travers empowered by her emotions as she has finally seen a portrayal of her father in a way that she had always desired and imagined, but in many ways had also been the way she saw him despite his flaws that we see during her troubled childhood. She did not see her father as a cruel man and wanted to conserve her image of him in every way she could. Walt Disney provided her with an alternate and more hopeful ending to her troubles and reality. As a storyteller he attempted to ""restore order with imagination, instilling hope again and again"" (slightly paraphrased). I have not mentioned Mary Poppins at all, as this is the story of how the film came to life. The main focus in this film is mainly on the relationship between Mrs. Travers and her father, between Walt and Mrs. Travers and between Mrs. Travers and the ever so personal and imaginative world created through her book. Mary Poppins is in essence a savior and an idea of hope, a hope that Mrs. Travers/Helen had as a child of saving her father and the very hopefulness that was regained through Disney's film, Mary Poppins. Overall, I absolutely loved this film because of the characters, the story being told and everything about it. I love that the film is about hope and attaining it through imaginative and creative ways. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The glances back and forth from Traver's childhood are so well done. I think all of us can relate to finding a story or piece of art that we create/read to help us heal.

Sav(or) Life....(re)affirm the joy of living,"Never thought I'd like this, but I do - I absolutely adore this one. Tom Hanks IS Disney. But the fun part? This one ain't about him. it's all about Mrs., Sorry, the curmudgeonly Mrs. P. J. Travers, and her journey/s. In spite of John Lee Hancock's ham-fisted handling of 'The Blind side', one of the reasons for which I was not primed for this one, he knocks this one out of the park. Pitch-perfect in tone, execution and characterization, never mind the so-called liberties that may/not have been taken, this is a work of a supremely confident team (its always a team, no matter who helms it), and evoked, in me, some of the best movie-watching memories I've had, esp. watching something similarly layered a few years previously, also on the big screen with a like-minded audience, 'Finding Neverland'. Everyone's in top form here (In addn to Hanks/Thompson/Farrell, we have Giamatti/Baker/Schwartzman/Novak/Whitford), and this is a welcome return to the mainstream limelight for Colin Farrell as well, and Emma Thompson, the eponymous Nanny McPhee, IS Mrs., sorry, Mrs. Travers. I've never enjoyed her performance more (except perhaps in 'Last chance Harvey', another under-seen jewel). The soundtrack is some of the best composed for film, as is the lush cinematography. All in all, perfect, and it helps that the distributors for this one have their heads out of their glory holes, and have released this absolutely wide. Its playing in approximately 12 shows/day across multiplexes, and the audience I watched it with, was respectful, and enjoyed everything unfold with absolute reverence and delight, the way this is meant to be savored. Once more, the middle finger moves around those impatient ^&%$$$s who do not savor the large-screen experience, and 'tis a pity they'll never know what they missed. Better for the rest of us though. Watch it before it leaves cinemas - this one's one of those magical, life-affirming works of art. Take your family, take your better/worse half - savor it. Maybe twice/more. I know I will.",,Anonymous,Biography
Don't Judge By The Trailers,"What a great movie. I was only mildly interested in seeing it when my brother encouraged me to go. The trailers gave it the appearance of a sappy comedy/drama made for kids. I didn't even know it was rated PG-13 until I arrived at the theater. Boy that's not it at all! If this movie failed at anything, it was its advertising. Kids would not relate well to it; it's definitely made for adults. I don't know why the trailers don't reveal more of the true depth of this film, but please don't judge the film based on them alone.The humor won't have you rolling on the floor, but that's not the point. It provides just the right tone to offset the very sad and dark material of P.L. Travers' childhood. As a child of an alcoholic father myself, I can really relate to P.L. Travers and the scenes involving her father brought back a flood of memories of my own. I haven't cried this much during a movie in years. This movie should evoke emotion from just about anyone, but for those who have experienced an abusive childhood, I think it will be particularly touching. Not many movies express the pains the alcoholism as well as this. I can only hope more will follow.But what I really loved about this film is that despite the sadness, it has a resounding message of forgiveness and hope. Though we go through incredible pain, we must forgive those who hurt us and move forward towards a better future. Great advice, not only for people who have experienced abuse, but for all people in general.I hope this movie wins Best Picture at the Academy Awards this year. It is definitely worth your time!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A nice fantasy,"I liked this a lot once I realized it is fantasy, rather than history. Disney and Mrs, Travers are both extreme caricatures. Disney is depicted as an overgrown, insensitive kid, a boob, rather than the actual ""Hollywood's Dark Prince"". The tape played at the end of the film shows that she was not nearly as whacked as played in the film. The California outdoor sequences and dialogue were stereotypical and silly, and the supporting actors playing Disney employees are also silly stereotypes. The obviously California landscape standing in for Australia was distracting, reminding one of movie made long ago when that was the practice.The story of her troubled young life is touching, as is Disney's telling of his early life, leading to the eventual explanation of the title.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Simple Joys of Disney Magic,"Saving Mr. Banks dramatizes the story behind the Disney classic Marry Poppins, which reveals the dislikes of the author, P.L. Travers, towards the vision of Walt Disney and his crew to her beloved book. The promotions promise to explore the relationship between the author and the filmmakers that then eventually lead to the existence of the said film. But most of the time, this is Travers' story about how this tale means to her life. The two sided stories are compelling enough, though there are times that feels a little lacking, but nevertheless, it is a quite fun light entertainment.One side of the movie is Travers' troubled childhood that was at first illusioned by his father's stories until reality fades it into something less magical. The other side is where Hollywood wanted to make her work look shallow in comparison which results to a personal outrage. Her demands sounded preposterous at the start, but thanks to the constant flashbacks it surely takes a lot of time explaining her thoughts by reflecting the pain from the past every time there is a contradiction coming.What's a bit disappointing here is the author's relationship with Walt Disney doesn't seem enough, like Disney is just a friend that sometimes appear with hardly any build up. The most memorable bits of the pre-production segment are the ones when it's making a joke out of Travers' demands. It's easy to understand that she's difficult to work with, but nice conversations with the people she bumped into seems to be the only solution to calm her down. Things may get too easy around, in other terms, it provides a warmth that we rarely get in movies in a while.It was the actors who made it so likable. Emma Thompson is terrific, she gives more depth than anything else here by realistically delivering whatever P.L. Travers has to express. Tom Hanks brings a charming enthusiasm that nicely fits to Walt Disney. The rest like Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak, and Paul Giamatti adds up the delight to its lightheartedness.The real story of the making of Mary Poppins wasn't actually as ultimately pleasant as this movie portrayed. It would have been more satisfying if it wasn't too afraid to be too negative on the situation, but by the way, this is a Walt Disney production, how could this be a less nicer play? In other mindset, this is a totally feel-good movie that is loyal to the genre's emotion and heart, and I don't think anyone wouldn't like to have that kind of pleasant experience. Saving Mr. Banks is already pretty amiable to be enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A surprising disappointment...and yet Thompson is practically perfect,"Middle-aged Brit and ""Mary Poppins"" authoress P. L. Travers, a frustrated, frustrating female conundrum of likes and dislikes (and with both surname and ancestry highly suspect), is being persuaded to sign over the creative rights to her book to Walt Disney in the early 1960s; she wants no cartoons or songs in the film--nor is the color red to be present--which leads to an ulcer-making relationship between she and the higher-ups at Disney. Historians are likely to pick this movie apart: from the factual/not factual content in Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay to the Hollywood milieu to Tom Hanks' mildewy performance as Walt Disney (which, if you're going to nitpick, is a good place to start). All that aside, however, the movie itself rarely lifts off. It has a smashing performance from Emma Thompson in the lead, it's richly produced, it has been directed (at moments) with a modicum of flair by John Lee Hancock, but the flashbacks to Travers' emotionally-upsetting childhood in Australia (with Colin Farrell overacting as her alcoholic father) are unwelcomed--they keep butting into the framework. Still, Thompson as Travers gives a performance worth-seeing; stubborn, exasperating, tight with her principles, Thompson fills the role and then some. Unfortunately, much of the rest is hokum, including Thompson's soft-hearted scenes with Paul Giamatti as a sympathetic driver. Her scenes with Hanks are, surprisingly, no better. Hanks, who undoubtedly put some thought into his Disney impersonation, is all wrong for this part; what with bad hair and make-up, boxy suits and a continuous look of consternation, his Walt Disney comes off like a dismayed studio lackey. There's some genuine heart in the proceedings, but too many disappointing decisions. When Travers finally gets into the movie music--the song ""Let's Go Fly a Kite"" by the Sherman Brothers--and begins to merrily dance, we barely get a glimpse of this happy moment before Hancock cuts away to other business. Likewise, when Disney first hears ""Feed the Birds"" being worked out on the piano, he appears to be wandering the studio grounds in the middle of the night. ""Mr. Banks"" isn't terrible, but the movie has a self-congratulatory air as well as heavy-handed pathos and sentiment. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Humour, pathos, reality. 100%","An amusing and entertaining account of the protracted efforts of Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) to acquire the film rights to the novel ""Mary Poppins"", by Pamela (Mrs!) Travers (played by Emma Thompson. The reasons why his efforts are so protracted become evident throughout the movie.Firstly, I have to confess to never having seen the movie nor read the book. Truth be told, it took me ages to work out who the titular character was! Now that I have the seen this movie, exploring the source material and more seems worthwhile.""Protracted""wellMrs. Travers sort of comes across as a female version of Basil Fawlty in this movie (of the famous U.K. sitcom ""Fawlty Towers"")! She is brusque and has the manner of a stern, toffee English woman. Mrs. Travers is consistently and insistently brusque throughout the movie and most amusing for that. That being said, seeing as how ""Fawlty Towers"" never found favour in the U.S., it might be hard to picture American audiences being much amused by her. There is some nice, subtle humour in the performances of those Mrs. Travers has to work with in the moviethe would be song writers for the film ""Mary Poppins""I recognised one from the U.S. version of ""The office"" (B.J. Novak).If Mrs. Travers was nothing more than a female Basil Fawlty, then I suppose I might not have enjoyed this movie so much. Thompson, however, brings a great sense of pathos to her role. She is a woman who miserably carries her cross with her all the time. Not having read her book, I wonder how much of a 'disconnect' there is between the author and her creation. Having seen a few award bait movies recently, I can't say that any have particularly grabbed me. As Travers does have a narrative arc or sorts and displays multi-dimensional emotions, I think Thompson deserves a Best Actress award. The recently held Golden Globe awards gave that honour to actresses in ""American hustle"", but to me ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the superior movie and Thompson a more deserving recipient (I have no idea if Thomspon was even nominated in those awards).Tom Hanks is also recognisably Tom Hanks in this movie, but it didn't detract from his performance. Seeing as how positively I responded to this movie, I would be generous in giving him a Best Actor award. Seeing as how this movie is made by Walt Disney Studios, it's no surprise that his representation is imbued with a vaseline glow. I was trying to recall what the controversy was with him, so I looked him up on Wikipedia to see if it was mentioned thereit isanti-Semitism and racism. Of course, I doubt if a movie of this sort would really have any business delving into that aspect of his character.What is good about this movie is how it attempts to ground Mrs. Travers personality with her childhood experiences. To me, it seemed to provide a basic level of insight into her, which wasn't harsh. Without having explored this aspect myself, it seems to me that the film does provide some sort of explanation for the relationship between her book and her childhood experiences. Perhaps I would have liked more insight into the relationship between her childhood experiences and the woman she becamethey seem pretty tenuous in the film, but then again I'm not sure psychonalysis would be of much help here. It's just my sneaking suspicion that there is more to her adult form than what we see in the movie. This aspect is intriguing to me.If I do have one criticism of the film, it is that it appears quite obscure on her family's story. It wasn't clear to me what Mrs. Travers' father did for a living before he moved his family to the middle of nowhere in Australia. Did he have to change jobs? Also, there is a scene with Mrs. Travers' mum (when she is also a child) where her mum pockets some liquor at the clothesline. Was that drink for her? Or was she hiding it from her husband? More clarity would have been appreciated here.There was one scene which I appreciated in this movieafter a moment of crisis between Mrs. Travers and Walt, Walt travels to England to see her. He connects with her on a human level, I felt, and displayed empathy with her. The less pleasant scene (although it is played for laughs) comes later, when Mrs. Travers returns to see Walt, unexpectedly. It seems an affirmation of what Mrs. Travers might have imagined their relationship to have been all alongmerely mercantile (on his part).This movie portrays Mrs. Travers as having her D.N.A. (so to speak) all over Walt's movie. Since the movie is regarded as a classic, it seems her efforts were entirely positive and beneficial to Walt's movie, perhaps? In which case, she's hardly deserving the scorn that she draws at times, right? If she hadn't of been so insistent on her vision for the movie, would have it been as so unutterably awful as she imagined it could have been?On reflection, it also seems to me that Mrs. Travers is, in fact, a kind of unintentional heroine of this Disney movie. Recently my Duckduckgo (a search engine) app had an interesting news story feed on itvia the ""filmschoolrejects"" website. The story was called ""6 things the film industry does not want you to know about"". Number 6 concerned studios stealing scriptspoor script writers submit a script and an eerily similar one gets made into a movie later on with no compensation for the original script writer. I say ""Bravo!"" to Mrs. Travers! A true hero!If the movie's script isn't just basically the conversations transcribed verbatim at the time from tapes, then I'd also give this film a best Script award. It's also my personal Best Film so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Thompson charms again in a great film of movie history,"Based on a true story, this film takes place in two different time periods. One is in the early 1960s when Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) is trying to convince P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to give his company the right to make a film based on her ""Mary Poppins"" books. (We all know the outcome of that.) The other time period is in the early 1900s in Australia and tells the story of Travers' very difficult childhood.This movie was more charming and moving than I expected. It begins with a comical clash of British vs. American values. It's quite funny at times though Travers occasionally goes too far with her put-downs.She is so obstinate that, if this were a fictional film, the final outcome might not be believable. Indeed, some of the truth is stretched but not enough to harm the overall effect.Some of the most moving scenes are those in the early time period. As the family patriarch, Colin Farrell is very gripping as a man who wants to do well for his beloved family but has the hardest times with his demons of despair. The flashbacks of these scenes make it easier to understand the difficult personality of the adult Travers.Her character is also made more human due to the dependable brilliance of Emma Thompson. When snarky, Thompson does what those great Brits do best: deliver sharp-tongued wit quickly but comprehensively within perfectly structured sentences. She is most moving, however, after recalling childhood moments (shown in flashbacks) while struggling to maintain her demands that the film stay true to her stories. Her face could tell a full story without saying a word.It's not a surprise that Thompson is so great. Her work in the 1990s (""Howards End"", ""The Remains of the Day"", ""In the Name of the Father"", ""Sense and Sensibility"" plus a hilarious appearance on the ""Ellen"" show) would be enough to place her in any hall of fame. I also recall she was one of the few saving graces in the rather mediocre ""Love, Actually"" in 2003. It's great to see her in a part that showcases her best once again.Hanks has a very fine monologue near the film's end. It summarizes what could be the film's main theme: sympathy to families whose sole breadwinners suffered in soul-destroying jobs. This even came through in ""Mary Poppins"".Rating: 8/10* * *Outstanding Achievement: Performance of Emma Thompson",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saving Mr. Banks,"Saving Mr. Banks is based on the story of how Walt Disney bought the rights to make Mary Poppins. Starring Tom Hanks as Disney, Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins, and Colin Farrell, as Travers' father -- as seen in flashback. The crux of the story centres around Travers' time spent at Disney studios, working with Disney, Don DaGradi and the brilliant Sherman brothers, as a screenplay is eeked out and some sort of agreement reached between the film-makers and the defensive Travers. Here, both Hanks and Thompson shine, playing opposite types butting heads over a common interest. Thompson is outstanding as Travers, walking a fine line between being risible and empathetic, as scathing barbs and a difficult temperament block the ebullient Walt at every turn. Hanks, equally good, is completely genial and very convincing in his role. We know and see Disney's motivations, become aware of a pointed drive to succeed and create a world in which he is master of his domain. But this is a likable character, as is Travers, whose backstory is told in extensive flashbacks. Her childhood, in the Australian outback, especially her relationship with an alcoholic father, comes to define her life as she wrestles with memories of tragedy and the ideal. Thus, her determination not to allow her beloved creation to be tampered with by Disney. Her resolve loosens, of course. We all know the film was ultimately made and became a tremendous success. But this is the story (albeit a romanticised one) of how the film came to be. Films about the movie business are often favourites of mine, and this is no exception. Saving Mr. Banks is a really wonderful film. The story is well written and directed, but comes with an enormous cache for anyone fond of Mary Poppins. The flashbacks occasionally fracture the narrative and spell out Travers' arc a bit too freely, but ultimately, the back- story is vital to her catharsis. Especially when this aspect of the story is so well handled -- despite feeling a bit like a different film entirely.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Made me want to see Mary Poppins,"Not to tread on the movie's qualities, but it actually made me want to see Mary Poppins. The story behind the making of one of the most beloved Disney movies of all time showed how much the books meant to the author and, how deep down, P.L Travers searched for her happy ending. Emma Thompson brings the essence of this complicated character to the screen and manages, in the end, to make us connect with her. I must say that I found the woman to be quite obnoxious at first, and while it did take quite a long time, I eventually found myself rooting for her. Tom Hanks just won me over with his portrayal of Walt Disney, a man that with an empire that wants to add another jewel, yet a one with a certain significance to his family, namely his daughters. To Disney, making Mary Poppins is a promise he must keep, and he will stop at nothing to persuade Pamela to sign the rights and stick with the project. Having watched the movie I know understand the title, as it resonates with the most important person in Travers's life: her alcoholic yet caring father which is played superbly by Colin Farrell. In the end, the movie comes down to letting go of something personal and refusing to see it generalized as a light cartoon. I supported Traver's cause and after all the problems that precede it, all I wanted to do was see Mary Poppins come to life.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
It is Thompson that steals the show,"Utterly brilliant!I haven't watched 'Mary Poppins' itself in many, many years but still have memories of it as a kid. That meant I had the desired knowledge of the key parts about that film, which I'd say is probably wise to watch before this - though not a requirement, at least in my opinion.Ironically, Travers' complaints about the animation segments to the 1964 film are justified on my end - I've been on a Disney marathon since May, but to ""shorten"" the watch load I decided to only watch the studio's productions that are straight up animation or straight up live-action, so MP missed the cut given it's a combo. If she had her way, I'd have watched it again relatively recently. Damn you, Mr. Disney!Anyway, 'Saving Mr. Banks' is an outstanding film! One that's filled with so much heart and some rich storytelling - loved the back and forth between Travers' early and later years. They entwin the two films together very well, while the Disney stuff - while in your face - adds humour as well as meaning.Then you have Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. Two actors I adore already. Hanks plays Walt Disney very good, he's top notch in this. However, it is Thompson that steals the show. She's superb as Travers, who isn't the most likeable character but Thompson ensures you stay invested in her. She's great in 'Treasure Planet' and 'Nanny McPhee', but this is the best I've seen from her so far.Elsewhere, shoutouts to Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson and Paul Giamatti for what they bring - especially Farrell. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak are good as the Sherman Brothers, also.A charming and very nicely made film. Can't recommend it more.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An impossible movie to dislike,"Tugging at the heartstrings during the most opportune times, making you feel all warm inside on cue and delivering more than a spoonful of ""fun for the whole family"" throughout to counteract the PG-13 moments, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is little more than Disney propaganda. But, when what you essentially have here is a Disney movie, about the making of a Disney movie, portraying Walt Disney, to go in expecting anything scathing would be foolish. That said, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" contains more edge to it than Disney's live action, ""The Odd Life of Timothy Green"", made for TV movie worthy track record would have you believe.Directed by John Lee Hancock (who is well versed in Disney-fying movies) and written by Kelly Marcel (the writer of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation) and Sue Smith, this imaginative retelling of the making of Mary Poppins (I say this only because in real life P.L. Travers absolutely hated the 1964 Mary Popping's film) depicts a charismatic, compassionate and non-anti-Semitic Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) in his attempts to woo author P.L. Travers for the right to bring her beloved novels to the big screen.The performances all around are excellent, but the standout has to be Emma Thompson, who plays the aforementioned P.L. Travers with the most perfectly disapproving British tone and mannerisms possible. But it is the structure of ""Saving Mr. Banks"" which is the most impressive. With the best sequences being some extremely well timed flashbacks showing Travers troubled upbringing with her alcoholic father (brilliantly portrayed by Colin Farrell) which momentarily takes things out of the farcical realm, dousing audiences with an occasional cold splash of welcome weight and realism.Final Thought: At the end of the day all ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is, is a film about the making of a film; which on face value may seem fascinating to film students and nobody else. This is also a Disney production, which means the story does not veer from the set in stone generic Disney outline (no matter their differences, in the end every character finds common ground and blah, blah, blah) with a score that instructs viewers how to feel (when Disney tells the story of his hard upbringing, cue the sad music). But there is no doubt the Disney Corporation knows their way around an entertaining film. What can I say? ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a movie that is impossible to dislike.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Emotional, Lovely and a MUST WATCH!","I've got no words for this movie... I grew up watching Marry Poppins with Julie Andrews singing and Dick Van Dyke by her side always thinking the unimaginable. I'm putting this review quite late because I watched it a long time ago, but if I did write the review when I first watched, I would probably write more than 30 lines analyzing everything lol. This movie is a complete masterpiece!!!

File Under Guilty Pleasures,"It may seem a slight concept--Walt Disney and author P.L. Travers reluctantly collaborate on an adaptation of her ""Mary Poppins"" series--but in the hands of director John Lee Hancock (the criminally under-appreciated ""The Rookie""), there's a grace and charm that makes for an enjoyably nostalgic experience, even if the tears generated from the script by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith aren't always earned honestly. The film cross-cuts between the contentious effort to adapt Travers' work and her Australian childhood, where she struggles to save her parents' marriage and, in particular, her father's romantic idealism, which has been crushed by alcoholism. (Her father is played by a fine Colin Farrell.) This earnest effort to ""explain"" (read: psychoanalyze) Travers' soured worldview seems labored and determined and it drags the film's rhythms down; but it helps that Hancock has Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks as the leads--both turn in the entertaining performances one would hope for, which is to say well-suited to their scenery-chomping proclivities. It's a very professional piece of filmmaking, easy to watch and suitable for filing under Guilty Pleasures.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doesn't deserve the Oscar hype!,"'SAVING MR. BANKS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Disney's Oscar hopeful about the production of their 1964 classic 'MARRY POPPINS'. The title 'SAVING MR. BANKS' refers to the father in that film (and the book it's based on). It centers around the novel's author, P. L. Travers, and Walt Disney's struggles to adapt her popular work into a movie. Emma Thompson stars as Travers and Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney. The film also features Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzman, B. J. Novak and Kathy Baker in supporting roles. It's overly sappy and doesn't deserve awards attention but it is a decent family drama film.Thompson plays Pamela ""P. L."" Travers (as an adult) in the movie, which is set in 1961 and also has flashbacks to 1907 (when Pamela was just a young girl growing up in Australia). The film revolves around Walt Disney's (Hanks) attempts to convince Travers to let him turn her popular kids' book, 'Marry Poppins', into a Disney movie. Travers was very reluctant to do so and didn't trust Disney. She also didn't want any changes made to her story. The film focuses on Disney's long fight to win over Travers and also pays a lot of attention to Travers' inner struggles with letting go of her past. Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic but loving father (in the 1907 flashbacks).The film is entertaining but it's drama and sentimentality seems really forced. I like a good emotional and touching movie but not when it's forced down my throat (like Disney often does with their films). I enjoyed Hanks and Thompson's performances but the P.L. Travers character is just a little too unlikeable (to relate to at all). It is funny though and the supporting cast is all good as well. It just feels way too much like a Disney movie (in a modern 'bad' way; not like the good old classics). Other than the forced drama it definitely isn't a bad film though (it just doesn't deserve the Oscar hype).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Magical,"What a lovely and well made movie this is.Has Tom Hanks ever been bad in any film? I don't think he has, even in not so good movies he is always brilliant.This movie was really made and Tom is perfect as Walt Disney as is Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers.But what makes this so special is the way the story is told. The flashbacks to her early life helps explain her eccentric actions and it is almost like two movies in one.Annie Rose Buckley is brilliant as young Pl Travers or Ginty as her parents call her. Colin Farrel does a great job as her troubled Father who has such a big impact on her life.The movie is filled with just about every emotion and is a delight to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting,"This film tells how Walt Disney convinces the unmovable Mrs Travers in selling him the movie rights of her famous book ""Mary Poppins"".I had no idea who Mr Banks was before I watched the film, nor have I read the book in question. However, the two main characters, played by Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, are both very interesting and captivating. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney is such an amicable father figure. He has so charming and wholesome. Emma Thompson as Mrs Travers is also interesting, as she is so negative and antagonises everything she encounters. Her character is so bitter, that it would not be fun to be her. Walt Disney and his team tries to break through her icy heart, but with no success. The plot itself is just alright, but the acting is very enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Biography
Kinda Melancholy But OK,"I didn't love the movie per se, but I appreciated what it was going for. It is very melodramatic, and it took some time to understand the Australian scenes, but the movie was gut-wrenching in some parts and Colin Farell does some of the best acting of his career.Emma Thompson plays a great lead in the film and really carried the movie... if Mary Popping was about Mr. Banks, then Saving Mr. Banks was about P.L. Travers' solemn past.Tom Hanks is on point as Walt Disney and the supporting cast does a great job of lightening the mood of a pretty dreary movie.There were a lot of old folks in the theatre, so I don't know that young teen would appreciate the movie as much, my own high-school aged in-laws were visibly restless. Would recommend seeing, but only if you're wide awake.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Father and daughter relationship,"Saving Mr. Banks' plot revolves around P. L. Travers' reluctancy to allow Walt Disney to adapt Marry Poppins into a movie and the latter's persistent efforts to convince her to do so.The flashback scenes are nicely done and that's probably the main factor that elevates this movie to a higher standard, as it deviates from the typical biopic formula. They show a lot in little time, namely all the key events in Travers' childhood -her relationship with her dad being in the centre of it all- that shaped her personality and her artistic identity, as they inspired her to create Mary Poppins, Mr. Banks and everyone else. Some parts of the movie's ""present"" time are explained through those flashbacks, for example her dislike towards pears. Most importantly, though, it becomes clear why she feels so close to her characters and wants to protect them from the dangers of the big screen. They are not mere characters to her, they are her past, her life.Saving Mr. Banks is a family, feel-good movie and as a result maintains a relatively light tone, but still keeps the balance between its humorous (Travers' disdain for anything American or glamorous), nostalgic (playing with her dad), poignant (her dad's alcoholism and illness) and touching (her relationship with her driver, singing and dancing to Let's Fly a Kite, her reaction after watching the movie) parts.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An absolute masterpiece by leaps and bounds,This movie is fantastic. One of the best dramas I've seen this year. Tom Hanks portrays a wonderful Walt Disney along with an award winning performance by Emma Thompson. They are both superb in this and deliver very memorable performances. The film itself just oozes classic in every way and should simply be listed as a must see film for every person that watches mary poppins or wants to. The film very powerfully creeps its way into your emotions making tears an inevitability as well as childhood flashbacks. I honestly missed my mother watching this because I grew up on mary poppins. Every single actor and actress in this gets to shine like a star thanks to this films director. I would recommend this film to anyone that just likes a great movie and this one better win some awards or I will be utterly peeved. ;) S A Storyteller,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Before Watching: Saving Mr. Banks (2013),"""Saving Mr. Banks"" (2013) is a charming movie about the people and relations behind the famous Mary Poppins. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:It's easy to dismiss Saving Mr. Banks at first glance as rather slow-paced and uninteresting for anyone that wasn't caught by the initial Mary Poppins-wave. That judgement could to an extent be justified, since this is after all a typical drama feature, and as such, rarely bothers itself with intense action sequences or an over-emphasized conflict of epic proportions. However, that does not mean that Saving Mr. Banks is not intriguing nor captivating - its intensity is just experienced in a different, but still present way. The aim lies on the aim protagonist, Pamela Travers, and her background as well as psychological connection to her work of fiction. Although she might come off as cold and one-dimensional, she grows into a very satisfying and cathartic arch towards the end.The side characters do a great job with providing the additional and much needed warmth, which elevates the movie in a curious and quite cheerful way. The opposites of personalities make for amusing as well as deep felt interactions, all interwoven with relevant flashbacks for Mrs. Travers. The music is almost too catchy, the scenery lush, and all things considered makes for a cozy and relaxing experience - save the ending which can come off as a bit abrupt and sudden, but still relevant and understandable.My personal grade: a pleasant 7/10.

Save Your Childhood Memories,"Did you enjoy watching Mary Poppins as a kid? Or as a young parent? Then save those precious memories and avoid this obnoxious grind.Every word out of Emma Thompson's mouth was a shrill annoyance. That high-falutin' limey accent and her imperious demeanour very quickly become too much to take. Then I read she was born in Australia and didn't move to England until she was well into her 20s. I've watched enough Australian Rules Football to know that Aussies don't speak poncey anything, much less private-school English.Then there's America's most beloved Dee Enn Cee mouthpiece (well, not counting fake Veep Julia Louis-Dreyfus) Tom Hanks in fat makeup (wait, that wasn't makeup?) playing one of wartime America's most notorious (give or take a Henry Ford) Nahzti sympathizer (allegedly). The reality behind that man was so far from his shtick on his weekly TV show that he should be sued post mortem for fraudulent misrepresenation.Colin Farrell plays a drunk. Woah. Talk about taking a risk and playing against type !Then for good measure the casting director mixed in a few more of Hollywood's most obnoxious actors - Brad Whitford, BJ Novak and MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti's facial tick-afflicted son.If you watch this you will hate yourself for wrecking your precious childhood memories.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

possible Spoiler,"I am stunned that no one has mentioned Colin Farrell. I have never seen him so... wonderful. Alas, as soon as I saw the character, I told the hubs, ""Alky"". That would explain why she was the way she was. I was then prepared to dismiss the movie and watch something else. However, ET and Tom Hanks brought me in a bit more. Then, the flashbacks brought me even closer. Then, Colin Farrell suckered me in completely. I was so caught up in the sure and certain knowledge that Mrs. Travers daddy was going to die that I had to keep watching. And ""Feed the Birds"": knowing that Mr. Disney went the the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, where Ms. Darwell was housed in her dotage,in order to give her her last hurrah in the biz was wondrous. And I even exed out the fact that Disney was an anti-semitic, anti-union boor. My father was his CPA, and when the park opened, our family was invited to DL and given a fantastic ""behind the scenes"" tour. We met Mr. Disney in his office, and he got on his knees to say hello to me and my brother, give us a hug and kissed my cheek. Everything was going along really well, until we went ""behind"" the scene at the jungle ride, and my bro and I were standing on one of the high banks of the ""river"". The photog told us to step back a little, and next thing I knew, I was tumbling into the killer hippo-filled stinky water, and a guide from one of the boats had jumped in to rescue me. No, really. But Colin Farrell: bravo times a whole bunch. And the Aunt (actress from ""6 Feet Under"" AND Australian) came to help, with her carpet bag and pots of plants and pineapple and ""Spit spot!"".

Delightful and Heart-warming Story About the Making of a Musical Classic!,"It's a delightful and heart-warming movie which enlightens us about the complexities in adapting 'Mary Poppins' into a movie, which becomes a lovable musical classic, and the early days of its author P.L.Travers which inspires the story. With two brilliant actors (both two-time Oscar winners) to play the leads, and a story involving two timelines, one exploring the script discussion at Disney office and the other exploring the childhood days of Mrs.Travers in Australian countryside, the movie forms a beautiful and not-so-complex puzzle which keeps you intrigued till the end.Emma Thompson plays the character of the complex, passionate and unwilling-to-bend author of beloved children's book 'Mary Poppins' with such vigour and range of emotions. And Tom Hanks completely transforms himself into the King of Animation, Walt Disney; the speaking technique, the walking style, everything just exudes Mr.Disney. Colin Farrell is commendable as young P.L.Travers' father.Thomas Newman's amazing music and John Schwartzman's skillful camera-work add to the beauty of the storytelling.Though most of the negotiation part might be exaggeration or lie (to soften few character images, it's a nostalgic journey through an old era, and revisiting a classic like 'Mary Poppins' with such depth makes you wanna watch it ('Mary Poppins') again; It's simply supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!Everyone has a story to tell, but how you tell it makes a lot of difference.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A joy to watch. 7/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this heart warming story about how Mary Poppins came to the big screen. The main element that I enjoyed about the movie had to be the chemistry between the characters and a very well written script that had wit and an emotion with the little girls story. When you actually hear the real recordings at the end of the movie, you know that Emma Thompson's character must have been murderous to work with, but with the success of the movie, it was worth the hassle. Walt Disney had an eye for making classics that will last in everyone's memory forever, so after waiting 20 years to make this movie, he must have seen something that would have touched everyone's heart which is very rare nowadays. The director done a great job with putting this historical event together, but it has to be the performances that made the movies joy to watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After the disappointing Cloud Atlas and the awful Larry Crowne, it's good to see Tom Hanks coming back to form with Captain Phillips and his performance in this film. Emma Thompson played her part extremely well. alongside the 3 writers and musicians that were helping her, or should I say, be dictated to, make the movie that became and still is an all time classic. Even the young looking Colin Farell played his part well which shows that they must have had faith in the storyline and script. I'm glad that the movie made over double the budget because it well deserved.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $113millionI recommend this movie to people who are interested in the making of Mary Poppins and the emotional ties that the writer had with the storyline. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Umbrella Wielding Nanny Goes Up Against A Mouse,"This is a story of a curmudgeon Australian born author bound to keep her story of a magical nanny out of the hands of Hollywood. It's also the story of a man named Walt who was determined to keep a promise to his daughters to turn the curmudgeon author's story into a movie. As Walt tries to persuade the author to hand over the rights to her books, the author keeps telling him that the story of Mary Poppins is not meant to be turned into a motion picture, for it is a story of her life, a story of her childhood and a story about her beloved father, the inspiration for George Banks in her tale.That's exactly why this film is called Saving Mr. Banks. It's not just about P.L. Travers trying to save her stories from the gloved hands of Mickey Mouse, it's about letting go of the past, learning from it and using it to become the person that you are. This film makes you think of Mary Poppins in an entirely different light. I always liked that the meaning of the 1964 film was about Poppins helping Mr. Banks realize that he didn't need a nanny after all and that he should be the one to guide his children in the right direction, but to see the development, the struggles, the conflicts and the overall madness that occurred to get Mary Poppins made just makes you think to yourself.......We are so lucky that this film exists.We can see why Travers didn't want her story mauled by the mouse house but at the same time, we can see why Walt Disney wants to turn Travers' beloved tale into a movie. There's no good guy or bad guy, it's just two entirely opposite individuals at entirely opposite ends of the fence. And I just love how Travers and Disney go at each other's throats, I mean they really play off of each other and you can really feel the tension between the two as they try to get their own ways. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were spectacular choices to play both Travers and Disney respectively and I think they'd be perfect contenders to receive Oscars.There's also Dick and Bob Sherman, the songwriting team behind the 1964 classic as well as Paul Giamatti as Ms. Travers' car driver. The relationship between Thompson and Giamatti's characters is another highlight of the film and very heartwarming at times. Colin Farrell is also grand as Travers' father, an alcoholic banker who stills has a heart of gold. I also liked the woman who played the Travers' nanny, the obvious inspiration for Mary Poppins in Pamela's books.You can also expect to hear a lot of songs from the beloved Disney film such as Feed The Birds and Let's Go Fly A Kite. And I have to admit that at the very end of this film, I got a bit choked up. Not that the ending was necessarily sad and depressing, but because it was bittersweet and changes the very way you look at things. From this day forward, I won't look at Mary Poppins the same way again. Seeing the making of one of my all time favorites has altered my entire view and I can honestly say that I like the film a heck of a lot more now than I did when I was 6 years old.Saving Mr. Banks is a great film to close out 2013 and a great way to celebrate Mary Poppins' 80th anniversary. It has a tad for everybody, plenty of laughs, cries, and a timeless story about a timeless story. It's simply.....Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.I don't know if I spelled that right.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

HK Auteur film review - Saving Mr. Banks,"As a writer, it is my opinion that how authors view the film adaptation of their own work is irrelevant and inconsequential to the quality of the adaptation itself. For example, whether Stephen King appreciates Stanley Kubrick's The Shining fundamentally does not make it a lesser film. This is the central question presented in John Lee Hancock's Saving Mr. Banks.The story recounts Author P.L. Travers (Mary Poppins), writer of Mary Poppins, reluctantly meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), who seeks to adapt her book for the big screen. As they are collaborating on the film adaptation, Travers reflects on her childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell), revealing her own personal attachments to the Mary Poppins story.Emma Thompson breathes a great inner life into P.L. Travers, humanizing a role that is greatly restrained and otherwise very unlikable. Tom Hanks, combining his star persona and natural ease, gives us a living and breathing Walt Disney. Hanks makes everything look so easy. Colin Farrell turns an affecting performance as Travers' chronic alcoholic father Travers Goff, and also props to Annie Rose Buckley as the young P.L. Travers. The heart of the story lies in the flashback segments, as we see P.L. Travers' past with his father in Australia and it shows that P.L. Travers essentially wrote Mary Poppins as wish fulfillment.Director John Lee Hancock balances the material perfectly. Even though I fundamentally disagree with Travers' persnickety demand of complete faithfulness, I empathize deeply with why she was so overprotective of her own material. It makes for much of the laughs as we watch the gloom Travers single-handedly killing all the child-like enthusiasm of the staff at Disney.It is probably best to see Mary Poppins first to get a more wholesome experience, as seeing the numerous classic scenes and songs that Travers could have prevented from ever being created gives a whole other level of tension. Also, stay for the credits for a surprise easter egg. Despite probably being overshadowed in terms of awards recognition, Saving Mr. Banks is a very enjoyable experience. Audience will find laughs and tears, as it is a well-made feel good movie.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Much like how Mary Poppins was ""trampled"" into creation (Disney knew what to sell), this movie's creation also feels like it was modified with certain intentions in mind.,. Portrayed as therapeutic for the author, and showing a Walt Disney that was nothing more than someone only capable of bringing joy to everyone involved (and not just to get his way). In a way, I feel bad for the real Travers, while the movie-version having a more idealized outcome.

Tom and Emma get good marks,"This was not my kind of movie, but as a married man of many years you have to let your wife pick a movie to watch before you choose yours. My Wife chose Saving Mr. Banks, I got 2 hours of silence from her, and nearly a teardrop every now and then. I watched Mary Poppins when I was a youngster and thought it was crap. That has nothing to do with Dick Van Dyke and his accent, I was a teenager before film critics lamented on how bad it was that I realized, he was an American doing a cockney accent. As a child you do not understand dialects, only language. you either understand what someone says or you do not.

We all knew Walt was evil,"Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend, but having recently watched ""Mary Poppins"" may alter the experience.I have just watched ""Mary Poppins"", a wonderful movie, before this so the magic that Disney pumped into Travers' story is still fresh in my mind. I'm not saying that Disney didn't create something fantastic, but I'm struggling with my affinity for this story.I think this is a great movie that documents an important event in both Disney and film history, and certainly that of intellectual property. I'm just not sure anyone else sees the same movie that I see in ""Saving Mr. Banks"", a title that I don't agree with at all, other than the victors of wars write history: I would have titled this the pursuit of ""Mary Poppins"".If you just change some of the music around, then you would have quite the psychological thriller on hand. The movie is filled with Disney hunting Travers, sorting out how to manipulate her in different ways, what to hide from her. He even has idiot minions that nearly ruin it for him. There's elements at play all over, she's brought out of her native environment, EVERYONE she interacts with is paid by Disney: they have a vested interest in keeping him happy, especially since he's not used to being refuted.20 years, a man pursued a woman that said no. 20 years, and she finally hit a wall and was low on funds enough that she could be convinced to deal with a kingdom of frivolity, and she had to sell a part of herself to him, even though she didn't want to, assured one thing, lied to, and having to make concessions the entire way. The audacity of going to someone, asking to buy their invention, and then belittling it so much that you reinvent it to the point it isn't recognizable as the thing you bought: it would have been so much easier to simply create something from scratch.This movie actually embodies everything I hate about the MCU, even in the early 1960s, it was enough to take a name that people recognized (and nothing else) and exploit it to make money off of it with no regards to the original work or author. And it is the fault of the authors, the owners of the intellectual property to sign away the rights without securing right of refusal or final approval. And it is the fault of the studio to exploit those in dire need as if they would buy a product that couldn't be sold as is.PL Travers was the hero of this story, and she lost to Disney, to need, to greedy capitalism, and I wish more people would take her advise of ""Never again!"".I think, in the end, this movie creeps me out, and makes me sad about the world. As good as it is, I can't say I enjoy it in retrospect.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's certainly no classic,"It's not a piece of schlock either but it's a fair to middling story about culture clash and more importantly about the magical abilities of Walt Disney. Let's face it, writers are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.... just visit your local library if you need confirmation. Disney knew that, but he also knew that once in a while one of them comes along with a special talent or idea that only exists in that particular person. You could try to plagiarize it but the end product would be missing the spark. The story is not really about the making of Mary Poppins, it is a story about the exceptional interpersonal skills, patience and persistence of Walt Disney. This film shows that the man didn't build one of the most celebrated companies in the world because he was lucky or because he was a ruthless businessman, he got there because he also had a gift of looking inside people and finding out what made them happy.And so we see how he used these qualities to handle even the most difficult individual and get what he wanted too.Tom Hanks is really very good as Walt himself, Emma is pretty good in her role even though she doesn't have to step too much out of what we see in her real life persona (To be fair I'm sure she's a wonderful person outside of the glitz). Paul G is excellent as the driver, but then again he is excellent in any part he plays.The nebulous scenes from Australia were a little too shallow for my liking, although I did enjoy the part where they move to the new town. I enjoyed it for totally selfish reasons,as my own parents emigrated to Australia with me as a babe-in-arms in 1948, so it was nice to see a reconstructed scene similar to what they would have seen back then.(No wonder we turned right around and went back to England!) The characters in these flashbacks didn't add a lot to the plot and really could have been played by anybody.All in all it's a movie that you would have rented from the video store (if they still existed) when the one you really wanted had been snapped up.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting backstage story offering a rare glimpse of the man behind the magic.,"Mary Poppins is fondly remembered today as one of Walt Disney's greatest achievements, a timeless classic whose charm and wonder has endured for generations. But long before Julie Andrews and her magic umbrella flew across the silver screen, another tale unfolded behind the scenes, and it's this tale that serves as the basis for Saving Mr. Banks.Helen Goff grew up in rural Australia, the oldest of three daughters born to a father (Colin Farrell) who frequently eschews the responsibilities of adulthood in favor of imbibing whiskey and conjuring up fantastical stories to entertain his little ones. He instills in Helen a sense of whimsy, insisting that she never allow herself to grow up and become an adult - a sentiment that another classic Disney character might agree with.Some sixty years later, the imaginative little girl has become celebrated author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), with nearly all traces of warmth and humor evaporating along the way. Financial ruin looms on the horizon, and Travers is forced to consider an offer from Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to purchase the film rights to Mary Poppins - a notion Travers has avoided for two decades, horrified by the idea of her creation ""cavorting and twinkling"" in front of audiences.As Travers spends two weeks in the Disney production studios with screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and composers Richard and Robert Sherman (Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak), her ridiculous list of demands (including her insistence that every conversation and production meeting be recorded) and her complete unwillingness to compromise provide plenty of humorous moments. Indeed, even Disney himself teeters at the edge of exasperation, forced time and again to give up ground in effort to keep the film moving forward.But as we juxtapose between these scenes and events from the author's childhood, we begin to understand that Travers isn't being difficult just for the sake of being difficult - there's a very personal connection here, and director John Lee Hancock expertly correlates the emotional impact of Travers' experiences with her attachment to the characters she created. There are more than a few moments that will leave audience members misty-eyed, but these moments reveal themselves organically, never coming across as forced or disingenuous.Thompson is superb as the prim and proper British dame, firing off snappy dialogue laced with sardonic wit, but it's Hanks that truly shines here, capturing Disney's charisma and creativity and reminding us why the studio magnate has remained a beloved, iconic figure in pop culture for so many years. Saving Mr. Banks isn't quite the biopic fans have been clamoring for, but it's a rare glimpse at the man behind the magic - and the woman responsible for one of his most memorable accomplishments.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like a Well-Made PBS Documentary with Really Good Reenactments,"With IMDb so strict about spoilers, I'm surprised they display the title of this movie. Turns out Mary Poppins is there for Mr. Banks and not his kids. At least, the filmmakers treat this as a revelation when it is dramatically stated close to the end of the movie. If they wanted that to be a moment, they should have called the film something other than ""Saving Mr. Banks.""And that's the problem. There just aren't any big, really interesting dramatic moments. There are moments treated as big and dramatic. And, because there are big-name actors, delightful Sherman brothers music, and really good lighting and makeup, at first it all seems bigger than it is.Truth is, there's just not much to ""Saving Mr. Banks."" Few surprises and tepid when they arrive.The film is pleasant enough, but the back-stories revealed to us about Poppins novelist P. L. Travers and Disney emperor Walt Disney just aren't that interesting. Or surprising. Or revealing to their characters.Of course, Walt is portrayed just about as wonderful as one could imagine. Travers is a difficult, no-nonsense Brit who has a sudden change of heart for no particularly good reason. Even Paul Giamatti never gets angry nor snarls even once, which is rare not to see.Hanks does a great job as Disney. Everyone else is adequate, none seeming to stray too far from whom they are anyway, or, at least, the types of people they usually play.Unfortunately the only thing that makes anyone interesting in this movie is who they are playing and a very few mildly curious moments in those people's lives. The actors and writers bring very little to the table.It's not boring. It's not that interesting. If you like Disney and Mary Poppins, you'll still like them after seeing this. In fact, you'll change very little before, during, and after watching this movie other than a few well-structured weepy moments. Kind of like a really good Hallmark TV movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Marvellous Movie,"Delightful story perfectly told by Disney - a show suitable for everyone. Not a great movie fan but this was top notch. Didn't even recognize Emma Thompson and though not her fan, she did a superb job. Hanks was also great but occasionally, he sounded like Forest Gump and that may have cost him the Oscar. But all the actors and actresses in the movie were tops and contributed to the film's success.Perhaps it is the Disney magic. Mary Poppins was a stellar motion picture so it made ""Saving Mr. Banks"" even more interesting. But it wasn't just a story about Mary Poppins - it was a story not only about its author but also a story about Walt Disney and it told a lot about the man and why he was so successful. That in itself made the movie a winner.This is a movie I would like to see again and again. It is a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emma Thompson is AMAZING！！！,"Having seen so many roles which Emma Thompson has played in Horwards End,Sense and Sensibility,In the Name Of the Father,but this one is quite shocking and brilliant.We may really see the annoying role Miss P.L.Travers in Emma Thompson who is so mean and unaccessible but in the other hand,has a miserable childhood.The movie starts with an amusing atmosphere but ends up with crying emotions which really touches the audiences--seeing Travers sitting in the cinema crying will remind us of our own parents.The two lines of this movies concern the current life and the past one which sometimes will make the whole movie fall apart,but thanks to the great connections between them and the marvelous performances by Emma Thompson,Saving Mr.Banks is still a great movie which will make us laugh and cry at the same time.Looking forward to seeing Emma's appearance in the Awards Season.Let's welcome the two-time former Oscar winner back after so many years with such an incredible performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bravo!,"Wow. Masterfully storytelling of the highest order. I am not a huge Hanks fan, nor a Disney buff but this movie surpassed ALL my expectations. So, the geniuses at Disney not only do Walt proud (as does Hanks...simply outstanding)but they essentially dredge up a movie and story about the process of adapting another story to the screen, and the multi-faceted back stories beneath the surface. They tie it all together so nicely. There is essentially no action, but you are riveted to the screen. Simply outstanding. Acting performances all top notch with special kudos to Paul Giamatti as Ralph the limo driver. IF you like history, film history, Disney, great acting, or just plain good story telling go see this. No bad words, no sex, no real violence...just plain good craftsmanship. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unexpected Surprise,"I was not prepared for this film although I had little idea what it was about, but I am such a Disney fan that I thought it would be at least interesting. I am also a big fan of Emma Thompson and have liked her in everything she has done and she does not disappoint here. I looked up the real Pamela Travers and was shocked to discover she absolutely hated the Disney version of her book, Mary Poppins. How this film deals with that issue is interesting. Tom Hanks is wonderful as Walt Disney and after a while you really begin to think he is Walt Disney. He is that convincing. The supporting cast which includes some familiar faces is also wonderful and showing the process of pre-production is really fascinating and very educational. I really learned a lot about how movies are made from this film. Everything about this film was classy including the music, photography, settings - everything. I really enjoyed watching the film and I got completely caught up in the story which I will not ruin by discussing any further. A big surprise was Colin Farrell who I did not know was in the film. When he appeared I did not recognize him at first and had to look at the cast list I printed out from this site to see who he was - something I do with every film I watch. Can't beat IMDb for film info that's for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thompson and Hanks lend magic to a slightly pedestrian script - the result is (mostly) supercalifragilistic... you know where this is going!,"Nominally, Saving Mr. Banks tells the behind-the-scenes story of how Walt Disney's silver-screen incarnation of Mary Poppins came to be, swooping as it did into the imaginations of children across the world in the guise of magical songbird Andrews. Actually, John Lee Hancock's film is a finely-crafted, if rather heavy-handed, character study that doubles as a meditation on family, fatherhood and the healing power of fiction.For years, Pamela 'P.L.' Travers (Emma Thompson) has jealously guarded the rights to her Mary Poppins novels, refusing to bow to the considerable charms and exhortations of media mogul Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) - a man who always get what he wants. When she hits a rocky financial patch in 1961, she's finally persuaded by her accountant to spend a fortnight in L.A. discussing the project. Once there, she terrorises Disney's entire creative team - including screenwriter Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford) and composer brothers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman (B.J. Novak) - with her demands.The story, it would seem, naturally lacks narrative tension - of course Travers gives in at some point, in some fashion. The existence of Mary Poppins in its everlastingly sublime cinematic form - despite Travers' strident and ruthlessly documented (via audio-tape) objections to script, score, animation and character design - is proof of that final surrender.But Saving Mr. Banks makes up for the inevitability of its outcome with some outstanding character work, allowing the darker and lighter sides of both Travers and Disney to peek through the conflicting personas - one prickly, the other genial - that they present to the world.In this regard, Saving Mr. Banks benefits enormously from the skill and talent of its two lead actors. As good ol' Uncle Walt, Hanks radiates a genuine charm that comes intriguingly laced with a hint of Machiavellian menace. In his business-minded courtship of Travers, Disney seems to reveal something deeper and sadder about himself and his soul - only for that glimmer of heartfelt intimacy to vanish as quickly as it appears. Hanks is masterful in playing the sweetness and steel of this complicated, media-savvy man, a warts-and-all portrait that's all the more surprising for the fact that this film was shot under the aegis of Disney's own studio.Thompson, meanwhile, is nothing short of spectacular. On screen (and, by all accounts, in real life), Travers is abrasive and utterly unsentimental, merrily insulting everyone who crosses her path with little care for their feelings or stature. Thompson breathes life into this difficult character, disappearing into the stern lines of Travers' face and the strict cuts of her dresses (not to mention that unflatteringly tight perm). Most impressive of all is the way in which Thompson plays the chinks in Travers' armour. She skilfully unveils years of guilt and regret in moments of quiet, unexpected vulnerability, all of which hint at the depths of soul and imagination that helped her dream up Mary Poppins in the first place.It should go without saying that the scenes Hanks and Thompson share are the best in the film. When they meet, Saving Mr. Banks acts as a master- class in physics - irresistible force meets immovable object - and acting; together, they create fireworks both explosive and emotional. There are few scenes more delightful than the ones in which Travers flatly defies Disney's flights of fancy (no red in the film!), or when Disney takes Travers for a ride (quite literally) in a personal tour of Disneyland.Unfortunately, a substantial chunk of Saving Mr. Banks - necessitated by the script as its main narrative device - is preoccupied with unravelling Travers' backstory and daddy issues. Far too frequently, the film cuts back to her yellow-washed childhood in Australia, where she - nicknamed 'Ginty' and played by the saucer-eyed Annie Rose Buckley - begins to realise that her sensitive dreamer of a dad (Colin Farrell) isn't quite the hero she has always believed him to be. It's not that this section of the film is bad, per se. In fact, it features a fine, heartbreaking performance from Farrell as a man who wildly loves his family but can't resist the siren call of alcohol.But the themes and ideas of these flashbacks are almost profoundly sentimental and hammered home in so blatant a fashion that one imagines Travers - whether the real or fictitious incarnation - would regard it with a furious disdain. As Travers herself grumbles in the film, when welcomed to L.A. by a roomful of Disney merchandise, the script could afford to ""learn the art of subtlety"". For all that Thompson is excellent in the part, it's sometimes tough to reconcile the open-hearted Ginty with the closed-up Travers. Hancock would have done better to trust Thompson to tell that story in the shifts and shadows of her enormously expressive eyes.Nevertheless, Saving Mr. Banks powers through on the strength of its marvellous cast. Whitford, Schwartzman and Novak have great fun playing their reactions to Thompson's Travers, ranging from exasperation to annoyance and, in one case, pure, unfettered anger. The unsung hero of the piece is Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Travers' eternally upbeat chauffeur. For all that Disney tries to find his way to Travers' heart, it's Ralph who brings the audience there with him.When it comes down to it, Saving Mr. Banks isn't about who won in the battle between Disney and Travers. To keep her house and home, Travers pretty much knew from the start that she would have to sign the rights to her beloved magical nanny away. She went to L.A. to fight for the spirit of her story - for her Mr. Banks - and this is precisely what allows the film, buoyed by the undeniable magic of Disney's final product, to take flight.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saving MR.

A Hollywood Seduction,"I found this as distasteful as You've Got Mail, and for much the same reasons. A powerful man with a veneer of amiability (played in both cases by Tom Hanks) attains the object of his desire by overcoming and taking possession of a female adversary through a questionably sincere appeal to her emotions.A medieval French nobleman is supposed to have said, ""Tell them anything, just get them in bed."" That's the story of this movie. Disney desperately wants the rights to Mary Poppins. Travers doesn't want to give up control and risk having her creation vulgarized. Disney tries the whole arsenal of Hollywood charm. The unbendingly British Travers is immune and impervious. Disney finally cracks her after his people find out the back story of her traumatized childhood in Australia. The scene in which he appeals to her sympathy and finally wins her trust by recounting his own childhood misery is a masterwork of fake sincerity. Once her signature is on the Disney contract, she is no longer an object of desire but a problem who must be managed lest she interfere with the marketing of the movie. She is not pleased with the result, but her objections don't matter.In sum, this is a microcosm account of the contempt with which Hollywood treats the writers of literary property that it wants to adapt to its own purposes, told not from the perspective of the embittered writer but with the smug satisfaction of the victorious studio. It is, in short, the locker room account of a conquest, and all the more distasteful for being well told.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Much better than just a ""feel good"" movie","I don't know exactly what I was expecting before I went to see this movie, but whatever it was, this movie greatly surpassed my expectations.Though it does not have the innovative photography that Orson Wells used in ""Citizen Kane,"" this movie resembles that classic in the way it slowly reveals the causes of the main character's behavior, locating them in her childhood. Along the way, Emma Thompson gives one of her best performances as the very complex Mrs. P.L. Travers, the Australian woman who wrote the Mary Poppins books. As she fights to preserve her idea of her character, and the backstory behind it that the Disney staff only slowly starts to perceive, we watch her come to terms with her childhood demons. Two of the final scenes, the one between Disney and Travers in London, and then the premiere of the movie, when Travers watches her childhood story come to life on the screen, are the highlights of a movie that has no low lights.Excess sentimentality, which could have been so easily exploited, is always avoided.It doesn't matter whether or not you saw the ""Mary Poppins"" movie or read P.L. Travers' books. You will find much to admire in this movie even if you have not.Go! It won't make you feel good, but it will let you admire some fine acting and script writing, and that is better than a Hallmark Hall of Fame moment any day.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Maybe the easiest 10/10,"I 'll start with a confession.
Having seen not all, but quite a number of Tom Hanks films, I was considering him as ""below average actor"". Specially ""Saving private Ryan (1998)"" I gave it a 4/10, just for the first 20 minutes of it. If I was to judge Tom Hanks 1/10 would be tooooo much for me!.
Having really enjoyed any second of ""Saving (again - but this time) Mr. Banks"", I must say ""Mr. Tom Hanks I am grateful for proving me ignorant, shortsighted, stupid"", to say the least.
Thank you for making me laugh and cry beyond control!On the other side stands Miss Emma Thompson.
I always adored her and she was, once again, a spectacle!
By the way, is she married???A film, specially such a film, is not an one woman/man show.

"Entertaining story, made all the better by a wonderful cast!","Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) usually gets what he wants. But, a promise he made to his daughters twenty years ago, to bring the novel Mary Poppins to the screen, has been a big thorn in his side. No matter how he has approached or wooed the author, Brit P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) she has refused to sign over the rights. But, things change. Her money is running out and she does love her beautiful house and amenities. Therefore, this crabby lady finally agrees to come to Los Angeles and meet with Disney himself. When she arrives, she is met by a very personal limo driver (Paul Giamatti) but she shows him no warmth. Nor does the hotel room, filled with Disney stuffed animals, change her attitude. Most of the creatures go in a closet, while Mickey Mouse has to sit in the corner. At the studio, the celebrated composers Richard (Jason Schwartzman) and Robert Sherman are targets of her unpleasantness, as are all of the other staff members. Just why is this dame so contrary, when everyone is rolling out the bright red carpet? In flashback, the viewer learns of her difficult, unstable childhood in Australia. Especially sad is her relationship with her father, Travers Goff (Colin Farrell), who sparked her imagination, when he wasn't drinking and losing jobs. In addition, he dies young and the children are subjected to stuffy Aunt Ellie (Rachel Griffiths). What will it take to please Miss Travers and get her name on the dotted line? For all movie fans who love the terrific Disney classic, Mary Poppins, here is the tale of how it almost never got made! Ms. Travers was one witch-on-wheels whose demands were only exceeded by her horrible disposition. Yes, she had a difficult childhood, which explains but does not excuse her perpetual coldness. Only Emma Thompson could bring her to life with some small saving graces. The rest of the cast, too, is superb, with Hanks, Griffiths, Giamatti, Schwartzman, and company doing a fantastic job. Especially noteworthy is Farrell; never has he been so touching or polished. The sets, from Down Under to sunny California, are also great, as are the costumes, well conceived script and confident direction. The meaning of the title is realized slowly but is memorable. All in all, don't save a showing of this movie for a rainy day. See it before the wind changes indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks Miscast and Cannot Carry the Movie as Walt Disney,"Tom Hanks is miscast here. He could not bring out the real Walt Disney -- who appeared every week as himself on ""Walt Disney Presents"". Disney did not have a forced southern accent, like Hanks deploys, and Hanks' outlook and mannerisms did not fit the reality of the Walt Disney.It is hard to act at this level, granted, but Hanks did not even try. He simply leaned on his already successful career rather than try to act in this movie.
Hanks is a movie star, but he shows here he cannot act.The movie would be much better without Hanks in it. This probably is not a hindrance to young people who have never heard or seen the real Disney. But thousands of hours of film on Disney is still around, and Hanks could have watched, learned, and tried.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Mr. Disney, Is That Really You?","Wait, what? Disney is making a film about Walt Disney? This surely can't be good or genuine. Fortunately, I was proved wrong because even for those who're desperately attempting to discover some substantial flaw, the movie quickly wins you over. Saving Mr. Banks essentially covers the real-life accounts of Disney's and P.L. Travers' (the author of Mary Poppins) relationship. By the time of the early 1960's, Walt Disney had already become the greatest of moguls in Hollywood and his vast empire had already been established. In sum, he was largely successful- living the dream- but one astronomical desire plagued his mind: the wish to capture one of his favorite books (Mary Poppins) on the big screen in typical, magical Disney fashion. However, Travers wasn't exactly the friendliest and easiest individual to work with, fretting over every single detail of life. Once her agent and Walt Disney Pictures finally convinces her to take a flight to LA and sign on for the project, firstly ensuring her significant control behind the production, the true issue emerges: how will the picture come to be when you have two powerful storytellers vying with their own visions? Throughout the narrative, we alternate between the present and Travers' past in which she grows up in Australia with a troubled family that are forced to deal with life-threatening difficulties.Basically, we're allowed the room to breath and laugh for a certain amount of time, and then, we're relocated to the tear-jerking story of her past, and it switches back and forth from thereon. This institutes a welcoming balance between raw emotion (I could honestly feel the tears lingering in my eyes, waiting to descend) and fun/hilarity. Using the sheer feistiness of Emma Thompson's character (Travers), we're met with plenty of hysterical scenes in which she struggles to adapt to an environment she's not exactly fond of. A significant factor behind the amusement- aside from its utter joviality- to be had with this film are the mesmerizing performances. Emma Thompson is exceptional and will undoubtedly be one of my nominees for Best Actress this year when considering her ability to convincingly pull off a truculent role, being exposed to various circumstances as we observe the genuine reactions. Colin Farrell portrays her alcoholic and deeply distressed father whenever we encounter yet another flashback. Needless to say, his performance definitely deserves recognition; in fact, Farrell and Thompson persistently compete with one another as I found both renditions highly remarkable. Rarely do I witness Farrell take on such a dramatic and mentally taxing role, and he fully delivers in this case. And, of course, we have everyone's favorite, Tom Hanks, who depicts Walt Disney in all his larger-than-life stature.Quite interestingly, the premise sees a rare storyteller (who still possesses artistic integrity and a strong will in what the next step is) face off against a standard businessman who is looking to persuade and reap profits. Here is ultimately where my issue lies: it seems like an overly positive and safe representation of the Walt Disney who (reportedly) infamously supported the Nazi's, carried a sexist mentality, and so on. That's particularly why I was bothered by Disney Pictures' involvement in this cinematic piece since- no matter what- they'd most absolutely downplay any negative characteristics of Walt Disney. With the story's progression, we never caught any hints of his greed (any instances were played off as light jokes), aggressive ambition for seizing his goals, etc. No, apparently, Walt Disney was thoughtful, kind, and joyous.As we continue along with this sensational tale, a terrific soundtrack, brought to you by the amazing Thomas Newman's talent and vigor, complements the varying emotion we encounter therein; sometimes lively and gleeful- effectively capturing the alluring atmosphere- and sometimes tragic and melancholy- focusing on the troublous life her younger self led- (what Newman does best as can be proved by the likes of Road to Perdition, The Green Mile, American Beauty, etc.). With that being said, some of the tracks feel slightly too similar to The Newsroom's theme song. From time to time, Newman enjoys repeating himself, but it's still beauty to one's ears, regardless.While we're on the subject of Travers' childhood, I found the whole ""flashback"" storyline more intriguing than the main one with the plot's advancement. There was just so much more transpiring in history- dramatic, surprising- while the present merely concentrated on Travers' predictable development as a human being. This being a Disney movie at the end of the day, to no surprise, the story loses a fair share of cynicism towards the end, and the last half an hour just feels too ""Disney-like,"" which is jarring when regarding the more authentic feel of the first half. In a predictable manner, Travers loses that fiery flare, and a sense of sentimentality suddenly invades the story. All in all, there's no doubt that I immensely enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks, and the time of year is certainly fitting for such a pleasurable and humorous experience. There's too much likability within for me to expect any probable disappointment, and thus, I enthusiastically recommend this magical picture to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A spoonful of sugar indeed! Saving Mr. Banks is a great movie about two creative geniuses.,"I can understand why authors are very protective of their works and characters. To write a good story, one must fully understand who their characters are. Why does Jay Gatsby hold his parties? Why does little Matilda love going to school? Why is Charlotte committed to saving Wilber the pig? All of these characters have long backstories that explain their motivation and how their relationship works with others. A lot of authors will have built up their characters so well that they've become close friends. So if someone calls to say that they want to put their own interpretation on the subject, it can become quite frightening to imagine someone else working on it.This probably makes it a convenience that most of the writers of the fairy tales that Walt Disney Pictures has produced have long passed on. The company doesn't have to worry about people from estates trying to but in into areas where they have no experience. For the most part, they wouldn't have needed the authors anyway; the movies comes out fantastic. Not all of them are a home run, but Disney has built up it's reputation enough to make anyone trusting enough to let the studio produce their work. Wellalmost everyone; Walt Disney does everything he can to please P.L. Travers in Saving Mr. Banks.Did you know that Mary Poppins had a really troubling production? Let's take it back before this. Pamela Travers (played by Emma Thompson) was the author of the successful Mary Poppins books. Though they have made her a wealthy woman, her funds are starting to run low, due to her stubborn decision to not write more. She had declined many opportunities to make to the movies with Walt Disney who had wanted the rights since the thirties. In 1961, she finally takes up on the offer to go to Los Angeles to discuss the possibility.Though she's greeted with a nice driver Ralph (played by Paul Giamatti), sent numerous Disney related gifts, and a promise from Walt (played by Tom Hanks) that the story will be handled well, she's still reluctant to proceed. She finally gives in on the condition that she has final say. Her meetings with the other script writer and musicians Sherman brothers (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) don't go too well as she seems to say no to everything. As Walt tries everything he can to make her happy, Miss. Travers constantly remembers her days growing up in Australia, and how her relationship with her father (played by Colin Farrell) became the inspiration for the stories.This is not a movie about Walt Disney. This is a story on P.L. Travers. And just because the Disney Company produced the movie doesn't mean that they will be sugar coating it. This is an honest story on how her unruly attitude had not only made the production on Mary Poppins tough, but had also cost her a chance at having a close family. Emma Thompson nails the part in every direction, making it harder on everyone else to live up to her.Luckily, the rest of the cast does just as well. Tom Hanks again pulls another great performance as Walt Disney, making him gentle, but a hard worker. Both Schwartzman and Novak are great as musicians who are probably the best in the industry. Even Colin Farrell shows a lot of emotion as P.L. Travers father. The story is edited in a brilliant fashion as Saving Mr. Banks uses the songs from Mary Poppins to cut to the authors past life. This is a true experience that will make you laugh, tear, and ultimately smile.I'll give this ten spoonful's of sugar out of ten. Saving Mr. Banks is a perfect movie about a relationship between two artistic geniuses. If you have any interest in the Disney Company, Mary Poppins, or simply how literature becomes adapted into film, this is something that you need to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Disney film like no other.,"It takes place in 1961, P.L. Travers(Emma Thompson) travels to California, in hopes to talk to Walt Disney(Tom Hanks) at Disney studios, to convince him not to bring her book Mary Poppins to the big screen, cause of her disliking for Hollywood adaptations, but Walt convinces her that she will have say so in all the productions. But also during this time, we go in flashbacks to Travers childhood on what inspired Mary Poppins.A very well made film, as we get in the heads of Travers and Disney, and trying to understand both there points of view. Hanks and Thompson both give terrific performances, really bringing these true to life people to life. The other supporting players don't disappoint either. The sixties setting was well done, and not to mention the flashbacks scenes also. Not to mention an Oscar worthy performance by Colin Farrell as Travers father.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Touch everyones emotions.,When you want to bring to life a book to screen can be such a challenging journey. Yet this is exactly what Walt Disney had achieved. This is a story of such passion and commitment that this brings out and as the author was in no doubt reliving her childhood memories touches your very emotions to the core. Sometimes we hold onto grief believing we are doing the right thing for the ones we lost along the way. But just as Walt Disney could see in this great story he wanted to pass on something that is more valuable than the physical e.g the book or movie it was hope based on imagination. This was a sad story but he knew it could be told which compassion and fellow feeling that could touch all of us. We all would like to tell our story and perhaps fabricate the ending so that all of us can come to terms with our loses that happen to us along our life's journey. This gives us time to reflect on our own past experiences and to reconcile with them. Great job!,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best movie of 2013,"I saw this film twice the week it came out. It is magical and glorious. It made me feel so good I had to see it again to figure out why.""12 Years A Slave"" and ""Philomena"" are incredibly wonderful films which I regard as must-sees, but ""Saving Mr. Banks"" hit me in a way that I almost think was religious. The impact of the film is encapsulated in an amazing scene near the end of the film in which Walt Disney tells Pamela Travers why Mary Poppins is so important to him. I don't want to say more or it would be a spoiler, but watch for that scene and don't get up to go to the toilet then!! It is so beautiful.There is a great deal of humor in the film, much of it due to Pamela Travers' eccentricities, but we see very serious flashbacks throughout the film which help us to understand why the Mary Poppins stories were so important to Travers. Colin Farrell does an Oscar-worthy job of portraying the father in those flashbacks.Yes, they changed the true story a bit to make this movie. Apparently Disney and Travers never went to Disneyland together and certain other details were changed. But a lot of it is very real, and they used tapes of meetings between Travers and the Disney folks to recreate some key conversations. At the end of the movie, as the credits roll, they actually play one of those real tapes, so you can see that what you just saw was not unlike the reality of those meetings. I have read a great deal about the making of this film and P.L. Travers and I am impressed with the trouble they went to to make this film. Travers was far too complex to portray her thoroughly in this film, and I forgive the filmmakers for changing certain details. The end result here is far more beautiful than a straight, 100% true bio-pic would be.Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak, Colin Farrell, Ruth Wilson and little Annie Rose Buckley did wonderful jobs portraying their characters. You will want to see this film over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable.  Could have done better.,"This is not one of those films I'd rush out to see at the cinema, despite the casting, it just didn't entice me to spend £15 for myself and my husband to see it, and another £10 for supper afterwards. But I digress. This title is now on Netflix. It is not for children, as the flashbacks are a bit too dark for children. As a matter of fact, the flashbacks are what holds it back completely. A brief scene wherein Mrs Travers discusses her childhood (briefly) with someone would have been enough. As it was, these scenes dragged the film down both in time and emotion. It wasn't bad, and Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks were absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. But it could have been so much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"As Mary Poppins would say: ""supercalafragalisticexpialidocious""","One of my personal favourite films of the year for sure. Whether it plays loose with the facts(at the end and with the portrayal of Walt Disney) makes little difference to me, regardless of any inaccuracy it is much more important whether the film in question is well-made, well-acted and has emotional and entertainment value. Saving Mr Banks has all of those. The film is beautifully photographed and the period detail is colourful and in the flashbacks evocative. The music is not inappropriate in style and fits with the tone of the script very well, also when you find yourself singing along to the songs included you know something's right. The story is incredibly engrossing, the cleverly interwoven flashbacks are incredibly poignant especially the latter ones, the backstage business with Travers' battles with the production crew and Walt Disney are informative and entertaining and all the references to Mary Poppins- in how the film was made and Travers' opinions on some aspects, in the songs and what the characters and their behaviour were inspired from(especially with Travers' father and Aunt Ellie)- are easy to spot and make you feel very nostalgic. John Lee Hancock's direction is spit spot, I never found myself bored for a second and the acting is great. Tom Hanks is a joy as Walt Disney and his chemistry with Emma Thompson is more than believable, especially in the scene in her house. Paul Giamatti is incredibly endearing as well, the standout of the supporting cast, though Colin Farrell and Annie Rose Buckley also give very good performances. The best assets of Saving Mr Banks are the script and especially Emma Thompson. The script is very witty comedically and is sharply observant, as well as the constant entertainment it also packs an emotional wallop especially towards the end. Mr Banks' redemption always resonated with me in Mary Poppins especially from an adult perspective, and the same happened in the ending scene(it also compelled me to watch Mary Poppins again, still is one of my favourite films regardless of what Travers thought of it). Thompson is outstanding, Travers is a more interesting character than Walt here but this is her film really so that wasn't an issue, she pitches Travers' stubbornness and cantankerous personality perfectly and there is a melancholic vulnerability in her performance too. Travers doesn't behave at all like a nice person here, but from the flashbacks you can really relate to her and understand why she's the way she is, which aside from context struck me as the reason for why they were included in the first place. Overall, a truly great film and one of the little gems of 2013. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just Brilliant,"I will be the first way to say that this is pretty much my ideal film: Tom Hanks and a story about an Animation Studio, however i can honestly say that all that aside this is a must see film. I did not know the story behind how Mary Poppins came to be and it is such an interesting one and shows some great things about this industry. It has made me revisit Mary Poppins and see it in a new light. Saving Mr Banks is a great film that has been put together really well (what would you expect; a Disney film about Disney). Emma Thompson is far from my favourite actress, but she deserves all the praise that she receives from this film. Also, the actress who plays Ginty is also great and i think we will be seeing her in the future. Don't be fooled by the Disney aspect. This is a great film and well worth a watch. I admire all the other reviewers who have written essays, but this is my brief summary!!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
With a spoon full of hog snot,Four stars because Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson could actually break through the sugar coating encasing this movie. Both characters were played perfectly (and I'm not concerned with historical accuracy) P.L. Travers is charmingly petulant and Disney is just effusive enough to be believed.But the rest of the movie suffers a lacking of intensity and substance. It is just way too sweet to be entertaining. I honestly believe the director wanted to create a look and feel of a 'family' movie that would have been real box office in 1961!And poor Colin Farrell - stuck in those hopelessly melodramatic and clownish flash backs that do nothing but pollute the story. They are totally unnecessary to the plot. The movie would have been far more tolerable and make just as much sense without them.And one more thing - whats with all those big eyebrows???

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"You may be attracted to this film by the two lead actors Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and, your instincts would be right. These two pull off a wondrous piece of story telling that feels genuine and authentic. Thompson and Hanks have done their homework and manage to incorporate true to life characterisations. A shame Colin Farrell couldn't manage the same as his character stands alone as forced and contrived - maybe he was trying too hard to encapsulate PL Travers' 'idealisation' too much. However romantic her memory, there is still room to make the character grittier. I feel Jude Law might have made a better choice for this role. Paul Giamatti is the readily identifiable US actor you can never name - in this vehicle doing an impression of Eric Morecombe, or so it seemed to me. It is the Ralph (Giamatti)character that enables the pathos of the story to unfold. Funny, interesting, sad and entertaining all in one film. Lovely.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The making of a classic.,saving Mr. Banks is a wonderful film about real people who have real problems. Back in 1961 the words child abuse were never uttered. There was Love duty and devotion. Achild took what was given to them and made the best of it. Even if it scarred the adult lurking inside.The Film opens with Mrs P.L.Travers facing the loss of everything. Her Mary Poppins books have stopped selling. She will not write anything more . and most of all she is faced with losing her home. But there is one flicker of hope. Walt Disney has reached out to her. and wants to buy the rights to Mary Poppins. Disney Wonderfully played by Tom Hanks . Has been chasing the rights to Mary Poppins for over 20 years. And Now he might have his chance. But Travers isn't that foolish. She wants Mary Poppins done her way or not at all. She demands script approval Casting approval and whatever else she can get her hands on. Disney it seems is willing to co operate as far as he can. But Travers is such a hateful vindictive woman that working with her is a mission impossible. Nothing goes right for any of them Travers refuses to budge. The smallest things Set her off . She hates moustaches and when Disney orders Mr. Banks to have one she flies into a tantrum. No one knows why until she leaves in a angry huff. and buys a plane ticket using her real name. Disney uses that and tracks her down to England where they have a heart to heart talk. and they realize they both have the same demons. Except Disney refuses to let his win. Travers melts a little and they finally make Mary Poppins. Travers still hated it . The Story is quite good. the acting is believable. Saving Mr banks is a movie that should have won an Oscar for Tom Hanks . And Emma Thompson. But the real tragic end to all of this is P/L. Travers died alone. as her son said loving no one and no one loving her. That is a tragedy of epic proportions . MAybe thanks to this movie she could be understood better.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dramatic Inside Look Behind the Scenes of Mary Poppins,"This is a deeply emotional and inspiring untold story of ""Mary Poppins."" The premise is based on the true journey of Pamela L. Travers (Emma Thompson), the author of the book. We learn it's going to take Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) a lot of hard work to get Ms. Travers to share our favorite flying nanny, Mary Poppins.This film is totally character driven. Tom Hanks is the first actor to portray Walt in a mainstream film. Tom trained for this by visiting ""The Walt Disney Family Museum"" and talking with Disney's former employees including his daughter Diane Disney Miller. Tom is Walt! He captures the dream, drive, and love for life that Walt believed in and you buy every word he says. They also respect Walt's wishes of never showing him with a lit cigarette. Of course, any leading man has a leading lady and we have a phenomenal portrayal of Ms. Travers by Emma Thompson. Emma trained, like Tom, by listening to the recording of the script read-through and practicing the way Pamela spoke. What adds up is a fantastic performance. You feel her emotion and why she is a stick-in- the-mud. This film's cinematography is spot on. It takes place over time from 1906, with vintage clothing and horse carts, to1961, with old cars and urban settings. The way they shift from time period to time period is flawless.My favorite scene is when Mrs. Travers observes the film for the first time. You see all of the emotional scarring that she has kept inside her whole life, come out. I can say that Emma's performs this amazingly well.Honestly, it's hard to pick my favorite character. Surprisingly I choose Ralph (Paul Giamatti), Mrs. Travers' chauffeur. He's the first person who Pamela likes and once you see this film you'll understand how big of an achievement that is. Paul's warm and humble performance has an affect on me that is unexplainable.The moral of the story is, don't let the past rule your present. Pamela has a hard time giving ""Mary Poppins"" up and, with her sad childhood, you can see why. However, she needs to understand that it's time to let it all go.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for 12-18 year olds. This film is little more emotionally heavy than the trailer shows. It's a lighthearted film, but sensitive kids may have difficulty with some scenes.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst dot org.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Super.............. (fill in the rest)!!!!,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a ""supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" flick about how the Disney classic ""Mary Poppins"" popped into its development. The movie stars Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the author of the ""Mary Poppins"" novel who refused for years for her eye-popping book to be adapted into a Disney movie no matter how eagerly Sir Walt Disney tried to persuade her. Due to financial problems, Travers reluctantly takes the road well-traveled and decides to travel to Hollywood and meet with Walt and the Disney movie clan. However, she does have lots of reservations about how Disney wants to tinker with her ""Mary Poppins"". Sorry that I am feeding you a spoonful of puns, by the way. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" delves in also to Travers' childhood, most notably her relationship with her loving, but alcoholic father. But the magic of this movie is witnessing the interactions between Walt Disney and P.L. Travers. Director John Lee Hancock, who previously helmed ""The Blind Side"", opens our eyes on dreams, imagination, wonder, adversity, insistence, and of course magic; which are all elements Hancock had a hand in to make ""Saving Mr. Banks"" worth the ride. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay was divine. Thompson's performance was excellent as Travers, and it was a bit of a travesty that she did not get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Tom Hanks not only helped save Private Ryan, but also had a hand in ""Saving Mr. Banks"" with his superb charismatic performance as Walt Disney himself. Other worthy supporting turns came from Colin Farrell as Travers' father, Paul Giamatti as Disney limo driver Ralph, and B.J. Novak & Jason Schwartzman as film composers Robert & Richard Sherman. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a lovely movie that everyone should experience, and you can take that to the bank. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Possibly the most likable film of 2013,"Saving Mr Banks is the true story of Walt Disney trying to persuade PL Travers to let him adapt Mary Poppins for the big screen. Although we all know how the story's going to end, this is one of those films where disliking it is nearly impossible. Aside from the excessive runtime, what's not to like? The Academy snubbed SMB, but it really shouldn't have been snubbed while American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club got so many nominations. Emma Thompson should have been nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Travers, which is one of the best performances from any actress in 2013. Both hilarious and heartfelt, she absolutely owns the film. Tom Hanks as Walt Disney isn't quite as noticeable, but is still excellent. All the other actors are good as well, with a surprisingly moving performance from Colin Farrell. SMB is told with 2 timelines, one a series of flashbacks, unfolding simultaneously. This doesn't get in the way of the film overall and the flashbacks are timed well so as not to break the flow.SMB may not be full of dancing animals, syrup, endless singing, one dimensional love stories and overloads of colour but it's one of the most delightful movies Disney has ever made. It's a very funny film with loads of sharp dialogue and plenty of wit, and it's well directed by John Lee Hancock, but it's also a very moving film. Both a true story rendered in touching and hilarious fashion and a thought provoking examination of where authors get their ideas from, SMB is a wonderful film and nearly surreally enjoyable. And there's not an explosion or action sequence in sight. It'll make you laugh and quite possibly cry as well. A wonderfully uplifting movie, SMB may be seen as slight and sentimental by some, but in terms of moving and entertaining dramas there aren't many better alternatives. You don't even have to like Disney to enjoy this delightful crowd pleaser.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"So it's not the whole truth, but who cares","There's one flow in the logic of this masterful film that makes you realize you don't see the whole truth of the story behind the struggle between P.L.Travers, and Walt Disney over the rights for Mary Poppins. I mean there're so many things she opposed with passion, and we still know the film was almost exactly as first presented to P.L.Travers, something more should have happened for her not only to give the rights for the story to Disney the way it was finally made. Thing is, I just saw the film, I realized this flaw was in the script and I still didn't care. It was all made so superbly that even the tear-jerker minutes abundant in this movie are forgiven. Emma Thompson is simply superb, as the bitter angry woman, forced to sell her only bankable treasure. As it was already mentioned in one of the previous reviews here, making this bitter misanthropic character likable, is a task only one of the very best could master. Tom Hanks, is as superb as her, I still remember Walt Disney presenting his TV hour, only problem is I'm not sure if I remember him doing it or Tom Hanks, with very little apparent makeup, Hanks simply is Disney, at least the way that Disney's company want us to remember him, but as Hanks plays him - that's the way we also want to remember him. The rest of the cast is as stellar as the two leads - not a single false note in the symphony. The story flows superbly cutting between P.L. Travers memories of her childhood, her lonely life at the time of the main story, and the Disney studio glimpses of the would be film offered to the unrelenting author. Most of the jokes are very gentle ones almost Britishly understated, and it works for the film.Bottom line, it may not be exact history, but it's definitely a good story told as engagingly as possible in my book, and I liked it for this very reason.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Story Behind Mary Poppins,"Although the film is not entirely based on fact, every film takes some artistic license, even biographies. It was a great story to watch about the making of one of the most beloved Disney films of all time, Mary Poppins, and the trouble they had doing so.Tom Hanks probably was not the best choice for Walt Disney, as he made no effort to use Walt's mannerisms or vocal pattern at all. I would give his acting a mere 6/10 for effort. Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers was extraordinary, as she was very much indeed closer to the real Travers' voice.I especially liked the role that Bradley Whitford played as the timid writer of the screenplay, Don DaGradi, who must deal with Travers' many tantrums as she had creative control over the screenplay. It was a very well made film, from start to finish.However, I am unclear as to why it received a PG-13 rating by the MPAA. But it was great, which is why I gave it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Mary Poppins, the governess that came from heavens","I think there's not one soul among us that doesn't know that arrogant and well-disciplined governess Mary Poppins, who flies using her enormous black umbrella. We get to know Mary Poppins, who has a wardrobe reminiscent of a regular 19th century English woman, as a super hero coming from heavens with dark colored clothes and a gigantic hat. In fact, what identifies Mary Poppins is the coal black umbrella of hers. Chosen as a ""metaphorical"" symbol of the gloomy rainy weathers of England, black umbrella is an important element that we identify Mary Poppins with. In reality, Mary Poppins is a very special person, because she has her own unique feature. She can tidy up a messy room just with a finger snap, she can fly and she can take out enormous household goods just from her small handbag. Having children under her spell with her magical powers, there's no impossible for Mary Poppins. If you could manage to do this, we can continue to how Mary Poppins have been realized. Based on a true story, Mr. Banks shows us the behind the scenes of this Disney classic and tells us the story of the unstable relationship between legendary Walt Disney and author P. L. Travers. When his daughters persistently asked him to shot the film of their favorite book Mary Poppins, Walt Disney promised them that he would, but he didn't realize at that time that keeping his promise would take 20 years. Consist of the merged main and side stories, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" shows the inner world of the author Travers perfectly. While we're already talking about main and side stories, we should give details on these subjects. Within the side story, we watch ""behind the scenes"" moments of Mary Poppins and within the main story we watch the relationship between the author and Walt Disney. For example, when a 'flashback' cuts in, we see the ""behind the scene"" enactments of Mary Poppins. Besides, these enactments consist of phantasms and reality intertwined. Well then, how does phantasm and reality intertwine? Within the scenes, where phantasm dominates, Travers imagines the scenes that will be shot. Telling us the events happened between 1906 and 1965 from his own point of view, the author reminds us that we're watching a ""film within a film"". He already is the eyes and ears of the film! In fact, having us identify ourselves with Mary Poppins, Travers reminds us Poppins' umbrella by using the ""rain provides life"" cue. Another detail is that the relation between object and character is as right as rain. For example, there are Walt Disney toys in Travers' hotel room. Eh, at the end, the movie was being produced by Walt Disney! But what impressed me most is that director John Lee Hancock, who uses vivid colors, turned the scenes, shot in 2:35:1 CinemaScope format, into a visual feast. This visual feast reflects the beginnings and the middle of the 1900s so good that you want the time machine has already been invented, so that you can travel back. The movie, really, embraces us and due to its strong aura, all the scenes become engraved on your mind. Let's cut to the Travers' experiences, which is the main theme of the movie. Sometimes, Travers' anger and dissatisfaction raise difficulties for the production. Because the author always worries about that the film won't be able to reflect the essence of the book. For me, the most important thing is Walt Disney's 20 years long perseverance to keep his promise to his children. But it looks like, the life Travers led let her down so much that she can't shake off all her bitterness and bad temper. The most obvious evidence of the bad temper of rebellious and delirious Travers is the lonely life she led. In fact, she was so lonely that Mary Poppins was her only friend. Actually, was not this the only reason for Walt Disney to pursue Travers? Actually, the most interesting part of this story is the ""Mr. Banks"" character which was inspired from the deceased father of the writer. May be this is the reason of her bitterness. Who knows? In general, Travers' conversation with Walt Disney's toy may be the sign of the loneliness and dissatisfaction of the writer who has chosen solitude after all she has been through. Because, used as a metaphor, the Disney toy makes all the problems, buried deep inside Travers' personality, burst out. According to our analysis, Travers either postponed these problems or enshrined her own loneliness into her heart. When examined superficially, the perfect story-line and the marvelous acts of Emma Thompson, who plays Travers, and Tom Hanks, who plays Walt Disney, make a cold fact appear before us. According to that cold fact, what we watched on the screen was multi-layered; and we get aware of this fact only at the end of the movie. The message is so deep that it's hard to forget all along our life; because, maybe we will never watch another movie that teaches a powerful humanity lesson. However, it wouldn't be right to finish the article without making this small critic: I think it was a bit irrational to show Colin Firth, who plays Mr. Banks, whose also gives his name to the title of the movie, within so few scenes. Hence it looks like something outweighed. And also, even, incorrect portrayal of Mary Poppins' character within the scenes that show the behind the scenes moments of the original film tops it all. I wonder why they didn't put any scene that shows Mary Poppins flying with her umbrella, which is a token of her identity? It's hard to find a logical answer. It seems like, the behind the scenes was a bit mediocre. There could be more details. In a nut shell: Even there were some faults, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a movie that can convey the feeling to the audience and become a friend with them successfully.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Deep Fusion of Genres,"23 January 2014. The biggest question about Saving Mr. Banks is even how to describe it. There doesn't seem to be any single word or even several words that captures this movie. It doesn't easily fit a movie genre or category. The fascinating weaving of past and present unfolds a movie that is a mystery, a comedy, a drama, a psychological thriller, a historical biographical, a period piece, that incorporates music numbers, relational themes, family, and even alcoholism.The movie offered a well edited, weaving of past and present that seamlessly enhanced the movie. This multi-layered, substantively faceted movie was rich with subtexts and deeper emotional and cognitive insight. In some ways, Saving Mr. Banks is unique in its rich delivery and depiction of the human condition, using historical facts, imagination, and popular myth to create an apparently serious magical experience.While no movie might be directly compared to Saving Mr. Banks, this movie retains or captures the tone or some of the qualities of such movies as Finding Neverland (2004), a Johnny Depp vehicle where fantasy and reality collide in a bittersweet love story about the man who wrote Pan Peter; The Weatherman (2005), a strong drama about a television weather man played by Nicolas who is going through the disruptive experience of divorce, his attempts a reconciliation, coping with challenging children, and a father played by Michael Caine who himself undergoes a life-altering experience; Moliere (2007), a French produced period comedy drama that provides laugh at in a layered movie about the comedy actor who must disguise himself at a rich man's estate and deal with a love interest at the same time; Punch-Drunk Love (2002), a new type of love story starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson; and Hitchcock (2012),a movie that provokes visceral, intense human emotions of sorrow, fear, passion, and redemption packaged in a movie premised around a horror film.Emma Thompson's performance is of particular note for her portrayal of Mrs. Traver's who wrote Mary Poppins. Her character performance under the direction of John Lee Hancock was memorable for the delicate balance between the nastiness and unpersonable personality such depicts and the more appealing nature of the overall tone and theme of the movie. Meryl Streep accomplished as much in The Devil Wears Prada (2006).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fab,"Are you kidding me? This is the adult's answer to all the Disney questions you have ever had. It is a marvelous reminder that life is not easy. Period. Thank you for this revelation about Mr. Disney and Mr. Banks. Bravo!Emma Banks so fabulously British, Mr. Disney so predictably American, but so similar. Who doesn't need reminding that it is important but so difficult to get beyond reality and to just enjoy life?So why didn't this film win more awards? Maybe because Tom Hanks was only almost believable? And that is retained the Poppins feel and sets? No flashy wardrobe or sets here, just the real thing. This film captures the essence of the era, and IMHO should have received way more accolades than it did.Thank you Rachel Griffiths for providing such a powerful presence and answering so many childhood questions. You rock on!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
You'll need more than a spoonful of sugar to get the bad taste out of your mouth.,"'Saving Mr. Banks (2013)' tells the story of how P. L. Travers was beaten into submission by Walt Disney when the latter finally managed to convince her to sell him the rights to her popular literary creation, Mary Poppins. The piece frames this as a positive thing, as happy ol' Walt helping the curmudgeonly author overcome her past traumas and see life in a supposedly better, more blindly optimistic light. In reality, though, it was no such thing, and Travers never came around to Disney's way of thinking, despite selling the rights to him. The idea that Travers' rough-around-the-edges persona is entirely due to her daddy issues is almost as ridiculous as the idea that Disney himself could psychoanalyse her issues out of existence with a single conversation. As is the concept that Travers could only achieve catharsis by watching a (in her opinion) butchered filmic adaptation of her work; if catharsis could be achieved via her work, it would surely be in the process of writing it. In either case, it's highly debatable whether or not the story meant as much in real life to Travers as it does in the film. Regardless of its inaccuracies (which feel like deliberate efforts from the mega-corporation to smooth over its rocky past and paint itself as the hero), the movie itself just isn't all that interesting. The second half is better than the first, and I'd be lying if I didn't say some sequences were effective in what they were trying to achieve. The performances are all solid, too. However, the overall affair is just so basic, perhaps almost insulting, that it's hard to take it as seriously as it would like you to. The first half is just plain boring, presenting us with an unlikable and unnecessarily rude protagonist who we're eventually supposed to come around on because she has daddy issues. The second sees a mix of self-congratulatory 'inception' scenes wherein the Disney creators come up with elements we recognise from 'Mary Poppins (1964)' (elements which, often, Travers strongly opposes) and scenes in which the men of Disney wonder what they're going to do about Travers and her steadfast desire to protect her work (which is framed as being stubbornness, rather than a creator standing up for their creation). The most accurate part of Disney's portrayal is the moment in which he literally says ""I did this for monetary gain."" Even when it's at its most successful, the film is only ever so engaging. It's well made from a technical point of view, but its story leaves a bit of a bad taste in the mouth. Even a spoonful of sugar doesn't seem to help. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Practically perfect in every way!,"If you enjoy ""Mary Poppins,"" then you will enjoy this movie because I love it! ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is about an author name, P.L. Travers who travels from London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney as they debate some of the ideas to create one of the most beloved films of all time. You already know the history on how the movie ""Mary Poppins"" came to be so no need to go into much detail about it because this movie tells you everything on what happened during the behind the scenes of ""Mary Poppins."" Unlike most movies that are based on true events, this movie is the first time to shows the ideas and the creativity beside recreating the sets from a well-known movie like ""Ed Wood"" or ""Hitchcock."" The cast in this movie are terrific. Emma Thompson does a great job for playing the author of ""Mary Poppins."" She does start off as a woman that you want to smack her in the face for being too critical on Disney; the songs; and the ideas that the filmmakers were going for. The movie does show her past on how young she was as she was once cute before turning into an unlikable person. However, the more you understand her and the more you feel sorry for her. With that said, Tom Hanks is absolutely remarkable as playing Walt Disney. He did captured the spirit on who and what Disney really is, and remaining true to his character. Colin Farrell and the rest of the cast all did great on their own. Thomas Newman's score is one of his greatest scores that he has ever done in his career. The film's cinematography and its setting is also really beautiful to look at; it really doe have that Disney magic, and it is also fun to see Disneyland in the movie. John Lee Hancock does a fantastic job on directing the movie. My only issue with the movie is the ending, because they never bother to show Travers after showing ""Mary Poppins"" to the movie's premiere and tells Disney on how much as she hates the movie, and thinks that it needs to be fixed. After Travers giving her thoughts on the movie, Disney tells her ""Pam, that ship has sailed."" I just thought it would have been something to show, but that is just a minor nitpick. Of course, I understand the filmmakers didn't want the movie to end like that because for what I understand from Thompson's interview is that the movie focuses on Daddy issues which is why they never end on Travers giving her thoughts on the movie. Even Richard Sherman, the man who wrote songs for ""Mary Poppins"" and consulting ""Saving Mr. Banks"" says that Travers is just a contradicting woman. In most interviews, she would say on how much she hates the movie, and in some rare interviews she would say on how much she enjoy it. So I give that a free pass. Anyway, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is practically perfect in every way! I give it a 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superfragicaliwoopus!,"Touching and heartwarming, any cynicism I had about Fairy Tales have been washed away.Pundits might complain that ""It didn't happen that way"" - and in doing so, completely missed the point.I admit, I was biased going in. I grew up dreaming every day about my first trip to Disneyland. I grew up watching the Wonderful World of Disney. I saw Mary Poppins, more times than I should admit, and wished I had hopped into the drawing with Bert and Mary. So for me Saving Mr. Banks was wonderfully nostalgic. And that would have been enough.Emma Thompson was fantastic, and that would have been enough (I am a bit surprised she did not get a Best Actress bid).But this movies gives us much more.A masterful retelling of true events that throws the main character, and us, into our own personal Fairy Tale. The demons are our own, and that makes the hope that much more tangible.It's why we tell stories in the first place, and this movie reminds us of that.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fascinating,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a surprise for my husband who thought it would be boring. Be sure to stay to the end credits to hear the real Mrs Travers tape. The only disappointment, and it was a slight one, is that they obviously did not film the Australian flashback scenes in Australia. As an Australian, and Sydneysider, the initial houses looked like those out of Ocean Township N.J, not innerwest Sydney. The verandah on the outback house was closer but not quite right, especially with the large oak, not a gumtree beside it. We don't really have palm trees like in California. Anyway, it would have been a bit more authentic if they had filmed those bits in Australia but the acting from Farrell and the young girl playing a young Travers more than made for it. Emma Thompson was amazing - my mum insists on her tea being made exactly the same way and they even look similar (not ordinarily- just ET's appearance and manner in this film) :)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
From a bitter woman comes a magical tale.,"All I could think was how could a woman who was so disgustingly rude create such a fanciful lovely character. Boo hoo, just because you have a tough childhood that does not mean you get a free pass in life. The way she treated Walt Disney and the Disney family was disgraceful. All she did was write a few books, Walt Disney on the other hand created dreams. So while I may not like the woman who created Mary Poppins I do love the story.The subject matter may not be likable but Saving Mr. Banks is a really good movie. It's beautifully told and acted. Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson were most certainly the perfect choices for their respective roles. Even Colin Farrell does a good job at portraying Mrs Travers pathetic father. So it's a sad story, something I wasn't expecting but nevertheless a really good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Maybe The Best Movie I've Seen All Year,"As a child, one of my favorite movies was always ""Mary Poppins"". Being young, I obviously couldn't articulate exactly WHY I liked it so much (I'm sure the catchy music had a lot to do with it), but I wore a tract in the VCR with it, that is for sure. After seeing ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, I was astounding to realize perhaps part of the reason why ""Mary Poppins"" stands the test of time: because the message behind it is one born out of real-life issues.For a basic plot summary, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" focuses on P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the ""Mary Poppins"" children's novel. For 20 years, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been pursuing the rights to make the book into a movie, finally culminating in him flying Travers to Los Angeles to begin work on the project. When Travers wants full creative control and clashes monumentally with Disney's version of the film, it is revealed (via flashbacks) how personal the Poppins story truly is to Travers.The reason why this movie is so touching and genuine is because it works on two different levels:On one hand, it brings back incredible nostalgia for fans of Disney's ""Mary Poppins"". Just hearing the iconic music again and seeing how key plot/character points came together is exciting.On the other hand, those (though probably few and far between) who haven't seen the movie will still be intrigued by the fascinating backstory of P. L. Travers. More specifically, the role her father (played by Colin Farrell) played in her life and how that relationship shaped her persona even into adulthood. Some fascinating human dynamics that prove out the old ""truth is stranger than fiction"" maxim.The hallmark of ""Saving Mr. Banks"", though, is its ability to have audiences laughing, crying, singing, and feeling all in the span of two hours. The complex characters, catchy tunes, and use of flashbacks prove a potent mixture of drama and fun. This is truly a film for the entire family.Until recently, ""Prisoners"" had been cemented atop my ""Best Movie of 2013"" list. ""Saving Mr. Banks"", however, is just as good, if only in a completely different way. I'm sure I'll enjoy some more genre Hollywood fare this holiday.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everyone I love gets a copy of this movie this Christmas!,"So here's the deal: This movie is more or less a really close look on how ""Mary Poppins"" went from being a book to being in theaters around the world. While you may won't like this film if you expected something ""shocking"", you'll see that this may be one of the most emotion-filled/ best written movies since ""The King's Speech"" - with much better music. Beware of the fact, that this movie deals with some heavy topic (such as alcoholism and shattered expectations on life). I really recommend watching the original ""Mary Poppins"" before ""Saving Mr. Banks"" since this filmy heavily refers to scenes from P. L. Traver's/Disney's masterpiece. Expect some really heavy scenes, some good laughter and one of the best soundtracks you have heard in any movie in a long long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
elusive but captivating,"The best part about the film is that it starts with a positive note and ends on a positive note. Don't go to this movie for Tom Hanks he is brilliant as always but it is Emma Thompson who has done a marvelous job, portraying role of an impulsive lady and taking everyone else as a nincompoop. The movie starts slow and the viewers have to give full attention in the beginning just to enjoy the fruits of their patience in the later parts of the movie. The director John Lee Hancock has done a great job however, the screenplay of the movie is awesome in other words Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius as described in the movie.Go watch it but be patient because only once you have uncovered the thick skin you can get full taste of coconut.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fun little biography, though not without its faults","The worst and the best parts about Saving Mr. Banks intertwine a great deal. On the other hand, it's a delightful little tale about a woman learning to cope with her past and about the making of one of the best family films of all time. And yet, on the other hand, it looks at the past through rose-tinted glasses, ignores some of the uglier truths about what actually happened and is generally extremely cheesy and sugarcoated.I'd still claim I liked this film. Emma Thompson makes for such a delightful P.L. Travers that it's hard not to sympathize with her, no matter how despicably awful she acts towards anyone else or no matter how difficult she's being over the smallest of things. Fantastic role performance all around.The rest of the cast is likewise up to the task and wonderful, with perhaps the sole exception of Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. I'm not really sure what doesn't work here, but he seems to be perhaps a touch forced and overly jovial. This is pretty much the first time Walt Disney has ever been depicted on screen by the actual Disney Studios and you can definitely see they're trying to put their best foot forward with Hank's performance. Not that I'm saying the actual Walt Disney wasn't a kind and wonderful man with mountains of imagination and vision to share, but this character doesn't feel rounded enough to be a real person.And yeah, it's kind of hard to see this movie when you know that the actual P.L. Travers hated the sole film based on her books and wanted nothing to do with Disney ever since. Of course there are some who say she actually grew to like it, and I can't really blame Disney of all studios trying to go with the optimistic version, but there's optimism and then there's naivety. It's really up to each to decide for himself or herself whether they find this twisting of circumstances and facts acceptable.As a film Saving Mr. Banks is a lot of fun and filled with great role performances, good scenes and excellent storytelling. As a biography it leaves a lot to be desired, but you kind of knew that even without me telling you, didn't you.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
LOVED this film more than I ever thought I would,"A film about the making of Mary Poppins seemed at first not to interest me. I was 15 when the real Mary Poppins film came out, much too old to think of it as teenage fare but my neighbor next door five years younger than I kept singing and singing and singing ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" Who knew the story behind the story of the making of this movie? This was one of the best films I have seen this year, right up there (although a different film) with the excellence of ""12 Years a Slave."" It has a depth I never in a million years thought it would have had. No spoilers here because truly one has to see it to appreciate its heft.I loved every minute of it. Kudos to Tom Hanks, Emma Thompson and all the rest who played major (and minor) parts. Each was wonderful. It is a touching, sad, beautiful and uplifting film. One can only hope more films such as this would be made where gratuitous sex, profanity and violent mayhem are absent. Hallelujah, it's about time!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
But I feel what's to happen...All happened before.,"""Winds in the east...Mist coming in...Like something is brewing...About to begin...Can't put me finger...On what lies in store...But I feel what's to happen...All happened before.""This was one of the few charming and sentimental films I fell for this year and a great deal has to do with the nostalgic effect that Mary Poppins has on me from my childhood. Yes it is schmaltzy at times and has a manipulative feel good vibe to it while at the same time self promoting itself, but I still was emotionally won over by this great story (and I don't care if most of it was made up, I still loved the film, I don't watch movies for facts). Saving Mr. Banks is smart and upbeat and will have you humming some of the songs from the beloved classic long after the credits have rolled. This is the best marketing Disney has come up with to promote Mary Poppins, and a lot of the success is owed to Emma Thompson for delivering such a powerful performance. Her character could be easily disliked for being so severe and unpleasant to others, but Thompson redeems her by allowing us to see where her pain comes from and how much the novel really meant to her. Tom Hanks is also great as Walt Disney and he would've received more recognition for this film if it weren't for those brilliant last 5 minutes in Captain Phillips that stole all the thunder from his performance here. Supporting roles from Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, and Jason Schwartzman make this an even more powerful film. Credit also must be given to the screenwriters, Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, who managed to deliver a charming story while including engaging flashbacks of Travers' past.Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) promised his daughters that he would bring the beloved Mary Poppins novel to the big screen, but it turned out to be a difficult task considering he has spent the last 20 years trying to convince P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to obtain the rights of her novel. Convinced that Disney will ruin her beloved book, she refuses to do so. Travers' agent convinces her to travel to California to meet with Disney and try to come up with an agreement considering she is running out of money. Travers spends the next two weeks working with screenwriters (the Sherman brothers played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) at Disney's facility making sure that the screenplay is written exactly how she wants it. Things get complicated as she refuses to compromise to basic things Disney wants to include in the film. The film also presents flashbacks of Travers' childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell) who she absolutely adored but had a drinking problem that eventually ruined him. Her childhood experiences shaped the book and that is why she is so reluctant to let someone else change her story.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side which was John Lee Hancock's prior film to this one and Emma Thompson might be a front runner to win for her performance as Travers. She makes this film much better than it actually is because if it wasn't for her Saving Mr. Banks would just be Disney schmaltz. I found it extremely hard not feel emotional about this film and it engaged me completely despite the lack of interest I had for the subject matter. I loved Mary Poppins as a kid, but that didn't mean I was interested in seeing a movie on how it was made. Despite all I've said about it being self promoting and manipulative I thought that what worked best was the integration of the flashbacks that allowed us to understand where Travers was coming from and reminds us how sometimes art is connected personally to the artist's past. That is why perhaps a film speaks to us in different ways because we too as an audience bring in our personal past and integrate it into a film finding a connection that perhaps others never will. That is the beauty of art, it affects us all in different ways.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Disney Classic - Saving Mr. Banks,"Ev er since I was a child in the fifties, I always thought very highly of Donald Duck comic books. The Mickey Mouse comics were OK, but the Donald Duck comics were much funnier. The additions of the nephews and Uncle Scrooge helped immensely.Then, as I got older, I left my Disney comics behind in the world of children. There was no room for Disney in the world of adults; or at least I thought so, until I saw this film.The vibrant performance of Emma Thompson brings the necessary energy that was required to bring Mrs. Travers to life. The always dependable Tom Hanks humanizes an icon that still remains remote to most of us. How could one man be so successful?To be sure, it is the animated Disney classics that are still most dear to our hearts; Pinocchio, Snow White, and Peter Pan. However, this film has strong adult issues as well; how to handle the loss of a loved one, how to overcome one's own insecurities and and biases, and most importantly, how to have fun again.The supporting cast of Colin Farrell and the talented Paul Giamatti only add to this very interesting tale. I highly recommend this film for all age groups.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fine example of Hollywood marketing,I get the sense that some reviewers here can't separate this movie from their nostalgia over Mary Poppins. While it's sensitive look at P.L. Travers somewhat tragic childhood I missed the part where this is a family movie as she segways back and forth between the flashbacks of an alcoholic father who then apparently dies tragically from TB/influenza and dancing penguins ... someone tell me where the wholesome family fun is in that. Disney is portrayed fairly inaccurately as well. In my usual quest of watching Oscar nominated movies I saw this movie and Nebraska within 48 hours of one another. The latter is easily twice the film of the much celebrated fictional glorification of Tom Disney or Walt Hanks (take your pick). Don't get me wrong the film was well done but doesn't live up to the hype and poetic waxing about the 1960's Wonderful World of the Magic Kingdom.,5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unduly overlooked and well worth the effort,"I, as an enormous fan of the 1964 film of Mary Poppins probably came into this movie with higher expectations than most. I was not disappointed in any way.I feel that both the film, and the two leads' performances have been for the most part ignored by many of the Film boards (possibly due to the number of great films made in the past year, but also could be an unwanted by-product of being a 'Disney' film). Emma Thompson was phenomenal and Tom Hanks was also very good. I enjoyed many of the supporting performances too - Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman and Colin Farrell just to name a few. The soundtrack had a great blend between songs from the movie and new score. The flashbacks and present-day scenes were skilfully woven together, and neither story-line dominated too much.Another delightful side-effect of this movie is a new layer when watching Mary Poppins. It was particularly amusing to see what demands of Travers' had been ignored! If you are a fan of the original film, you are almost guaranteed to enjoy this one. If not, you will probably still enjoy this film, but not to the same extent.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tale about the pre-production of musical-children movie 'Mary Poppins',"This is not the first time I saw a movie about the behind the making of a masterpiece works. Recent 'Hitchcock' described 'the man of mystery', Alfred Hitchcock's career best movie 'Psycho'. Johnny Depp's 'Finding Neverland' tells about behind the creation of a magical land and Peter Pan. So there are many other movies about theme like this. This movie is as well based on such kinda story which unleashes creation of the most celebrated musical-children movie 'Mary Poppins' from its book.Characters like the author of 'Mary Poppins' book, Travers played by Emma Thompson and Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks filled the screen with interesting moments of history. Especially the cultural differences between two countries, England and United States brought lots of humorous scenes to us. The story telling splits into two where one briefs the author's real life incident when she was a child lived in Australia. And another one was about Walt Disney's struggle by the threats from Travers, while being adapted the book into a movie.Both the characters, Travers and Disney had an uncompromising relationship in the story. Where Travers was fighting not to go wrong in the movie adaptation because the characters from her book means a lot to her. On the other hand, Disney's fight to keep what he promised to his children to make a movie from their favourite book.One of the best movie of the year. Tom Hanks was okay in a role of 'father of animation'. But I was impressed with the Emma Thompson and also the Collin Ferrell. Paul Giamatti's role was small but wonderfully portrayed. No wonder why this movie got nominated for 2014 Oscar in the music section. Was expecting it to win but failed to do, so sad.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Walt was a great Man, and Tom Hanks plays him perfectly.","I grew up watching Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Walt Disney himself would introduce the show each Sunday evening. He was a warm and wonderful man that we allowed into our living rooms. His studio showed us wonderful TV shows like Daniel Boone. Then there was the Mickey Mouse Club. A wonderful show we watched in the afternoons that showed us nice kids like us. I went to Disneyland shortly after it opened. What other man in the world could or would create a fantasy world for Children that adults could enjoy too? Anyone that says that Walt was an evil or rude man doesn't have any idea what they are talking about. Was he a business man? Sure. Did he have to talk people into doing things his way? Sure. That was part of his magic. He made the world a better place. Who doesn't love Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, Goofy, and on and on and on.Now as for Saving Mr. Banks, I have seen many documentaries of Walt Disney. Most of them pretty accurate, but kind of dry. This was a documentary that pulls you in. From Emma Watson to Colin Farrell to Tom Hanks, the cast is perfect. As you watch the movie you get drawn in. Your emotions go places you didn't expect. You fall in love with all the characters. You can even relate to their difficulties in life. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the movie. I loved the movie and found it mostly truthful. I suppose there was some hollywoodsy stuff in it, but nothing that distracted me. I can't say enough good things about this movie. I have seen it twice. One by myself because I didn't expect much. But after I watched it alone, I asked my daughter if she would like to see it. So, we watched it together. Well we laughed and cried together! And I will probably watch it again and share it with my Significant Other.Don't miss this movie. It is FANTASTIC!

Write what you know.,"Well,Mrs Travers certainly did that,basing her best known book ""Mary Poppins"" on her own somewhat fraught childhood. Having achieved that catharsis she had no wish to see her characters ""Disneyfied"" by a man whose only achievement as far as she could reckon was to have drawn a cartoon mouse and gotten very rich on it. Thus the contest began between this strong determinedly unimpressed Englishwoman and one of Hollywood's richest movie moguls for the ""soul"" if you like,of the world's favourite nanny. Well,we know of course that Mr Disney won her over eventually and ended up making possibly his best - ever film,and probably his most - loved. The ""Mr Banks"" in the title refers not only to Mr D.Tomlinson's character but that of her father,a gently alcoholic businessman in Australia on whom it was based. Miss E.Thompson is blindingly good as Miss Travers,charming yet steely right up to the end. Mr T.Hanks plays his usual good - humoured and slightly exasperated character,a turn he has made his own over the last 30 years. It's a sad and funny quite uplifting film - rather like ""Mary Poppins"" itself. Even if you haven't been to the pictures since 1964 when you sat down to watch Julie and Dick armed with a ""Kia - Ora"" and some popcorn I urge you to give it a go.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maybe not what you expect but what was done was done well,"This film was not my cup of tea. It did not quite match the trailers.Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has liked the books on Mary Poppins and wants to make a movie. However, he needs the permission of P. L. Travers / Helen Goff (Emma Thompson.) Travers is struggling with her view of a past life which prohibits her from seeing what Walt is trying to accomplish. Can the situation be adjusted?The film is slow-paced with a downer attitude. Emma does too good of a job of playing a bitter woman regardless of the outcome of the presentation. Lots of drawn-out downer music for the background. At least the music does not start blaring at odd moments or drown out the voices.The only real highlight of the movie is a Disney speech that is a tad long. It was necessary to explain what was only inferred in the first ¾ of the film.The magic kingdom that is displayed in the film looks like the one I visited.The film is not spectacular. Some people may give a good rating because of secondary items such as who the actors are or what the subject matter is. However, I look at the presentation as a whole.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two geniuses meet,"This is Walt Disney's first ""biography"", in a way of speaking--more specifically, it is how Mary Poppins flew to Hollywood. Emma Thompson (who also played an earlier nanny in the short lived Nanny McPhee franchise some years early) really conveys P.L.Travers's frequent reluctance and selfishness yet also her talent and magic, with Tom Hanks, no less as ""Walt"" (he didn't require titles to address him. Everyone was on a first name basis with him), fitting right into the role... You;ll see supporting plays like Paul Giamatti as the kindly limo driver who has the only true friendship with P.L.Travers, B.J.Novak & Jason Shwartzman as the famed Oscar winning songwriting Shermans, Bradley Whitford as Disney scribe Donald Da Gradif and even the famed Disney secretaries,(unsung actresses Kathy Baker as Tommie and Melanie Saxsson, who is real funny, as Dolly, the one who is in the sessions and brings snacks.) No fancy snacks, no animated Penguins or anything, no songs...you've heard all the (generally considered impossible to deal with) P.L.Travers requests. You'll see childhood Australian 1906 flashbacks of P.L., and you'll find out her real name and the reason for her temper later, in 1961. You'll also see that P.L. was both nice as a kid and only human as an adult, and that Walt Disney could be practically (to use Mary Poppins's obviously favorite adverb there) stubborn as P.L. was. You can hear the songs that the Shermans play, even an actual tape recording as P.L.Travers in real life and on screen insisted on. So, have a spoonful of sugar and see this.

The Story of How Mary Poppins Came To Be!,"In 1961, Walt Disney invited P.L Travers, the author of Mary Poppins to his California studios to negotiate the rights for her classic novel. The rest is history. Saving Mr. Banks is a movie that tells how the film adaptation came to be and the struggles that occurred during pre-production. The movie itself is charming and is an uplifting story as it is in classic Disney mode. The movie has strong acting and a wonderful score by Thomas Newman. The movie is funny and also sad. The film is also told by using flashbacks, in which the story is greatly enhanced as we see the influence of the characters in Mary Poppins.John Lee Hancock's film tells the story how Walt Disney was able to secure the rights to Mary Poppins. But it was no easy task. P.L Travers is a very proud and proper woman. Because of dwindling book sales and financial trouble, Travers agrees to travel to L.A where she supervises the script. But she is not too easily impressed and it takes a trip down memory lane in order to inspire her heart and her mind.The strongest suit of the film is the impressive acting. Emma Thompson delivers one of her best roles as the stern and sometimes downright mean Travers. Her on screen persona makes her character watchable, even if she is disliked. Tom Hanks takes a step back in a supporting role and I thought he did a great job. However one can wonder if he was overly nice in portraying Disney. Paul Giamatti had a touching performance as Traver's driver. Even dealing with her rudeness, he always respected and was nice to Travers. Finally, Colin Farrell gave an extraordinary performance as Traver's alcoholic father, who she has deep admiration for.Overall, Saving Mr. Banks is an excellent family film that is essentially a two hour making-of documentary of Mary Poppins. But the film is so sweet and magical, and it is another film that is a recipient of Disney's magic. This film is better than it had every right to be. The performances, particularly Thompsons, is stellar. A end-of-the-year hidden gem. Now let's go watch some Mary Poppins! I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"This is a thoroughly engaging film with stellar performances from its cast, especially Emma Thompson who is just wonderful. She must surely be at least 'nominated' for a host of awards for this role. Discovering the 'origins' of Mary Poppins wasn't exactly on my movie hit list but on a wet winter's afternoon in northern England and a wife who wanted to see the film, what was I to do? I was, in the end, so pleased that circumstance (and my wife)had taken me to the cinema.

"Almost certainly not historically accurate, but still a great film","Sometimes we need to suspend our desire for reality and accuracy to appreciate something for what it is.
If you don't understand that, then Mary Poppins is not a film for you.
This film has lots of historical flaws, but it is still a great story, and is superbly made.
Tom Hanks is brilliant, as always. Emma T is Emma T (as usual) but carries the part. All the other actors are just right.

"The Louie ""Saving Mr. Banks"" Movie Review","First of all the cast was very good – Tom Hanks, Paul Giamatti, Bradley Whitford (from West Wing), Colin Farrellall actors I like a lot. And Emma Thompson did an outstanding job. The movie shifts back and forth from the early 60's when Mary Poppins the movie was made to the 20's when P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) was growing up as a child. The movie was more of drama during the flashbacks as you see what her life was like growing up and eventually learning where Mary Poppins really came from. During the time in the 60's it is a lot of fun. You see how ornery Travers was and how badly Walt Disney wanted to make the picture and the funny hell she put everyone at Disney through before it eventually was made. And as the movie goes on you get more and more engaged in the often comical battle and the reasons for the battle. It is a very interesting story involving drama, comedy, intrigue and it is a genuine story that most people don't know, about a movie we all know and love. Although I bought my 10 year old daughter, it is not a movie children will enjoy but all adults will. I give it a solid ""B"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb performances.,"The flawless execution of their craft with every character that appears in this gem of a story in nothing short of superb. It's the story where Mickey Mouse meets Mary Poppins and, after all the award buzz has settled down, I find it hard to believe that Emma Thompson was skipped. It has to be her finest performance, not missing a beat with her witty, sarcastic dialogue and never missing an opportunity to use her wonderful ability of portraying worlds of emotion through a few glances and lip quivers.It's hard not to over sell the film in terms of her performance because all actors involved were so on point that to not to see how bright she shines in this role is next to impossible.The script was captivating. The fact that it was Walt Disney and the author of Mary Poppins was not the captivating point. The dynamic of stubbornly holding onto something precious, and the reasons therefore was captivating. The witty banter was captivating. The flow of events incorporated with the past was captivating.The films hits a high note in terms of humour from the get go, whisks you into a world of adolescent memories and peaks with so much hope. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an impeccable film that touches on one of the most memorable children movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting biopic of an interesting character,"This movie is about ""P.L. Travers,"" the pen name of the woman who wrote the Mary Poppins books and the negotiations and huge struggles involved between Travers and Walt Disney over Disney gaining the rights to make the one ""Mary Poppins"" film. It gives much of the author's early background which influenced both her writing, those struggles and her personality.Emma Thompson was nominated (very deservedly, IMO) for Golden Globe's ""Best Actress"" 2013 award. She was great portraying very difficult character.While the film is biographical, like many ""biopics"" it takes liberties in which facts it presents, omits &/or distorts. Nevertheless, it captures much of this author's qualities, personality, and history. The Wikipedia article on ""P.L. Travers"" is worthwhile for those who wish to sift fact from film fiction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._TraversAnd also, if interested, you can google the Chicago Tribune article about an interview with the author of a biography of ""P.L. Travers"": ""'Mary Poppins, She Wrote' author discusses P.L Travers, 'Saving Mr. Banks' """,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Pleasure Watching,"Saving Mr. Banks is a film directed by John Lee Hancock, and stars Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and Paul Giamatti, and centres around the author P.L. Travers, who created the book Mary Poppins. We watch as she goes to Los Angeles to have talks with Walt Disney, who wants to adapt her book into a film. During all this, she reflects on her hard childhood, and how it influenced Mary Poppins later on in her life.To begin with, the performances. Emma Thompson is wonderful in this film. She brings a lot of energy to a character which almost refuses to get up and have some fun, which in my mind, is quite the achievement. Thompson really steals the show, despite Tom Hanks giving a fantastic performance as well, as Walt Disney. I must say, he nails the moustache! The rest of the ensemble, including Paul Giamatti and the surprisingly powerful Colin Firth, give top-notch performances. Ultimately, in the acting category, there is nothing to criticise.The film is cut into two halves; one half, where she is in talks with Mr. Disney, and the other being her childhood. I felt that the talks with Mr. Disney, and the arguments she had with the screenwriters and music composers were easily the best parts of the film. They're full of energy, clashing personalities and some wonderful music. When it came to the second half though, her childhood, I found that these flashbacks seemed slightly bloated, or went on for a little too long. For the most part, they did explain important, key events which helped shaped her future. There were a few flashbacks in which I found seemed to drag on a little, and couldn't hold my interest for very long. These flashbacks, I found, were a little more common than I originally anticipated coming into the film, and ultimately, they did negatively impact the film for me.Ultimately, I can't really criticise this film any more. It's very well acted, well paced for the most part, and the plot is consistent and quite accurate to the real story. This film will win awards, undeniably, and I'm not going to be annoyed by this, as I can understand why. For the most part, it's a very well done film, that should serve as a must watch for everyone!8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Like perfume,"The film did not impress me tremendously, but I can still say it was a sweet, light movie. Emma Thompson exhibited a great performance as always; especially at the end of the movie, I clearly understood that she spoke with the exact same tone and style as the real author when I listened to her voice recording. Tom Hanks also portrayed Walt Disney's role very well. However, the transitions to the past were so sharp that I had doubts about whether the little girl we saw was the writer or not. I felt as if two separate stories were being told. I can say that the film left a pleasant feeling, but it was not lasting. So in short, it was like a perfume scent that could fly away quickly.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney","First of all, it is an absurd travesty to exclude Emma Thompson in the BEST LEADING ACTRESS nomination list this year by the Academy members, she campaigned rather hard in the awards season, she is a revered two-times winner and the film is exhaustively friendly towards the academy members, considering FINDING NEVERLAND (2004, 7/10), the story behind another children classic Peter Pan. And most essentially, she is at the top of her game in depicting a quite unlikeable character, the high and mighty spinster P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins books.Under the direction of a dab hand John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE 2009, 8/10), the storyline inter-cuts between two time-lines, in the dawn of 20th century in the inland Australia, the tale of woe of Ms. Tavers' childhood and in the 60s, when she flies to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Hanks) about the adaptation of her worldly-famous creation on celluloid. The two main deal-breaking stipulations for Ms. Tavers are, the picture must not feature any music numbers, and absolutely no animation is required, which are two leading signatures of Disney's trademarks, and both will be compromised if you have seen the crowd-pleasing and massively successful MARY POPPINS (1964, 7/10).The 1960s bifurcation engages in a comical contradiction between Travers' British uppityness and the business-centered civilities of Disney and his staff, which amusingly juggles with our empathy and distaste of her, Thompson commits herself integrally with her pitch-perfect acrimony and balances it with a tint of human nature through her friendship with her limousine chauffeur Ralph (a down-to-earth Giamatti). And eventually, her hostility and aversion towards the money-seeking deal will thaw by Disney's self-referencing confession of the hardship in his boyhood. But in reality, Travers never sold off other copyrights of her works anymore after this instance, which denotes the tear-jerking scenes where she is watching the finished film during its Hollywood fanfare premier is more of a reflection and vent on her own troubled memory rather than an acknowledgment to the picture itself.Equally well done is the childhood narrative, Farrell plays Travers Goff, and we come to realize Ms. Tavers coins her nom de plume after her father, a man dreams of fantasies and lives in fairy tales, whom she nurtures a very close affection to, but life is rough, he is a chronic dipsomaniac, an irresponsible bank manager and her family is the prototype of Banks family in the book, Farrell shines with devoted warmth and poignant endearment during his sequences with the newcomer Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the young author with a nickname Ginty, it has been one of his rare compelling performances to date. Ruth Wilson implodes with a suicidal tendency as her mother, and Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie is criminally underused simply because she is THE real Mary Poppins and she is only allowed a 5-minutes part for her presence.Hardly a hagiography, neither for Travers nor for Disney, whose subtle snootiness is brilliantly laid bare in the premier segment, when there is no need to kiss her ass, a polite cold-shoulder is all she deserves. So behind every tartar, there is a cause, the film is a success in not patronizing its audience with sugarcoating or spoon-feeding, yet in a tactful manner, it arouses empathy from within, last but not the least, it is also a treat to your ears, owing to Thomas Newman's masterful score saturated through and through.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"emotional , enchanting and occasionally funny ... this one is a gem","When you have Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson in the lead, you can expect nothing but greatness , and this one is nothing short of it. This re imagining of how Walt Disney tries to convince P.L. Travers for securing the rights of her work ""Mary Poppins"" is a very involving and an emotionally drenching tale that is very rare to see in a Hollywood flick.The story begins with P.L. Travers who is struggling financially as there are no more Mary Poppins books and the royalty from her works have dried up. Reluctant as she was for the past 20 years in giving rights of her work to Mr. Walt Disney , she decides to give it a shot provided the script and the re imagining of the character fulfills her demands and inner satisfaction. the film also features the childhood events of the author and how these events have Mary Poppins, the character. This is a story about how Walt Disney persuades Mrs P.L. Travers and whether or not she will grant those rights , is what the story all about.It is a simple story , with some fine performances. the characters make you believe they are real.Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers are in fine form. They are flawless in their performance, and makes it look so easy. Also a special mention to the performance of Collin Farrell who played the role of P.L Travers' father with great finesse and honesty.It is tough to direct a movie that has such a simple story line and John Lee Hancock has done a marvelous job with it .In the end I would like to say that everyone should give this movie a shot for its simplicity, emotional content and overall for the child in you.The honesty with which the movie is shot is not going to disappoint you.

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"Mary Poppins has always been a favorite for generations, but how did Walt Disney get the rights to make this film? Disney's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" tells that story through Emma Thompson, and Tom Hanks. I had very high expectations for this film, and I can honestly say I was not disappointed. The film is well-paced, there is no rushing through acts, or scenes. The makers seemed to be sure to take their time to make an enjoyable film. The story line was well done, it was touching in every way, and left the audience with a smile on their faces. Flashbacks were correctly placed, and added to the emotion and life of the film rather than take away like many films have. The music, of course, was familiar to anyone familiar with the famous musical and often times arrangements were made off of the original music and score. Hanks' performance as Walt Disney was excellent, as well ad Thompson as PL Travers, they took their characters, based of course on real people, and performed nearly flawlessly based on what they could know. Overall, ""Banks"" is a great film, and will be loved by anyone who Loves Mary Poppins, and generations after. Overall rating: 8.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most inspiring movie of 2013,"Heart felt, enjoying and makes you want to scream Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Saving Mr. Banks is a must see and a very much enjoyable movie on how sometimes you have to let go. Emma Thompson plays P.L. Travers who is rude but speaks her mind and she doesn't have any humor in her but in the movie it shows her as a child and how she grows up and loses hope on herself because her father who is played by Colin Farrell gives her so much hope and inspires her to dream. Then you have Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks who tries to keep that dream at first they don't understand each other the they become capable in handling each other. All i can say about this movie is that its really really good i loved it i loved the characters and i loved the message behind it and you'll have to see the movie to understand what i am talking about but this movie is very good and done so well.

Brought a smile to my face,"I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot. I only vaguely remember watching the Mary Poppins movie a single time when I was a little kid (I'm 23 now) and I've never read the book. I enjoy Disney as much as the next person, but I'm not a super fan or anything.I was under the impression that this movie would be boring when my parents and I were getting tickets to the movie. My parents paid for me, which was the only reason why I agreed to go. The concept for the movie didn't exactly jump out at me.Well, I just saw it and I can happily say that this movie proved me wrong! It was absolutely bedazzling. The acting was top notch and the story was passionate, heavy, emotional, and heartfelt. It definitely was NOT boring. I caught myself tearing up a few times throughout the movie. It tells an emotional, heavy, and, at times, dark story that I was not expecting. That doesn't mean to say that I didn't leave feeling good, because I definitely did! This movie has a lot of charisma and it is just a joy to watch.As I said before, the acting is top notch. Emma Thompson does a great job at making a very layered and complicated character. There's a lot more to this character than meets the eye.Tom Hanks does great at Walt Disney, and I enjoyed B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers. Colin Farrell also has an important role and he does very well.I especially enjoyed all the old Mary Poppins songs they used in the movie.This movie reminded me a lot of Finding Neverland.

Awards season!,"Definitely think this is going to be nominated for a few awards this season. Tom Hanks is the perfect choice for Walt Disney, and Emma Thompson comes off as both snarky and funny at the same time. While at times it is a little dark, it has plenty of humor to make up for it. But considering that both this and Mary Poppins are both Disney I'm not sure we're getting all the facts here. But they really went all out in making everything and everyone look and dress like they were living in the early 60's.

When Disney met Poppins,"Well not exactly for more than one reasons, but I do like that summary line, because it is about the story how the movie Mary Poppins came to be. There probably are some exaggerations, but during the end credits you can listen to a bit of the audio tape that was made during some of the discussions to make the movie.One thing that the poster with Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson does not show (before watching this I only knew the basic outline of the movie), is the actors involved with this. Be it Paul Giamati or in a really great performance - Colin Farrell. Actually he almost steals the movie (which shouldn't be a surprise for a few reasons too).The movie might set up the characters on different ends of a scale (like they couldn't be more removed and almost clichéd), but the actors make it more than work.

Practically Imperfect In Every Way (And There's Nothing Wrong With That),"SAVING MR. BANKS, a film directed by John Lee Hancock and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson, is a fantastic film.Growing up, I was always fascinated by Mary Poppins. From childhood, when I watched the musical classic, to later childhood, when I discovered the books I still hold dear.In high school, I became very interested with this mysterious write, PL Travers (I didn't even know if she was a woman or a man!). So, I did some research on her and her background. Needless to say, I was shocked - she came from a poor family with an alcoholic father and a suicidal mother and rose above it.Then, when I learned a year later that her story was being turned into a movie, I was very excited. I raced to the theater on Christmas Day and watched it.This movie is, simply put, a triumph, practically imperfect in every way.Whoa, hold on - what? IMPERFECT?!Yes, imperfect. Let me explain.From the opening moments to the final scene, Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks (as well as some wonderful supporting actors, including Paul Giamatti and Colin Farrell) show us that no one is perfect - and there's nothing wrong with that.For instance, Pamela ""PL"" Travers is stubborn, angry, bitter, and (really) dead inside. For so long, she has allowed her anger and bitterness towards everyone fester inside. When Walt Disney asks to make a movie of her beloved Mary Poppins, she is reluctant in every way possible, wanting her work to be untarnished by ""silly cartoons"" and the color red.Walt Disney himself is pushy, somewhat deceitful, and in the end, he does whatever he pleases to her movie. But he respects her and comforts her in many hours of need.All in all, this movie is a wonderful movie about imperfect people. Imperfect people making imperfect movies about imperfect people. And, in the end, we laugh, we cry, we applaud, and we go back into our imperfect world. And that's okay.That's okay.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Actually Liked This More Than I Liked Mary Poppins,"I called ""Mary Poppins"" a solid movie. I liked it. It was good. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the story behind Walt Disney's effort to acquire the rights to the book by P.L. Travers. It's a fascinating glimpse into the backstory to the book. As the movie opens, Travers is little more than an unlikeable character - considering handing the rights over to Disney after two decades of refusing only because she needs the money, resentful of Disney because of his success and because he wants to make money off the story, refusing to agree to any of the studio's ideas for how to adapt the story for the screen.But there was more to Travers than met the eye. The movie featured repeated flashbacks to Travers' childhood. At first there was little connection with the story, or with Mary Poppins. But as the flashbacks continued, the backstory is slowly revealed, helping to explain Travers' reluctance to accept any of Disney's suggestions. As we learn more about her troubled and, ultimately, tragic childhood, Travers becomes more of an object of sympathy. Ultimately, there's a bit of Disney's own backstory given as well, and the movie is a fascinating glimpse into the lives of two people who seemed at odds, but who had far more in common than either would likely have imagined.Tom Hanks (as Disney) and Emma Thompson (as Travers) are both two time Academy Award winners, and both, as you would expect, offered powerful performances in the lead roles. The movie strikes a good balance between being both funny and emotional, and it moves along at a very nice pace. Overall, I'd say it was actually better than ""Mary Poppins.""

"A competent, interesting and relevant film that hits all the right notes","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningReclusive novelist P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) staunchly refuses to share her literary masterpiece Mary Poppins with anyone, despite being pestered for the film rights numerous times by different people. But she has fallen on hard times and there look set to be even tougher times ahead. So, on the persuasion of her agent, she flies off to America and has a meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), the most well known man on earth in the early 60's. Initially reluctant and extremely difficult, Travers is also horrified at the thought of Disney making it in to one of his ghastly animations, which she detests. But gradually, the fairy tale mogul wears down her tough exterior and as the film progresses, we learn of the tragic back story of Travers's childhood that nevertheless formed the basis of the fantasy world she escaped to to create her wonder yarn.Working in a children's hospital, occasionally you'll pass a television set with a DVD playing to keep the kids amused while they wait for an appointment or something, so it's only comparatively recently that the magic of Mary Poppins has entered my life. Kids, or family, films aren't generally the type of thing I go for, as my comments listings will attest to, but something about this film still grabbed my heart enough to become a film I now own. So, in the 50th anniversary of the film's first release, this inspired and enlightening film is highly relevant and was certainly well worth my time, shining some light on the production difficulties the film encountered, not least Travers's awkward, hostile personality. Though well written, the script sometimes makes Travers come off as cartoonishly eccentric and over the top at times, and you're left wondering how it would have been possible for anyone, even Disney, to possibly make her come round.And yet, throughout the film's tough depiction of her, this is juxtaposed with flashbacks to her childhood spent in rural Australia, where her even more outlandish father fueled her mind with his free spirit and boundless imagination. But his was a tragic existence, blighted by drink and self destruction. And yet, he imparted the words of wisdom that let her mind flourish, ""never to let the world grind you down with how it is, and to keep your imagination alive."" From this, her more human side comes to life, and our dislike gradually simmers to empathy.Needless to say, if the idea behind the film wasn't exciting enough, it's even more exhilarating with the performers involved, and they all turn in reliably stellar performances. Hanks once again captures the manner and style of his charge with aplomb, bringing a real life character to the screen unlike anyone before him, while national treasure Thompson is perfectly suited to the role of Travers, and there's great support from Colin Farrell, unrecognizable at first as the dad, and Paul Giamatti as Travers's put upon chauffeur.It's a magical examination of the magic, that will please the long time and even the more recent devotees of Poppins. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Let's go fly a kite,"Saving Mr Banks was a Surprisingly amazing flick. I heard great things about, so I went to see it for myself and It made me realize how much I loved the movie Mary Poppins as a kid. The movie was really accurate on the actual life story. Emma Thompson is great as P.L. Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Pretty good job as usual. It took m awhile to get used to Hanks Playing Disney. But after 5 minutes of seeing him. I completely forgot it was Hanks. In the movie there are flashback scenes, going into the past of P.L. Travers. People complain that that the scenes feel to fantasy like. There really not. Those flashbacks scenes are told through Travels Prospective. Which actually makes it really good. This was probably the most adult Disney movie ever released by the studio. Now my only problem with that is, if Disney keeps going in the adult direction, will the studio be family orientated anymore. Maybe that's why we have touchstone pictures. Anyway, It was a really good flick to end off 2013. Great Story, acting, great scenery, I loved it. Can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Wonderful Film,"With her book revenues drying up and in danger of losing her home, author P.L. Travers is forced to entertain the idea of selling the movie rights to her beloved novel Mary Poppins to Walt Disney, who has been pursuing them for 20 years, in order to keep a promise he made to his daughters. So eager to make the film, Disney makes Travers an unprecedented offer: final script approval. Essentially, nothing goes in the film without her say-so. The rest of the movie is based around Travers butting heads with director Don DaGradi and the film's composers, the Sherman brothers, to make the film. Travers, the purist who based the characters on people from her own childhood, wants to make the film exactly like the book and the creative team wants to (for lack of a better term) ""disneyify"" it.And that's basically it. The premise of the film is very, very simple but a plot doesn't need to be complicated in order to be good. What makes the movie so incredibly good are the performances. Emma Thompson is the go-to British actress for ""hard but with a touch of heart"". Tom Hanks is brilliant as Disney, effortlessly transitioning from the light hearted, child loving, ""everyone call me by my first name"" type boss you wish you had to the shrewd, successful business man. He'll negotiate but in the end, he's going to get the deal he wants. Not to be overlooked are Colin Farrell, who delivers the finest performance of his recent career as Travers' father in flashback sequences, and Paul Giamatti, who is just lovable as Travers' chauffeur who tries to break through Travers' stony exterior of simply not wanting, in the slightest way, to be there.

Novak and Jason Schwartzman all knock it out of the park as well, as DaGradi and the Sherman brothers, respectively.If I have to nit-pick to find a flaw with the film, it would be that the ending is a work of pure fiction. If you've read anything about the real story (and there is plenty of evidence because, as it's truly depicted in the movie, Travers insisted that all creative sessions be taped), Travers hated the final product, which she insisted upon calling ""Walt Disney's Mary Poppins"" to distinguish it from her own work and refused to work with the studio ever again. But, if you can get past that, it's an enjoyable film with strong performances that definitely makes for a worthwhile rental.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best story of the year?,"I thought 2013 had an unusually high number of well-done movies and great stories. This is one of them, and my favorite. The plot of the movie skips between the upbringing of a girl in early 20th Century Australia, and Disney Studios pursuit of the movie rights to Mary Poppins. You eventually realize the girl is the author, P. L. Travers. Her parents are co-dependent, and the father is an alcoholic, bouncing from 1 job to another. He fills his daughter with dreams instead of a sense of responsibility. When Walt Disney enters the story we find he's been pursuing the movie rights for 20 years. Ms. Travers fears the trivialization of her characters and has refused him at every turn. The real story is why and the movie unravels this mystery in a great fashion. This are fine and perhaps Oscar-winning performances by Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. You'll appreciate the story better if you've seen Mary Poppins, but don't avoid this if you haven't - they'll explain enough so you'll get it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is one of the most inspiring films out there. It expands upon a mystery behind the scenes of one of the best films ever created. Who knew or had ever really considered before the background story of the film ""Marry Poppins?"" Like most people, I had just thought that it was just like any other Disney Film, one that was based on a fictional story built by a brilliant mind.In this case, the story behind Marry Poppins in no doubt includes imagination, but you really get to understand the ""mind"" behind it all...and you feel the emotional side of it all the way through.I will have a deep respect for P.L. Travers for the rest of my life, as I truly understand now what the story meant for her. I will also have a deep respect (as I already do) for Mr. Walt Disney, as the film expresses the deep meaning the story of Mary Poppins had for him as well. To have the background story of the author and the meaning of Mary Poppins unfold is simply awe-inspiring, surprising, emotional, humorous, and exciting.This film definitely deserves a 10 out of 10, as actors in this film played to the role nearly perfectly. It truly is as if you can feel and see the actual real characters themselves. Absolutely fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Corny but Acted in Earnest,"There is just something about watching Tom Hanks be Tom Hanks. It's just this warm, comfortable feeling, seeing that man light up the screen. It's almost like the feeling you get watching a Disney movie. Saving Mr. Banks, Disney's new movie starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, gives us the opportunity to do both of those things.Hanks is fantastic as Walt Disney, who spends his days trying to court stuffy British author P.L. Travers (Thompson) into allowing his studio to adapt her Mary Poppins for the screen. What ensues, as you can imagine, is a cat-and-mouse comedy about her ridiculous demands and Disney's attempts to overcome them.You see, Disney wants to be accommodating. Decades before the film's 1961 setting, Walt made a promise to his young daughters to make a movie out of Poppins, a promise he takes incredibly seriously and pursues for over twenty years. When Travers, who refuses to write new material, begins to run out of money, she is strongly advised to meet with Disney in California to hear his offer for the film rights to her novel.Travers, however, wants complete control over the entire production. She routinely insults Disney and his silly animation, making him promise that no cartoons would find their way into a film of Poppins. She also disapproves of songwriters Robert and Richard Sherman (B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman, respectively), and takes issue with the casting of the picture, particularly that of Dick Van Dyke.Over the course of these weeks-long negotiations, the narrative is constantly being interrupted by persistent flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. Her alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) inspires her imagination, but also serves as the reason for her bitterness as an adult.Saving Mr. Banks is a lovely film in many regards, in particular its acting. Hanks is wonderful as Disney, and his final monologue, delivered from a stationary position while sitting down, is testament to how much he can do with a simplistic setting. Another standout is the always- great Paul Giamatti, playing Travers' chauffeur. Giamatti has no business in a role this insignificant, but takes the dialogue he is given and turns it to pure gold. His performance had me choked up more than once.Despite its good qualities, Banks has numerous pitfalls, as well. Its script has ""Disney"" written all over it. Much of the dialogue is hokey and transparent, even in the hands of professionals like Thompson and Hanks. The flashback sequences are spread throughout the film in such a way that we get one scene in the present followed by one flashback, and so on. Structuring the picture in such a manner diminishes the real story (Travers vs. Disney) and instead tries to convince us that Travers' origin story is equally as important. This may be, but it is nowhere near as compelling, and its predictable end comes too late for the drama of the main storyline to redeem it. Director John Lee Hancock would have done better to have contained the flashbacks to a few lengthier sequences and wrapped them up at about the two-thirds mark of the two-plus hour running time.The biggest problem with Saving Mr. Banks, though, is Travers herself. She never becomes a likable or relate-able character, even after the big reveal of why she is so embittered. Walt Disney's charm may break down Travers' psychological walls, but cannot demolish those built between Travers and the viewer throughout the picture. Thompson turns in a great performance, but the movie would have been more effective if told from Disney's perspective rather than Travers'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, emotional, and endearing","Although I'd already heard good rumblings about this movie, I was still surprised at how absolutely charming it turned out to be. In fact, I think Hanks is much better here portraying Walt Disney than he is as Captain Phillips in his other big movie this year. The Phillips character seems one-dimensional and not particularly likable, whereas Hanks portrays Disney with infectious charm, steely grace, and genuine enthusiasm. Emma Thompson is hilarious albeit practically unrecognizable as the opinionated and intractable British author, P.L. Travers. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Paul Giamatti, B.J. Novak, and Jason Schwartzman. The music is fun and familiar and the dialogue amusing and witty. I laughed out loud several times and was brought close to tears as well. I highly recommend this movie to young and old alike. You will leave the theater smiling.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
In the Company of Disney (and the Shadow of Mary Poppins)...,"Walt Disney has become a brand-name invoking a world of perpetual enchantment and demonstrations of friendliness so over the top they can confine to a tyranny of smiles. That's a very cynical way to look at it but not too far-fetched. Still, as a father of a little girl and given how enamored she was with ""Frozen"" and how she seems to enjoy the old cartoons I show her on Youtube, I can't deny that Disney (the man or the company) always had a way with children and pardon the cliché, the inner child in all of us.So it's quite fun to see the Walt Disney company producing a movie where all the archetypes of Disney would be disdained by a stuck-up British lady who's no one else but the writer of ""Mary Poppins"", P.L. Travers played by a delightful Emma Thompson. It's also fun to see the one receiving these critics being good old Disney himself, played by Tom Hanks. He doesn't try to imitate Disney but ""Saving Mr. Banks"" isn't intended to be a formal biopic about how the tycoon got the rights for what would become one of his most successful and iconic works.The film plays on a more emotional level, it is about two visions, two convictions that should have made Mickey Mouse and Mary Poppins walk hand-in-hand to contribute to a masterpiece (the poster is a perfect summary of the film on that level)... only it took twenty years. It was a promise made to his daughters that Walt Disney couldn't allow himself to break, make a film out Travers' classic ""Mary Poppins"", but the woman, a stubborn Aussie, wouldn't have the glitter and the schmaltzy bliss of Disney tarnish the legacy of her book. She had a misconception, taking Disney for some modern-day Santa Claus but so did Disney by misunderstanding the woman and ignoring the sources of her inspiration, some tragic ones.The film offers many flashbacks of Travers' childhood during which we witness the fallout of her family, from the descent into sickness and alcoholism of her father, to the attempted suicide of her mother and a nurse that took care of her family when she was seven. Just like John Lee Hancock's previous film ""The Blind Side"", the film seems very simple and straightforward until, you start to grasp a specific subtext. In ""The Blind Side"", there's a moment where we clearly question the motivations of the Tuohy Family, if it wasn't just about football, and then this question is answered. In ""Mr Banks"", we know Travers doesn't want any animation, any red color, but we quickly realize there's something else eating her.She wants Mr. Banks shaven, to be a good man, she has an obsession with Mr. Banks even more than the children or maybe Mary Poppins, the flashbacks centering on her well-meaning but unlucky father played by Colin Farrell allows us to reassemble the pieces of the puzzle and understand what the purpose of Mary Poppins was. There's a pattern in the film consisting on all the friendliest moments (and Travers is quite devoid of immediate warmth) involves a father or one invoking father's memories. Nothing Oedipal about it, it's just speaks about people who accomplished major works by translating the burden of their childhood into something positive.Of course, Disney's body of work is superior but there's no denial that Travers contributed to his most iconic creation, his first Best Picture nomination and a classic for all ages. We know ""Mary Poppins"" will be made anyway, and the efforts of the Sherman brothers or Disney executive will pay off, but the film is enjoyable on the simple level of these interactions and the so conflicting mentalities of Disney, a cheerful man but astute businessman and a woman who's taking her book very personally. It's only after she realizes how personal it is to Disney that she finally trusts him... and the rest is history.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful and magical,"This movie tells a beautiful story. I had no idea of what was behind Mary Poppins, so I went to see this movie with the thoughts that would only be about the making of a movie with a cranky author. It turned out to be a very touching story about family and love. This movie reminded me why cinema can be important in our lives, why after 15 years Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and all those characters are still in our hearts. Growing up doesn't mean we're going to stop loving these stories because they we're part of growing up and part of our families. Saving Mr.Banks shows exactly that and it's lovely to see that Disney was a man that truthfully cared about what he and others created. More technically speaking, Emma Thompson did a great job, in my opinion (I was actually a bit sad that she was completely dismissed from Oscars, Golden Globes, etc.) and Tom Hanks walked with her very well. It's a family story and it warms up our heart. Not all of us will connect to the characters very easy, but Mrs. Travers will challenge you not to laugh on her very direct answers. I think that even those who aren't completely fans of this sort of movies will have a nice time with this one. Certainly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Let's go fly a kite,"I don't know who is Mary Poppins, or neither P.L. Travers before I watched the movie. And now I do remember Pamela, Walt, Mary Poppins and will no longer simply consider Mickey Mouse as a ridiculous toy. I cannot help bursting into tears when the song came out at the last scene. It reminded me of The Killers's song at that last moment:""are we human? or are we dancers?"" When reality crashes a dreamer's Neverland, can he just survive in a fictional world? It seems that people who survive in the reality will not save Mr. Banks. The movie begins with a dream unachievable, a knot unsolved and a woman untouchable. And ends up with a truth revealed, a hero in heart and a compromise towards life. Thanks to the fabulous performance of Emma Thomas, who deserve an Oscar for sure. and Colin Farell's heart-wrenching performance. They two gave me the biggest surprise of 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Even though Travers is an awful person I really enjoyed and recommend this. Overall, very good and very much worth seeing.","""Winds in the east, mist coming in, like something is brewing about to begin. Can't put me finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before."" Walt Disney (Hanks) has a promise to keep to his kids. He promised them he would turn the Mary Poppins books into a movie. He has everything in line except the rights to the movie. After 20 years author P.L. Travers (Thompson) finally decides to come to L.A. and talk to him. That was the easy part. I was looking forward to watching this because I love the Mary Poppins movie. This was a good movie and I really enjoyed it but there is one thing that kept me from loving it. Emma Thompson is a great actress and she did a fantastic job as always but the character is so unlikable it distracts a little from the story. When you watch you will see what I mean. After reading about Travers, to find out that the movie is almost 100% accurate makes her that much more despicable. For a movie that I had high expectations for I really enjoyed this and recommend this. Overall, very good and very much worth seeing even though Travers is an awful person. I give this a high B+.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thompson Brightens Up a Flawed Film,"I admire John Lee Hancock for his willingness to tackle sentimental, sugary, and heavily cheesy scripts as a director because that tone will reflect on his direction. Though Saving Mr. Banks is a step in the right direction from reprehensible 2009 Best Picture nominee The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks has its problems most of which accumulate in the flashbacks that parallel the dominant storyline. In fact, if the flashbacks would have been eliminated entirely, Saving Mr. Banks could have been a charming, meta-tale that film fans could devour like last year's Hitchcock (which I adore).Faults aside, Saving Mr. Banks is a warm tale featuring a soulful musical score, kooky hairstyles, and fun set designs. Tom Hanks suits his role of Walt Disney and has a few monologues where he puts the optimism and cheerfulness he hinges on for most of the film aside and creates something exceptional. Emma Thompson is rightfully soaking up most of the acclaim for Saving Mr. Banks. Her terrific portrayal full of snootiness and cruel comedy is made complex by burying sorrow and pain deep in her character's past. The concluding scene is so effective because of the truth Thompson displays.Saving Mr. Banks is about letting go of the past, accepting it, forgiving those who have hurt you, and resurrecting yourself. The other, possibly more lucrative, message: Walt Disney is the cure for all children's misfortunes, even children in their old age.Grade: BRating: 6.5",,Anonymous,Biography
A fascinating tale charmingly told,"I have not read any of the eight children's novels featuring Mary Popppins and published between 1934-1988 or seen the 1964 movie musical adaptation, but I enjoyed this cinematic explanation of how the childhood experiences in Australia of the author P L Travers inspired the original story and how Walt Disney and his creative team struggled so long and so valiantly to bring that story to the screen.Tom Hanks never gives a poor performance and is excellent here in his portrayal of Disney, giving a moving testimony towards the end. However, this is Emma Thompson's movie because she is simply wonderful as Travers, hard yet vulnerable, cutting yet clever. The Mr Banks of the title refers to the fictional version of Travers' father Travers Goff who is played by Colin Farrell.",,Anonymous,Biography
Emma Thompson Delightfully Leads Mr. Banks,"John Lee Hancock's 'Saving Mr. Banks' tells the story of P.L. Travers, creator of the classic Mary Poppins. Writers Kelly Marcel, Sue Smith and director Hancock depict how her loving father who struggled with alcoholism influenced her and her refusal to permit Disney to turn Mary Poppins into a movie. However, what I found to be lacking was Aunt Ellie's impact. Clearly she's the inspiration behind the character Mary Poppins and yet there is so little of her shown in the film and what her influence was is left for the viewer to assume. 'Saving Mr. Banks' is quite well shot. However, the special effects are poor. The editing and lighting are smooth and the score is very pleasing. The writing is brilliant, especially the sharp dialogues and the score is wonderful, particularly the renditions of the 'Mary Poppins' soundtrack.The film boasts of several superb performances. Tom Hanks does a decent job. He exudes enough charm to carry off the part. Colin Farrell, even though not a convincing Australian, does a remarkable job otherwise. Same goes for Annie Rose Buckley. Paul Giamatti is excellent. Bradley Whitford, Jason Schwartzmann and Kathy Baker provide fine support. Rachel Griffiths is wonderful but she deserved more screen time. But, 'Saving Mr. Banks' belongs to Emma Thompson who delivers yet another transcendent performance marking one of her best works.Flawed it may be but John Lee Hancock's movie is well worth watching. It's charming, colourful, delightful and very well acted.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Things You Didn't Know About Mary Poppins...,"Here comes the amazing and slightly disturbing truth of P.L. Travers (Book: Mary Poppins)! The amazing true story of how it all happened. Definitely a ********* performance. Now let me get this straight with you: I do not cry in movies. Yet in this one, I cried. I actually cried. The acting was just so superior to other movies that I thought I was actually seeing the real thing happen, with my very own eyes. The amazing Emma Thompson stars as P.L. Travers, and legendary Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. The ultimate feel-good/pick-me-up movie of the year, mixed in with suspense, comedy and drama. So, if you like spectacular dramas like 'Pride and Prejeduce' (1980), 'Finding Neverland' (2004), and 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' (2011), then I most definitely recommend this movie to YOU!",,Anonymous,Biography
If only they could have left Mrs. Travers out of it entirely,"I honestly liked this film. I really did. It was full of nicely drawn characters and wonderful attention to detail, and I don't think Tom Hanks has ever made a bad movie. Yes, everything was great. Except every time Mrs. Travers appeared, I wanted to kick her in the face. What a disagreeable woman she was! I understand, yes, she had neuroses and a crappy childhood and was lonely as an adult. She was lonely, I would venture to say, because she was a royal killjoy, a true defeat of anything joyful. Yep. Would have liked the movie a lot more with a lot less of her. And yes, I do realize she is the focus of it all. In fact, most of the other characters seemed to revolve around her unpleasantness. I understand the need for this to be ""real"" movie. But honestly, if you can get past what a miserable person Mrs. Travers, according to this, seemed to be, you'll like it.

Has its flaws but has quality in the design and delivery,"I'm not sure how much of this film is actually true and how much of it is creative license for the sake of a good film, but I'm not too bothered because I doubt too many people come to this thinking they are watching anything other than a piece of light entertainment albeit with a basis in reality. The film concerns the making of the film Mary Poppins – a film that Mrs Travers, the author of the source material is very protective of and that Walt Disney is keen to make and make in a way that he knows will work and sell. Throughout the mostly gently comedic film, we get flashbacks to Travers' youth in Australia with her challenging situations, a fun-loving father and a distinctive house- keeper.The film is delivered with a rather uneven tone but it is one that it mostly hangs together even if it never really becomes a great film. At its heart it is really sentimental, with a nostalgic and comedic air throughout; at the same time it seems to hint at elements which are factual, but the additions suggest a real push towards more of a warming and touching story. The flashbacks are part of this although the film never really has the depth that these suggest was being tried for. The film seems to be fine with this though and to be honest, so was I. I enjoyed it for its sentimentality and was grateful it didn't overdo it or push for tears or chuckles too heavily; it is a very nicely crafted film where you sort of feel the quality and, even though you can see what it is doing, you at least appreciate that it isn't doing it in a really cheap way.This can be seen in many aspects – from the look of the film, the sets, the design and the whole tone but also in the performances. Hanks is nicely engaging and takes to his role well but it is Thompson that really brings the most to the film. Her crispness adds to the comedic element of course, but it is her delivery that, by reflection, makes the flashbacks work better than they would otherwise have done in terms of the formative aspects of the narrative and characters. Support is good from Whitford, Novak and Schwartzman, although I thought the film didn't really need Giamatti's character adding to the sentiment. In the flashbacks Farrell and Wilson both do well, and it is nice to see Griffiths in her small role.Saving Mr. Banks is not a fantastic film but it is a gently entertaining and engaging one. It has its flaws for sure but it wears them well and has strengths that help cover them up; the end result is perhaps sentimental but it is not mawkish and I enjoyed it for its quality build and delivery.",,Anonymous,Biography
