Still holds up better than most horror movies of today's age,I just came around to watch the original Alien on Netflix and I have to say that I was positively surprised that a horror movie from the '70s is this suspenseful and effective.The characters actually behave like thinking human beings. The soundtrack is great and the direction is superb. Especially when comparing this movie to the modern movies with similar stories that borrowed many of the things that are working well here.A classic every horror and overall movie fan should watch.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"""Alien"" is not just the monster, it's the atmosphere and the way you feel!","In ""Alien"" we follow a seven man crew en-route to earth on board the huge space freighter ""Nostromo"". The crew is in cryosleep, but the on board computer interrupts the journey when a foreign radio signal is picked up. It originates from an uninhabited planet and the crew lands to investigate. There they make contact with an alien life-form...What makes Alien so great is the constant feel of uneasiness. Right from the beginning you have a feeling that something is wrong. The crew is not particularly friendly towards each other, and you truly feel all the in-group tension. The ship itself is a huge worn out industrial-style maze of halls and corridors, and it feels more like a prison than a place to live. It is as if not only the alien but also the ship itself is against the humans. The Alien itself is the scariest monster in history because it is a ruthless, soul-less parasite completely devoid of any human or civilized traits. The design of the monster is a stroke of genius. Sure it has a humanoid form, but it has no facial traits or anything else which could give away emotions or intentions. Its actions reveals no weaknesses nor civilized intelligence. The Alien is more or less the opposite of everything human and civilized, plus the creature is more well-adapted to the inhumane interior of the ship than the humans who build it. To sum up, you then have a setting where the humans are caught in a web of in-group tensions, an inhospitable ship and the perfect killer which thrives in the ships intestines. You almost get the feel that the humans are the ones who are alienated to each other and to their own ship.Ridley Scott tells the story with a perfectly synchronized blend of visuals and sounds.The actors do a superb job, portraying their characters in a subtle but very realistic way. The seven man crew is not a bunch of Hollywood heroes. They are ordinary people with strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. In this way they all seem so fragile when confronted with the enemy.As mentioned the ship is very claustrophobic and Ridley Scott adds to the eeriness by using camera movement, lights and shadows in an effective way. The living quarters are bright and should be comfortable to the crew, but there is something sterile about it all. The rest of the ship is basically a huge basement.The music by Jerry Goldsmith underlines the eeriness so well, and the movie wouldn't have worked without his score. Combined with the sounds of the ship it all adds to the uneasiness.This is not a story about heroic people who boldly teams up against evil. It's a story about ordinary people facing true fear, which is the fear without a face. The fear we can't understand and can't negotiate with, because its only goal is to survive on the expense of us. It's a story where some people bravely fight back whilst others are destroyed by the terror. It's a story where people a killed in a completely random way. There is no higher-order justice behind who gets to live and who dies. All seven characters are just part of a race where the fittest - not necessarily the most righteous - will prevail, and all seven characters start the race on an equal footing. None of them are true heroes, and none of them are true villains.All the above makes Alien so great as a horror movie. The terror isn't just the Alien itself, it's the entire atmosphere which gets so effectively under your skin, that you just can't shrug it off after the end credits like you can with so many other Hollywood horror movies. The title ""Alien"" doesn't just refer to the monster, it is the theme of the movie and it is the feeling you have during and after the movie. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The facehugger scared me as a kid and i still find em creepy.,"Everything has already been said about this great film n there seems to be little left to say but lemme contribute a lil more by praising how good this film is.I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs n as a kid i found it to be a bit slow but was shaken by the chestburster scene.The facehugger terrified me as a kid.Revisited all the four parts in the early 2k on dvds which i own.Revisited this part again few days back as i am on Alien movie marathon n very impatient to check out Prometheus n Covenant.I feel that this part is inspired by Bava's Planet of the Vampires.The ruins with the skeletal remains, the design and shots of the ship itself does have the deja vu effect.This one is atmospheric n dark, gory at times, it has enuff stuff for sci fi fans, it also has slasher n war like tone.But the best thing is the feminist tone where in this part the women are not being cast as the helpless victims.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Timeless Science Fiction Masterpiece,"'Alien' is one of those special films that have aged very, very well. Even now, after nearly 40 years, everything about it just feels fresh. The restrained, natural performances by the fantastic cast; the outstanding production design; the beautiful, ominous score by Jerry Goldsmith; the realistic, ""lived-in"" look of space-freighter Nostromo's interior: it actually feels less dated than many science fiction films that were made much later, which is quite an astonishing feat. Even the (what now must be considered) ""retro"" technology inside the ship doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as anachronistic in the face of our obvious recent advancements, because it's the most simple technological equipment that is usually robust enough to survive the longest under harsh conditions (like the extreme temperatures in space).I feel it's especially hard for science fiction films to stand the test of time - which is kind of inherent to the genre I suppose - and 'Alien' simply remains an outstanding achievement in that regard. It's a testament to the talent of everyone involved, but especially to the vision of director Ridley Scott. The film was crafted with so much love for every little detail, and the designs by Moebius, Chris Foss - and in particular the Lovecraftian horrors unleashed by Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger - are among the best and most iconic in any science fiction film. This isn't just an outstanding, timeless piece of entertainment: it's a work of art. 10 Stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Holds up as a classic.,"Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.Fantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.The music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she's upstaged by the creature.You can't help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.A cinematic masterpiece. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
In space no one can hear you scream,"First seen in 1979 , I was 15 Mum dropped me off. Seen once every five years since.Seems to get better and better as time goes on, maybe because as I mature, I appreciate the fine acting details or is it that there are fewer and fewer films to compare Alien to. Alien is a masterpiece in so many areas (in no order); Editing, photography, acting, direction, art, music, sound, script. In fact Alien ought to be mandatory viewing for every film director whether budding or currently or even as a refresher for well seasoned film makers.It's so clear Ridley was able to make the film he wanted to make without interference from non creative parties.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
After 40 years it still scares the hell out of me,"When I see reviewers ratings less than five I have shake my head in disbelief. Alien set a standard that has yet to be equaled let alone surpassed. I watched it on the wide screen when it was first released, and over a dozen times since. And even though I know what's coming, the hairs on the back of my neck still stand up. What a brilliant work of theatrical genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A horror classic,"What makes Alien great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but Alien has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors, it feels almost like a maze.Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite Alien being released in 1979). The creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact, there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to director Ridley Scott for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Scott's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.Final Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Structural perfection matched only by its hostility,"Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity.  In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"For me, it doesn't get any better than this","I'm often amazed that people prefer Aliens to the original, I guess it's down to personal taste but in my opinion the first film is far and away the best. It's the way Ripley's whole world just unravels gradually from the get go, the pacing is sublime and it simply doesn't have to rely on tons of action set pieces like the second film does. My assumption is some people find it too slow but everytime I watch it I just marvel at every scene, the effort that went into every detail. The true mark of what an achievement this film was for the time is also how nothing appears dated even now in HD or in 4k, there are countless instances in the second film where it's blatantly obvious scale models have been used and it always bugs me. You have to remember this was made when Christopher Reeve's Superman was about which vfx's look terrible in comparison, blows your mind doesn't it?! Don't get me wrong I enjoy all of the Alien franchise movies, they do gradually worsen in sequence apart from Prometheus which is joint second place for me. I won't go into script or acting, needless to say both are top drawer and feel completely authentic and natural.A masterpiece! Simple as that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Undeniably stunning,"This was made in the seventies. Seventies. The picture quality is stunning. Undeniably stunning. The sound is perfect except minor issues regarding occasional muffled dialogue. God it looks good. Rivals and beats many films made thirty years later. The blend of suspense, horror, science-fiction is perfect. The budget is perfectly used. Perfect. I say stick with the theatrical version, the various director cuts are not as well paced, add irrelevant scenes and don't fix the one bit that annoys me - the jump cut on Ash's head. Stay theatrical and think of the best film ever made and you would possibly have this. There may be a scant few other films but this would be the first. The ending is so intense and fearful without cheap techniques. I love it. Very minor technical issues are forgotten through fear, fascination and legacy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"Not only is Alien one of the greatest sci-fi films created, it is undoubtedly encapsulates all the best elements of the horror genre too.The plot is perfect. Simple enough that missed dialogue doesn't throw the audience out of the loop, yet complex enough to demonstrate the depth behind the context. Twists are utilised at the perfect moments to ensure that intrigue remains at a high while tension is at a constant. Characters superb, with no real stereotypes of tokenism added in to no effect.Visually, the 1979 release is still far more aesthetic than films released 40 years later. The sets are superb, costuming is great, and the lighting to capture the right atmosphere is perfect. Brief glimpses of the Xenomorph establish the fearsome foe without putting everything on show and lessening it's impact, and is a perfect example of why costuming and puppetry done right will always look better than CGI.An excellent cast, with Weaver's breakout role supported by the likes of Hurt and Holm. Dialogue is delivered realistically and always at the right intensity, and never out-of-step with the perfect directorial pacing.A phenomenal start to clear franchise material, which no matter how wayward later editions go, will always be a classic. Somehow Alien's sequel matches this performance too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The mother of all movies,"Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with. I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurate:The direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. ""In space, no one can hear you scream"". THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget! There's a lovable cat in it.RATING: 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Classic horror,"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)However here the characters are not merely alien-food but have some dimension to them. Weaver is excellent, while the support cast is full of great support actors (Stanton, Kotto, Hurt, Skerritt, Holm), but of course the real star is the one we see least of.We barely see the alien in full detail, most of the time it is set in shadows, moving with deadly intent.The alien here is not simply a killing machine as seen in later films but is cruel with it. Witness the alien trap a female crew member and slowly rub up her leg, moving with slow seductive movements before moving with terrifying speed to kill another crew member sneaking up behind it. The slow movements betray the alien's pure cruelty.The film is a study in terror. It may not be as action packed as the other films in the series but it brings the claustrophobia of being hunted to a new level.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien.....the one that started it all........,"Alien....the creature......the film.....the legend. The one that started it all, the one that led to one of the greatest sequels ever made, one that got a comic book mini-series and 2 cross-over films with ""Predator"". This is THE film. And without a doubt, the greatest horror film ever created, and this totally makes ""Halloween"" look like ""Chicken Little"". You can forget about all those rubbish ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies, 'cause ""Alien"" just takes horror up to so many levels! In ""Alien"", we find ourselves in the distant future with a crew just coming back from a haul of 20 million tons of ore back to Earth. But while the crew members are in stasis, their ship picks up an ""SOS"" from a nearby planet, and once the crew is awakened, they are forced by the ""Company"" regulations to follow that signal. And then when they land on the planet and it turns out that something terrifying is in store for them, when a hostile organism attaches itself to one of the crew members. And later on, it becomes clear that the crew member was being impregnated and then dies a horrible, violent death from a deadly breed of an other-worldly life-form. And now the rest of the crew must fight off the creature.As other classic films should always have, ""Alien"" does great on the characters. And of course, the most recognizable one is the lead woman, Ellen Ripley who is played then-unknown Sigourney Weaver. She provides a very human face and you're gonna feel like you're actually watching a real-life woman in here, and it could be because of her accent, or her mannerisms. But as the film progresses, she develops into a more mentally tougher woman while combating the Alien. There are times when she totally keeps it cool, times when she's afraid, times when she's angry, and times when its just Ripley being Ripley. And thanks to Weavers acting talents, she can really dish out one hell of a character.The rest of the supporting cast are nothing short of spectacular, Parker and Brett are the selfish, sarcastic men who only want to make a profit. And through most of the film, you can feel the tension that Ripley and Parker have. Lambert, who one of my favorites from here is the second woman who happens to be the opposite of Ripley, a total coward. Dallas, who the viewer might get the vibe that HE is the main character in the 1st 15 minutes or so, is pretty much the leader here. Kane, is the tired, dead-looking guy who is the one that carries the alien species inside of him. And finally, Ash is the one with the sinister purpose and you start to suspect that he's up to no good at some point. And movie characters need to have their own personalities and that's what ""Alien"" has.And as for the Alien itself, well what can i say? It is the most horrifying creature in the history of cinema, period. I mean, how could you stop it? It has acid for blood, and is very lethal to fight face-to-face. And the special effects were over 20 years ahead of its time. The face-hugger on Kane looked so freaking real, that you're gonna be scared just by looking at it, even it doesn't do anything except breathe most of the time. And the sets couldn't have been better, very futuristic, yet there's always something ominous and dark about them.The suspense is impossible to resist as the sequences deliver the chills at times when you least expect it, and when you do expect something to happen, nothing happens. And ""Alien"" is one of the very few horror films that understands that you can't scare people by raking up the bodies and the blood, but you have to build up the suspense to do it. And director Ridley Scott is such a genius, and he shows that here, he absolutely knows how to make any kind of film, ones that can scare (Alien), one that can sadden (Thelma and Louise), and one that can excite/thrill (Gladiator). And Ridley really keeps up the dark atmosphere, especially in the beginning when there's no talking for the 1st 5 minutes or so, we get the feeling that something's not right all the time. Some parts are very quiet and very depressing and we feel exactly what we see.This is the legend that I'm talking about here, folks. Don't miss the chance to see this, because it will scare the living daylights outta you more than any other movie you're gonna see in your life.

Alien (1979) The best sci-fi movies,"Alien was released 44 years ago and still impresses with its technical quality. The scenarios and visual effects are perfect, managing to be better than many of the current films that have much more technology to create something better. The Alien has a wonderful and iconic look, making him one of the most striking villains in cinema, even though he doesn't appear all the time. Not showing up much is what makes him so awesome. The tension scenes work really well because you don't know what he's capable of and you can't see him. The characters are well developed and the fights between them are very natural. There is only one moment where the visual effects are not so good, but that does not negate all the aesthetic beauty and writing of the film.

My favourite tagline for a movie,"""In space, no one can hear you scream."" This remains my favourite tagline ever for a movie. When 'Alien' was released in 1979, it caused almost as much talk as 'Star Wars' did when released two years earlier. The science fiction genre was being revolutionized at this time and 'Alien' had a horror characteristic to it which was psychological, visually striking and compelling with the type of strength in silence not seen since '2001: A Space Odyssey' in 1968. Definitely a big influence in blockbuster film making, 'Alien' has spawned three sequels so far and is a great horror/science-fiction classic not to be missed. It is director Ridley Scott's best effort on the big screen for making fear the best character in the film.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Classic tale of terror,"This is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Everything is so carefully and expertly constructed to the point that repeated viewings are just as good as the first. Also, the atmosphere, along with the amazing sets, is real shocker and few movies have managed to create the same kind eerie feeling.The story starts with the crew of the cargo vessel ""Nostromo"" waking up before schedule. They soon realize their on-board computer has detected life on a nearby planet and they go to investigate. One of them unwillingly brings back an...ALIEN (!) which soon becomes a very unwanted passenger. The introduction of the title creature in the famous chest-burster scene is a real jolter. Especially if you watch it after dinner.The music, too, must be mentioned and it moves the story along with unrelenting terror. However, the lack of music, in certain scenes, works just as well and this combination makes for one of the best musical montages to be put on film.This is a classic film that spawned a series, which is good overall, and a bunch of copycats, many of which are just sad.

Young Sigurney Weaver and Veronica Cartwright provide a high breeze of fresh air in the otherwise oppressive mouldy interiors. It was Ridley Scott at his best, along with other early masterpieces like his much accoladed debut 'The Duellists'.

As Near Perfection As Possible.,"Three words perfectly describe ALIEN: Long, dark and ominous.You know you're in for a good time when even the opening title gives you a shiver. The music plays perfectly as the word 'ALIEN' slowly appears, line by line. Then there are the establishing shots of the ship; poorly maintained, claustrophobic.And then there's basically forty minutes of people in a ship pondering and eating and getting along (or not). The film has one little thing that allows it to draw you along so slowly - a promise. A promise made by the advertisements and hype that this was going to kick your ass. You just had to wait.But when it happens, it happens. Though the film doesn't speed up per se, there's a lot more happening in front of the screen to make it at least look like stuff's going on. The first half crawls almost depressingly, but the second half catches your eye and refuses to let go.I suggest everyone sees this film. Even if you skip through the beginning, you need to see this.

Simplicity in Storytelling and Art Direction Makes the Film Timeless,"The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the film practically has no connection to any particular culture.The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R. Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn on one by one to form the letters of ""ALIEN.""The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Thirty-two years on, and still exceptional.","In the crowded gallery of horror films, Alien hangs in a prominent position, high above its rivals. By virtue of its deft blend of psychology and physical horror, it lifts the genre out of the graveyard and into deepest space . While its scale models, grimy characters, and shimmering soundtrack may no longer appeal to a generation of audiences who revel in the hotchpotch storyboards of 'Drag Me To Hell', Alien still commands great respect, and rightly so. It has not lost any of its cutting edge, even after thirty-two years.Alien's simplistic premise keeps the film tight and lean; a taut, slow-burning game of cat and mouse involving a vicious, shadowy creature whose acidic blood can melt the very girders of the ship it has invaded, and a compelling blend of the brave (Ripley), cautious (Dallas), and mechanical (Ash). There are no meaningless references to childhood memories or superfluous romance. The characters and their personalities are weathered, believable, and their mission plausible. The profit-driven search for mineral ore provides a realistic corporate counterpoint to the main story, which sees the seven crew members dragged, somewhat unwillingly, into the extraterrestrial's world. With the possible exception of Ash, they did not seek this encounter; the computers lead them to it. How each crew member responds to the situation is key; in effect, seven sub plots form, each focusing upon something different, be it a crew member's mannerisms, their way of thinking, or indeed, a violent death (Chestburster). This is Alien's greatest appeal; it provides an insight into the human mind, as psychological horror movies should. Which crew member do we, the audience, root for, admire, or resent? Who can trust who?Sigourney Weaver, so often credited with inspiring a roll-call of female cinematic heroines, rightly earns every syllable of praise that has been heaped upon her since the film's release; Ripley's resourcefulness and courage are marvellous to behold. However, as the genuinely disturbing android Ash, Ian Holm is supreme; his reserved demeanour and considered approach masking the motives that lay hidden out of sight.As an exercise in sound and vision, Alien is a memorable spectacle. There are many moments that are striking. The colossal hauler Nostromo, futuristic and industrial in design, dominates the screen as it crawls slowly, almost gracefully, towards Earth. The sheen of the soundtrack and the echoing calls from the freighter to 'Antarctica Traffic Control' are atmospheric to the core, while the fogbound alien planet, littered with blackened mountains and the silhouette of the hulking, derelict vessel, is hauntingly desolate. Spaces where, in modern horror films, the gaps would be filled with meaningless dialogue, are left vacant. The viewer can interpret what they see with no need for speech. Ridley Scott's vision of 'horror first, science-fiction second' was, without a doubt, fulfilled; audiences should ignore the flashing lights and controls of the spaceship and focus upon the Alien. Around which corner does it lurk? Who becomes its next victim?Alien is a film of immense quality. It has the capacity to frighten and to deceive. It flows precisely from scene to scene with no wasted shots and most tellingly, does not stray off course by incorporating fanciful special effects or worthless roles filled by fringe characters. One spacecraft, one extraterrestrial, seven humans, and one cat is all we are given. And quite simply, anything more would have been a waste. While the genre of horror may have moved on, the art of horror is captured perfectly, here, in the blackness of space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"I remain underwhelmed, I'm afraid","This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clichéd today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A horror classic that has stood the test of time! Still by far the best movie in the series.,"'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien is an incredible classic,"The Film is just well made, revolutionary for it's time and still watchable for younger generations, although young people might find the beginning ab bit to long.One of the best films i have ever seen.It would be a crime to give this movie a grade under 9.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Cleverly frightful, even after seeing it for the first time at this time of age","Alien is a well done, out-of-this-world horror film that leaves some good scares and some epic scenes. The alien itself was splendidly creepy, the humanoid was really neat, and the spaceship was awesome. Most of the main characters were not all that compelling, but with a story like this, it all mixes together nicely. This also included some well designed special effects, including the alien, and especially the cargo ship that carried the crew (and the cat). I can certainly see why this was a big hit during it's time, and as mentioned before, I would have to say that it still is a really good hit today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The alien within?,"Despite it's legendary status, the truth is that Alien is just a horror movie set out in space, i.e. the alien monster taking the part of the serial killer that's murdering the cast one by one (minus of course the main character, in this case Ripley - played by Sigourney Weaver). So, nothing original, apart from that it's set in outer space.Then where does that leave us? Well, two things are really of note. H.R. Giger's design of the alien planet and the creature itself - chilling and nightmarish, in what is the brush of a true artist, and also Ash's poetic reflection on the alien monster: ""Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility."" ""I admire its purity. A survivor.. unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.""And yet despite the atmospheric approach, it's unclear what angle or view, if any, the film offers. Seemingly it condemns the instinctive effort for survival of the alien creature, yet in the end it's the morally bound humankind which prevails. In fact, the scene in the end where Ripley comes face to face with the alien and kills it by shooting it in outer space is probably the film's center of gravity. The alien creature is for the first time looking insecure and scared of dying, but Ripley (guided by her own instincts) shows no remorse. Here, the roles of the hunter and the hunted are blurred, and so is the moral status of mankind.Other minor themes are the remorseless capitalist stance of the mother/company, which also hides a metaphysical meaning (the company is called mother, it controls the destiny of the crew, has it's own purposes, has it's chosen representative amongst the crew with the robot Ash etc).",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One Bad Apple,"A classic in sci fi horror movies, this one gets you right from the start. It's a claustrophobic film and never lets up, the trouble is it's been remade so any times and never bettered.The crew of the Nostromo have just woken up but are nowhere near Earth, instead their ship has received a distress beacon. Except it's more of a warning, and on the planet Kane (John Hurt) is attacked by an alien lifeform. Trying to get back to the ship Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) says the land crew should be put in isolation. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) disagrees and lets them on the ship. BAD IDEA, as one by one the crew is killed, of course there is a bad apple. I won't tell you who but it's pretty obvious as the film progresses. Sequels followed, all starring Weaver and they're all good in their own ways, but this is the superior movie in every way. It certainly helps with a great cast and a superb special effects crew.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Overrated,"Nice to see that a few all too rare reviewers agree that Ridley Scott`s ALIEN is a rather overrated film , yes I agree with everyone that the set design is fantastic but the film suffers from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY syndrome in that it has a very slow sterile atmosphere which makes it difficult to connect with the characters . The only character I felt any sympathy with was Kane and that`s only because he was played by the excellent John Hurt . As for the rest of the crew I couldn`t care less if they got eaten or not . To all intents ALIEN is a corny B movie script ( I think we can ignore all the pseudo-intellectual claptrap involving subtext - it`s a B movie script ) produced by A list techniciansTrivia point : Ridley Scott was working as a BBC designer in 1963 and legend has it that he was due to work on a fledgling sci-fi series but became unavailable at the last moment which meant Raymond Cusack worked on this new show called DOCTOR WHO and it was he who designed the Daleks undoubtedly the most visually interesting creations in the history of television.Talking of DOCTOR Who check out the 1975 story ` The Ark In Space ` which has a very similar premise to ALIEN  but is far more enjoyable",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Probably my favorite movie ever.,"A lot of people describe the suspense and terror that this movie demonstrates as its best characteristic, which is certainly valid. It is intense, and can be held up as one of the greatest horror movies of all time, easily. I would argue, beyond that, that it's one of the greatest movies of all time in general. It's basically perfect sci-fi; with absolutely gorgeous sci-fi design and brilliant execution, with beautiful sets and effects that hold up today. It has great dramatic moments and even some twists. None of the sequels, to me, hold a candle to this.It feels a bit like Blade Runner, with its borderline avant-garde use of quiet moments. However, unlike Blade Runner (which is just as strong a film) this movie uses its nebulous setting and ominous set design, music, lighting, and sound design to instill a deep, troubling fear in the audience.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Still Fresh Classic,"I find it almost impossible to talk about older films like Alien without griping about CGI and the current state of mainstream cinema. This review is no different. Alien is so much better than the pap we get from present-day Hollywood.Watch this movie and be shocked by how it a) takes some time to build up its cast, who aren't wisecracking, superhuman hunks and lingerie model types, b) uses practical effects (out of necessity) that actually look and move like solid objects that could exist, and c) doesn't revel in pointless gore or rattle the screen with a ton of frenetically cut action scenes that do nothing to further the plot.In short, ladies and gentleman, this is a film that takes some time and care with its story. It may be a simple story. It may be basically a haunted house thriller or Jaws in space, but it wrings every last drop of tension from the script, setting and monster, making for a classic that will watched for decades after the likes of Transformers or World War Z are mostly forgotten.One final note about Alien and this type of thriller in general: it heightens the audience experience to wonder how they'd react in the same situation, whether they'd have the guts to face down a snarling monster like the xenomorph or if they'd cr*p their pants in the corner and wait to be eaten. Because Alien features characters that actually talk, panic, squabble and make decisions like some plausible representation of actual human beings, this is a possibility. The film is called Alien, but it's also very much about the humans.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"I Truly Appreciate This Film, But I couldn't love it.","Coming from Ridley Scott, The Cult Classic ""Alien"" that truly shaped Sci-fi genre afterwards; is a remarkably well made film. That inspired so many filmmakers to indulge themselves in these kind of fascinating tales. Considering the era it belongs to; that alone makes it much more impressive but at the same time it still has some pertaining isssues which I really want to discuss.Set in the dystopian future, where space travels have now become a norm and astronauts are instructed to explore newer life and organisms beyond our solar system constantly.
The plot revolves around one of those ships, named ""Nostromo"" containing 7 people who have just woken up from their sleep capsules after their mothership received a distress signal from a nearby planet. The story continues from thereon.Released back in the 1979, the art direction, cinematography, the VFX; everything looked pretty amazing. Even by today's standards they seemed almost competitive. Although it has some isssues regarding the usage of underwhelming Prosthetics, Make Ups but I can understand the limitations they had in those time and age.I would not have complained at all, had I seen this earlier; maybe 10-15 years back. But unfortunately after so many years of experiencing better Sci-Fi productions, at the age of 23; only now I have decided to see this classic for the first time. Too late in the party I guess!Therefore I couldn't unsee the shortcomings on Make Ups, And Props that are being used because of how Hollywood itself as a industry has evolved in terms of Artistic approaches; I couldn't simply nod my head for nostalgia sake and say those were perfect. Sorry I Just Can't!Another issue I have with the characters themselves. Apart from Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver, others seemed weaker in terms of build ups and their individual personalities. I couldn't even care for any one of them. I loved Ripley as the strong lead who single handedly carried it on her shoulders. Without her inclusion this would have been a unpleasant viewing!As for the sound design and background music goes; that was awesome. The makers used a subtle layering of Music whenever situation is demanding. Other times pure silence did the work. Full marks for the audio department.Screenplay and the Editing looked sharp most of the times. On few occasions I found out the cuts or the transitions to be unclear and interrupted in midway. I watched the director's cut, haven't seen the Theatrical one yet so that might be the case but I did notice some glaring issues regarding various frame transitions throughout the runtime. I might be too nitpicky here, but for a cult classic that is both critically acclaimed and loved by the fans; I think I can.Now don't get me wrong, my criticism is my own personal viewpoint. And I know I'm in the minority here but as a reviewer I needed to express an honest opinion. And I just did that with clear enough explanations.That doesn't mean I didn't like the film, Definitely I did. I really liked the film. The scares, the tension, the suspense alongside an amazing camera work, art direction and sound design it certainly grabbed my attention. But still it couldn't make a lasting impression on me. I wanted to love this, as a Sci Fi Enthusiastic; I wished it to be among the best. But to my overwhelming expectations; It missed the spot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Classic! It broke the rules of horror with its originality.,"It's a classic, but why? Because this film broke several horror paradigms, such as that women are always powerless, or that horror couldn't be more subjective and calm, and so on. The originality of this film is huge, making a wave of horror films that are inspired here.As I mentioned, the movie is subjective, it uses your mind and your creativity, so you can make your own guess as to what Alien is entirely like. It uses the most primitive human fear, which is the fear of the unknown, and because of that, it takes a longer time for the alien to appear in the plot. For some this is bad, for others not so much, for me it is sensational.In addition to primitive terror, the screenwriters still found time and space to make very interesting criticisms and allegories, such as that the crew (men) who were abused by FaceHugger so that the Alien will be born, or the criticism of capitalism and corporations who care only for profit and not for the workers.This movie has tremendous importance for the movie industry in general, not just for science fiction and horror. His precise decisions that fill the film with qualities, made new directors and screenwriters inspired by it.

Modern Space Horror was born with this chest bursting film.,"The first of the two punches that made Ridley Scott a science fiction directing icon, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece as both a science fiction and horror film.

One of the best sci-fi films of all time.,"Alien (1979)To commemorate 4/26 Alien Day I thought I'd watch this movie. I think Ridley Scott is my favorite Ridley. That's saying a lot when you know how much I enjoy Daisy Ridley as an actress. Not only that, but he's also one of my favorite directors. Easily in my top 10 if not top 5. It's a shame that he's never won and Oscar.Alien is a staple in Sci-fi Horror. It's a hard genre to mash together and produce something good, let alone phenomenal. With the exception of the Alien series I can only name Pandorum off the top of my head that would fit into that meld of genres.Alien also had a strong female protagonist, one that wasn't really established as the main character till the second act. It's sort of reminiscent of Samus from Metroid.Speaking of main characters: Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, is easily one of the most recognizable female characters in all of science fiction. I'd only suspect that maybe Princess Leia would be more. Even if it was her first time as the leading lady she did a wonderful job that stands the test of time.I'd be hard press to not talk about Kane, played by John Hurt, as a demonstration of not only an intense and agonizing scene, but the wonderful use of practical effects that will terrorize and also make you feel pity for him. I won't spoil this old movie, but I'm sure you all know which scene I'm talking about. If you don't you'll know by the second act.People seem to forget that Ash was played by Ian Holm. Bilbo from The Lord of the Rings, and Priest Vito Cornelius from Fifth Element. His scene towards the end of act II reminded me of playing Alien Isolation the video game. Though it should be the other way around. Remember the first time I saw Alien was when I was nine.John McClane will be known for his catch phrase. Darth Vader for his many quotable lines. I believe Ripley has an amazing phrase she says in the movie that out of context is not a spoiler. ""I got you! You son-of-a-bitch.""Can I say that the writing in this film is off the charts. People have a real reason for being there. Each character is on their own a beacon of personality. There isn't a character that's forgotten after watching the movie recently. I couldn't even name half of the party in the Hobbit and I saw that just the other day. Just goes to show you the respect I have for character development. Thank you Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett. They both worked on Total Recall, another great Sci- fi film.Verdict: Cult Classic, must watch.

"In space, no one can hear you yawn.","In space, no one can hear you yawn.The first Ridley Scott film I saw was The Duelists. LOVED it! So I had high hopes for Alien. I saw it when it came out in 1979. Admittedly, the film had a disadvantage before the credits rolled: I saw it in Hollywood and the line for the film was far scarier than the film could possibly be.As I sat watching it, it seemed familiar, like a film that really freaked me out as a boy: It! The Terror from Beyond Space. ITTFBS had a monster that just couldn't be killed and it was on a ship in space so there was NO escaping it (none of these fruity escape pods in 50s sci-fi). I haven't seen ITTFBS since, but it ranked right up there with Mars Attacks bubble gum cards for giving me the creeps.So Alien was a remake. There's no crime against that, unless it ends up being the film Alien turned out to be: not very scary, pretty funny (for the wrong reasons) in spots, and politically correct (the enemy isn't so much the Alien as BIG BUSINESS that wants the Alien brought back no matter what the cost). I haven't seen the complete film again for several years, but as it was on today and I found so many parts so ludicrous, I had to vent.First, a plus: the sequence leading up to the face hugger eggs was, if sluggish, rather intriguing (why do space-age cameras of the future take such bad pictures?) and the sets were great! But we are introduced early on to the film's unending and uninteresting mumbled dialog. I guess this was supposed to make the film seem more `real.' They were improvising some of this, but it might as well have been `caterpillar watermelon' crowd-scene improvising. This got old fast.The stomach bursting was a shock! But that quickly faded as the Alienette looks like little more than a nasty finger puppet and literally zips off screen WB-cartoon style. It gets worse. After a fight to the death involving a rolled-up issue of Evil Android Monthly, Ash's head comes off. A few minutes of poking a prosthetic mock-up of Ash's head which looks NOTHING like the actual Ash, there is a clumsy cut to actor Holm's head poking through a hole in a table. Meant to be gory and gruseome, this is all just inept. And the gurgle/burble white ooze everywhere made me chuckle -- it looked like someone was having a Dairy Queen nightmare.Before Ash, the only enunciator in the bunch, is sent to that big milk carton in the sky, he tells us the Alien can't be killed and that the crew is expendable. Daft! How can one transport something that can't be killed which, if it decides it wants to kill you (and everybody else, which seems to be its ""thing""),  can't be transported? Well, that's just the way those big, evil corporations work, I guess. I'll bet the same people behind Wendy's and Swatch are planning something just like this right now! In space, nothing makes much sense!And speaking of that tag line, I had hoped that this would be a scary, `real' tech movie, following in the footsteps of 2001. No. Sadly, in space, everyone can hear you scream, and mumble, and just make a TON of noise (especially Lambert and Parker throwing those cylinders around; they were probably killed because the Alien couldn't sleep!). And when did steam become a high-tech necessity. Is it DRY in space and they need a nuclear humidifier on every deck; a leaky one, at that?The last ten minutes are fairly tense: will Ripley slip into something even more comfortable than skin-tight t-shirt and panties before confronting the Alien which is no longer fast and dangerous in the confines of the escape pod, but stumbles around in the ubiquitous steam until it can be ejected like a drunk who's stayed past closing time?There. I feel better now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"A sci-fi horror ""classic"" which disappoints","Upon its initial release critical reaction to Alien was mixed to negative. One notable review described it as an empty bag of tricks. One critic dismissed it as an overblown B-movie. Another called it deeply dislikeable. Then a funny thing happened. Audiences saw the film and liked it. The film became a big success. It wasn't long before the film was being touted as a classic of its genre. Critics who had initially panned the film went back and wrote entirely new reviews praising it. The film was now beyond criticism. Nobody would dare admit they did not love it. Truth is the critics had it right the first time. This film is just not very good.Alien is meant to be a scary monster movie but the scares certainly don't come fast and furious. This film takes a long, long time setting itself up. Director Ridley Scott tries to build suspense. But this slow build drags on far too long for the film's good. Tension and intrigue drain away, boredom sets in. The film is often described as ""Jaws in space"" in that it's a monster movie in which we see very little of the monster. But where Steven Spielberg kept Jaws crackling along Scott's film gets terribly bogged down. Jaws also benefited from compelling characters. No such luck with Alien. Sigourney Weaver has some presence to her playing the key role of Ripley. But that character doesn't really spark to life until very late in the film. The rest of the cast has very little to do. A boring group of characters prone to doing stupid things. Like searching for a cat instead of, you know, escaping the giant murderous Alien. There are some notably fine actors here, including John Hurt and Ian Holm. But the script fails them. The characters never inspire much feeling in you at all, giving you little reason to care about their fate. There is very little story here, no character development whatsoever. A late reveal of one character's background proves more silly than shocking. The film has a memorable moment or two. But one or two moments in a two-hour film aren't nearly enough. This monster movie is monstrously overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Defining moment in sci-fi horror history,"Alien is one indisputably one of the best science fiction, and horror films ever made. And easily one of the most influential ever. As it basically invented and defined the science- fiction horror genre, paving the way for films like the thing, and predator.One of Alien's best aspects is its amazing cinematography and creature/set design. All of see work together to give the film a visual style that was unlike anything scene at the time and Ridley Scott would re-use in Blade Runner. Alien's magnificent visuals can be strangely credited to Alejandro Jodorowsky, who found and assembled all the different artists used in Alien for his adaptation of the novel dune, which was unfortunately canned before shooting started, but every cloud has a silver lining, and Jodorowsky's Dune's silver lining was Alien.Another one of Alien's best aspects is its pacing and atmosphere, though some people today may call Alien ""boring,"" these people know nothing about film and are not to be trusted. Alien opens with a slow footage of space, as the eerie score plays, open credits come up, and the title is slowly spelled out, this is then followed by a slow montage of the empty ship Nostromo, followed by the crew slowly waking up from cryospleep. In fact we don't see any sign of an alien until 1/3 of the way through the film, and we don't see the main alien until halfway through the film. And this is why some call it ""boring,"" but these people came to see the wrong film, they expected something like predator, a straight forward action film where the hero tries to kill the creature, instead what they got was something more like Halloween or Psycho, a subtle unnerving film that builds tension and doesn't blow its load all at once.The characters in Alien are also far above the average horror movie, they aren't annoying teenagers, or people that we just want to see die. They're relatable diverse logical characters, that have really natural chemistry, as can be seen in some of the films earlier scenes. And another interesting thing about the characters is, we have to figure out which one the protagonist is, it isn't revealed immediately and makes all lot of scenes much more tense because we don't know which characters are going to die.Though Alien begins slow, the final scenes of Alien are some of the most ""on the edge of your seat"" scenes ever, I don't won't to spoil anything for anyone who somehow hasn't scene alien yet, but you will most likely be on the verge of a heart attack while watching.One final note, I recommend you watch the original version first, and then you most definitely should watch the directors cut.9.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
All time great film,"I first saw this in a cinema in 1980 while I was at university. As a huge sci-fi fan I assumed this would be some kind of low budget monster movie that would be mildly diverting. I'd never heard of Ridley Scott before... I came out of the cinema stunned and wanted to see this again immediately. To say it is one of the greatest sci- fi films of all time is under-rating it. It is one of the greatest films of all time.Performances that are pitch-perfect from a stellar cast. The first dirty, grungie space vessel that I'd seen in a film - more gritty and real than anything that had ever been offered up before. A freighter - not a fighter or a star-destroyer or something glamorous. Just a working freighter.And a villain that was relentless, a perfect killing machine. Tougher than anything - with acid for blood! And in the end a heroine that was just as relentless. Ripley. Legendary now, revolutionary then. If you haven't seen this, your film education is lacking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
EXTRA(ordinary)-TERR(ifying)-ESTRIAL,"One of the best lit films of all time, the attention and care towards how the sets, actors, and Xenomorph appear in darkness and light is so commendable and is what keeps this film looking so fresh. Alien is basically what happens when a creative team is given the ability to build an immersive world while also making a tense horror movie about an alien killing people on a ship. It has indulgent landing and launching sequences, an infatuation with the anatomy of its creature, accurate specs of its ships layout, it's not a hard sci-fi watch per se but you can tell if Ridley and the crew had more money this film would probably be much longer. As it is I think it has the perfect length, also huge props to that fantastic cast where every character is clear and well motivated. I love this movie so much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the all time great science fiction AND horror movies,"My friend and I saw Alien when it was first released, at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. We were teenagers in high school. We sat in the front row. After Star Wars had come out 2 years previously, we were still waiting for something else equally comparable to come along. With this, we finally got what we had been waiting for. Not only was it a great science fiction movie, it was also one of the greatest horror movies.I went in to this knowing next to nothing what it was about. All I had to go on was the line in the poster: ""In space, no one can hear you scream."" I just had to find out what it was that was gonna make us scream. I found out all right! They came up with quite a terrifying alien monster. This was the kind of thing, once the crew of the Nostromo started to learn its true nature, during the course of watching the movie, it was chilling to think they might not be prepared to stop it.Now, decades later I regard this as one of the greatest science fiction movies, and also one of the greatest horror movies. If you are a fan of either genre, or especially both, you need to check this one out. And don't stop at this - there is a whole fictional universe that has been created, the Alien and Predator movies, many of which are worth your while.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Favorite Horror/Sci-Fi movie,"Alien has something that current horror movies lack and that is fear of the unknown. For a good portion of the movie, we didn't know what the alien looked like. Alien builds up tension by not showing us what the alien looked like or what it was doing.
The characters were amazing during the whole movie. They weren't there just for the alien to kill, they actually had characteristic unique to them. Each character felt real and relatable.
The best part of the movie was definitely the alien. Like I said above the alien was never shown completely without purpose. It was moving with the intention of killing everyone on board.
Ridley Scott direction was excellent. From the atmosphere to how the alien goes on board the ship, everything was on point. I loved the atmosphere of this movie, it was a claustrophobic during most of the movie.
This film is not an action film, so it doesn't have fast sequence moments; this movie takes its time and is a very slow pace. But, that is what makes it work.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't quite hold up after all these years.,"After viewing the film again after 37 years, and loving it when I first saw it, I realize that it has many flaws. Most noticeable are: 1) the horribly developed dialogue between crew members. Obviously the writers never worked in a factory like setting, or for that matter, any setting where they had to communicate with small talk with co-workers. Compare this dialogue with the dialogue from the 1951 Thing or even Forbidden Planet.2) Sigourney Weavers character is way too harsh. It may have been a sign of the times to create a ""strong woman"" but in the film she comes off needlessly harsh and unappealing.3) Overuse of technical effects like the strobe light. Why does a ship have strobe lights anyway?4) A very big rip-off of the film ""It, the terror from beyond space. The plot line and dialogue was better in that one as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
By far the best of the alien series,There are some fantastic visuals in this that are nonexistent in the other alien movies. Really great storytelling with good suspense. The writing and script were top tier. My one complaint was that the story had a few clichés that occur in any movie about aliens in space. Other than that it's one of my favorite space films.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Quiet Beginning,"Review 1 of 4Alien is one of those films that will never age. It takes the simplest story and tells it as well as it can be told. I look at this film as the first in a trilogy, many may not agree with that, but Alien is a perfect beginning. It establishes an entire world and makes it feel real. Everything feels new and interesting. The things that are not explained in this film are exactly what makes it so fascinating to watch. Where did that ship come from? It doesn't matter. Like a good novel the film allows you to fill in the pieces with your own imagination. This goes for the alien it self, since we see so little of it that it becomes all the more terrifying for it. Ridley Scott is like a painter with his images. So many frames of this picture seem like they could be made into still photographs. Alien is science fiction and yet with the way it is shot and acted the movie feels like a documentary. It's that sense of verisimilitude that has made this movie last for so long. So much is present in the subtext. I get the feeling that one of the underlying themes of the film is that technology in the future will little by little overtake the lives of human beings, but paradoxically the nostromo still needs a crew in order to operate. I believe this film is one of the few realistic depictions of what encountering a real Alien life form might actually be like, and that it may not be what we are expecting. something that has always stood out to me about the film is the level of familiarity that the characters have with their surroundings. Many science fiction films love to draw attention to their futuristic technology but the characters in Alien react to it like a construction worker would with operating a crane: it is their job. This film is so good for so many reasons. The performances are nothing short of amazing, the set design exquisite, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is subtle and evocative, but the main reason for me that alien still holds up after all these years is that it takes itself very seriously. There is no Hollywood style self referential humor that would saturate the later entries of the series. Sigourney Weaver may have gotten the academy award nomination for Aliens, but her work here is very solid. She plays a character who through much hardship finds strength within herself that never appeared to be there to begin with. If you look at the Alien series as a trilogy this is the film where Ripley discovers who she really is, or defines her character, and the only way one can do that is through the choices they make in extreme circumstances. This is a film of great tension and subtly, well worth seeing over and over again to pick up on all the layers of subtext that may have been missed the first or second viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien: A sci-fi-horror match made in heaven.,"At the end of the day, Alien is now roughly almost 40 years old. 40 years is a long time, and we've seen cinema evolve drastically over that period, yet Alien retains everything it had back in 1979.Everything from the atmosphere, the long shots, the slow build-ups, the creature design, the characters, the plot twist, I could go on. It really does become difficult to find flaws in this movie. Granted some of the FX are pretty dated now, but you have to remember how revolutionary they were back in the day.Alien is a masterclass in sci-fi horror, far and few films can claim the level of superiority that Ridley Scott's masterpiece still holds.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

You know your movie is special when you call it 'alien',"This isn't just an 'alien' film this is the alien film. A film that succeeds in both the horror and Sci-fi genre. Having seen both versions of this film directors and the theatrical, I must tell you to watch this film. The acting cast is great, the story flows and is logical but that's not even the best part. The special effects and CGI have never really been topped by any other film. Even in the newer 'alien' movies or the 'alien vs predator' franshise.

The perennial sci-fi horror classic.,"Tonight I got the chance to view the perennial sci-fi horror classic in all its glory on the big screen, celebrating 40 years since its inception, and my god does it stand the test of time.Derek Vanlint cinematography is masterful to say the least, perfectly embodying the elements of horror through utilising claustrophobic camerawork and a bleak blue and grey colour palette, however, it's his use of lighting that truly captures the chilling overtones. Shafts of light seep in through vent grates, puncturing the smoky atmosphere in abundance, strobe lighting creates a sense of agitation as the creature hunts the crew members one by one, whilst flurries of neon blue and red shimmers ground it to its science fiction roots.The sound, or lack of, further builds unease, with Jerry Goldsmith's humming drone of a score crafting an eerie tension that only erupts when utterly necessary, standing as one of the first films to EFFECTIVELY utilise jump scares. The use of clanging chains and scraping metal highlighting the anxiety being established alongside impressive and colossal sets. The production design is utterly stunning, from the confined corridors of the Nostromo to the vast expanse of the alien world.This film will forever remain an exemplary addition to the sci-fi genre. Gorgeous and terrifying cinematography, a haunting score, immense set design and some brilliant performance from the main cast, that aided in creating one of the greatest female action heroines of all time, upping her game further in Cameron's follow-up action flick. 'Alien' is truly masterful.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Does not stand the test of time,"Having just watched Alien for the first time, I cannot give it more than a 6/10. The film was mediocre at best. It began slowly, and honestly, never really picked up; in fact, I almost decided to stop the movie and go do something else since it was quite boring.Let me explain a bit further. The characters are weak, showing no development and very little likability. Thus, I had no care for them throughout the film and so they provided little incentive for me to keep watching. If anything, the pure annoyance at the characters' decisions made me want to turn off the movie even more.Furthermore, the plot was very straightforward and could not stand by itself. If you think for a moment about what would happen in a film named ""Alien"", chances are you are spot on.Because of this, I have a feeling that this movie must have stood on the laurels of its visuals and its novelty during the era. For contemporary viewers, these no longer hold much weight, and so the movie crumbles. As an analogy, I believe that similar remarks will be made about movies like James Cameron's Avatar in a few decades.To summarize, this is not a film that has withstood the test of time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Classical sci-fi horror at its best,"It is 28 December 2024, and Alien seems like the perfect Christmas/Years-End movie to watch. Does it stand its own 45 years after launch? Well, sort of...There is nothing to say that has not been said before about Alien. Countless reviews in different media talks about its greatness and how it revolutionized sci-fi horror. To these statements, Alien remains truthful, a well-made sci-fi horror-driven drama about 7 contracted personnel in a container ship that wake up suddenly from cryo-sleep because of an unknown beacon from seemingly uncharted territory. Far away from Earth, and bound by contract, they investigate the beacon to find an alien life-form that might put their lives at risk.Most, if not all elements of Alien have undergone scrutiny, dissection from plot to cinematography. Yes, it is a simplistic plot that sort of works; yes, the slow-paced, slow-driven terror is amusing, for the most part, but can be quite tiresome. No news here. Thus, this review focuses on the nit-gritty aspects of this film in current times: what still works, what does not work anymore, starting with the latter.This review uses the Director's Cut for basis.Avoid the terrible mistake of watching the Director's Cut if you are to watch Alien for the first time. There is a reason for the existence of a Theatrical Cut and, later, a Director's Cut to make the scene, usually launching after the success of a movie or its Director - and Ridley Scott is a famous, famous individual. The Director's Cut is, well, one version away from Raw, and, in Alien, the pacing is weird, unexpected cuts destroying continuity.Maybe by the end of the 70s, Alien was frightening, but times were simpler back then. In 2024, this movie ranges from respectful classic to boring altogether. Movie aficionados find the cinematography and careful design to be top-notch, masterfully done for the time, especially considering that the CGI element is little to none, but today's audience expects action, and Alien provides little. The entirety of the movie is the characters trying to chase this unknown creature in a methodical way, while camerawork is worried about the aesthetics of the ship. When they do hit the creature, deaths happen mostly offscreen, to the unsatisfaction of the audience.The dialogue is also cringeworthy, a series of unnatural exchanges that feel scripted, at best. There is your fair share of expository speech, and then there is character development, which is sort of minimum and idiotic. Two characters complaining about their pay checks all the time; a weird Scientist that behaves like a plank; a woman that is hysterical from the start; a Captain that leads nothing. And then there is Ripley, which starts dull and ends dull, her emotional constraints unclear in the story until the unclimactic end.Yeah, the ending is far from amazing too. It basically just happens, no final confrontation, no sudden realization, nothing.Now, the elements that work are the ones that have sustained this powerful franchise.In the sci-fi horror genre, Alien is a ground breaker that shows that simplicity works. Give us cool trinkets and some exposition and we fill in the gaps.As aforementioned, the Cinematography is great, evidencing the aesthetics of the ship and focusing on the terror aspect through its slow drive.The antagonist is this interesting hunter beast, the perfect killing machine. Its motives are crude, rudimentary, but its coolness overcomes its dullness. Everyone knows the power of the Xenomorphs.Alien is one of those movies that stands the test of time as a fine piece of Art. Like such, average watchers might miss its intricate designs, dismissing it as old stuff, at best vintage. Those that look beyond should notice its raw power and fancy its clever prospects.Just... just don't watch the Director's Cut first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Plot, atmosphere, character development and associated cosmic horror.","These are some big words in terms of cinema and one of my favorite movies of all time.We are in the presence of a masterpiece of the seventh art and the beginning of one of the most interesting franchises in history.An unpretentious movie that led to an iconic character of Lovecraftian cosmic terror and one of the most important action heroines in history along with Sarah Connor.The atmosphere of tension, the murky, the darkness and dirt that surrounds the environment and the plot.A Machiavellian corporation that pulls the strings so that an android acting as the executive arm foments terror and desperation allowing events to occur.""In space no one can hear your screams,"" an incredible mantra.Those who have never seen the movie should go into it without knowing anything at all.It is the perfect prototype for a movie of this genre where you don't know who can survive, but we do know that the vast majority will die...
Exemplary practical effects and the design of the genius of H. R. Giger bring us a perfect being, an insatiable killer, who doesn't reason, who kills by instinct.Perhaps its sequel (which I love and think is brilliant) demystifies the xenomorph as a creature of terror a bit, adding a lot of lore to the universe. However, in this movie, we have a space horror thriller that could rarely (or never) be reproduced in the cinema, no matter how hard it was tried.A must for fans of the genre and a good reminder for the next movie that is released, which seems to have a lot of inspiration in ""Alien.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Still better than 99% of the movies being churned out over the past 30 years.,"I have seen this movie countless times since 1979 and it still delivers on the aspect of being far from earth, on a planet you do not know, with a spaceship of unknown origin, and encountering a nasty lifeform. These people were blue collar workers; not the brilliant scientists and doctors that you see in today's movies regarding aliens. No, what you see in 1979 is much more realistic of how humans would be when encountering a complete unknown. In movies like Prometheus and Life, the overall common sense is nil and the smarmy, charming and very attractive geniuses are completely opposite of what brilliant people of science and medicine are really like. In reality, they are mostly awkward, quiet, strange and in many times extremely plain in appearance. In Alien, everyone comes across as tired, annoyed, curious (Kane) and finally terrified. A very real progression that leads to the outcome.Most of the bad reviews I have read on IMDB come from viewers who have grown up on the CGI oatmeal that most movies rely on instead of story. It's sad that they don't realize how great the story of Alien is.The cast back in 1979 was mostly unknowns which added so much to the reality and everyone played their parts perfectly.I am watching the movie right now as I write this and even though I know exactly what is going to happen, I am still tense and in awe of how good it still is.If you do not like this movie, I pity you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Ultimate Sci-Fi Horror Classic,"The wave of horror films from the 70s and 80s was filled with what many would consider classics. Halloween, Hellraiser, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are all entrenched in the public consciousness and a must see for any film fanatic. But few of these, even the really good ones, rise above the level of 'cult' classic - they have a dedicated fan following and are certainly good films in their own right, but never really rise above their genre. Needless to say, the *true* horror classics hail from the black and white era of the 30s, 40s and 50s, but I'm specifically referring to the 70s/80s wave here. In my book, three of those rose above the level of cult classic, to become true film classics - The Thing, The Excorcist and Alien. And Alien is the one to rule them all.In many ways, Alien is the base on which every sci-fi horror film of the past forty years was built. Every film made in this genre, no matter how innovative in other areas, rips off Alien in *some* way at least. From the unique design, courtesy of the late H.R. Giger, to the bleak and pessimistic future set design - even more so than the grimy 'used future' and interstellar warfare of Star Wars, Alien is the true antithesis to the giddy optimism of Star Trek - and the greedy corporation trying to exploit the beast at the expense of the characters, and humanity at large. Watching it now, it may seem like you've seen all this before - but that's only because so many others learned it from Alien.Story-wise, Alien is not much to look at. Though innovative at the time, it is a very basic 'space-explorers-encounter-a-deadly-organism' tale that we've become familiar with by now. The brilliance lies in the execution - Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score, Ridley Scott's slow, atmospheric direction and the authenticity of the characters. Alien's characters aren't particularly developed, but engaging all the same. We get to know them not through deep backstories or dramatic character arcs, but their interactions - including several improvised scenes - which showcase them as relatable, working class everymen. These aren't the mystic heroes of Star Wars on a quest to save the galaxy, or the elite Starfleet captains commanding a ship exploring the vast reaches of space - these are your everyday working stiffs, sent out to the middle of nowhere on a gig. Space holds no enthralling mystery to them - it's their working environment, much like sailors out at sea. And when they encounter a dilapidated alien vessel on a barren planet, there is none of the exciting mystery of many space exploration tales - rather, there is a sense of impending doom. And we see their very human reactions when they encounter this fearsome extraterrestrial predator - fear, anger and desperation. This is not the childlike wonder of first contact, but the terror of being trapped in a tin can with an animal trying to eat you. As icing to the cake, there is no real 'hero' to the story. Ellen Ripley, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver - by now synonymous with the Alien franchise - does not emerge as a 'natural leader' among the group. In fact, she doesn't really lead at all - she becomes the story's sole survivor mainly through happenstance, because she is fortunate enough to not be in the wrong place when the Alien comes out, and spends enough time studying it to figure out a way to outsmart it. Later films elevated Ripley to a more mythical status as the woman who kept surviving the Alien incursions, taking away from her human vulnerability in this film.None of this would be as effective without the film's briljant creature design and special effects. Making the most of its modest budget (reportedly, Ridley Scott built the Space Jockey set without full permission from the studio) and using SFX both sparingly and effectively, Alien has managed to stand the test of time much better than its 1986 sequel Aliens. H.R. Giger's creepy, sexually charged design - inspired both by outlandish fetishes and deep phobias of rape - has not been matched in the decades after, though many have tried. This isn't a cheesy green space invader with a laser gun, but an *animal* - a fierce creature, trying to feed, survive and procreate. The humans it encounters are no mortal enemies or puny natives to be conquered, but either prey or merely in the way. In fact, it isn't really an evil monster - it's just doing what it does to survive. This, in fact, makes it a more effective antagonist rather than if it were just your average creepy space man. Later films respected this core foundation, but unfortunately moved away from the ilusive, deceptive nature of the Alien and turned into insectoid cannon fodder, dangerous mainly because of its large numbers. It's easy to forget that, at its core, Alien is supposed to be about suspense instead of action.No film, both within the series and outside it, has ever matched the briljant effectiveness of Alien. It is a film that was never meant to be A-list, but became so anyway because it was just executed so well. This is truly one for the ages, and a must-watch even if sci-fi and horror don't appeal to you.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

But the movie just isn't. It's an unoriginal slasher film that takes place on a spaceship.Unlike Mad Max: Fury Road – which also has a minimalist story – the action in Alien doesn't lead anywhere, it just sort of happens periodically.

Edgy and Slick: A Masterpiece of Sci-Fi Horror,"In terms of sci-fi horror, Ridley Scott's »Alien« is as good as it gets. As many people have pointed out, the story is basically B-movie stuff: a spooky monster haunts some hapless people, only this time they're in space. Scott stages the rather simple plot like an arthouse flick, beginning with the slick and lifeless introduction to the space ship Nostromo. The atmosphere is unbelievably tense throughout the movie: from the industrial Nostromo, the stormy planet V-426 to the phallic Alien designed by H. R. Giger.In many ways, »Alien« is the antithesis to Stanley Kubrick's »2001: A Space Odyssey«, the most megalomaniac movie ever conceived. Ridley Scott shows us that space travel won't be about philosophical self-discovery. It will be about dirty, senseless work. Of course, there are also some gender issues at stake here. Sigourney Weaever as Ellen Ripley might be most badass last girl in movie history - and maybe the first female action star that is not reduced to her womanhood.If »Alien« has one problem, it's the fact that it betrays its B-movie roots. There is a wannabe-deep scene near the end of the movie that feels affixed, as if Ridley Scott wanted to reconcile the intellectuals in the movie theater. That wasn't necessary at all. Still, if you're into stylish and evocative sci-fi, horror or sci-fi horror, you need to watch »Alien«. Man, what am I talking about?

Original and terrifying sci fi terror,"Alien is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. This kicked off a mostly excellent franchise and influenced cinema as whole. Designed with great detail by brilliant artist HR Geiger the Alien brings forth a new level of intergalactic terror. Alien is completely different from anything that came before and took sci fi horror to new heights and gave it a lot of depth. The ensemble cast is excellent and is lead by Sigorney Weaver and had Yaphett Kotto, Tom Skerrit and Harry Dean Stanton as strong support. In my opinion this film is flawless and still looks incredible today. The special effects are amazing and the acting and direction is spot on. Alien is incredible and in my opinion is timeless. The film aged well and is essential and a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A new level for Sci-fi Horror,"An alien distress call from an uncharted planet awaken the crew of the deep space towing vessel Nostromo. They go down to the planet to investigate only to bring back something dangerous.The story is a fairly simple creature feature in a spaceship. Ridley Scott took that simple story and gave it everything needed to make a new standard in sci-fi horror. Before it the sci-fi horror is the mainstay of B-movie schlock. After it the genre reach a new golden age. The same way that Star Wars pushed the envelope, the same can be said of Alien.The atmosphere is fantastic. Ridley Scott has packed in some iconic scenes. Who can forget the meal scene? It's going down in movie history. That are some movies that transcend a simple movie. This is one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Reasonably One of the Best Films Ever Made,"Alien is directed Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver in her breakout role as Ellen Ripley, a female astronaut that belongs to a crew that receives a distress call from an unexplored planet while in space. They respond to the call by landing on the planet, and searching it. They seemingly find nothing, but, upon leaving, find an unwanted visitor aboard their ship. Once they figure out that this ""alien"" is superior to humans in most every way, the film becomes a battle to either kill, or at most escape, the deadly creature.This film is widely considered one of the best horror movies of all time, and I can really see why. I can also see why some consider it one of the best films of all time. Alien is teeming with suspense, and keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat for almost the entire run time, say for some exposition in the beginning. Every time the audience gets even a subtle glimpse of the beast, each and every time there's a subtle jump, singularly due to the amazing practical effects of the alien itself.To start with some pros, the directing is utterly fantastic, to say the least. Ridley Scott does such a good job working the camera; it makes every emotion pop right out of the screen and suck the watcher right into the movie, drawing out the tone drastically. Some of the long takes can pull forth the tension throughout the scene, or the fear that a specific character feels at the present time.The acting is also amazing, starting with Sigourney Weaver. She gives one of the most breathtaking female performances in cinema history. Her character, Ellen Ripley, is a very strong and independent female; one in which no male is required to make her who she is, unlike most female leads today. If movies delivered more characters like Ripley, films would be better in almost every way.The hands down best thing about this film, however, is the simplicity of the plot. One can only imagine a person pitching the idea for this film, saying ""a crew of astronauts are stuck on a ship with an alien that kills them."" The straightforwardness of the plot is so astounding, it makes one do a double take upon the complexity of a horror, or even action, film in the modern day. This simplicity is present in many ""best films of all time,"" such as Die Hard (1988), or Jaws (1975). Overcomplicated plots are one of the many reasons why too many movie goers say ""they don't make'em like they used to.""Overall, Alien is understandably one of the best films of all time, thanks to the characters, directing, and clarity of the plot. I'm going to give Alien an A+, or a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Creepy, well made and haunting",Every second of this movie gives me the shivers. Even in the slow moving first half the atmosphere is so ominous and creepy and the acting so excellent that I'm never bored. The movie builds up the tension so masterfully you're on the edge of your seat all the time. I've heard some people say that the effects are dated to which I will answer: No not really. The monster is a man in a suit with some mechanics in the head and while there are a few shots where it's movements seem a little stiff we rarely see it and when we do it's only for a short duration and it actually in many ways looks more real than most CGI creatures of today. The artwork and design is one of the reasons this movie holds up so well to me. The ship looks appropriately old and battered up and the alien itself is pure genius. This movie just keeps thrilling me every time I watch it.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Sci-Fi/Horror Masterpiece!,"""Alien"" is one of the most intense Sci-Fi thrillers to have ever graced the silver screen or the home theater in any format! It is the film's intensity that provides such an incredible draw to this extraordinary film. I was pulled in by the ultra high sense of realism. This film almost feels like a documentary because of a lot of the subtle hand-held camera work (read; not like the shaky, seizure inducing hand-held work of today's films). There's much going on in that film that was revolutionary for the time. Great ideas, design, cinematography, subtle, very realistic performances.Sigourney Weaver stars as Ellen Ripley in her film debut role. Weaver is absolutely perfect for the role, and was practically the first girl-power type female heroine who single-handedly carries this international blockbuster right through until the final minutes. John Hurt also plays Kane to excellent effect, especially in his death scene as he frantically wriggles on the table with the alien inside him. Harry Dean Stanton is brilliant as Brett, as is Tom Skerritt as Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is also perfectly cast as Parker, who provides many on-screen laughs. Veronica Kartwright (who later went on to star in The X-Files some 20 years later) stars as the lovable Lambert, the only other female member of the crew along with Ripley. Ian Holm as Ash is absolutely brilliant in his role as the android secretly sent on board to bring back the alien life- form, while - in his eyes, and ""Mother's"" - all other crew members are expendable. The acting in this film is really first-rate, which is another big factor in why the film works so well.The art designs are incredible: the entire look of the film, from the commercial nature of the spacecraft to the iconographic alien itself is right on the money. It amazes me how well visually this movie still holds up. It feels as rich and deep cinematically as most anything today due to Ridley Scott's brilliant visuals. You watch this film at certain points and it feels as slick and polished as any current genre film without the hollowness or incompetence.All in all, Alien is a terrific sci-fi horror movie that plays with your senses incredibly well. Nothing happens for the first 30 minutes, and that is exactly the director's intent. By doing so, a feeling of extreme suspense is instantly formed, leaving you on the edge of your seat until the very end.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic!,"Believe it or not, I had never seen an Alien film. What prompted me to actually see it was the fantastic Prometheus trailer that debuted. Even if the film turns out to suck (which I really doubt) it would still have been worth it to watch the original Alien.What can I say? Fantastic. The music, the slow-paced nature of the first half, together with increasing tension as the film goes along is incredible. Once stuff hits the fan, it never lets you go. The film is also quite scary, an it made me jump various times. Why? It knows how to build tension incredibly, and the final 20 minutes are truly perfection. Both the sound and visual effects work to make the film a very effective experience, as does the wonderful cinematography. Bring on the Aliens, bitch!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A tense and atmospheric sci-fi horror,"""Alien,"" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1979, is a landmark in the sci-fi horror genre. The film stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, a crew member of the spaceship Nostromo. The crew responds to a distress signal from a desolate planet, only to discover a deadly alien life form that begins to hunt them down one by one.Scott's direction excels in creating an atmosphere of dread and suspense, utilizing the confined spaces of the spaceship to enhance the claustrophobic terror. The film's slow build-up masterfully increases tension, and H. R. Giger's design of the alien creature remains iconic and deeply unsettling.The cast delivers strong performances, with Weaver standing out as a resilient and resourceful protagonist. The practical effects and set design are impressive, contributing to the movie's immersive and foreboding environment.While ""Alien"" is a highly effective thriller, its deliberate pacing and minimalist dialogue might not appeal to viewers seeking more immediate action. Nonetheless, the film's influence on both science fiction and horror is undeniable, making it a must-watch for fans of either genre. ""Alien"" offers a chilling and suspenseful journey into the unknown, blending atmospheric horror with sci-fi elements to create a timeless classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Monumental 40th anniversary theater experience!,"Captivating development I can't believe I have only seen once before today many years ago!

Average spacecraft thriller.,"I never was a big fan of the Alien series. Always thought that they were way too dumb. However, i've never watched the very first one; the one which started everything, the original Alien. Until today. And to be honest, i am a bit disappointed. It's a very well made film, even more for the standards of 1979, but to the story itself...well, i just don't care for it at all. Sure, the film has great visuals, the spacecraft is full of interesting details, but the story is dry. The character development is not adequate at all, and this is an aspect which i consider fundamental in any film. We don't have any deep idea of who are the persons in there, or what they were doing, or what they are going to do. Then, the thriller? Almost none. And it's not scary. To the well of the truth, almost all the times the 'scariest' moments were very predictable and even unintentionally comic.But nice. It's a classic, right? Well, personally, i don't give a dawn. Because besides the fact that it is an extremely well made thriller with an Alien as the main villain , It has nothing more to add. Maybe it was very good back in the 70s and 80s, but not anymore. 7.3/ 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"In space, no one can hear you yawn","I read all the great reviews on this film and I wonder if everyone but me has lost their mind. At best, this film was average. It had some striking visuals and a few good scary scenes. The problem is, the movie takes way too long to get to those scenes. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is boring and empty (and often incoherent). A lot of the movie is poorly lit, between that and obscure shots of the alien and the blinking computer lights and meaningless images on computer screens and technical talk, there were parts where I didn't know or care what was going on. Very little of it was entertaining, the majority of the film just bored me. The most overrated horror movie ever.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"An iconic, legendary and unforgettable movie that revolutionized Sci-Fi and Horror forever","Alien is one of those movies that was ahead of it's time. It's eerie, ominous, atmospheric and chilling. Best of all, it's a movie that takes its time. It doesn't feel the need to have to rush into things - it creeps up on you creating a lasting tension, anxiety and fear. The sound design, sound effects and music play a vital part in the tone and feel of the movie - almost like a character in and of itself. There's these drone-like synth noises throughout the movie that create an uneasy feeling. The ship feels like it's lived-in and even seems like it's abandoned, almost haunted. The attention to detail in this movie is astounding and super intricate. There's so much that's told just in visuals alone. Ironic how Kane (John Hurt) is the first one to fully wake up. I never realized it before, but there's some good foreshadowing in this movie. The practical effects were brilliantly and cleverly done. You can tell with certain aspects that it's movie that was made in the late 70's early 80's, but I think this is what gives it its charm.It seems like the crew has known each other for quite some time and have been on other missions before. Clever storytelling and great character development. The characters have this rawness and grit to them. The acting is phenomenal. Everyone brings their A-game. Ian Holm gives a menacing and deceiving performance as Ash. Very impressive and unique concepts and designs from H. R. Giger and the team. The face hugger and Xenomorph are such terrifying and brilliant concepts. Timeless ideas that still to this day are sought after.An iconic, legendary and unforgettable movie that revolutionized the Sci-Fi Horror genre. It's also a movie that warns us about the dangers of technology and AI. There's so much to unpack from this movie and this is great since it warrants multiple viewings. The way Ridley Scott chose to shoot the movie makes for a personal, claustrophobic, deceiving and intense experience. I can also see where the creators of Dead Space might've gotten inspiration for the atmosphere, lighting and interiors of the ships in the game. Overall, it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies in the history of cinema, a masterpiece. If you haven't watched it, I don't know what the hell you've been doing. But you should definitely watch it. This is one of the essentials, a must-watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Disengaged,"Alien is undeniably a landmark film in sci-fi, though my experience with it was mixed. This film is heavily influenced by 2001. A Space Odyssey, i.e., (1) the production design that actually stands out, with its strong aesthetic and attention to detail; (2) the soundtrack, with its violin orchestration, adds to the tension but carries a darker, more mysterious vibe; (3) the VFX - it is impressive for its time. While I appreciate the homage, I found myself enjoying Space Odyssey more.The slow pacing didn't fully capture my attention, leaving me disengaged and less intrigued. The writing left me with mixed feelings, leaving me confused as to who is the protagonist of the film, yet it has a meaning in themes such as teamwork and survival.Overall, it's clear that Alien was groundbreaking for its time, but for me, it didn't quite live up to the hype, especially after watching Alien Romulus, which you would think is incomparable. While I recognize Alien as a classic and understand its significance in the sci-fi genre, it didn't resonate with me as much as I had hoped. It's a good introduction to the Alien franchise, but from today's perspective, it feels overrated and somewhat outdated. Despite this, it remains a product of its time, and for that, it deserves recognition. However, my personal enjoyment was limited.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Rat In The Attic,"A rat in the attic is a good metaphor for this unimaginative ""sci-fi"" flick from director Ridley Scott. The human crew aboard a Hollywood-conceived spacecraft diddle and dawdle. They chitchat about this and that; they eat; they smoke; they look at outdated computer screens; they emit petty frustrations. Finally, after interminable plot filler, and after our space voyagers have displayed requisite incompetence (what would film stories be without incompetence?), ET shows up on-board, less cosmic than sleazy, like something the cat drug in from a b-grade horror flick. Now, our beleaguered ... and incompetent ... crew promptly sets forth to deal with the menace.But our spacecraft-trapped rat has vanished into the woodwork, probably to escape the crew's incompetence and/or all the hammy acting. Where did ET go? Behind the stove? Under the frig? Inside the computer? Nope, he's in the attic. Quick, fumigate. Oops, too late. The house is condemned.I'm constantly amazed how easily sci-fi fans can be satisfied by conventional, stodgy stories, and cheesy, overbearing special effects.

Flawless cinematography and the standard in Horror.,"""Alien"" is one of the few shining pinnacles of not only perfect but industry defining cinema. Regarded as one of the top three greatest horror movies of all time, it's a definite contender for first place. ""Alien"" is exceptional for many reasons, but some notable aspects include an incredible visual landscape that truly gives a sense of atmosphere to the plot; a patient and careful pace thru which attention to detail and a true love of the characters evolves, and, most importantly, a flawless script in which every word is carefully chosen. Plot and subplots are developed and each member of the cast is fleshed out. ""Alien"" sets many standards; not only in moviemaking as a whole, but also in the Horror genre. This film surprises, deceives, concerns and overwhelms.It's hard to find issue with any aspect of ""Alien"" but one shortcoming is the lack of a proper soundtrack. The monster effects are somewhat dated, but can still stand their ground. When a director truly loves his craft, and his producers are smart enough not to interfere, he will attend to every single aspect of a production. When I say that ""Alien"" is a perfect movie, I truly mean it: perfection in cinema is defined by an experience of effortless acting, correct dialogue, flawless cinematography and next to no errors in plot and film. Many examples of this perfection exist, and its sad to see the industry half-bake most of its creations. As an example, the sequel to this movie is an immediate and very apparent drop in quality, but is still miles ahead of anything being filmed today. ""Alien"" is a movie worthy of purchase and repeated viewing, and an example of the wonderful art mankind can achieve.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A perfect film,"What can be written or said about a masterpiece that hasn´t been written or said before? Not much, I suppose, but I just have to get it out of my system. ""ALIEN"" is a masterpiece in the art of movie making - period! It is as classic as it is legendary. Those who think otherwise, I´m sorry but you are a lost cause. I cannot praise this film enough. You could say that I am obsessed with it - it is that great.This is what you can achieve when you have top notch talent in every department: Writing, directing, editing, scenery, art department, special effects, music, acting, et cetera. As opposed of today, when totalitarian and political correctness handcuffs creativity. It´s not a coincidence that I personally detest most films coming out The System (i.e. Hollywood) today.First of all we must go down on our knees and thank God for Dan O'Bannon, Ridley Scott and H. R. Giger, for being the three principal people responsible for bringing ""ALIEN"" to life. Especially O'Bannon, whom without there would be no movie in the first place. It´s a pity that he (outside the hardcore fan-base) hasn´t been given more attention than he has. Just think about; if ""Dark Star"" had been a (moderate) success, maybe ""ALIEN"" would never had seen the light of day?Ridley Scott, what can I say? The man is (was?) the best visual director in the business, bar none. Only Kubrick could compete with him in that department. It may be O'Bannon's idea, but Ridley Scott brought that idea to life. Every single shot and every single frame is a work of beauty and art. The composition of every scene is so beautiful and shines with a touch of class that - with a few exceptions - is rarely often seen today. True genius, Ridley Scott.Last but not least, the utmost praise most go to Hans Rudi Giger. He brought something horrifying and yet beautiful to the screen that audiences hadn't seen before and perhaps hasn't seen since. LV-426 and its surroundings is all thanks to Giger (minus the chestburster and - in part - the facehugger). A masterstroke by Scott and O'Bannon insisting on getting Giger onboard. His biomechanical art is out of this world!Kudos to each and everyone. All of the actors who are perfectly cast; the art department; sound editing; special effects (that are astounding); Brandywine (for agreeing to produce it) and to Alan Ladd jr. Who green lighted it (at the time being the head of 20th Century Fox). Jerry Goldsmith put the icing on the cake with his eerie, evocative, haunting and yet beautiful score. Even though Scott and sound editor Terry Rawlings played copy and paste with the score and cues, plus incorporating the music from ""Freud"" in places.This is a great film. A cinematic achievement that I can watch over and over again. If nothing else for the framing of the picture and the visuals. I love this film.

A bit overrated?. (my 100th review),"I bought this DVD, thinking it's a certified classic and that I'm bound to enjoy it immensely...seeing that I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies. After watching it, I thought I missed something. Was this really it?After realizing my less-than-enthusiastic thoughts on what I had just seen, I immediately rationalized that I did just watch the movie 25 years later, and that there's probably no way I can get the effect that audiences had when it first released. So much has happened in movies nowadays, that I've basically seen it all. I appreciate what Ridley Scott tried to do here, by letting us wait, and wait, and wait, and wait some more. It's Hitchcockian, and I'm a big fan of his. 'Alien' is more suspense than anything, it seemed that after the suspense is gone, and everything that was supposed to happen happened, and the alien was finally revealed in all its glory, there isn't much left to hold on to. For some reason, 'Alien' comes off as incomplete and, surprisingly, unintentionally funny at some points. I just couldn't get past the fact that the events in the film could've been avoided if it wasn't for the utter stupidity of the crew members. 'Alien' wasn't scary by any means. The alien itself is marvelous; I was always intrigued by the creature, just the look of it! Only a crazy mind could've come up with something looking like that.I've read some reviews here on IMDb stating that the sequel 'Aliens' is superior to the original, I'll have to see that to decide for myself. Also, I only watched the Theatrical version on my DVD, maybe I'll be able to appreciate the Director's Cut more?although I read in the DVD pamphlet that the Theatrical version is Ridley Scott's favorite. Therefore, I'm giving 'Alien' a pass of sorts, seeing that it's a landmark in a genre that's been squeezed dry for so long now. Maybe with future viewings I can come to enjoy it even more, but my initial reaction is that 'Alien' wasn't what I expected. I can still appreciate it for the pioneer that it is, but it seems a bit overrated.** ½ out of **** stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

There is a saying that says that fear is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really well.Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far. Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago so we can't expect too much, but look at Star Wars which came out around the same time.

One of the best science fiction movies of all time,"There are relatively few films in history that are so solid and well made that they are the definition of a 4/4 star movie. Alien is one of those films.

It is one of the coolest, most bad-ass, and horrifying films you will ever see.Sigourney Weaver is phenomenal in the role that shot her to fame. She is the heart of the film and plays her part with a sort of innocence and naive youthfulness that is endearing and real. Who would have ever thought a woman could be so bad-ass in a science fiction/action/horror movie in 1979?This movie is so good shot for shot that you will be glued to the screen. You can't miss a minute, nor will you want to. Even after all the similar sorts of horror and sci fi films that have been made which have borrowed from Alien, none of them can put together what Alien did.Some movies just rock. They just know how to open,know how to show, know how to tell, know how to explode, and know how to end. This is one of them. The ending is perfect and a perfect example of how to tell a story and end a movie, something many films of today can learn from.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The machinery of chaos (Montezuma's Revenge),"This one really needs no introduction, this pitch black vision of an unfathomable darkness. If I was asked to run a film class, this would be a prime example to study: collaboration, reinvention, conceptual design that accommodates damage to it, the journey of shared vision from page to space. It does everything right that could easily have gone wrong. The backbone is an extremely coherent space world and mythology, as complicated as we find in Star Wars but with only necessary snippets provided instead of platitudes. On top of that, you have (expertly executed) the age old story of an encounter with ancient evil. But this one has biology, structure that horrifies more. The icing on the cake is a final layer about the nature of the encounter, your encounter with 'alien' vision. Hold this thought.It is amazing to revisit this in retrospect of how much it changed and how much has changed since.In the 1970's, one of the hottest and most troubled film properties for a while was Dune. The scope and detail of Herbert's books called for a a film on a massive scale, a blockbuster, and that was a time when the blockbuster was still a fluid concept. It was a time when you could dream the unthinkable: a 10-hour Jodorowsky extravaganza with the creative involvement of Dali, Welles, Gloria Swanson, Delon, Jagger, designed by H.R. Giger and scored by Pink Floyd. Extensive pre-production work was axed when money decided the venture was impractical, and basically nuts. The world safely went with the Spielberg-Lucas model, nurtured from Jaws to Star Wars. The prevalent business model for a Hollywood blockbuster these days, is a bankable producer-director in charge (he can be a little creative), and contract out the design and effects-work to individual SFX studios. We're getting poorer every year and the products more bland, because of this IKEA mentality.Anyway, the smoke from the colossal Dune collapse turbulently shifted in two directions. We got the two Phillip K. Dick adaptations in the 80's, one of them Scott's Bladerunner. The other is right here. Inbetween, Scott had been next in line after Jodorowsky to tackle and swiftly abandon Dune.What happened, is that a guy called Dan O'Bannon (effects-man in that first Dune) drifted to screen writing to pull himself up from a financial hole. Out of many stories he penned, one was about an alien passenger wreaking havoc mid-space. In its first incarnation, it was going to be a Corman foamcore cheapie called Starbeast. Hollywood tapped the project, considering workingman Aldrich to direct. Daft choice, thankfully axed. This one needed new, excited blood like O'Bannon.Ridley Scott came onboard, fresh and eager from a Kubrick-influenced debut. Kubrick's 2001-notions of cinematic space as a clean and silent roar, elegant design, and controlled visual eddies from symphonic flows of the camera, all of that was carried over into this, and is openly acknowledged in the first shot. O'Bannon(a horror guy) introduced Scott to Texas Chainsaw Massacre and more pieces from the Dune jigsaw: Foss and Moebius were carried over to sketch the world of the film. H.R. Giger was flown in from Switzerland, with alien-designs so disturbing he was held over at LAX.And that is how it came together. The story was recycled from spare parts (Forbidden Planet, Planet of the Vampires), dressed in 'used' scrapyard aesthetic and Giger's diseased-looking biology, and finally given Texas Chainsaw- violence in the engine gears and fabric. And the nature of that collaborative encounter with the product of vision is sketched in the actual film, in the way it made a difference.You have a colorful bunch of professionals in the same 'ship', each one a specialist in his field. Each one has his own logic about what the voyage is all about, but not necessarily equal say. They are earthbound before a beacon signals from the void.It isn't until later that we find out a narrative of discovery had been set in motion around them, and that narrative is controlled by non-human agents, actual devices (Mother - Ash), which is why it's both simple and precise. The actual author won't be seen until Prometheus, one of many things mucked-up there.The discovery is of something that we go on to understand has structure and design, and the instinct to do as designed challenges human conscience. And this is why Scott's presentation matters: it is not a guy in a suit we see, it is abstract shape, pure organism morphing before our eyes.The second expansion is that it is not the story of explanations that matters, but the journey to retrieve new vision. This has been obscured, because that vision is a monster, and because on both ends of that story (Weyland - Engineerworld), you have only vague bits of clearly engineered worlds that we want to know more about (hence, the heavy Alien fanfiction that distracts by too much clarification).It's all here though. The story was something to get you to where the void signals.The real deal is in how we come to terms with something that is new and seemingly dragged strange and whole from the void.And it takes a dissonant - human - element to muck up the precise Weyland gears of the narrative, and actually give birth to the thing. A machine would never be curious enough to touch the egg.This is brilliant. It's all in the coordinated bursts of machine-reason to human-chaos to inscrutable creature-reason and back again, and the way that is choreographed into an environment that bleeds and bursts into our vision (best seen in the discovery of the alien ship).Our vision itself is the alien being born, space impregnated and convulsing with the process.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Don't let nostalgia fool you, it's good for an Alien introduction, but a poor movie in its execution.","The art production is amazing and the camera work, plus the great soundtrack, succeds in building tension and suspense.But, Alien (1) lacks in character development and, mostly, in fluidity and attention to detail in its storytelling. The edition in the first half makes it look like an old vhs that keeps jumping forward leaving behind unseen parts that are important to understand the development of the story (plus the merging of practical effects on scenes looks like a low budget school project; even for a 1979 movie).Eitherway, you have to see it to introduce yourself to a great villain like Alien, but it is enough watching it once. The sequels are another (and better) story.PD. The best actor was the cat. What an amazing expression when the grown alien appears for the first time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Horror or science fiction?,"I wasn't real impressed with this movie because it seemed like any other horror movie, but in a science fiction setting.In fact, I believe that was the secret to the movie's success. Take your typical horror movie plot - a monster is stalking a group of people, killing them one by one - and set it in the future, in space, and you've got Alien. It probably attracted a lot of science fiction fans to horror and horror fans to science fiction.From a more esoteric standpoint, I was disappointed that the settings were so dark. Maybe it worked on the big screen, but it failed in my living room.Credit-wise I'm curious to know why Tom Skeritt had top billing over Sigourney Weaver. The latter's character is obviously our hero and has all the best lines, while the former's character is killed halfway through the movie.It would be like giving Jack Palance top billing in City Slickers, although he contributed much more to that movie than Skeritt contributed to Alien.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An Overblown Rip-Off,"If you're after a flashy shock 'n' schlock movie, then look no further than Ridley Scott's ALIEN. Directly recycling the formulas of the space-shocker B movies from the '50s, notably THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD and IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, this 1979 blockbuster attempted to mingle together science-fiction and horror, two of the most popular genres of its time, in a more sophisticated manner than those primitive '50s pictures. It also tried to emulate the style and success of STAR WARS and JAWS, which were the two biggest money-makers in the box office at the time. The result is a vastly overrated, unimaginative flick with a heap of overbearing effects. Besides the production design, the filmmakers have done very little to differentiate it from those old-time creature features; the movie is just a trendier rip-off.Its stodgy story follows a group of seven astronauts who must deal with an extraterrestrial after it manages to gain access to their spaceship. With this slimy menace running around the dark corridors playing a sinister game of hide-and-seek, the astronauts are killed by it one by one.Being the proficient designers they are, director Scott and his special effects team pull off all the ostentatious visual tricks they want to create this ghastly environment. They've added lots of spooky sounds too, like metallic clanging noises, the pounding of human hearts, robotic beeps and chirps, the wailing of sirens, and the shrieking and retching of the dying astronauts. Even the cheesy-looking killer alien has been carefully crafted. But it's a shame to find that this seems to be all that the crew is capable of. ALIEN is the jack-in-the-box type of scare movie, where, in order to get a fright, something has to unexpectedly happen or pop out. This lazy tactic has become favoured by movie audiences, and it's easy to see why; jumpscares are effective and simple to do. ALIEN typically makes the audience anticipate the scare through pretentious shots of nothingness, camera movements and the soundtrack's increase/decrease in volume. Because of the film's audio-visual craftiness, it happened to largely influence horror and sci-fi movies, including this year's UNDERWATER.The petty characters have meaningless chit-chats; they laugh, they shout and curse, they mumble technobabble. The suspense lies in their eventual deaths, but they're so shallow that empathy amounts to a simple shrug of the shoulders. Some have considered the film as one of the greatest of all time. What a stretch! I heard that director Scott got his training in advertising. It really shows - ALIEN is little more than a special effects showcase.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
My favorite movie of all time.,"I don't even know where to begin in reviewing this incredible film. I can't do it justice.

Even now, at 40 years old, the xenomorph both terrifies me and creates within me a sense of wonder behind its mysterious origin and nefarious capabilities.Truly the perfect organism.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Original and best,"I first saw ""Alien"" the day after it opened, knowing very little about it except that the cryptic TV commercial for the film looked cool and its advertising slogan (""In space, no one can hear you scream"") was compelling. Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott were mostly unknown and the rest of cast, while recognizable, weren't typically headliners in highly anticipated Hollywood releases. This had ""B-movie"" written all over it, and in many ways it is very much a B-movie made with A-list skill, craftsmanship and imagination.It's impossible, all these years and several viewings later, to separate myself from my first experience of watching it. I can't forget that I nearly jumped back a row, to the accompanying screams of a nearly full theatre of moviegoers, during the now-famous chest- bursting scene. The iconic imagery of the film -- the sensuous design of the alien ship, the ominously large corpse of the alien spaceman fused to his giant perch with bones bent outward, the unknowable originality of the titular creature and its unpredictable life cycle, the lived-in character of the commercial towing vessel Nostromo (""Star Wars"" excepted, in most depictions of space travel at the time everything had a factory-fresh gleam) -- all became almost instantly iconic and influential for a reason. Having experienced this film's introduction into an unsuspecting world, it's not possible to look at it through the eyes of contemporary film fans who come to it later and might judge it by a different standard.All of which it to say, I admit to being incredibly biased in my assessment of how well ""Alien"" holds up despite the considerable advances in visual effects since it was made. What looks a bit dated today is the depiction of the on-board computer ""Mother"" and the bizarre blinky-light room in which it is housed. Most of the rest of the tech depictions are fine, mainly because the story doesn't rely on whiz-bang futuristic tech to propel it. The basic (and, alas, inadequate) weaponry with which Nostromo's crew tries to contain the alien was understandable then and now, on a non-military vessel with a civilian crew. The surprise reveal about the true nature of one of the crew members still makes sense against the backdrop of corporate shenanigans in which the crew operates. Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett's story carefully constructs the sense in which the deck is stacked against our heroes in ways they don't fully grasp until a few of them have died, and it does so mainly by making the crew anything but heroic. These are ordinary workers who snipe at each other and complain about their pay and try to advance their place in the hierarchy the way workers everywhere do, and maintain an uneasy camaraderie and mutual respect despite workplace tensions that are eminently relatable.A lot has been written about this film as a metaphor for both male and female rape and the predatory nature of sexuality. While the film's design is stuffed with incredible sexual imagery, I'm not really sure what that analysis gets you. ""Alien"" is essentially a very effective, beautifully shot horror movie set in outer space. It employed and helped solidify horror movie tropes we're all familiar with. It's not afraid to take its time to build atmosphere, character and suspense, which might (but shouldn't) try the patience of people used to the faster pace of current films. To me, it was and remains an almost perfect movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Best Films Ever Made,"An absolute masterpiece of a film. This is how you make a horror film. The plot is fairly straight forward but its the cast and characters that make this movie. Superb acting from the likes of Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt make you really invested in the characters. What i liked about Alien is that you do not really know who is supposed to be the main character until about halfway through the movie which makes it feel much more realistic and believable. There is also some unexpected twists in the plot which are really shocking.The Alien design in this movie is the most awesome thing ever. Its so unique and terrifying. It is in my opinion the most interesting 'antagonist' so to speak created in a horror film to date. So must more interesting than a man in a mask just stabbing people. The practical effects are astonishing and its mind blowing how realistic they made this look in 1979. It still holds up perfectly today. This is one of the most well directed films i have ever seen. Every shot is perfect and carries meaning. The setting and locations are absolutely beautiful and the pacing is perfect. If you're an aspiring filmmaker and you want to learn them this is a must see.Alien absolutely masters the art of suspense and creating an unnerving atmosphere. Everything in this movie from the alien and Alien ship design by HR Geiger, the beautiful sets and cinematography and the incredible sound track by Jerry Goldsmith creates an atmosphere like no other film. The audio is also very well balanced. The film knows when to use music and when to be silent, it just uses them at the perfect times and it all helps to make one of the most suspenseful movies i've ever seen.This movie is one of the most perfect and beautiful films ever made, is my 3rd favourite movie of all time and in my opinion the pinnacle of Sci Fi and Horror. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Nigh Perfect Sci-Fi Horror Flick,"The settings in this film are exhilarating and claustrophobic, the characters are funny and likeable and we want them to survive, the creature is horrifying and vile, and the storyline is tense and exciting.

It is one of many films that is very famous for being original where many other films have taken the premise and tone and improved upon it. I remember watching a parody on ""American Dad"" and thinking if only Ridley Scott had actually made this film so compelling.A couple of amazing, instantly iconic moments notwithstanding (and with a wonderful sense of design with its lonely, junkyardish ship and a super Alien), I would not say this has stood the test of time and is really more for viewing for historical interest.Overall my favourite part was Sigourney Weaver's anal cleavage.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A near perfect organism,"Alien is the quintessential sci-fi horror that's rife with mystery and all the better for not answering some of the major questions as to how this stuff works whilst still delivering a lot of exposition that only makes the titular creature all the more terrifying. It's suitably scary, allegorical and assembled with tremendous technical craft from the slow reveal of its title set in the silent vacuum of space where no one can hear you scream.Even though it's obvious now, it's still really satisfying to see Sigourney Weaver becoming the protagonist over the course of the film. Early on other characters are positioned in front of her, she's given minimal dialogue and comes across as a little cold since she prioritises company policy. However, once she's front and centre she is amazing with a palpable sense of fear balanced by her ability to remain calm as much as possible.The rest of the cast are terrific as well since they're thoroughly convincing as a team who get along well and have their own little groups. All of that makes Ian Holm stand out even more. He feels off even when he's trying to be jovial and is just so unsettling when he's at his coldest which makes the big twist around his character more coherent with subsequent viewings since his performance hides it in plain sight.Ridley Scott's direction is so effective because of how patient it is in that first half. It takes 5 minutes to meet the characters and nearly half of the film for the Xenomorph to actually appear but it's never boring thanks to gorgeous set design which makes every aspect of this grungy, lived-in world so fascinating to experience. The scares are all timers too that hone in on misdirection to always catch you off guard.The design of the Xenomorph is phenomenal, especially since there's nothing that comes close to its extremely distinct look. With H. R. Giger involved, it's undoubtedly very phallic in nature which enhances how intense the Xenomorph is in every way. Jerry Goldsmith's score is beautifully barren, only requiring a handful of notes to make everything feel incredibly eerie from those opening moments in space.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

It's bewildering how someone could think of such story in 1979 where the whole alien-conspiracy was not a hit. and what's more amazing is how clear they plot is. No filler and needless details. The movie certainly gives a very tense feel even until the very end.
If i didn't know what time the movie was made, i would've guessed it was made in the 2000s. Definitely a must watch because it lives up to everyone's expectation.

The direction on a macroscale is good as he builds the overarching conflict well and uses tension to bring out the horror in the alien and the fear of dying; the direction on a microscale is pretty good as each performance has a part in how they reach to what is going on; the storytelling is good as it progresses through a pretty simple story, and uses tension to heighten the stakes as the conflict unravelsStory: Pretty Good
The concept is pretty simple yet effective as the movie boils down to a hide-and-seek with the alien, and the movie does a good job at incorporating a twist to heighten the stakes; the plot structure is pretty simple, but the exposition feels very long; the character writing is pretty good as it fills all the archetypes of a ""crew"" movie, but also does a good job at providing some depth for Ripley as she tries to do the right thing and navigate through her fearScreenplay: Pretty Good

A review from 2024 taking both past and present in consideration,"As crazy as it may seem, i never saw the original Alien or even its sequel, altough i did came across Alien 3, Alien Resurection (wich was the new movie when i was a teen and on age to watch this and my first in the franchise), and a few spin-offs later like Alien Vs Predator 1 & 2. So only Aliens left for another day.I decided for this review i would review it 50/50 on both its ""classic"" aspect as well as how it hold up in 2024. The first thing that comes to mind is the creature are no secret anymore. We seen them countless times and we know what they are, so the mystery aspect and how it can impact the movie is something harder to judge. I do think its many forms and ""evolution"" is well done.My biggest issue tough, and its no secret if you read any of my other reviews, is the pacing. The movie is very slow. The first hour is basically a set up and a lot of it could had been cut out without impacting the movie, even the suspense and atmosphere. That said, if we go in the 1979 shoes and what they could do with special effect and how these could be considering very advance for the time, i guess for a first viewing it was something phenomenal.I have to take into consideration that Star Wars was released 2 years early tough, and spaceships and stuff like that was already done, so the miniatures and cool effects were not the first. That said, Alien do bring a more ""realistic"" aproach on the concept, obviously with a 1979 vision (old computers, screens etc).Ultimately i do have to admit the movie did bored me at times a bit during the first hour, maybe because i already knew what was this creature, so its really hard to judge it for that specific part.But i do think tough that in the second hour, the horror element and pacing was a lot better. Some peoples could complain the movie is ""too dark"" and you can't see much of the creature and the violence, but i personally knew about this and had no problem with it.Overall i think the movie aged perfectly fine when it comes to special effects, overall story, characters, atmosphere, but do can feel a tad long during its first hour.I am happy i can finally say that i saw it, and i do feel if a teenager would start by this one instead of the more modern ones, once he pass the look of the computers and tech wich is obviously ultra retro, he could have a very good movie with genuine scares and suspense and kinda forget its that old.Im gonna go for a 7 out of 10 for a 2024 viewing with MY personal experience. It was enjoyable, but there was not much surprise for me sadly. But i did felt on the edge of my seat a few times during the more suspenseful scenes, so the movie wins at what it aimed to achieve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The worst in the series but still an ok movie.,"This was a good movie. The only thing wrong with it is nothing happens. It takes too long to get where it's trying to go but when it gets there, it's a fun ride. It's a well made movie. The f/x a good for it's time. The make-up f/x were really cool looking. The actors did their parts very well. The script was very good too. The only problem is the plot. It needed a lot more action. I really liked the movies that followed. Aliens IS the best sci/fi around. Alien3 was a good movie that no one really liked. Alien: Resurrection was a really good movie. I loved that one. The whole series is great but this isn't the best. I think the reason it's so highly rated is because it really stands above the normal slimey-alien-from-outer-space movies. For that, I give it credit. For the plot, well, that's another story.

Parasitic Relationship...,"Upon its release, it was obvious that Director Ridley Scott's ALIEN was something special, unlike any science fiction-horror film before it.Drawing loosely from past deep space adventures, Scott took us into a desolate, haunted place full of dread and terror. Primarily a ""monster movie"", ALIEN presents us with a creature from our darkest nightmares. H. R. Geiger's design is still fresh and startling to this day. It's sleek, reptilian body, topped by that elongated, eyeless head, is an incredibly effective creation.The human crew of the Nostromo are mostly nourishment for this hellish thing.The classic scenes abound, from the discovery of the egg chamber, to the ""bloody birth"", to the discovery that one crewmember just may be hiding a secret, etc.That's where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) comes in. She's resourceful, smart, and called on to be far stronger than she might, at first, appear. Ms. Weaver made this role singular. We will always remember the final confrontation. Ripley shattered stereotypes, setting the standard for a generation of tough female heroes.Imagine sitting in a dark theater, having never seen anything remotely like this before. Having no frame of reference for what was playing out on the screen. It was all fresh, new, and astonishing.Still is...",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Borderline Boring,"Alien is not a bad movie. In fact, it's a pretty good one. More of a thriller than the sci-fi/horror ones that its sequels were. But therein lies my only problem watching the Director's Cut when it was re-released in the theater. I was reminded what a slow, borderline boring movie it is for the vast majority of its running time. Still, it was the only one I hadn't seen on a big screen, so it was cool to see it. I'll still take Cameron's Aliens over this any day. For that matter, I'm one of the few who actually liked Fincher's Alien3.

The Sci-fi bar was raised and set very hi,"I saw this movie in theaters when it was released in 1979 at least four times. I was just turning 18 that year so yes I went on my own accord. Eventually, when VCRs, DVDs, Blu-Rays came out I owned it ineasch version, and it was worth it. Ridley Scott raised and set the bar very hi for any subsequent Sci-fi movies to come out after it. Any other Sci-fi flick I saw after this one was, 'How didi it compare toAlien?"". This Is one of those movies that no matter how many times you see it, viewing it remains worthy while. Sigorney Weaver set the bar for female leads too. After her performance, female leads as badasses became not so uncommon. I loved the movie so much I even looked up how the creature was designed and learned the H. R. Giger was the primary influence on what the creature looks like. Several more Ridley Scott films fell into my favorite list too. This film is so good that I can count on one hand how many I have given a '10' rating to. I personally think that 'Aliens' is just good, but takes a different approach to compete storyline.

Mother???,"Deep in space, the commercial vessel the Nostromo receives an emergency distress signal from an unexplored planet. After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one.Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An All-Time Classic,"""Alien"" is the one of the first films that I think of when I think of the word ""atmosphere."" Ridley Scott brilliantly crafts a setting in this sci-fi horror classic that is still explored with prequels and sequels. It's not just the setting though; it's the way that the plot slowly builds up and there are many moments of downtime to get a little familiar with characters. This film, along with other late 70s classics such as ""Halloween"", really set up the blueprint that most modern horror films replicate.This movie is a marvel on a photographic level, with much of the shot composition and lighting and set design really making for a dark and claustrophobic experience. The idea of a huge 7 foot tall monster with acidic blood and a retractable mouth-within-a-mouth that hunts the crew members off one by one is a horrifying thought.Much props has to be given to Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This was a breakout role for her, and it's a role that she further explores and brings even more perfection to in the sequel. Most of the other characters aren't really worth mentioning other than Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) who I found extremely obnoxious and annoying (I can tell that this was probably Ridley Scott's intent with the character though). I also really liked Yaphet Lotto's character, Parker. No nonsense.This is a must watch. Many classic horror movie tropes were spawned from this one. And with decades past it's still extremely elusive to track down, much like its eponymous alien.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the GREATEST movies of all time!,"I remember when I first saw Alien as a teenager. This movie scared me to the core and it's STILL scary and very suspenseful to this very day! I love movies from all genres and horror is one of my favorite genres in cinema history and when it comes to horror movies, Alien is DEFINITELY one of the greatest ones of all time! Ridley Scott's direction in Alien has a HIGHLY suspenseful feel throughout the entire film and it somewhat makes you feel disturbed and uncomfortable and that's one of the reasons why this film is so iconic! Sigourney Weaver as Ripley takes this ENTIRE film from opening to finish! She was EXCELLENT in this film and this is definitely one of the greatest roles I've seen in ANY movie which makes this one of the greatest roles in cinema history! All of the other characters such as Brett, Parker, Kane, Dallas, Ash and Lambert played by Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, and Veronica Cartwright were really interesting and engaging characters throughout the entire run time of the film and the acting in Alien is ABSOLUTELY mind-blowing which was another reason on why this movie is insanely scary! Now let's talk about the creature in Alien known as The Xenomorph, this thing is just.................ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING AND AWESOME! The Xenomorph has to be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in ANY movie in my entire life! Ridley Scott also decided to not show this creature for the majority of the film which was a little more terrifying, because you never really expect or know when this thing is going to come or what it's going to do to the crew or what the creature looks like when you first watch Alien and it is just GENIUS AND FANTASTIC SUSPENSE FILM-MAKING! Something else that I also love about Alien is of course the iconic chest burst scene! Most of you who have seen Alien know what I'm talking about, but when they were shooting the chest burst scene, the actors were 100% unaware of what was going to come out of John Hurt's chest so when the Xenomorph burst out of his chest, their reactions were legit and real and that's just so awesome! This movie also holds one of the GREATEST jumpscares in cinema history when Dallas is in the air shafts and out of NOWHERE he runs into the Xenomorph and you don't actually see him die by it, but you see it appear and you just hear this EXTREMELY LOUD screeching sound and static sounds in the background and every time I watch this movie, that jumpscare STILL sends chills down my spine and it's a jumpscare done right! There's also something else I absolutely love about Alien when the crew finds out that Ash was a robot that was sent by the company to send this life form back to earth and it is a VERY clever twist that was HIGHLY unexpected and it's all done by the genius mind of Scott and the tension he brings in this film! Alien is one of my all time favorite movies and it has stood the test of time VERY SUCCESSFULLY and it has inspired many film-makers and it will continue to do that, because it's a timeless masterpiece and a classic film and Alien DEFINITELY gets a 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Great sci-fi horror,"Alien is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and it also happens to be a horror, making it all the more tense and exciting to watch. Its strength is its patience combined with top-notch visuals and music and an original plot.The look of the movie is incredible from start to finish. The Nostromo spaceship, the interiors, the Alien itself. Much of it was designed by H.R. Giger, a German with a unique and fascinating style. He also worked on Jodorowsky's Dune (which never got made) and you can see similarities in the design. They seem to combine the organic with the artificial and often border on the sexual. The inside of an alien spaceship is full of imaginative and strange details like nothing you've seen before. It's a shame Prometheus was such a terrible attempt at expanding on the story behind it...The score by the prolific Jerry Goldsmith is one of his best. There are faint echoes of more innocent sounding woodwinds with swelling, ominous strings in the background. It's mysterious but captures mankind's natural sense of wonder - it's not completely evil. As one character says at one point, they practically admire the alien, despite its capacity for destruction. We can't help but feel similarly. There's a juxtaposition of beauty and death. In Interstellar as well, the characters go on journeys at the edge of what's possible, seeing incredible things but also facing the serious risk of death. Our universe (and the beings in it) can be a harsh but beautiful mistress.Like all the great horror movies, the monster or threat is only gradually revealed. We're in the dark along with the characters. The details surrounding the alien, how it reproduces, what defence mechanisms it has, what on Earth it even is are very cool. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a strong female character who is forced into a survival situation. She's one of the few to use common sense throughout the whole movie. She's cautious where others aren't. She know why certain rules are in place and gets frustrated that others would prefer to take risks. As it turns out, she was right the whole time.There are slow shots moving down corridors, letting us take in the designs of the walls, sometimes with emergency rotating lights and gas clouding things a bit. The movie takes its time setting things up and creating a mood. When things do happen, they have more impact because of the calm moments in between. But I enjoy the quiet moments just as much. There's always plenty to take in and ponder.There are many twists and turns in the plot. This keeps things tense - we don't know what might come out of nowhere, who can be trusted, where are you safe. There are some frustrating horror cliché moments where it seems like problems could have been prevented if the people were less stupid at key moments. But we also get to experience some imaginative situations which aren't yet possible with current technology but might well become realities in the near future.I have to admit, I don't find the alien itself scary. But I like its presence and the overall mood of the movie - it's a very well made horror. It's more about suspense than jump scares. It builds up the anticipation and a sense of inescapability. The tone is a bit depressing in some ways. These humans are in the middle of nowhere. But we do get the impression they're heading back to Earth and usually spend their journeys in some kind of cryo-sleep. This movie's an exception to their routine. But a film like Jaws is much easier to relate to while still putting the humans in a setting (the sea) where they're out of their comfort zone.Aliens is a great sequel but the rest are more average. Alien goes down as the best of its genre, a horror sci-fi that takes its time, confident in its story and visuals and creates one of the most memorable movie monsters of all time with characters we care about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
An Intergalactic Distress Call Of  The Most Monstrous Kind,"Well, at this point, what could I possibly say about 1979's Alien that (in the past 35 years) hasn't already been said about 100x before?It's actually quite surprising to see that after all of these many years (and after all of its many imitators) Alien still rocks when it comes to its shocks.Whenever discussing Alien there's one very important person, directly involved in its production, who I find rarely gets any mention or recognition for his vitally important contribution to this Sci-Fi production.And that person is Swiss-born artist H.R. Giger who was the one responsible for the design of this truly awesome and terrifying creature with its acid blood and a ferocious appetite to match.You can be sure, without Giger's fantastically fantastic creation, this Sci-Fi/Shocker would have never had the enduring impact that it inevitably has had over these many years.On May 12, 2014, Hans Rudolf Giger (at 74) died in Zurich, Switzerland.

To Say I'm in the minority of my opinion would be a monumental understatement.,"Waittt? Whattt? Dude Said Alien was a bad film. What's he on? Well we'd all be boring if we had the same opinion. But please here me out. This film was largely flat, boring and I was unsatisfied with the movie. This is Overatted. And it's OVERATTED for many reasons. And I'll explain why. I might change your mind, I might not. But atleast put my view into perspective, even the so-Called 'Best films' aren't always that good maybe on rewatch or in general for other people. And I'm sure it was good for it's time so I'm not going to ignore those things but what I will do is explain why this film is not amongst my favourites.Plot,Starting out with the plot. Which was simple and at times effective. But didn't really convert any expectations and didn't really have any twists and turns to keep you entertained. What didn't make sense to me as to why they were searching for a Cat when an Alien is on board. And I wouldn't ask this question if for alot of the film there quitley speaking there lines and more to my previous point they are mostly sitting down and doing very little. The Plot doesn't really have anything noteworthy about it. I felt it was a long boring drab film that doesn't do anything. Even with it's premise. It's impending doom which don't get me wrong is a great idea and the slow burner might of worked. But for me the characters were dull and uninteresting which I'll get too later. But the plot is bear thin so there's not much to talk about.Characters,Good part of the story is character growth. Some form of depth. So that we can root for them in more ways then one. But however I found the characters rather dull as I have previously said and that's down to the fact that they have nothing that's distinctive about them. There all the same, and I get they have the same job and probably the same role idk it never gets mentioned as to why they are there and why they do the job that they do. But they should atleast have some distinctive character trait to set them out from the rest. But they don't, and the acting is rather dull too. They don't have a personality which is a problem in a big budget film like this. And in any case. The characters are hard too root for as they have nothing to do. And you can only go so far with the ending doom slow burner type story and for a lot of you it works, for me it put me to sleep, well almost. Being rather one note characters.Set Designs,Which on the whole is perfect. The Ship has a great module and the set designs on the inside of the interior are great too. Bright and colourful which makes it stand out. And way ahead of it's time. Which is a plus. I can see why this is loved by so many. The chlostrophibia feel on the one hand is done well in this movie. I suppose that the set designs had something to do with that.The Alien,Well even though the film is called this, the Alien isn't involved until the 1hr 30 minute mark. Where the film only has another 25 Minutes as I'm not including the credit sequence otherwise then it would be 30. I get it the film is meant to give you a long lasting feeling of dread. But for me there's no substance to it. If your going to call your movie 'Alien' then the Alien should be the main focus of the film. And not having 5-10 Minutes of Screen time. If the title was labeled something else, then it might of worked but the Alien only being in it's own film for less than 10 minutes in a 2hour film! Feels rather redundant and a clickbait title to get viewers attention which worked. And people say the same thing about other movies so its only fair to talk about this one in the same sense. The work on the Alien is also way ahead of its time so that's a positive.So overall I got some enjoyment out of it like the Special effects, set designs and impending doom. But for the majority of the film nothing happened leaving no real emotion or impact. And if you still like the movie after my review then more power to you. But I just don't feel the same way about it. I get why it's held as a classic to most of you. But for me it's nothing more then a bland forgettable movie in space. So sorry but I'm giving it 3 stars out of 10. But now time for the Verdict.Verdict,3/10 Some scene stealers but overall Bland and pancakes are less flat then the characters.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Classic Horror,"Commercial star ship Nostromo, returning from a routine mission, are detoured when an alien SOS is intercepted. Awakened from hypersleep, the crew are obligated to land on the alien world where the call for help has originated, but the ship is slightly damaged during the landing process and three of the crew set out to explore the hostile new world. They come upon a derelict spacecraft, the skeletonized remains of an alien creature with an odd wound in its chest and a cache of strange egg-like objects. Crew member Kane is brought back from the exploration unconscious and with a bizarre, crab-like creature attached to his face. He is still alive, and indeed, the creature on his face seems to be keeping him alive for reasons unknown. The Nostromo is repaired and the crew leave the desolate planet behind. The crab creature soon leaves its perch on Kane's face and dies, and Kane emerges from his coma, apparently in good health. But the purpose of the alien soon becomes terribly clear; Kane has been impregnated with an alien embryo which births itself from his chest in a shower of blood and gore, killing Kane and escaping into the ships air ducts before anyone can react. The crew set out to destroy the creature, not realizing immediately that its accelerated growth has transformed it into a huge and vicious predator whose only desire is to kill them all.Very loosely based upon the 1958 horror film ""IT! The Terror From Beyond Space"" Alien is a masterpiece of Gothic horror, a haunted house movie on a spaceship. Flawlessly directed by Ridley Scott, Alien, whose plot is actually fairly simplistic and nothing new, is so filled with dread, so claustrophobically genuine, that it seems like nothing ever seen before. Ghostly steam, clinking chains, long dark corridors where anything can be hiding, the suspense is unbelievably suffocating. We never really get to see what the alien actually looks like until films end, and so the quick flashes of tail, head and mouth are so brief and so confusing that it only adds to the horror. Plus, Alien does what no ghost story can do - there is no way out of this ""haunted house."" There is no escape from the horror within.The performances are all outstanding. The alien is not the only menace to the all-too human crew; there are also soulless corporations and short circuiting androids to be dealt with on top of everything else. Faced with these dilemmas, every single crew member of the Nostromo are absolutely believable. They're tired, stressed out, rude and bitchy and they spend a good lot of time griping and snapping at each other, but they drop what they're doing and stand together, protecting one another without hesitation when they must. The gore is minimal; the death of Kane is the bloodiest, nastiest moment in the whole film and because Kane, played by John Hurt, seems to be the nicest of the crew members, it just makes his painful death scene all the more horrible.Alien is a grim, visceral, satisfying horror film and remains the unsurpassed best film in the series. Alien is an established classic and should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Science Fiction Masterpiece...ignore the little trolls with no brains.,"Ah, here we are....the dregs of the IMDb reviews, where teenagers and 20-somethings who have rarely seen a film made before 1980 tell us how a masterful film like Alien is boring and slow..These poor mentally crippled creatures know no patience, know nothing about the craft of cinema except what their short attention spans can consume in junk food bytes (pun intended).Ignore these little trolls...Alien is a landmark classic of cinema with it's horror suspense and extraordinary visual design (Cobb vs Giger) - a film that still haunts the imagination all these years after i first saw it as a teen. Like 2001, the images are unforgettable, a cinema experience you can become completely immersed in.The late 70's, my youth, were in many ways were an incredible rebirth of science fiction and horror cinema, and it's worth noting how Alien in a sense bookended Lucas' fantasy reinvention of sci-fi with Star Wars. Ridley Scott's great vision in bringing all these elements together in Alien and Blade Runner literally changed the course of fantasy films alongside Lucas'.Many comments here also focus on comparing Alien to Aliens, which is ridiculous..It's simple...Alien is a horror masterpiece, and Aliens is a brilliantly executed action film using Alien as it's inspiration.If you don't like Alien, you don't like films...it's that brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Innovative Sci-Fi Thriller Reintroduces Realism to the Genre,"While there is a general resemblance to the classic pulp sci fi film, ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"", Alien is an expertly crafted and thoroughly original film. In my opinion, it is also vastly superior to all of its descendants, including James Cameron's action and special effects smorgasbord, Aliens.As a teenager, I was so intrigued by the premise of this movie that I was one of the few people in the United States who went out and purchased Alan Dean Foster's book ""Alien"" and read it before the film was released. The book was actually very good, so I knew I was either in for a big treat or a total disappointment when I went to see Ridley Scott's Alien on opening night. Of course, there was no disappointment.Scott assembled a great cast, none of whom (at the time) had a great deal of face recognition except, perhaps, Ian Holm. He placed his characters in stasis aboard a long distance freight ship (""the Nostromo"") owned and operated by a mining company. The ship is grimy, a little broken down, and a bit cramped. The habitat module is one very small portion of this enormous commercial barge.The film uses sound beautifully. Both the amazingly haunting and memorable postmodern soundtrack and excellent soundscape are flawless. The film opens with the ship's computer beginning to power on the ship's systems, and even though the scene consists of nothing but sound effects and mostly immobile hardware, it is permanently burned into my memory.The crew is awakened, and unlike most sci fi films, almost immediately begins complaining about being brought out of stasis early and bickering about how much they should be paid for what appears to be an extra duty. Soon, we learn that a communication signal has been picked up on a planet nearby and the Nostromo's shuttle must descend to the planet and investigate.All of this is established effortlessly by Scott's fantastic directing, cinematography and editing, but rather than spoiling any aspect of this brilliantly plotted and presented story, I will discontinue my plot summary here and move on to the critique.Ridley Scott has directed two of the best science fiction films of all time - Bladerunner and Alien. These two films are completely different and also radically innovative for the sci fi genre. Alien reintroduces realism the the genre. The crew is not a bunch of heroic freedom fighters or righteous warriors. Instead, they are corporate staff members and a couple of administrators - a captain (Skerrit) and first officer (Weaver) who are the company management representatives, mechanics, a science officer/ship's surgeon, a navigator, and geologists (it's a mining company). The ship itself is not a sterile faster-than-light Maserati in space, but a gritty, messy, cramped, barge. And the alien is TRULY ALIEN. 'nuff said about him.H.R. Giger's organic/cybernetic art enhances the other-worldliness of all of the scenes that take place off of the Nostromo, and of course, the design of the alien itself. An enormous contribution that should not be overlooked.It doesn't really matter which version of this film you see. They are all terrific. The director's cut adds a couple of scenes which appeared in the book, but were left out of the original release. Personally, I don't think these scenes really add much to the film, but it is a matter of personal taste, since all of the versions I have seen are 10s.Recommended for anybody who can tolerate sci-fi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Sci-fi classic,"Easily one of Ridley Scott's finest films, and one of the best of the sci-fi genre. Alien is simply wonderful, with imaginative production design especially and a magnificent score from Jerry Goldsmith. The pace is also right on the money with a purposefully slow build-up, the editing is great, Scott's direction is superb and the story is wonderfully structured with seldom a dull moment. The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role. It is a delight seeing fine underrated actor John Hurt, and he is great to watch as the curious crewman. Overall, defines the term sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Flawed,"Alien is a good film with a number of major flaws, some of which should never have been allowed into the final released print. I saw it in the cinema on its original release, and was throughly looking forward to it being both a sci-fi and horror fan.1. So I was bemused to spend the first 5 minutes wandering over every square inch of the Nostromo. It was almost as if I was being told ""We've spent 5 million bucks on these sets, and you're going to see every square inch before we even start the film.""2. An hour of inconsequential fluff before anything happened. An hour!!3. Face hugger - good, from the alien spaceship to its final demise in the sickbay. This was more like it.4. Chestburster - absolutely horrific. Until that is, it looked round like a curious cartoon mole popping up out of a mole-hole, and skittered off to hide and grow. Everyone in the cinema laughed. Everyone. The entire impact of the chest bursting - thrown away. I can't believe that they wouldn't have been aware of this before putting the film into release.5. Rewiring Ash. Sigourney Weaver is wiring up a dummy head prior to Ian Holm's head, protruding through a false floor, answering her questions. So how do they bridge the transition from false head to real head? By using a cutaway to Ripley concentrating on the task in hand. No, they don't bridge it at all - instead, there is the most jarring jump-cut in the history of cinema. Even people who aren't versed in the grammar of cinema know that something cronky has happened, even if they can't put their fingers on what it is. This is Basic Film-making, first term, first lesson. Just plain awful.6. From here to the end, apart from the illogicalities and unanswered questions, the rest of the film is pretty good.Is that enough to make up for those glaring glitches?

Alien! One of the BEST original sci-fi movies of all time!,"Alien, (as well as all sequels, and prequels), is one of my favorite science fiction movies ever. It is one of those movies that you can watch a million times and never get sick of, it just has a really smart, interesting story, and the storyline and characters all work perfect together. The actors are great, especially Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good as portraying Lt. Ripley. The movie is set in the future, and is basically about a spaceship that gets a call while in space to check out a distress signal coming from a distant planet. The crew of the spaceship come into contact with an alien lifeform, and must fight to survive, as well as save the human race. The feel of the movie and characters is very authentic, which, (along with the excellent story), is why I love it so much. It is basically a science fiction thriller, with a very ""on-the-edge-of-your'seat"" feel to it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best films ever made,"Not much to say that hasn't been said about Alien. I am doing my small part to pump the rating up to a solid 9 where it belongs.I saw this on the big screen during it's opening week when I was 11 in a REAL theater - huge (holding 1075 people), packed house, spring-rocking seats, 70mm film, six track Dolby...wondrous. I have watched Alien at least 50 times since and I will never grow tired of it.The overall mood of the film is chilling and suspenseful. The detail and sheer beauty of the Nostromo's interior is stunning. I could easily watch an entire hour of slow, sweeping pans of the rooms and corridors alone. Nothing before or since has ever come close.The special effects in Alien are fantastic by any standard. Yes, there is one scene in which someone attempts to stand something upright on a table and another where something appears to be moving on a dolly that reveal some limitations, but these are more than acceptable trade-offs for the realism of makeup versus CGI. I am sure the editors wished they had a few more takes to work with, but they did their best with the shots they had and these very minor flaws do not detract.I would have thought that by now, CGI would be a match for ""old-fashioned"" silicone and makeup, but sadly no. CGI still looks fake and has never produced a single, believable, creature or superhero in all these years. Ever. I find that very sad. I don't know if it is because the technology for realism just isn't here yet or if it is simply a lack of human talent in adding in the ""imperfections"" that make things look real. I suspect it's a combination of both plus a lack of budget for the time it would take and I don't think we will see real-looking CGI for at least another 30 years. I wish more films today would shun CGI altogether. Models, silicone and makeup are far superior. Come on CGI effects teams - CATCH UP!Well, that's my rant on CGI... But although the sets and effects are wonderful, Alien is not a special effects film. It is pure suspense and horror in a sci-fi setting, done to perfection.Alright that's enough. If you are the one person alive who hasn't seen this, what are you waiting for? If sci-fi or slow suspense is not your cup of tea, so be it. It takes all kinds to make a world, but give it a shot - give it its due. Alien is truly an amazing work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies ever made!,"I give it a 10/10 without doubt. I am not giving it a 10/10 out of compassion but because of the creative and cinematographic (relative)perfection. Please mind that even though it has a new directors cut re-release, this movie is actually a full 25 years old!!! Even when you watch it now it stands it own and that is the magnificence of the art-director and of Ridley Scott, the film director.Ah then you get to see one of the best (or simply the best) female action heroes ever created on screen. Sigourney Weaver is just so memorable. Please don't forget that the brilliance of this movie launched a whole quadrology. That itself is a testament to this first one: Alien. The second one Aliens directed by James Cameroon is an epic in itself but much of the foundation was (perhaps inadvertently) laid by Ridley Scott in this movie. Please note another side effect was that female heroes were used by Hollywood after this movie in very big productions.Each shot, each scene and sequences build up the film in a fantastic manner that is old school but still so difficult to achieve. It is like Da Vinchi's painting. It is old school style. But still difficult to do. Story is about the crew of a mining ship who end up with an alien while answering an SOS call. Alien: not as in an illegal immigrant (er.. this is not a political movie about borders and immigration...) Alien as in the most scary creature ever devised. Truly alien.

Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever,"Alien is by far one of the greatest movies made. Directed by Ridley Scott, you can tell by the eerie, bleak opening credits that your not in for a pleasant ride.This movie starts out with introducing us to the crew of the Nostromo, who are returning to Earth. Along the way they receive a distress signal. They go and investigate and everything takes a turn for the worst when a crew member comes back on board with a parasite attached to his face. When the alien then breaks free all hell is raised.This is a great movie. The suspense is by far some of the best filmed and the dark atmosphere heightens are sense of terror. Well acted by Sigouney Weaver, Ian Holm and Tom Skerrit this is a genre defining movie which holds to date one of the most shocking scenes ever filmed. The 'Chestburster.'5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The film that started it all,"I'm writing this review not because I think 'Alien' needs another 5* review, but because I read a post on an internet message board by someone saying, 'I can't believe this piece of junk is considered scary!' So, I re-watched Alien, trying to see if I could see where this poster was coming from. I guess there are now two types of viewers. The first - like me - grew up on Alien in the late seventies/early eighties, where it was one of the most ahead of its time films ever made. It started off the whole 'monster-munching' movie genre, where a lone creature stalks and eliminates a team/crew/whatever one by one. There have been countless B-movies made since its release in 1979 which have tried - unsuccessfully - recapture its look, feel and financial viability, but pretty much all have failed.Then you have the new generation - those who have grown up with 'Avatar' as the 'normal' quality of film. It's fair to say that Avatar is a vastly superior film to Alien, but only because it has the budget etc. If you're used to seeing thousands of alien creatures fighting over a mystical landscape, watching a single creature (which, as some times, comes across very much as a bloke in a suit) jump out of the darkness about five times in two hours, comes as a bit of a let-down.However, when it comes to purity, Alien will beat pretty much every movie ever made (even its highly-regarded successor, 'Aliens,' which - although also excellent, is not as pure as the original, as it blends genres more).If you know Alien and generally appreciate horror and/or science-fiction, you'll probably already love it. However, if you're new to the genre and primarily are used to modern filming techniques, you may have to put yourself in the place of the audiences back in 1979, who had never seen such a claustrophobic and tense piece of horror.The xenomorph itself, now looking a little dated (in my opinion the dragon-thing at the end of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland looked more horrific!) may not cut it compared with modern special effects, but - again - it was way ahead of its time. Alien will stand the test of (cinematic) time. Film history will always have a place of it (and Aliens), just don't go thinking that films have always been made the way Avatar and Lord of the Rings have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"An exercise in cool, calculating visceral horror","Ridley Scott's first mainstream Hollywood film is still fresh and powerful 30+ years after it was first released. The story of a commercial spaceship crew diverted to explore a distant planet as a result of the detection of mysterious signal getting themselves an extremely unwanted visitor and the subsequent horror than ensues makes this a landmark science fiction horror film. A fairly straightforward plot is helped by Scott creating a truly superb visually arresting atmosphere, thanks to great work by production designer Michael Seymour and cinematographer Derek Van Lint. It starts of epic, then transitions to the mundane, before building a growing sense of uneasiness leading to claustrophobic suspense and dread that just keeps building and building until, in the final act it turns into a nerve-wracking horror- thriller as key characters fight for survival.While Ridley Scott deserves great credit in pulling this all together so well, kudos has also to go to the whole cast for creating a wonderfully naturalistic approach to their roles, and being able to define their characters so uniquely and clearly, even if they are archetypes – Yaphet Kotto as the engineer with a chip on his shoulder regarding the preferential pay that the officers get, who nevertheless when the chips are down does demonstrate heroic qualities; Harry Dean Stanton as the fellow engineer who may have some form of brain damage, possibly brought on by historic substance abuse but knows the mechanics of the ship inside-out; Veronica Cartwright as the ships navigator, who acts as the link to the audience as a professionalism is gradually striped away as she is consumed by fear; Ian Holm as Ash, the enigmatic and quiet science officer who has only just jointed the crew at the start of this journey; John Hurt as the curious, fearless and gung- ho second in command, Tom Skerritt as the level headed, approachable but experienced Captain, and of course Sigourney Weaver (for whom this was her first film in a significant role) as what seems to be the young, less experienced but confident and assertive career-driven up and comer Ripley. The growing tensions between the characters, particularly the way that all the character butt heads with Weaver's character works well in the development of the story, and despite relative inexperience Weaver is terrific in the role, and helped create an iconic character in science fiction that would lead to three sequels.Kudos also has to go to the technical crew for creating a terrific atmosphere for the actors to work in – this was helped by Scott deciding to film the movie in chronological order of the story rather than a more typical logistical shooting order. The decision to hire the dark surreal artist HR Giger certainly brought a fresh new look to science fiction, but Michael Seymour's production design is truly brilliant and the way that the Alien is presented on screen is still pretty much the best – keeping its appearances limited and quick – nerves are so shredded by the end of the movie that seeing the monster in more extended full body shots where it is more obvious that it's a man in suit doesn't pull you out of the picture. Credit has also got to go to the brilliant Oscar winning visual effects team – as well as the aforementioned HR Giger, it also included in-camera effects from both Nick Alder and Brian Johnson, and excellent miniature photography from Dennis Ayling. Alder had cut his teeth as a director of effects photography on the Gerry Anderson TV show 'Space 1999'. After Alien, he has worked as an on-set special effects expert on an array of films including Empire Strikes Back, Conan the Barbarian(1982 version), Legend, Jewel of the Nile, Leon, Braveheart, Lost in Space, Behind Enemy Lines, Blade 2, Underworld, Hellboy, Shanghai Knights, Ghost Rider, and would win a BAFTA for best visual effects for the Luc Besson film The 5th Element. Johnson's early credits including work as a special effects assistant on 2001, before also cutting his teeth on Space 1999 as a 2nd unit director overseeing the visual effects. After Alien he would work on a variety of films including Never-ending Story, Dragonslayer, Slipstream, Dragonheart as well as winning another Oscar for best visual effects for Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA for his work on Aliens. Carlo Rimbaldi was already an Oscar winning special effects veteran of over 20 films prior to working on Alien, and had just prior to this film completed work on both King Kong (for which he had won his prior Oscar) and Close Encounters. He would go on to win a third academy award for his work on E.T, and would go onto work on Conan the Destroyer and Dune. Denis Ayling followed this film as a cinematographer in British Television. Giger's did occasionally work on other films (creature designer on Alien 3, visual designer on Species) but his legacy is that the basic Alien look and design influence has survived through 3 excellent to OK Alien sequels, two poor Alien v Predator crossover movies, two disappointing Alien prequels, a batch of (very bad) Species sequels.Another noticeable contributor to the film's mood was the music – which should have been credited to Ridley Scott and Editor Terry Rawlings. Jerry Goldsmith's original score was extensively edited, cues moved around and classic music from other compositions fitted into the scores, but nevertheless somehow the music works very well.All of this helped make Alien a truly outstanding movie. The atmosphere created is so visceral that the film always leaves you with an impact after when the film is overOverall a landmark science-fiction classic.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
very slow and boring,"This film is overrated and i expect everyone to stay away from. The movie itself is very slow, outdated. Opening scenes look like some old spaceship movie based on outerspace landing, the movie is so dull it keeps you waiting for anything to pop-up, although i must admit it is a bit creepy, but too slow. I watched this movie alongside the predator, and i must say the predator is far entertaining movie, i eagerly wanted to see an alien with something innovative, but it lacks what the predator has i.e: heat vision and array of weapons. The alien movie reminds me of the film relic released in 1996, accept that sorry to say that relic has an edge over this one, because its more entertaining, rather than this boring farce, which i regret wasting my time on, the only decent alien movie of the franchise has to be aliens, all the rest after that have been worse than even this one. 2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Masterpiece,"Alien is a chilling suspense thriller set in space. Directed in 1978 by Ridley Scott, this film is important to me, as I admire the techniques used in order to generate a response in the viewer.Back in 1978, the director couldn't rely upon today's modern digital effects to grab the audience's attention. Instead, he relies upon techniques such as camera angles, a clever set design, and a superb soundtrack to slowly build tension and create feelings of fear, vulnerability and intimidation within the audience.It is at least half an hour into the film before the audience are aware of the extent of the horrors that follow. Until then, the uncertainty of not knowing exactly what we should be afraid of only adds to the tension. The eventual release of the tension, which has gradually built up, inevitably has more impact.The film is set in a time and place unknown to us. However there are several ideas in the film which we can recognise and relate to, making the story believable, therefore more frightening.For example, the idea of travelling far in space for the purposes of a mining expedition is something which the viewer could accept as likely to be happening in the future. Also, the seven characters on board the ship have an obvious class system, something which we can all relate to in any work environment.These are some of the qualities which make Alien so popular, making it an inspiring piece of film making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"A historical milestone, yes, but also a bore","This film was historically significant for its work with special effects and cinematography. It is not fun to watch, though. I found the film slow-paced and unexciting.

We see special effects every day now, not only in movies but in advertisements on TV. This movie relies on its special effects, which are admittedly well done, but are not enough to justify rating a movie highly in 2007.The Alien didn't scare me.

Now, of course, I sincerely believe the film industry should try it's best to be original, although let's be honest, that won't happen. Everything in this movie is perfect, I mean that. The script never falls apart with one of the most steady spaced movies I have ever watched. The acting is unknowingly great, depending on your observations of certain characters. The ship is fully developed, with a crew that does not hesitate in any scene with their brilliant chemistry. The ship design feels dirty and lived in, keeping the advanced look. Every time a button is pressed to put in commands or a lever is pulled the ship responds. The Alien design is many peoples favorites, feeling real. For 1979 this movie is revolutionary in visuals and props, never looking too fake. If there is anything I would have to say this movie does best on, it is the cinematography. Derek Vanlint gave the job of a lifetime, alongside Ridley Scott. Alien is one of my favorite movies if you have never watched it....fix that.

The characters having no one to contact or to run away being that they're blanketed by space. The unique personalities of all the characters make them each interesting for their own ways. And the build up and tension created by the movie allows for the scares to come much easier. This has been and may forever be my favorite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated...,"Alien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.The space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...Back on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.On plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.Some still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid conventions.With art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.It made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.Now 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly so. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Alien review,"Alien is one of the first movies directed by legendary 'Ridley Scott' (Blade Runner, Gladiator) The film is a classic in the making. When i first heard about this movie i was around 10 years old, obviously too young to watch the movie, now i am 17 and i have watched it for the first time, now twice i enjoyed it so much. This is honestly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 70s, probably is my favourite Sci Fi movie of the 70s, and one of the best of all time. The Sequel 'Aliens' (1986) was directed by James Cameron, another one of my favourite directors. Director of 'The Terminator' (1984) which stands as my favourite Sci-Fi movie of all time. The reason i didn't want to see Alien when i was younger, was because i always felt scared of the Alien, i used to have horrific nightmares of them just thinking about them. When i went to Disney world, i have always loved Movies, so i decided to visit a Movie ride, the Alien suddenly popped out of the ceiling, of course it was only plastic, but looked real enough. So i had always been too scared to watch the Movie. I didn't know what i was missing out! As i watched it i didn't know what i was worrying about. It's very different to watching it on Screen than seeing for real. I am nearly 18 now, so i am not really scared of anything anymore, i would definitely go back to Disney and try out that ride again, just to see if it still scares me, I think now i've finally seen the movie i appreciate now that it's not real, and i find it interesting than scary now more than anything, because it feels like I'm in the movie. When it comes to Ridley Scott director 'Prometheus' (2012) a prequel to Alien, that wasn't very scary at all, it was more of a mystery than a Sci-Fi/ Horror i thought.

Don't land on unknown PLANETS!!,"I am watching this movie in 2016 and still the practical effects almost made me puke. Ridley Scott's space horror is one for the classics. I have obviously watched many movies with gore and aliens and sometimes both but all of them try to force feed you. The set pieces don't seep in and the audience is made to jump from one gory situation to another. BUT this is Ridley Scott we are talking about. The one who started it all. I actually had watched Prometheus 1st and had a vague idea about the Alien franchise. Now after re-watching Alien I am beginning to connect the dots.The plot is probably known to everyone by now. So just skipping over that. Starting with the direction. The slow paced direction allows you to feel the atmosphere. The situation. It makes you understand the psyche of each of the crew members aboard the Nostromo. You start to care and while watching it I often wished to not get emotionally involved because I knew what was to follow. The face-hugger scenes was much more creepy and disgusting than when the Alien arrives, because the Alien is shown in the dark and mysterious. So the effect of the goriness is only understood when the witnesses arrive but the face-hugger is on screen. It is puke-worthy.The acting was very natural. The lines almost seemed unscripted. The equation between all the crew members was very evident from the beginning. I should seen through the fact that Ash was an android but it was well hinted throughout the film. It is very subtle. So subtle that you are bound to miss . As I said, the pacing is very steady. You'll feel the fear. The set-design is amazing. All in all it was a enjoyable movie.

"Nothing Special, Just Another Sci-fi movie","The 1970s are very well known for movies that scared audiences out of their mind. Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" startled audiences with a sophisticated kind of imprisonment whose purpose was to cure when really it could have been used in the next ""Hostel."" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" frightened audiences with the realization that there is barely escape when in a burning building or a sinking cruise liner. Finally ""The Exorcist"" did the worst, in short, it made every viewer sleep with their light on for the rest of their life. The decade closed off with another sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien.""""Alien"" is the story of a spaceship crew who is awakened from chronological sleep to investigate a distress signal from a distant planet. After a bad landing, the crew of seven sends a crew of three out onto the surface to investigate. When one crew member, Kane (John Hurt) is lowered into a derelict ship, he is attacked by an alien being that clings to his face. Meanwhile, crew member Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) translates the supposed distress signal into a warning, however, they do not understand why it would be a warning until it's too late. An Alien being is now loose on the ship.The crew is now faced with a challenge, a loose killer Alien on the ship. They must keep together to stay and alive and make themselves kill or be killed.Known as a sci-fi horror classic, ""Alien"" isn't all that it's worked up to be.

The phrase 'in space nobody can hear you scream' has never been so effective, and the movie relies on atmosphere to generate this effectiveness. This is a risky decision for any movie developer. If that atmosphere is not established well enough, then the movie loses all sense of fear and tension. Here, however, this is not the case. The alien is instantly established as a threat - thanks to that infamously gory scene in the cafeteria (you all know which one I'm talking about) - and this, combined with the tight hallways and sense of claustrophobia, is what shapes Alien into the chilling experience that is renowned more than 25 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien.,"At 12 years old, my father handed me the book version of Alien, by Alan Dean Foster. I remember him chuckling and telling me I'd like it. Once I started reading, I became absorbed by it. My father was right. This was the year the film was released, and at 12, there was no way of going to see it. So I became obsessed with getting to see it. After the film was released, I stumbled upon the photo book The Making Of Alien, and after finally seeing H.R. Giger's creations, I was completely blown away.Alien is a tightrope of tension and fear. It's the most atmospheric movie I have ever seen. All of the cast are solid in their roles. Ridley Scott and crew did an amazing job of recreating H.R.Giger's designs, and Scott's direction is flawless throughout. The set designs inside the Nostromo, and the gritty 'space truckers' feel of the film, add to the realism. Which makes for a great contrast when they finally discover the alien derelict, with it's nasty surprises.John Williams's score is amazing. Suitably dark and bleak, with just a glimmer of hope.So, from a 12 year old's crush, and to finally seeing it a few years later, I can say with ease, Alien is without doubt, my favourite film.Total perfection.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Perfect Film. Turned Both Sigourney Weaver & The Alien Into Cultural Icons.,"I had seen this a couple of times prior to watching it with the expressed purpose of reviewing the quality of the film. It's a classic - if you live in America and watch movies, then you really can't escape having seen 'Alien' (1979) at least a couple of times. I always thought it was ok - a fine movie. I'm not a sci-fi fan and I don't particularly care for Sigourney Weaver. However, I created this numeric review system since the last time I saw this film, and I have reviewed 130 or so films now for IMDB. Regularly reviewing films with this metric has changed the way I watch a movie. Now, there is this constant comparison in my mind, weighing the qualities of the film I am watching verses all other films of the genre.'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest films of all time. The 1970's effects not only hold up, but are still impressive, due to extraordinary cinematography. Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ripley and she adds surprise sexuality to the film toward the end. The writing shows the ship to be a microcosm of societal conflicts - duty verses survival, equal pay for equal work, and the battle for women's equality in group decision making. And, then there is The Alien. I capitalize his name (or title?) because he is one of the biggest box office draws of all time. Nicholas Cage wishes he had the career of The Alien.This film has some great qualities and no noticeable flaws. I am proud to award it my 6th perfect score.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

one of the best,"What can be said that hasn't already been said, nothing that's what. One of the best in the genre to be made and best effects for it's time. They simply don't make films like this anymore Hollywood won't risk it or this generation won't appreciate it. One of the great strengths of ""Alien"" is its pacing. It takes its time. It waits. It allows silences.Today's slasher movies, in the sci-fi genre and elsewhere, are all pay-off and no buildup.The result is a film that absorbs us in a mission before it involves us in an adventure, and that consistently engages the alien with curiosity and logic, instead of simply firing at it.We have now descended into a bog of Gotcha! movies in which various horrible beings spring on a series of victims, usually teenagers. The ultimate extension of the genre is the Geek Movie, illustrated by the remake of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which essentially sets the audience the same test as an old-time carnival geek show: Now that you've paid your money, can you keep your eyes open while we disgust you? A few more ambitious and serious sci-fi films have also followed in the footsteps of ""Alien,"" notably the well-made ""Aliens"" (1986) and ""Dark City"" (1998). But the original still vibrates with a dark and frightening intensity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Classic from 1979,"Technically it was a great film. The cinematography was far ahead of it's time, but the story was kinda mid. It was very stereotypical and predictable for our time. The plot was confusing at a lot of scenes as well. The characters weren't something special and pretty forgetable, too.I have to say that I don't really like horror movies, but this one was still good.So all in all it was a good film, maybe a bit overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Extremely boring.,"Before I continue this review, I just want to give a warning to everyone with photosensitive epilepsy. The entire third act of this movie is filtered by strobe lights. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, then don't watch.Plot and ""Characters"" - I honestly don't mind slow movies, but this is taking it too far. I'm not asking for nonstop action, all I really wanted was some kind of a plot, tension, maybe some world building, and possibly some character development. Just the bare bones that you'd want out of a movie. Unfortunately, this mess contains none of that. The ""plot"" can be summed up in one sentence - ""dumb people find alien, do dumb things then die."" One of the people on the ship turns out to be a robot and it doesn't even have anything to do with anything, it just happens. I've heard people say that these characters are incredibly well-developed, but they aren't. Calling them ""characters"" is an insult to the very word. There is next to nothing that differentiates them from one another. Instead of dull scenes without dialogue or anyone doing anything, this movie really could've used some scenes where the characters interact, express individual motivations, and maybe get some backstory. The start has a vague plot about getting away from the aliens, but but the time one person is left alive, the editor gave up and nothing makes sense. Even the movie knows its being boring too because Ripley strips for no reason and from then on the movie is filmed in a bit of a sexual manner.Sights and Sounds - The visual quality and the effects and the sound design in this movie are all fine. Nothing great, but not bad. Its actually pretty good, considering its age.This movie isn't scary or interesting. Really it commits the biggest crime that a movie can commit - its boring. It does almost nothing that a movie is supposed to do. Even my dad, who was blinded by nostalgia goggles prior to rewatching, realized how bad it is after watching it with me. Anyone who says that this movie is great clearly needs to rewatch it. I don't care that this movie doesn't have nonstop action - there are a lot of movies with lots of action that are boring. Honestly, I have no idea why people hold this trash in such high regard. Maybe it was good at the time, and sure it had some influence on future movies, but it doesn't really have anything else going for it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Pure masterpiece,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece, pure and simple. If there is still anyone who somehow haven't seen it (i can't imagine how could that be even possible), do your self a favor a watch it, not with your friends on Friday evening, but alone and let this movie blow you away.I saw this picture for 5-7 times in my life, and the last time i did (actualy today), was on my 2m x 2m screen projector with all sound system ready to roll.This is timeless film because of many things. The atmosphere, the rising tension, the craftsmanship of the scenes, acting - it all works here because they are not overplayed, and build on seemingly simple approach. 15 minutes into this movie again i caught myself that i forgot everything and i was in there, with them. Thats because of the script, directing, acting - it's all in the first place here, not settings, which still looks great - a bit dated, maybe, but it's not Star Wars type movie were visuals have to be sharp - ""Alien"" shows things in shadows, moody style to create feeling of uncertainty, and it does it brilliantly - that is why this movie is never going to age.Please don't ever compare it to even superior (in my opinion) ""Aliens"" - ""Alien"" is different kind of a movie, it's purpose was to scare people with deadly and very claustrophobic atmosphere, settings and the creature itself, to feel people uncomfortable (in a good way) knowing that no one is safe here and around every corner there could be your end - just look at the close ups near the end of the movie, or shoots where camera is showing person and a deep dark space behind him, thats were imagination starts to fill the darkness.Overall, 10/10 for one of the greatest achievements in the art of movie making.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror Breed,"Alien (1979)The First of a New Sci-Fi Horror BreedIt's hard to believe how fresh and scary this movie was at the time, but it's also a relief to see it still holds up as a well made movie even now. Is it a classic great movie? Almost, almost. But not quite, in the end--mostly because of some clichés and goofs in the acting and dialog--although it has really great moments. And it's a great way to discover director Ridley Scott's unique style.Certainly now that H. R. Giger the artist has gotten famous in his own right, the alien itself deserve special mention. And the sets are impressively otherworldly and familiar at the same time--not only the huge and hugely baroque ship, but the interior scenes on the planet toward the beginning. These are marvels whether or not your style (and for my money, the alien is a really improbable type of extraterrestrial, more at home in a comic book Hades than actual space). Another novelty to note, probably a product of the shift in movies in general since the 1960s, is the director's intention to keep things real and everyday. Things are dirty, people worry about their paychecks, and so on.This is a long way from the sterility of 2001 though head to head the earlier Kubrick film is on another level of art. I know a lot of people would rather be entertained, though, and Alien is entertaining. It's fast, it's scary, it's gory, it's messy. It's surprising. It's beautiful. And it spawned a whole series of follow-ups, the next one confusingly called Aliens (1986), also a very good take on the new genre.I first saw this when it came out in Colorado and it was on a huge, curving screen that wrapped around the audience, and I was really, truly scared. Now, thirty years later, the scary parts are still really scary, and it's edited so quickly you won't spend more than a minute on any one scene that doesn't quite click. Horror sci-fi has never been the same since.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Hey guys I found a good movie,"This suspenseful, spine-tingling movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the time it's finished. When you watch this one, you feel like a good friend (by good I mean shrewd in picking movies) has brought it to your house to have a great movie night. In other words, it seems like director had seen it several times before he made it. He is that friend of yours by the way. A huge spacecraft has finished its mission and is heading back to Earth. We the crew members get up from their sleeping pods, they realize the spaceship is out of its course. Apparently it has received a signal from another planet, indicating some alien life form and set off to accomplish it secondary mission: investigating life in space. The extra- terrestrial life they find is by no mean friendly and brings horror into the ship.It's more of a horror film than a science fiction one. I am sure you have seen those horror films in which some people are stuck in a hut in jungle and there is some nasty creature lurking to hunt them one by one. Well, now make the hut full of small rooms and send it to space. This, has provided director with a lot of close-ups which sends a shiver to your spine. It keeps you guessing when something is going to jump into the frame from an angle and kill people on board. But the brilliance of the movie is in what it doesn't show. By this, I mean unlike other horror movies you don't see people running around, crying or screaming ( not that much anyway). Also, when the astronauts find the organism, they do not celebrate nor freak out. They act vary nonchalant like they come across these things all the time. And this, has saved a lot of time and helped the director and audience focus on the story.A lot of unnecessary scenes have been cut out. And there's your good friend Ridely, selflessly sparing you from all the fake screams and tears. At times you guess you are going to see some sentimental crying or other reactions, but it never happens. Well, crew members are scientists and not some clueless teenagers. Sometimes in comedies, actors act normally in funny situations which makes it even funnier. This technique has been applied here and if you ask me it has worked like a dream; a scary one too.Right at the beginning of the movie, the camera is roaming in the spacecraft which seems horrifyingly deserted. While we are curious to see some people or aliens, we reach a room in which astronauts are sleeping in their pods. And when the camera approaches the room, the automatic door goes up. This, throws the audience right to the spaceship. There is another scene in which the senior commander, frustrated to find a way to kill the monster, tries to get some answer form the computer brain of the craft called Mother( discover the irony yourself). He keeps asking about the creature but the computer has insufficient knowledge. Then with all his hope gone he types: 'What are my chances?'",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A slow burning fear inducing masterpiece,"This is a very good movie. Like SUPER GOOD.
It has a few flaws and here they are:Movie is relatively slow.
Ash's head in that one scene is obviously fake.And that's it. I don't have issues with slow burning movies and I appreciate quality of special effects.
My biggest complaint is that movie isn't scary anymore. Because I watched it like 30 times and can almost tell it scene by scene. Of course it's no longer creepy, disgusting or scary to me. And that's fine. I still can get a lot of fun from this movie. It's good. REALLY GOOD. If you haven't watched it, go and do so. Just keep in mind that it's not a fast-paced action movie, but a slow and methodical horror.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A tour DE force,"Just saw that Ridley Scott will soon be bringing out a film (Prometheus)that has roots in his masterpiece ""Alien."" It prompted me to go back to user reviews of this epic film, and in one of them, from 2005, a reviewer identified as Patuguitos simply and rightfully acclaimed ""Alien"" as the perfect film. Bravo--it is true. This film was victimized by bias against its science fiction genre, garnering awards only in the areas of special effects, set direction, etc. Yes, it features a fearsome creature (brilliantly shown in increasingly frightful glimpses):apparently Oscar voters felt this disqualified the film as a serious piece of cinema. Absurd--""Alien"" deserved nominations, if not wins, as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Editing, Set Design, Special Effects, Score, and perhaps other categories. I have been a discriminating film-goer for almost 60 years.

In space no one can hear you scream,"One of the most original, suspenseful & terrifying films you're ever going to come across, Ridley Scott's breakthrough feature is a masterful blend of imagination, art direction, set design, special effects, unsettling score, perfect cast, terrific performances & quality narration, and is an extraordinary achievement in the genre of both horror & science-fiction which today is universally hailed as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time.Alien follows a seven members crew en-route to Earth on board a huge commercial ship when their journey is interrupted by what appears to be a distress signal from a desolate planet. The crew lands to investigate but discovers a deadly life form which breeds within a human host. And so begins the horror... the horror of a highly aggressive extra-terrestrial creature which begins to stalk & kill them one by one.Ingeniously directed by Ridley Scott, it's his brilliant use of atmospheric visuals & breathtaking details plus strong emphasis on realism over movie heroics that provides Alien an ageless appeal. Cleverly penned down by Dan O'Bannon, his vision of the monster and the futuristic world he sets the plot in is nothing short of breathtaking. Also, H.R. Giger's design of the monster is an exceptional feat in itself, for it is truly a unique & original fusion of insect, man & machine.Cinematography & editing is carried out amazingly well and integrates effortlessly with other aspects of this film. The cast works together as a team with great maturity and it was pleasing to see each & every character getting equal importance as it provided viewers a bunch of very believable & convincing individuals. And in a cast that comprises of Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm & John Hurt, it is Weaver who ends up leaving the most lasting impression on the canvas.But the most remarkable thing about Alien is its persistent attention on suspense over mindless gore & graphic kills and of course, its smart pacing as well that separates it from typical slasher films. Alien actually takes its time & waits until the viewers are fully immersed into its world and is at its scariest when nothing is happening as Scott allows plenty of space for our imaginations to run wild and, with little help from Jerry Goldsmith's tense score, turns almost every frame into a potential nightmare scenario.On an overall scale, by bringing together the silence of 2001: A Space Odyssey to create suspense and the horror of Jaws by not showing but not ruling out the presence of the creature either, Alien succeeds in creating a very dark, moody & unique atmosphere that constantly provides a feeling of uneasiness throughout its runtime. A genre-defining masterpiece, a genuine fright classic, and an unprecedented fusion of art, science & horror, Alien is a distillation of everything that scares us in the movies.

"Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979) stands the test of time as a masterpiece of science fiction horror","""Alien"" (1979) is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that has influenced countless films in the genre. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film tells the story of a crew of astronauts on a mining vessel who encounter a deadly extraterrestrial life form on a remote planet. The tension is palpable from the opening shot, and the film's visual design is striking and otherworldly.One of the film's great strengths is the strength of its characters. Sigourney Weaver delivers a powerful performance as Ellen Ripley, the ship's second-in-command who emerges as the film's heroine. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Yaphet Kotto.The film's use of suspense and horror is expertly crafted. The Alien itself is one of the most terrifying creatures in cinema history, with its design by H. R. Giger perfectly capturing the sense of dread and horror that permeates the film. The sense of isolation and helplessness that the characters feel as they are stalked by the creature only adds to the tension.""Alien"" is also notable for its visual effects, which have stood the test of time. The use of practical effects gives the film a sense of realism that CGI-heavy films often lack. The iconic design of the Alien and its spacecraft have become iconic in their own right and have been referenced in countless films since.Overall, ""Alien"" is a masterpiece of science fiction horror that stands the test of time.

Sci Fi Horror Classic Stands The Test Of Time,"It is amazing to think Alien first came out way back in 1979. Watching it in the here and now, the film has barely dated and still stands up as a masterpiece of horror and suspense. Strongly casted with fantastic sets and a now legendary creature design, Alien is a true classic. The pacing of the film although slow by todays standards really enables the audience to get embroiled in the atmosphere and claustrophobia of the Nostromo and allows us to get to know its crew. Sigourney Weaver of course made her name with this film, but Ian Holm as Ash is fantastic, the subtle body language responses he does throughout as the horror escalates enable us to realise he knows more than he is letting on about the creature. There is not a single weak performance in the film and each character leaves an impression in there own way. The special effects are also outstanding and hold up to today's viewing, it was certainly a masterstroke by Ridley Scott to show as little of the Alien as possible as this escalates the dread and horror. A minor gripe would be there is perhaps slightly too much of the Alien shown right at the end of the film but thankfully that is just for a few seconds. The Matt paintings look fantastic for the planet the Nostromo lands on and the eggs and face hugger are suitably horrific. Alien is a film i have watched lots of times over the years and never got fed up with it, always enjoying the visuals and viewing experience. The word Classic was created for a film like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"I like it, but I've never quite loved it.","I wasn't crazy about Alien the first time I watched it, way back in high school. I've given it another shot on two occasions - including at a cinema tonight, done as part one of a double feature with 1986's Aliens - and though I'm able to appreciate Alien more now than when I was younger, I still don't love it.There is something missing for me, and I used to think it was just that I found the film slow, but I'm not sure that's it anymore. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey is even slower, and Blade Runner - another Ridley Scott sci-fi film - is also pretty patiently paced in parts, but I've come around to really love those ones.Something's just missing for me, with Alien. I can appreciate how simple it is, and how atmospheric it manages to be, and acknowledge its approach to very grounded characters who all have a believable dynamic (no romances or friendships or filmmaking 101 character arcs; they really do just feel like co-workers), but outside its most striking moments and scenes (those that do unfortunately get ruined by pop culture references, though that's not the film's fault), I do find myself thinking ""that's it?"" every time Alien ends.Hey, it's still good though. It's probably even great and I'm the crazy one who just can't get on its level. But it is one of those acclaimed and beloved classics that I can't really sink my teeth into, and it can be frustrating to feel left out of the club. I definitely like elements and scenes here, and the stuff I'm not crazy about, I can appreciate, but it just doesn't get to me on a level where I find it scary, intense, or particularly involving.But yeah, Alien is probably still the Emperor, and very much clothed, and I'm the delusional peasant who's unclothed, but still has just enough sense not to go and march into the town square and begin raving about how Alien has no clothes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Every detail is very carefully designed, with very realistic airs, making us feel as if we were really on board a spaceship, the actors are impeccable and teach the true madness of facing something unknown.

"SF ""lost patrol"" movie","""Alien"" follows the general conventions established by John Ford's ""The Lost Patrol,"" his highly influential 1934 work.  It's been redone any number of times as a war movie or a Western.  Now it's in outer space.  The sub-genre looks something like this.  A small contingent of people -- a mixed group -- in an isolated situation are confronted with a rarely seen enemy who strikes out of the darkness.  There is no way to fight back effectively.  One by one, the group members are picked off, beginning with the leader.  This shifts the responsibility to the next in command, who turns out to be the lone survivor or, sometimes, the last to sacrifice himself or herself for the sake of the mission.But it's hard to recognize the basic plot under all the gloss.  This movie was something of a shocker on its release, and introduced a lot of innovations into SF movies.  For instance, in all earlier movies in which a team lands on an alien astronomical body there is no wind.  Here, there is a howling gale.  This may not seem like much, stated so baldly, but no one had thought of it before, although it's long been known that planets like Jupiter have atmospheres that are in a state of constant turbulence.The monster was also a vehicle for a new, slimier conception of raw evil. This one is no Gill Man or furry pet with teeth.  This thing is positively reptilian in its detestability.  And it doesn't just ""do away"" with its victims.  It begins by incorporating every revolting image from our worst nightmares -- a scaly muscular skate-like creature that plasters itself to John Hurt's face and embeds itself in his innards in order to plant a seed of some sort, which later develops into a juvenile that, in a famous scene, bursts out of Hurt's chest during a shipboard dinner that didn't look very appetizing anyway.  This was the first movie that could really turn one's stomach, what with jelly-like substances and gooey sounds.  Everything connected with the alien looks as if it belongs under a rock in a jungle. The f/x are outstanding.  If they look a little tired today it's only because they've been so often imitated.The performances are professional all the way down the line.  Sigourney Weaver has a strangely boney face and tiny mouth, but she's believable and turns in a good performance, especially for a Stanford graduate.  Her first name was plucked by her father from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" one of my faves.  Tom Skerrit isn't around that long, but he is so likably easy-going that we hate to see him disappear from the plot early on. John Hurt is a fine actor.  He was my supporting player in the art-theater classic, ""From the Hip.""  He's never done less than a first-rate job. Whatever happened to him?  Veronica Cartwright exudes vulnerability.  She needs protection as an adult as much as she did when she was a child in ""The Birds.""  In an interview she revealed that when the juvenile creature first appeared everyone laughed at it because it looked so much like a penis. Ian Holm as the robot is suitably cold.  He's a good Shakespearian too. Yaphet Koto is an earthy comforting presence -- while he lasts.  The alien itself doesn't have much screen time but makes the most of it, dripping all over with what looks like saliva.  It reminded me of a boatswain's mate I once had the misfortune to serve under.There are a couple of curious things that shouldn't get more than footnotes. The music is almost all taken from Howard Hanson, a moody and underrated composer, and effectively evokes distance, darkness, and the mystery associated with them.  There are also a couple of references to Joseph Conrad thrown in (eg., the name of the ship is the Nostromo) for reasons I can't figure out.  Maybe the writers or the director just happened to like Conrad.  It should also be noted that Sigourney Weaver's figure, while not bursting with femininity, is sleek and smooth and looks designed for underwater swimming.If you haven't seen this, you should probably try to.  The gross factor isn't very high, viewed from today's perspective, so if that's what you're looking for, rent Carpenter's regurgitative newer version of ""The Thing"" or something.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Impressive for Its Time,"Impressive for its time, no doubt, but the pace verges on slow at the beginning. It takes a good 45-50 minutes into the film before anything actually happens, so if you are an impatient viewer like myself you may find this a dealbreaker. Once things get going, however, Alien is a really imaginative take on Alien life. It is no doubt impressive how a film of this technical ability was created in the 70s. The eyes of a millenial such as myself were quick to write off this movie as ""another sci-fi thriller in space"" but as it is one of the first of its kind it scores major points for being that reference point for so many films that came after. With the headstrong Sigourney Weaver in the lead role there is a rootable character who has tenacity and a commanding presence that dominates the screen. The alien lifeforms are rightfully grotesque and space does look like space, or what we might imagine it to look like. It's the combination of a strong lead character, the creative impetus of the director, and the production value that make this a classic. Nonetheless, it is far from a perfect film. It drags in many parts. There verges on too much gore versus intelligent thoughtful scenes. It would have been interesting to see the aliens communicate with the humans, or some explanation of what their purpose is. Instead, the movie opts to depict the aliens as bloodthirsty predators hellbent on killing. This paints a rather bleak portrait of aliens to the masses. Aliens, if they exist, are not necessarily violent, and do not necessarily take on the forms depicted in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Ground-Breaker In Sci-Fi/Horror,"Usually I don't care for films that have nothing but unlikable characters and a lot of verbal blasphemy, but this was so well done that I just had to have this on a good DVD because I'll always watch this film every few years. It's just too interesting to ignore.The attractions are the incredible suspense; excellent photography and set design and memorable horror scenes. They didn't overdo the action scenes, either, as is so often the case with modern-day films. In fact, some of this might be too slow-moving for today's audience.The suspense, as crew members search for the killer alien, is almost unbearable at times and helps make up for the profane cast, all of whom are low-life people who would never be astronauts in real life. I personally applauded when Veronica Cartwright, who had one of the nastiest faces and mouths on screen, met her demise. The rest of the crew wasn't much classier. Since this movie came out, in fact, the sequels to this plus many other science fiction films seem to portray astronauts as trashy people which is the opposite of reality and just plain ludicrous.Anyway, Alien a memorable movie to anyone who has seen it. Who can ever forget the alien emerging from John Hurt's chest? That's a scene that stays with you forever. Others have tried to imitate the horror of that scene, but never quite been as successful.The restored DVD gives this 25-year-old film a new appearance. It looks fabulous and really highlights the great cinematography and superb direction by Ridley Scott.

An iconic product of its time whose spectacle may never be repeated with how this genre is sold nowadays.,"It seems risky nowadays for Production to invest heavily into all the plastic, rubber and paper it takes to make the miniatures, set dressing and costumes for a movie like this. That's why it makes me sad when I re-watch Alien (1979) and get reminded that it is very hard to find the feeling this movie gives me in contemporary horror sci-fi. Watching Alien I am transported to another world. The film slows down at all the right moments and allows the ambience to be quiet when it needs to be. You really feel the powerlessness and isolation. To me Alien (1979) serves as an undying testament to just how immersive and memorable practical effects can truly be over CGI and how important moments of quiet and slowing down the action are to ultimately grant the desired horrific or spectacular payoff. And just when you think all the payoffs have paid off, the movie continues to surprise and delight.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Finally got the theatrical experience,"Went tonight to see the 45th anniversary re-release of Alien in theaters tonight and it was quite a treat. It had a cool little interview before the movie with Ridley Scott and Fede Alvarez (the director of the upcoming Alien: Romulus) which I'm looking forward to seeing. I liked that Ridley Scott referred to the movie as a horror film a few times. Many people on the Internet classify it as sci-fi action, but I definitely think it's more of a horror film. I had never experienced Alien in the theater before and there were more than a few times that I was genuinely scared and totally creeped out with the atmosphere. And the jump scares actually worked (unlike many horror movies made these days). Had a great time and was pleasantly surprised to have the theater mostly full at about 85%. At least I wasn't the only one screaming out during those jump scares. So glad I got to see it on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The best way to start the Alien saga,"If you try to see how Sci-fi and a Horror movie would look like if they were mixed together, you would get Alien, everything about this movie kicks butt with no way to explain it whatsoever. This movie also shows that it takes place in 2037, the world probably just changed a little bit though.So the movie starts out with a space-mining crew waking up from years of rest, their ages have stayed the same. The crew find an unknown planet; they go there in hopes of finding iron ore. One of the men finds a room filled with mysterious eggs, he looks into one and suddenly a creature called a Facehugger clamps onto him. The crew studies the guy and cut one of the Facehugger's legs as it's acid blood drips down the decks. Later the Facehugger is off of the guy's face.Later, the guy goes in pain as an Alien Chestburster comes out of him and runs to the lower levels of the ship. Later when a guy finds the member Ripley's cat, the fully-grown alien comes up behind him and strikes him with it's inner-jaw. Ripley and the crew decide to hunt the alien down and kill it. The alien eventually kills the other crew members leaving only Ripley left.Ripley, thinking that the alien is still on the self-destructing ship, get's into a smaller ship and flies into space as the main ship explodes in the distance. Ripley prepares for another long sleep period until she finds out that the alien is on the ship.Ripley acts fast as she puts a astronaut suit on so the alien does not get D.N.A in her. She blows the alien out into space and burns it with the thrusters. Ripley then prepares for another years of sleep.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
How the hell is this the second best horror ???,"this film was misdirected, unoriginal, cheaply produced and it all showed. the plot line was absolutely atrocious and although the producers may have added in extra splashes of gore to direct attention from the otherwise horrible performing i do not think it can really be considered to be a horror. i accept that it was going to have a challenge to compete with the seemingly unrivalled success of Star Wars (1977) however to expect to actually give George Lucas a run for his money wit this production was ludicrous. i am not quite sure that i have seen another film with quite the level of subordinate scripting and meaning that does not go directly out of its way to be considered as a joke. e.g. scream",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
In space no one can hear you Puss-puss-puss!,"Alien (1979)-As with any film the cat is the best bit and excellently performed by Jonesy.The cast that supports Jones is very good too, however I have never particularly seen what the fuss is all about with Sigourney. She does well in everything I've seen her in, but I don't feel that there is anything specifically noteworthy about her.Ian Holm on the other hand does a fantastic job as Ash, he's very sinister and you don't know why or if he's going to do something crazy whenever he is on screen.Personally I could have done without Lambert, but I suppose there has to be characters like her.The film is not fast paced to begin with, but manages to stay interesting throughout and it's surprisingly easy to believe, which is probably due to the set and props which are extraordinary.I find it so easy to imagine a future where these characters are grouped together on a spaceship of a design like the one seen. It's obvious that every detail had all been carefully thought about before production even began and that's why this film appears on so many ""Must See"" lists.The special effects are actually very good for the time also, with the exception perhaps of the little fella that hurtles across the dining table.The adult ""Alien"" of the title is brilliantly creepy and the simple idea of having them glisten and drip really adds to the hideous bug/lizard like nature of the beast.It's not a complicated watch and the simple storyline is what, for me, makes it a classic. It delivers something quite powerful, without getting confusing.Pay attention though as there is a lot that is used in 'Prometheus' (2012), which I had completely forgotten about until I re-watched this very good film.903.55/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Effective...,"When one brings up the subject on horror movies, your first thought is of the ""Scream,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the ""Friday the 13th"" series. But then you think a little harder, about the good ones--""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Poltergeist"" and ""Alien.""I admit, I have yet to see ""The Exorcist,"" but to this day, ""Alien"" remains the creepiest movie I've ever seen (and when I say 'creepiest,' I mean that it did not leave a lasting sense of fear...it was just 'creepy.'  I still have yet to see a movie that will actually scare the wits out of me).Nothing prepared me for ""Alien.""  I already knew exactly what was going to happen, and I still found myself in the dilemma of who would live and who would die.  The suspense was incredible, almost unbearable--at the end of the movie, I felt like I was gonna hurl!  Not because of the gore (I've actually got a pretty strong stomach for that), but because of my connection to the characters trapped aboard the monstrous Nostromo.  The feeling of hopelessness, despair, stranded in the middle of nowhere and awaiting the inevitable was so effective, I almost couldn't take it.  The claustrophobic sets (especially the scene with Dallas chasing the alien through the ventilation shafts) and the grisly alien effects, combined with surprisingly good acting from the cast, made this the beginning of a new era in science fiction.  Director Ridley Scott took us where no one had gone before--into the lives of the characters fighting the trauma.Before anyone died, we got to know each member of the crew.  By the time the baby alien violently burst from John Hurt's chest (and what an amazing scene!  Oh, but don't watch ""Spaceballs"" before watching this...it'll make it seem silly), we actually felt like one of the members standing around him, trying to hold him down, trying to save him but without any luck.  We had gotten a taste of everyone aboard, and every time someone died, we could really feel for them, a feeling of ""It's not fair!""The slick camera angles were another fairly influential part of the film, somewhat shaky at times but it all adds for effect, especially near the end with Ripley frantically tearing down the tight corridors, steam spewing from all around, blinding her from what's ahead and what's behind.  If only I had seen it in theatres...that would have made it truly haunting.And a clever trick from Scott...the use of our own imaginations to decide what really happens to each character.  The only person we actually see dying was Kane and the chest-bursting incident, but we only get a glimpse of what happens to everyone else.  We see a bloody Parker, hunched over lifeless later on in the movie,  but we have no clue what happened to him. We saw the alien whip around, grab him and begin a short struggle, with blood pouring from Parker's mouth when all of a sudden, the alien's second mouth shoots out and--where does it go?  Who knows...this isn't even answered in the sequel.  All we know is that it tears into some part of the body and kills them almost instantly.  Personally, I think it grabs the heart (or some other major organ) and rips it out, but that's just me.Ridley Scott must be among the most talented directors in history.  I can't see a resemblance in his directing between ""Gladiator"" and ""Alien"" (or ""Thelma and Louise"" for that matter) besides stunning sets and stomach-churning gore.  He proves here that he can master the art of film as well as Hitchcock and Kubrick (actually, he combines both their talents in this film).  ""Alien"" will always remain one of the most inventive and influential additions to cinematic history.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Good Horror Film,"I am off to see Alien: Romulus tomorrow, so I thought it was about time to rewatch the film that started the franchise and the film that takes place before Alien: Romulus chronologically in Alien. So I watched it today and here is my review for a film considered a classic. The premise of the film sees a crew answer a distress call which ends up with them encountering a deadly lifeform.Main Character
Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley and she is great in this film. She is a strong character and is one of the most famous female lead characters of all time and this film introduces us to the awesome performance. She gets plenty of time to shine in this film and she was a great lead character.Supporting Characters
A young Ian Holm plays Ash and for me he is the most interesting member of the Nostromo crew and Holm absolutely nails it in the role. He is the science officer of the crew and there is just a lot of intrigue about his character and Holm really excels here.The rest of the crew are good and involve some big actors such as Tom Skerritt as Dallas & John Hurt as Kane. They are decent but their characters are never really fleshed out but they fill the roles well and do well with what they are given.The Alien itself is such an interesting design and I love how this film conveyed The Alien as a true threat to the crew and its lack of screen time actually added to that effect and made every time it does appear feel special.Story
The story does a really great job of showcasing a predator hunting down its prey and these humans really struggling to deal with it. There is another interesting story that comes into play in the film which is pretty interesting but isn't particularly the focus here. The issue is that the film doesn't really make you care too much about the majority of the characters and spends a bit too long building atmosphere and tone instead of a plot.Script
The script is fine, there are one or two scenes that are pretty memorable and have some good dramatic dialogue. But I never really felt the relationship between the characters and as I mentioned above I never really cared about anyone and the lack of interesting dialogue plays its part.Style
The film does a really great job of building tension and atmosphere. You have no idea when The Alien is going to strike next and the film really delves into its horror vibe in order to keep the viewer on edge. But, I have to be honest this film is really slow, especially for the first act. It takes way too long to get going and doesn't do enough in that build up to add to the complexity of the majority of the characters.Overall
Overall, Alien is a good film that nails its atmosphere and the objective that it wanted. I know it is probably a controversial opinion to say this film is a bit overrated but I kind of feel like it is, but it is still a good watch especially if you are a fan of horror.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Rather childish film for someone used to modern films,"The film does not make sense.The science-fiction part is outdated and even amusing: space suits emitting CO2, funny computer monitors and keyboards, etc.Since the film was made in 1979, these technical details are forgivable.The idea of having a crew mainly made of humans is absurd, given that they obviously are capable of making really advanced robots.Not for a second I was surprised by the plot of the film.I can understand why this film was a top film in 1979.

Of the network okayed just about everything from plotlines, especially to set dec, character models, music.Everything about 2 screams ""for sale"" and to me (for example Alien 3 - was that produced, developed and released with a modicum of the standard that Alien was treated to?) while it's the better action movie, Alien is the better movie.Just like Hitchcock, this movie didn't just change horror/sci-fi forever but also modern, big budget blockbusters entirely and is so timeless and genre defining that I'm not even a horror fan and this is one of my favorites.This movie speaks more in the action, the setting and the arc than in the dialog, the music rivals anything by Williams or any of the other greats, and this still remains one of the best, undated looking movies ever, it could have been released today, tomorrow, or 30 years from now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien set the bar for sci-fi horror. Scott's direction and Weaver's powerful performance as the resilient Ripley make it a genre classic.,"Alien"" (1979) stands as a seminal triumph of cinematic horror that elevates the science fiction genre to an art form. Directed with meticulous precision by Ridley Scott, this enduring classic seamlessly amalgamates elements of science fiction and horror, engendering an atmosphere of unrelenting trepidation that persists long after the final frame.From a cinematic vantage point, ""Alien"" is an aesthetic tour de force. The Nostromo spacecraft, with its dimly lit, labyrinthine passageways, engenders a palpable sense of isolation and vulnerability. The cinematography, deftly orchestrated by Derek Vanlint, employs chiaroscuro techniques to accentuate suspense, crafting a visual tableau that is both haunting and evocative. H. R. Giger's phantasmagorical creature design is a masterwork of practical effects, with the gradual revelation of the Xenomorph serving to intensify the overarching suspense.Jerry Goldsmith's evocative score elegantly underscores the film's mounting tension, while Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley stands as an iconic representation of female empowerment within the genre. The film's deliberate pacing ensnares viewers in its suspenseful narrative web, and ""Alien"" undeniably persists as an eternally relevant cinematic magnum opus, rightfully enshrined in the annals of cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Gothic Scifi,"One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story, suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect. Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would go with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien 4(1998).The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by HR Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but vurnable woman.Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975]) which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes the music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story. Mozart's ""Eline Kleine Nachtmusik"" enforces the cold, expecting, and unknown fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling horror and anticipating terror within the plot.Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the death of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert. Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards Ripley.Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986). Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Evolution in Terror,"Let's cut to the chase: Alien isn't just a sci-fi horror flick-it's the godfather of the genre. That chestburster scene? Absolute nightmare fuel, but not just for shock value. The real genius is how the alien's life cycle-bursting from human hosts-mirrors humanity's own messy, violent origins. The film hammers home the idea that when something utterly alien (pun intended) crashes into our world, all our rules crumble. The xenomorph isn't just a monster; it's evolution on steroids, a brutal reminder that survival isn't about who's strongest, but who adapts fastest.The movie's claustrophobic tension and Giger's biomechanical nightmare design still slap, even today. But what sticks with me is the existential dread: humans vs. A creature that doesn't care about hierarchies, morals, or ""winning."" It's primal Darwinism wrapped in a spaceship hull. Alien isn't just about scares-it's about the terrifying beauty of chaos, where old orders die screaming and new ones rise from the bloodstained ashes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"OK, am I allowed not to like it?","I just saw the movie in the theatre. The ""Director's Cut"". Maybe I expected too much. But it wasn't that great.

I'll assume that it takes place in the future. But when they arrive on another planet, they walk perfectly. No, uh uh, that's never going to happen. Not unless the suits they were wearing were super suits. And where did the robot thing come from? Did anyone expect that to happen?The alien itself only appears like in 15 minutes of the movie. Sigourny does kick ass. I admit this was a creepy movie. But not scary. Not ""OH MY GOD! AHH!"" scary. It's like ""Oh, wow. OK. Ooh.""Maybe I need to give the movie another chance. I just wish they didn't say in the trailer ""The scariest movie ever made"". Because I will point out more than half of the movie that could've been better.As of the acting, good job to the cast. Great setting. And it was fun to watch. But there were just too many questions: 1.) the gravity thing(i mentioned) 2.) they've mastered gravity, but there are no lights on the ship? 3.) there is water leakage in the ship? you'd think they'd be careful 4.) was there any point to the cat?I can go on and on.

Classic Alien Movie,"This is definitely a classic horror movie ever. The story itself is done really well and is interesting with a crew discovered an alien species that they found. It builds up really well with introducing the characters and the reveal of the alien creature. The movie feels like a haunted house in outer space with its isolated environment and the atmosphere tone that the movie presented here that is really effective. It is also pretty creepy to be in outer space with a creature inside the same environment of you, and there is no way out. I found the movie to be suspenseful and creepy when the alien shows up and how it poses a deadly threat towards the characters. And the climax itself is suspenseful and intense. Ellen Ripley is a warrant officer and is one of the most popular final girls in any horror movie out there. I really like the character on how she is pretty smart throughout the movie and is brave enough to survive against the creature. She is a really memorable character with her personality and performance by Sigourney Weaver, who does an amazing job as the character. The other characters are also done really well by each of their personality and traits throughout the movie. Also, Ash has an interesting twist to him that is interesting and unique. And the actors do a great job in this movie. I found the special effects to be done really well in this movie. I love the alien creature design in the movie with its interesting design and how terrifying the creature is. It contains pretty good details onto it and is a memorable villain throughout the movie. The chest bursting scene is really memorable on how they did the effects of it and how it's unexpected on the execution of it.

It's about as good as an 'origin story' gets.,"Well, I would have thought this movie to have been far better than what it was.Perhaps I've been spoiled by the special effects that litter modern day films of the same nature, but I wasn't buyin' the guy crawling around in an 'alien' costume one bit.Many people hail Ridly Scott for his directing talents, I on the other hand find that he is a little bit over-rated. Don't get me wrong, he does a fantastic job with all that he does, but he doesn't seem to push the envelope; he does as is expected to get the job done, but not too much else.That being said, Alien was probably the hardest film to do out of the entire franchise, origin stories always are. Aside from this film, I have only watched the second installment before writing this review so as not to taint my views too much.I think the best thing about 'Alien' is that it left a lot of room to expand and improve.So on the final report I may say that do to the dry and almost pointless dialog at times and the poor attempts at astonishing us with lots of flashing buttons, as well as 'satisfactory' direction I would give this 5 out of 10 only to add another point for a total of 6 because without this film we may not have seen 'Aliens' or the others to follow.It's worth watching, especially to study the development of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Dull dull dull,"Got to go against everyone here, but another outdated Scott film which left me bored.It took too long to get going, was very cliched but worst of all had no character to warm to at all. Infact it was probably a collection of every type of negative characteristic in people somewhere in someone in this film.A good ten minutes of this film is wasted on not one but two scenes of people searching for a cat. After the tedium of that the attempts to scare was usually in the form of a big bang.Weaver's hardly in it until the last half hour & when she is she comes across as an unconvincing hero(ine). There's little charcter development with her or anyone.As my concentration wained things became a little confusing. I must've missed the explanation of why there was cat on the ship, or what went on at the end with the 5 minute count down to override the ship (when she was trying to escape). Despite all the ammunition there was a amazing lack of enthusiasm to use the gun & on an alien who we never really got to see that clearly.I enjoyed 'Sphere' of all films as I got into the plot and could play along with the mystery, so thought I'd give this a go as it was recommended by more than one correspondant. Unfortunately, not only was there no real suspense or horror in this. There was nothing to entice the viewer to engross themselves in the plot.3/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Space and Horror my favorite,The concept of Space and Horror truly belong together. Alien makes this the case with no way to escape. Sigourney Weaver and the cast do a remarkable job. Alien feels authentic realistic that this could happen in the near future with space travel. It builds great suspense and you dont know when the Alien will show up. The movie has several good surprises. Also many great scenes (especially since it was part of the recent defunct WDW ride).

A Masterclass in Tension and Atmosphere,"Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) is not just a sci-fi film-it's a masterclass in tension, atmosphere, and horror. From the very beginning, it lures you into a hauntingly desolate world. The film's pacing is deliberate & slow, unraveling a growing sense of suspense or dread as the crew confronts the creature.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is iconic-she emerges as a symbol of strength, intelligence, and survival in a time when strong female protagonists were rare. The entire cast, including John Hurt and Ian Holm, contributes to the claustrophobic, paranoid dynamic that defines the movie.The production design by H. R. Giger is a work of art. The alien itself is a terrifying creation-its sleek, bio-mechanical form brings the perfect mix of beauty and nightmare fuel. The minimalistic score and use of sound are brilliantly unsettling, turning silence into a weapon that heightens suspense.Despite being over 40 years old, Alien has aged remarkably well. It's a testament to practical effects, storytelling, and the enduring power of fear. Unlike many modern sci-fi films that rely heavily on spectacle, Alien excels at the slow burn. It keeps you on edge, never showing too much, but making you feel the creeping terror just around the corner.Alien isn't just a movie-it's an experience. A blend of horror, sci-fi, and thriller, it remains one of the greatest films in cinematic history. A must-watch for any fan of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Almost a perfect film.,"I watched it again last night and I recall how I felt on the first watching at the cinema. The theatrical release imho is better than the director's cut. In the theatrical version we did not see the alien in it's entirety until the very end scenes. And therein lies part of the film's appeal. The fear of the unknown.What begins as a mayday waking up a sleeping haulage crew, turns into a monstrous event that awakens fears in all of us. In a slow build horror builds on horror, and then the deaths start.The entire film used no CGI, just standard special effects although you only see them 2-3 times in the whole film.The entire cast burned the nature of each character into the memory, and simply by great acting, great storyline and dialogue, and superlative direction.Unlike most modern films with ""Just a bit more excess"" CGI, and blaring music throughout, this film relies on the story and the people telling it.It's hard to believe it's over 40 years since I first watched this, and I sat transfixed for the last 2 hours watching it again for the umpteenth time, . And still it's a masterpiece.Aliens tomorrow to top off the treat.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Cinematic masterpiece!,"What can be written/said about a masterpiece that hasn´t been written or said before? Not much, I suppose, but I just have to get it out of my system.""ALIEN"" is a masterpiece in the art of movie making - period! It is as classic as it is legendary. Those who think otherwise, I´m sorry but you are a lost cause.
I cannot praise this film enough. You could say that I am obsessed with it - it is that great.This is what you can achive when you have top notch talent in every department: Writing, directing, editing, scenery, art department, special effects, music, acting, et cetera..et cetera. As opposed of today, when totalitarian and political correctness handcuffs creativity. It´s not a coincidence that I personally detest most films coming out The System (Hollywood) today.It´s no meaning going through the storyline once again, since I´m pretty confident that those here on IMDB that read this thread knows the story over and over. Instead I want to give credit where credit is due.First of all we must go down on our knees and thank God for Dan O'Bannon, Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger, for being the three principal people responsible for bringing ""ALIEN"" to life. Especially O'Bannon, whom without there would be no movie in the first place. It´s a pity that he (outside the hardcore fan-base) hasn´t been given more attention than he has. Think; if ""Dark Star"" had been a (moderate) success, maybe ""ALIEN"" would never had seen the light of day.....
Ridley Scott, what can I say? The man is (was?) the best visual director in the business, bar none. Only Kubrick can compete with him, in that department.
It may be O'Bannon's idea, but Ridley Scott brought that idea to life. Just imagine any other director making ""ALIEN""? Impossible! Every single shot and every single frame is a work of beauty and art. The composition of every scene is so beautiful and shines with a touch of class that - with a few exceptions (Tarantino?) - isn´t often seen today. True genius!
Last but not least, the utmost praise most go to Hans Rudi Giger. He brought something horrifying and yet beautiful to the screen that audiences hadn't seen up til then and hasn't seen since. LV-426 and it´s inhabitants is all thanks to him (minus the chestburster and - in part - the facehugger). A masterstroke by Scott and O'Bannon to insist on getting him onboard. His biomechanial art is out of this world!Kudos to each and everyone; all of the actors who are perfectly cast; the art department; sound editing; special effects (that are astounding); Brandywine (for agreeing to produce it) and to Alan Ladd jr. who greenlighted it (being the head of 20th Century Fox, at the time). Jerry Goldsmith put the icing on the cake with his eerie, evocative, haunting and yet beautiful score (even though Scott and Terry Rawlings (the sound editor) played copy and paste with it, plus incorporating the music from ""Freud"" in places).This is a great, great film. A cinematic achievement that I can watch over, over and over again. If nothing else for the framing of the picture and the visuals. I love this film.By the way, did how mention how utterly scary and horrifying it is?...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
a striking film,"Alien is certainly one of the most striking and influential sci-fi films of all time, after all, the feature film released in 1979 serves as inspiration for several current films and series. Undoubtedly one of the things that stand out the most in the film is its simply incredible practical effects, the film was released over 40 years ago and even today they are incredible, and of course, the film would be nothing but Ridley Scott's direction that unlike many films at the time, the director prefers to leave a mystery around the creature, which really reveals itself only at the end of the film.
In my opinion, the only reason this film is not perfect is that it has at least 4 or 5 minutes more than it should have, there is a scene at the end of the film that would be perfect if it ended there, but instead the film he decides to continue with one more threat, which he resolves until quickly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
In space no one can hear you scream,"* * * * * (5 out of 5)AlienDirected by : Ridley Scott, 1979Claustrophobic and effective horror favorite; still a shot in the arm to the whole genre.Alien is a scary watch for even the most convinced horror fanatic. Standard 1950s formula (with touches of Kubrick`s 2001), but done with such flair and vision that it became an instant classic.Sigourney Weaver delivers a top performance, as does John Hurt and Tom Skerritt, but the real winner is director and designer Ridley Scott who creates an environment so compelling and spellbinding it would not only spawn three sequels but be considered an institution to this very day.The alien design was created by artist H.R. Giger and is legendary by itself.Note : The art direction, cinematography and sound editing was revolutionary, as was the camera angles and barren and bleak vision of the future. Must remember to mention that the movie boldly had a woman as the main character, another plus for this genre that only added to Alien's credibility. The movie also went against mainstream as lead characters were randomly killed, and this naturally only adding to the suspense (a technique later copied in such diverse thrillers as Shoot To Kill, 1988, and Deep Blue Sea, 1999).",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Horror done right,"An excellent film, that tells the story of a crew stuck in space with a creature out to kill them.

Alien is pretty good,"With a lot of older movies I find myself a little bored and sometimes having to skip segments, alien is nothing like that, it's action packed, a little scary and really fun, it's a really solid movie and it definitely deserves the franchise it has and still continues to entertain and astound people after being out for over 30 years. Once again this movie is great for people who love action and it is worth much praise and a spot on the movie's wall of fame, and it will take its place as a great movie and still worth talking about, it's a pleasure to think about and enjoy, the first time I watched it I thought Ellen Ripley was a man she is very masculine.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"""I admire it's purity""","I don't watch this film very often but when I do I'm always struck by how much younger Sigourney Weaver keeps on getting.Like most modern science fiction movies the plot is recycled from a low budget potboiler of the fifties, in this particular case 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space'. While like 'Planet of the Vampires' the film is a triumph of production design, and the presence of a strong female protagonist is to be commended - although Jonesy the cat naturally keeps well away when confronted by an adversary bigger than he is - and the script provides the most plausible name for a non-existent chemical by calling the fluid the face-hugger (SLIGHT SPOILER COMING:) bleeds ""molecular acid"".But it set an unfortunate precedent by making the alien so revoltingly ugly, as it always was in the film's endless imitations. Since Ash was so in awe of it's perfection why couldn't it have had the sleekness and elegance of a shark, which would have also better complimented Jerry Goldsmith's score?",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A classic sci fi horror that stands the test of time.,"This movie is still as creepy as it was the first time I watched it. I am usually not a horror fan but I can't help myself when it comes to sci fi.The premise is pretty simple. Good guys land on an alien planet where they pick up the villain of the movie. The good guys put in work towards doing what good guys do to bad guys. The execution of this really simple plot is where this movie shines.Most of it takes place on a giant spaceship but the ship feels empty and dark and has a million places for a bad guy to hide so the tension is high. Even during the big showdown it still feels like everything is slow and drawn out to really build tension.I can't think of anything I don't like about this movie, other than the horror of it kind of sticks with you but would totally recommend to anyone who likes horror or sci fi.

A classic movie,"Perfect setting! The dilapidated cabin, the dirty space, the Philistine crew, everything broke the impression of the pure universe in people's mind.

The Real Antagonist of Alien isn't the Xenomorph,"If you go around and ask people what makes this movie so great, most people are going to tell you it's the titular alien, and while I think that everything about the Xenomorph is done perfectly, I would never say that the Alien is the main point of the movie, or even that the Alien is the true antagonist of this film.People say that this movie supposedly created the sci-fi/horror subgenera but that isn't really true at all. The 1950s were full of horror movies predicated on science, and a lot of them even involved aliens. The reason this movie felt like a whole new experience lies in the way this movie focused itself. Every monster movie up to this point was completely centered on a single creature which was the sole antagonistic force of the movie they existed in. The suspense orbits only around one entity and as soon as aforementioned entity is defeated, the status quo of the movie is restored. If you ask me, that's why none of these movies ever got sequels or any lasting legacy. ""Alien"" is such a good movie because it doesn't follow this trend.Imagine a universe where this movie did not have Ash in it, imagine a universe where this movie did not have MU/TH/UR in it either. The new synapsis of this film is that a crew accidentally finds a planet and accidentally takes an alien on board where the alien kills everyone except Ripley who than kills the alien. The problem with this movie is that the suspense is killed when the antagonist is. You might think that this is a good thing, but interestingly enough, it kind of ruins the movie. If a movie goes from good to bad to good again, it means there are no lasting implications. This movie has a lot of lasting implications. Even as the credits role, you are forced to come to terms with the truth that a bunch of higher-ups in society down on earth purposefully sent a group of astronauts to a planet where they knew a dangerous alien was, purposefully let the alien on board, purposefully let the alien incubate inside one of them and purposefully let the alien kill everyone in the ship. The most terrifying thing about the movie is this idea: that somehow the pursuit of science can justify the deaths of an entire group of people.That's the reason that MU/TH/UR counting down to the explosion is so terrifying and that's also why Ash is so menacing. Ash and the ship exist as reminders to the characters that their lives don't mean anything to the people that sent them. And just like MU/TH/UR and Ash are manifestations of this larger antagonistic force, I would say that the Xenomorph is also. Notice how the Xenomorph requires the death of an individual to exist in the first place, and also notice how the Xenomorph grows as our characters get closer and closer to the truth. It starts small, as the characters regard it as a strange dumb animal, but as they realize that to the rest of the world, this alien is more valuable than their collective lives, it grows larger and larger.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A bit disappointing...,"I watched Alien for the first time recently, and I was really excited! I've heard countless times that it's a ""must-see"" and a ""classic"", and while I agree with that to an extent, I was kind of disappointed.A lot of Alien is watching the ship flying slowly across the screen while members of the crew press buttons. It's a really slow movie, and while this does help build suspense, it also makes it a bit of a chore to sit through.There are enjoyable moments though; the chestburster scene is especially great, and so are most scenes with the alien.When this movie came out in 1979, it included some of the most brutal things you could watch in a film. However, I don't think it holds up particularly well today. I wasn't scared at all, which is supposed to be the aim of the film.Overall, Alien isn't for me. I admit that it's a classic, and it changed cinema, so for that I respect it, but I can't see myself rewatching it any time soon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Of course we can't leave out the monster, who is very menacing and a lot to deal with.

"For those in love with Space, Terror and Cats","In a seemingly abandoned spaceship, the silence is interrupted by an incoming signal. An automatic program wakes the crew up from hibernation. Disoriented, they assume they're close to home: earth. But no, they're still only halfway there. The signal that was picked up by the ship comes from an unknown origin on an unknown planet and they, the unprepared crew of a simple cargo ship, must go out to investigate. And nothing can prepare them for what they will encounter...This slow burn horror masterpiece gives you the chills, even today, and will keep doing it for years to come. It works because of the practical effects, because of the brilliant directing because of the acting, because of the music, because of the set pieces... should I continue?The futuristic universe 'Alien' takes place in is put before us and is compellingly realistic. With several winks at Kubric's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) in the design of the ship and the momentary hint of classical music, it creates a sense of familiarity, yet in the ships' largely industrial-gothic appearance it puts us on guard as well. Their technology is being explained, but only when the characters absolutely need to mention it. The rest stays unsaid, but is made clear by other aspects of the movie than dialogue.If that alone is not enough to prove that Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius, we'll talk a bit more about him. He delivered his vision of a movie that's 'Jaws in space' the way he wanted it and the way we needed it. Scott makes movies the way no one has ever seen one: visually renewing, with a whole new believable world to tell a story in (also take a look at 'Blade Runner' (1982), 'Gladiator' (2000), 'The Martian' (2017) ...). This one in particular is one of my favourites in terms of style.Take the design of the hostile Alien creature (the Xenomorph). When shown the work of Swiss artist H. G. Giger by screenwriter O'Bannon, he saw the potential it possessed and had Giger design the creature. The result is as terrifying as it is artful. Appearing as vaguely human, but out of this world in all its aspects.The characters in the first drafts of the script were unisex and could be filled in by both men and women. The studio bosses, all white old males at the time, off course demanded the leading role to be an man. But, Scott said no. In his vision, the main character was a woman, simple as that. And let's be honest, without Sigourney Weaver, this movie would never have been as good as it is. She (the whole cast to be honest, but especially her) had me gasping for breath again and again. Her panic and determination are compelling.All this, and the way he ingeniously builds scenes where the tension gets unbearable and the way he added and cut scenes in order to tell the full story without interrupting the flow of the film, prove that he is one heck of a film maker.This is also a feminist movie, although many will argue that it was never intended to be. But the result is a feminist movie nonetheless. Not only is the main character a woman, outstandingly brought to life by Sigourney Weaver, the underlying themes of the movie are feminist as well. Because actually, this is a movie about rape. And here, it's not only the women that can fear unwanted penetration, but also the men. This rape-theme, executed by the so-called 'Face-Huggers', is unsettling for all viewers. Also notice the phallus-like design of the Alien creatures.The tension is guided by the subtle score of Jerry Goldsmith. The panting flutes, the wailing violins, the assaulting brass section and the beautiful main theme. It is a composition that is unmatched in the horror genre. And where modern scores for scary movies, mean nothing more than a scary addition to the film, this modernist score truly tells a story on its own.'Alien' is, all snobbish intellectual analyses put aside, in the first place one of the best horror films ever made. It gives everyone the creeps, it lingers and it's pure art. And come on: there is a cat! How can you not like this movie? But what makes it truly great, is the fact that when you look a bit closer, there's more to it than meets the eye at first.And remember, if you ever get to journey through our solar system or beyond...

As perfect as any film can be,"Ridley Scott's Alien was not just a seminal science fiction horror film which redefined the genre, it was also a landmark film for female leads in horror/sci-fi and one of the finest examples of combining two genres (in this case science fiction and horror) to create a masterpiece. Written by Dan O Bannon, expertly directed by Scott (in what was then his 2nd film only) and utilizing the works of great artisan craftsman like H.R Giger and Ron Cobb Alien is a masterpiece of most facets of filmmaking. The actors are all incredibly good in their respective roles of space grunts, but 29-year-old Sigourney Weaver shines the most. Alien is 40 years old (!!!) and yet it is as timeless as if it were made last year. The sets and creature design look fantastic as does the pacing which only reinforces the belief that a good film doesn't have to be swiftly paced.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Ripley's a perfect horror heroine here.,"The main reason that makes this a great movie for me is that is totally focused on the alien story, makes you feel their desperation from being alone with that thing in outer space all through the film, there's no rest for anything else. Plus the effects (for instance, Ash's scene) are great for 1979. But Ripley steals the show, played brilliantly by Sigourney Weaver, here's a character I can feel totally identified with. She reflects my ideal concept of a woman heroine in this movie. Her look, expressions, every move is perfect. None of that happens on Cameron's sequel, when they added a little girl so we can cheer for her and cry, I assume, which I didn't, and Ripley is turned into a sentimental Rambo with big weapons, losing all the enigmatic charm I loved so much here. This is the best movie Ridley Scott has ever made, even when the last scene could have been better for my taste, and surpasses by far Cameron's ""Aliens"", which is just a very dumb version of Terminator. I highly recommend Alien as a sci-fi horror, along with John Carpenter's The Thing. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Hope FX do a great show with Alien,I watched this after they announced a show from FX in the Disney investor presentation. I am very impressed with the production/set quality in this movie. The plot is good but I hope in future movies they discover more about this alien universe with an origin story. Cinematography is mostly focused on reactions to facial expressions so many closeups shots and actors done amazing jobs too. The visual effects in this movie are great for 1979 very impressive. I will watch this franchise completely. Are you planning to watch classic horror / Sci-fi this is the one.,9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Influential.,"""Alien"" is Ridley Scott's first great feature film, and could probably be his magnum opus if not for ""Blade Runner"", which is the other masterwork of his. Honestly, I cannot be sure if he belongs to the pantheon of great filmmakers or not. He spearheaded near-perfect pictures in his earlier days, but his later works like ""The Counselor"" and ""Exodus: Gods and kings"" are near forgettable. ""Body of Lies"" and ""Robin Hood"" are not very well received either, and Oscar winning ""Gladiator"" is overrated.Undoubtedly ""Alien"" is so influential. It spawned three sequels and one indirect prequel thus far, for which they were helmed by three different film directors except ""Prometheus"", which is also directed by Ridley. Its influence stretched even further when it got expanded into video games and even comics. Thus this inevitably made Ridley to be one of the most respected filmmaker in Hollywood of his times. His success is more to be evident in ""Blade Runner"".""Alien"" is the story of a group of ordinary workers who went missing in the stars. The spacecraft 'Nostromo' is on its way back to Earth when it receives a transmission from a nearby planetoid. Obeying the protocol set by the company, the crew agree to land the ship to inspect on the source. They go out to locate the signal, but to only later realize that they bring back something with them to the ship that would decimate the whole crew.Although Ridley is so-called the leader of the project, it was scriptwriters Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett the ones initiated it. Everything we see in the story, is theirs. ""Alien"" got inspirations from classic sci-fi movies like ""The Thing from Another World"" and ""Forbidden Planet"", despite it being an 'original' story. The product is like when different ideas from different sources assimilated and converted into an ultimate masterpiece. Ridley skillfully visualized the ideas, but ""Alien"" will never happen without the duo.From the horrors to the romanticism of its opening, the film is so grasped of perfection. One of the keys to the film's critical success is its pacing. It seemed to be like a kind of slow-burn horror, which slowly but exceptionally captured the details of the movie; like its filmmaking and narrative thrust that all together built-up in favour of for coherence.It was a smart move for Ridley to not shoot the monster fully on camera, and this helped to preserve the authentic look of the character (Xenomorph). If more physical parts of the monster be brought upon to audiences, then flaws of the design of it can be left not concealed. On the other hand, the sets of the spaceship and planetoid were all well-designed. Ridley's direction furthermore helped to leverage its aesthetic appeal.The superb collaboration of Ridley, its writers, the composer of musical score, designers and crews had made ""Alien"" to be the atmospheric, masterful timeless sci-fi horror. ""Alien"" could easily be a mediocre B movie, but Ridley's brilliant direction turned it into one of the greatest films instead. Who would have had expected that a script not so intricate can be converted into a piece that will stay relevant for decades to come? The feat here is rarely being felt and I doubt that it will happen again. I am so sure that as long as cinema is culturally still important to us, ""Alien"" will never be forgotten.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of The Best Movies of All Time,"This movie was made in 1979, almost half a century ago, and it was so ahead of this time, and still is terrifying.Back when the movie was made, CGI was practically nonexistent, and some scenes still hold up and overpass multiple movies up to this day. The special effects are insane for it's time, and able to compete to modern day movies.The atmosphere is insane, and it is chilling after half a century. The story is full of suspense, the direction of the movie is insane and the music is incredible.

One of the all-time greats,"'Alien' (1979) is one of the greatest classics of scientific fiction, and is always indicated for those looking for a masterpiece. Alien is the result of an original concept, a great script, a great direction, the charisma of intelligent characters and one of the best plays of history and cinematic language that I have ever seen.The original soundtrack is incredible. It is grand, existentialist, played in the right moments and gives the film a more frightening tone. It exactly matches the villain Alien, who barely appears, but when he does, it scares anyone. Only the look of it already does that, the way he acts makes science fiction a horror movie.Cinematography? Flawless. Scott's direction made one of the most immersed films I've ever seen (It's just not more immersed than Blade Runner, which by the way is also his). It seems he takes care of everything. The film takes place almost entirely in a spaceship, and it looks like a real spaceship, and that we are in the real future. I can't find so many words to explain it, but it is truly surreal. Those initial scenes of the ship, the scene where they first find the egg, I thought I was seeing 2001. The scenes where the camera revolves around the places, that scene where the camera rotates to show the characters, those sequential shots. .. one of the best done directions i've ever seen. The only thing I didn't think was so good were some action scenes that the camera seemed to be ""out of place"", if I were to talk it would give a spoiler. Not to mention the infamous alien scene coming out of the guy's belly.The story is very good. The characters are not stupid clogs that make stupid decisions, on the contrary: They are interesting and well designed and not stereotyped, I ended up caring for them.Alien is an experience that is not just a story of et, it is the appreciation of art, good ideas (and that become iconic) A result of an excellent mix of technical aspects and a great cast of actors who make great characters and a villain unforgettable. That shows Ridley Scott is a genius, that cinematographic experiences are not just about technique and how ""Alien"" is definitely one of the best films ever made in history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A film I associate with pure fear being experienced when I was 12 years old..........thank you Dad.,"When a film has made a significant impact it leaves a mark. I remember where I was, who I was with and how I felt when I first digested Ridley Scotts masterpiece and is a film I routinely return to.Alien was reportedly pitched as 'Jaws in space' and follows a rag tag and often disgruntled crew as they are rudely awakened from cryo-sleep to answer a mysterious distress call down on the unknown planet LV-426. Needless to say, things don't go according to plan.Alien is an exceptionally well crafted, slow burning sci-fi horror that still manages to shock and keep you on the edge of your seat today. The creature design by Giger is still horrifying and the subtle lore that is established serves to build intrigue without detracting from the main 'problem' the crew are facing. Little did 12 year old me know that these questions would be explored in the later made 'Prometheus'.Notable mentions should go to Jerry Goldsmiths score who's eerily sweeping horns and strings have become synonymous with getting stalked by a xenomorph and to Ian Holm who turns in an excellent performance playing 'Ash' the ships science officer.Although a slow burner to start (the action doesn't really kick off until the hour mark), the atmosphere and the journey you are taken on is worth the investment. This is Ridley Scott on top form and he has arguably rarely been better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Horror Delight,"This movie was definitely above your average sci-fi horror movie. It's not just a horror film where the crew of Nostromo is being hunted by an alien just because it just happens to be there. The introduction of the Alien feels organic and serves a reason.Alien delivers its scare through thoughtfully crafted environments, that are not just beautiful but sometimes nightmarish, and shots that keeps you at the edge of your seat. The Alien not just some scary being because it is strong, but because it is smart and menacing. Although the movie does employ some cheap jumpscares from time to time, it was definitely not overused. Additionally, some of its gore scenes are shot at odd angles making it quite difficult to see what goes on in the screen, although I believe this is mostly due to constraints for relying on mostly practical effects.Characters in the movie are well written and doesn't treat the audience as stupid. The actions they take make sense. Rather than their fate being tied to how stupid they are, their life depends on how they can outsmart or be outsmarted by the Alien.Nonetheless, the movie serves a provoking and thoughtful take on horror, something that many horror directors of the current age should take in to account. Definitely deserves to be a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Classic Sci-Fi Masterpiece,"A Sci-Fi Thriller Classic with intense moments!Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) stands as a towering achievement in the sci-fi horror genre, masterfully blending elements of both genres to deliver an experience that remains unparalleled. This film is not just a classic; it's a meticulously crafted, heart-pounding thriller that has influenced countless films and directors in its wake.The plot is deceptively simple yet incredibly effective: the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo, en route home, encounters an alien life form that systematically picks them off one by one. The film excels in its ability to create an atmosphere of dread and suspense, which is, in no small part, thanks to its brilliant screenplay and Scott's precise direction. The narrative's pacing is perfectly tuned, gradually building tension while keeping the audience on edge throughout its runtime.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ellen Ripley is nothing short of iconic. Ripley is not your typical action hero; she's a character of depth, resilience, and intelligence, breaking away from the often one-dimensional roles afforded to women in genre films of the time. Weaver's performance, along with her strong screen presence, makes Ripley a character who endures long after the credits roll. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, deliver strong performances that add to the film's depth and realism.The film's design elements are where Alien truly shines. H. R. Giger's design for the alien creature is both haunting and awe-inspiring. The alien's biomechanical aesthetics contribute to a palpable sense of otherworldly menace that is both disturbing and fascinating. The ship itself, with its claustrophobic, industrial look, adds to the tension and makes every scene feel like a confined battleground. Giger's work, combined with the film's atmospheric lighting and sound design, creates a setting where the fear of the unknown is as palpable as the fear of the alien.One of Alien's most significant achievements is its ability to maintain a gripping tension without relying heavily on overt violence or gore. The film's horror derives from the unknown, the unseen, and the slow, inevitable sense of dread that permeates every scene. This restraint in showing the monster directly enhances the impact of its reveal and reinforces the psychological terror that drives the narrative. The creature's few on-screen appearances are used sparingly but effectively, each moment intensifying the suspense.Additionally, Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score is integral to the film's atmosphere. The music complements the visual and narrative elements, amplifying the sense of isolation and impending doom. The score's minimalistic yet powerful composition enhances the film's chilling ambiance and keeps the viewer in a state of unease.While Alien is a masterpiece in many respects, it's not without its minor flaws. The film's slow pacing, particularly in the first half, might not cater to all viewers, especially those accustomed to faster-paced modern films. However, this deliberate pacing is part of what makes the film so effective, allowing the suspense to build naturally and the characters to be fleshed out before the horror unfolds.In conclusion, Alien remains a landmark in the sci-fi horror genre, offering a perfect blend of tension, atmosphere, and memorable performances. Ridley Scott's direction, combined with the contributions of a talented cast and crew, ensures that the film continues to be a compelling and influential work. It's a film that rewards patience and attention, making every moment of suspense and horror count. For those who appreciate the art of filmmaking and storytelling, Alien is a must-see, and its place in cinematic history is well-earned.Pros: Masterful direction, iconic creature design, strong performances, haunting score, atmospheric tension.Cons: Slow pacing may not suit all tastes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

In space stories can run out of steam,"""Alien"" is Ridley Scott's acclaimed horror science-fiction film about a killer alien on a spaceship. It features excellent special effects and scenes and a clever use of lighting techniques. Sigourney Weaver is strong as the film's lead and Ian Holm is memorable as the ship's science officer. John Hurt is also in the film as the ship's executive officer, but is underutilized in the role.Where ""Alien"" suffers is in its story or more appropriately its lack of. Characterization in the film is limited and there is only one interesting twist in the plot, which was enjoyable, but represented only a small part in the film. The story is quite run-of-the-mill and barely developed beyond the fact that there is an alien bent on indiscriminately killing members of the ship's crew. The lack of story development made ""Alien"" seem long and mostly tedious.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Did you know Weaver's part was written for a guy?,"Thank God they gave it to her though.

Alien set off a chain of so many sci-fi adventure/horror films that it truly did revolutionize the industry. The costumes are absolutely amazing too. Also, I feel like part of the reason Weaver's Ellen Ripley stands the test of time is because it wasn't originally written as some '70s stereotype of a woman by a man, and so when watching it today, it feels far more modern than maybe it otherwise would have.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The setting is as frightening as the monster,"Alien is about a crew of seven truckers delivering materials to Earth, they're awoken out of cryo sleep (freezing chambers) early by a transmission. Contractually required to investigate it, they touch down on the barren planet it originated from, only to head back inside when one of their tag-alongs gets a mysterious organism attached to him. Tragedy ensues from there.I can't justify how well Alien has aged. There is nothing dated about it. It looks great, the sets of the trucker and alien ship are on par with Star Wars, the alien (for how much of it you see) and eggs look authentic and detailed, the matte paintings, even the intricacies like the ship's functions are effective, which plays into how the movie handles its suspense. Alien sets itself in a way where you're as creeped out by the ENVIRONMENT as much as the monster itself. This is a massive sentient ship filled with dark corridors and dimly lit rooms, and you only see the alien in bits. It puts you on edge. It isn't a gore heavy movie, either. Outside the first kill there's practically no blood. The first kill is graphic to a level it sticks in your mind, then every other death is left up to the imagination, relying on external factors like sound and camera work.Alien is solid. I can't give it a perfect score, tho, as it takes a little too long to move in the beginning, there isn't really any meaningful message to it, and the characters, though good enough to care about, aren't that developed, but that's fine, they just have to be relatable. This is a straight haunted house movie in space with a plot twist and does that perfectly, an example of camera work, timing, and sound. When you finish, you wonder what could exist in space.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Still a masterpiece 40 years later!,"I watched this masterpiece for the first time in 2021 and I was left in awe as the credits rolled. I absolutely loved this film, despite it being released almost 4 decades ago! The acting holds up wonderfully and everyone does an absolutely amazing job, the cinematography was beautiful even by todays standards and the sound design and music was scary, but beautiful and really helped build a certain atmosphere and a sense of complete isolation, which is where the movie shines. You feel trapped with the crew knowing that around the next corner It could be waiting for its next pray, this feeling is what makes Alien such a nail biting, edge of your seat experience.There are a few things that were of course held back by the technology of its time, but these are just extremely small nit picks that doesn't come close to ruining the movie in the slightest. There were a few times where the sound effects or visual effects really put me off, but these scenes only lasting for a couple of minutes. The creature it self and the environments look amazing and even better than I could have hoped for. Everything felt real and the alien looked even more terrifying and realistic than I thought It would. This sparked a franchise and while some of the further installments were great and some of them not so much. Nothing can touch the throne that the original Alien movie has been sitting on for so long. This is still a thrilling and nail biting adventure, that will leave you at the edge of your seat many years later. This is truly a timeless masterpiece.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
an unfinished idea,"I think this is a classic SF flick but that doesn't mean there wasn't room to explore more of what the alien was, as opposed to seeing it rip humans in half type of thing. I think the film is a bit too gory. By further exploration of the alien entity, I mean that nowhere in the film does anyone suggest that what they are seeing is an alien human hybrid. The fact that the alien is found on a derelict vessel, piloted by another type of alien begs the question that if a species had such advanced technology the chances of it being retrieved would be fairly high, so it probably would not even be there, unless the whole thing was a deliberate set up. The idea of the find being a deliberate set up are also never explored by the film maker. We now have many extra solar planets listed in technical books on space. Many of these planets exist in what is called habitation belts. The idea of suggesting where the apparently violent alien hybrid came from is not explored nor is the possible home planet of the alien vessel explored. The idea of extra solar planets is not new. Also the fact the alien that became a alien human hybrid did so after being in a gestation phase for perhaps as long as a million years. That suggest profound cell damages in any extant organism. That idea was not explored. Lots of tension, but I would call it surface tension, as the real deal is the real deal of thinking about what it all means. Well, that is just my opinion. It is an effective film, but perhaps it claims to be thinking mans SF, which it isn't.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"""In space no-one can..."" etc.","The originator of the Alien film franchise has aged well for a science fiction horror tale.

The opening is as impressively artistic as it is, regrettably, boring. The cast minus Ian Holm and Sigorney Weaver all lack the much needed element of personality and Scott's loose directorial approach makes the dialogue sound really indifferent. The intensity does begin to pick up after the first act but at no point do the actors really stand out in my view.

Only watch to understand lore.,"Alien was a disappointing movie. I remember watching it as a kid and liking it, but as with Jurassic Park I watched a week ago it was all nostalgia.The movie isn't terrible and I'm taking into account the 1979 release window. But that being said I felt it was all very... Meh.The story is semi-intresting but isn't great. I think the best way to describe it would be it's good, Just good.The action (even for a 1979 flick) was mediocre. It wasn't terrible but for what it is trying to be i.e a horror movie it was lackluster at the best of times.One jumpscare was all that scared me throughout this movie and although I love watching horror at times, I'm a little baby when it comes to being easily scared. But this movie was terrible at scaring even a hair on my skin. The only time I felt any sort of fear was the aforementioned jumpscare that was a cheap jump (like most horror movies do). The atmosphere wasn't captured great, the scary situation wasn't captured well and the Xenomorph... well. The main creature (Alien/Xenomorph) wasn't scary in the least. After playing games like Alien Isolation and knowing what this creature can do in universe I was upset that this is what kick-started the franchise.Cast - 5/10Action - 2.5/10Story - 4/10Horror - 2/10Overall a pretty poor movie that can be summed up by nostalgia.

Surprisingly Amazing!,"I have heard amazing things about this movie, so I finally gave it a watch. I originally thought it was going to be just ok and overrated, but boy was I wrong. This movie has amazing characters, practical effects, and is just an amazing thriller in general. The story is simple; there's an alien on board, so try to survive. Most of the runtime of this movie is suspenseful, and has us as an audience connect and like these characters, not just pushing them into the movie hoping that you'll like them. The actual alien is really cool to look at, especially since it's not CGI, its all practical. The directing is perfect, the characters could not be better, the alien is actually intimidating, and the acting is just amazing. Ridley Scott did a damn good job directing this movie, but there's one thing that I don't love about it, and that's SOME of the music in the beginning, but that's it.

Like all classics, to be viewed by future generations, it cannot remain in a time warp, never to be compared to the future films it inspired or spawned. As my sons watched this movie, they cringed at the special and visual effects, and matte paintings, that for our generation were indistinguishable from a real life, massive set (the artists won Oscars for these masterpiece effects). But for today's generation, the special, visual, and model effects are readily distinguishable, and effectively destroy the film's illusion. My kids could easily point out where the seams to the matte paintings were located. I hate to admit it, but this film's only failing is that it cannot stand up to the newest generation of films, that it brought about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A 1970's Landmark Horror Film!,"""In space, no one can hear you scream.""While Halloween was the sister to Psycho in slasher pictures, in 1979 director Ridley Scott made a motion picture of what it would be like to be somewhere where people wouldn't hear you screaming if you were being chase by an evil monster.""Alien"" takes place in space where a group of miners led by Dallas, played by Tom Skerritt, land on a strange colony from another planet where they think that all would be normal until they discover that a group of eggs are laid on the floor with Kane (John Hurt) attacked by a spider-like creature before being knocked out for a while. Members of the crew include Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm) and Parker (Yaphet Katto) where they want to know what kind of creature is on Kane's head before seeing a special surprise at the dinner table.Later in the film, a new monster takes place inside the spaceship where it goes after the crew members one by one leaving only a matter of time before everybody dies.""Alien"" is a landscape in horror survival where it plays like a silent motion picture where we don't know what's going to happen next.

The best horror movie ever,"Where to start? This is alien The best horror movie I've ever seen.Its not like the horror movies they make these days (full of nonsense) It may not have much blood or action, but at the moments the alien appears you really feel it, SCARY! I think this is one of the best, or the best horror creature ever created. This movie is like The godfather trilogy, and the star wars Original trilogy. IT WILL NEVER DIE! An absolutely one to watch! I would say go and watch it with your girlfriend:P it really helps. personal rating ***** out of ***** this movie is really dark that makes the movie very strong at scare moments.

Arguably the most satisfying combination of science-fiction and horror in the history of cinema,"Almost thirty years have passed since Alien made its first appearance, becoming an instant classic, opening the doors of Hollywood to director Ridley Scott and starting one of the best-known franchises to have ever graced the screen. Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.Of course, by now everyone knows what the alien looks like, but when he inadvertently started the series Scott made the wise decision of keeping it mostly unseen: the ghastly creature is almost never shown in its entirety, preferring to lurk in the shadows as the unaware human characters gradually realize what's happening. In fact, the first half-hour or so of the film is spent to introduce the protagonists and get a better understanding of their relationship, which, as in many other similarly themed movies, is tense. Justifiably, since the nine astronauts have been together on the Nostromo for a lot of time, sent on a mission in outer space by a mysterious Company. Suddenly, they receive a distress signal from a remote planet and decide to take a better look at what's going on. Within hours, they will regret it. Hopefully, the people watching this film won't.Some parts of the movie could be dismissed as clichés, but the truth is, of course, that Alien actually CREATED many of the stereotypes of recent sci-fi (crew being wiped out from within, no one out there to help them, et cetera). Plus, the film is so solid and consistently captivating it is hard to stop and think of possible leaks in the plot. As a pure exercise is suspense and horror, Alien has no rivals, Scott's clever use of lighting and camera angles ensuring the claustrophobia and tension never drop. He is also helped in this by choosing to keep the villainous creature in the dark most of the time, perfectly adhering to the old principle of ""the less you show, the better"" (something Spielberg and Carpenter applied with equal success on Jaws and Halloween). And while the characters may have been developed better in the sequels, what we have here is enough to qualify as convincing and likable, thanks mainly to a spot-on cast: Sigourney Weaver, a complete unknown at the time, is mesmerizing in the role that made her an A-lister and finally put an end to the Hollywood tradition of women being no good other than when it comes to running and screaming. The supporting cast is every bit as strong, with John Hurt (who is the unsung hero of the entire franchise's most celebrated sequence) and Ian Holm in particular adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere.Briefly, one of the Top 10 greatest science-fiction/horror (it fits equally well on either list) films ever, and, Blade Runner and Gladiator aside, the high point of Ridley Scott's career.

Classic horror,"Probably the first sci-fi/horror, and definitely the best. By limiting the number of characters, and enclosing them in a confined space, Scott hikes up the tension without having to resort to cheap thrills or buckets of gore (though the chest-bursting scene is still terrifyingly effective). Each of the characters is fairly well developed, and it's unclear at the start who will live and who will not, which also upps the suspense. The production design is really cool, and doesn't look dated at all, and the alien creature itself is quite original and still scary. Great performances too, and a good script, making this much more than just a monster flick.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"Disturbing, Oppressive, Horrific. In other words, everything I want from Horror!","Made in the late '70s, Alien became the prototype for genre films going forward. Before they relied on quick-cuts, jump-scares, and digital effects to create our ""horror"", filmmakers instead used pacing, theme, and a combination of attacks on our senses to keep us constantly dreading what may be around that next corner.The slower pacing, accentuated by longer takes and establishing shots, allowed the dread to build Because of this, the payoff was very gratifying. Some of this came from technical limitations. For example, they really couldn't show the ""alien"" in its entirety as it moved around simply because it would've looked a bit hokey. Instead, as with Jaws before it, Alien shows us glimpses, suggestions, reactions, and aftermath. When we do finally see the alien in its full glory, it is indeed glorious.The filmmakers used the oppressively dark, wet, and mechanical environments to hide the threat in plain sight, forcing the audience to feel a little bit of the helplessness felt by the characters.The director also tricked the actors into visceral, horrified reactions through sneaky and ambiguous direction coupled with extreme practical effects.The idea behind this movie could've been done in any isolated, close-quarters environment. The fact that it was an alien on a spaceship simply added to the overall feel and impact of the movie; however, it would've been nearly as effective if set in, say, an Antarctic outpost, or in a submarine, or in an abandoned research lab. Because of this, it sparked a rash of imitators in those exact scenarios (and more).Alien is a classic horror film. An icon. That said, it just may fail to have the same impact on modern audiences. The slower pacing, deliberate story beats, low-tech effects, and dialogue-heavy scenes would likely be seen as ""boring"", and might risk losing a less mature audience before the big fun even begins. This is a shame, but I doubt many younger horror fans would get as much out of this movie people did when it was first released.That said, if you want to see where this style of horror reached its zenith, look no further than the xenomorphic sci-fi body-horror of Alien.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Not Exactly a Genre Film...,"It seems that 'Alien', or the entire mythos that this film started, has a bad rep nowadays. Many people forget, with the recent 'AvP' films and whatnot, that the original 'Alien' film was a glorious piece of cinema.I've heard 'Alien' referred to as a horror film, as well as a sci-fi film. Well, I guess in its simplest form one could refer to it as a genre film. However, 'Alien' deserves much, much more than that. It's a masterpiece of suspense. A Space Opera. A terrifying force and the source of countless inspiration for films to this day.Like many ""Generation Y"" fans, I grew up on 'Alien'. I think the first time I watched it I was either 6 or 7. Although I can't pin-point the age I was, the mark it left on me was unforgettable. For better or worse, no other film would manage to rock my imagination and shock my nerves so much afterward. The direction from Scott is masterful, as well as the performances of the entire cast.What's interesting is that even though Sigourney's Ellen Ripley would become the main protagonist for the films following, this film shows no sign or bias to her character. Each actor has a chance to flourish in this film, including a curious cat named Jones and the ship itself- The Nostromo.As long as there are aspiring filmmakers intent on making thrilling and suspenseful movies, 'Alien' will always be a standard to look up at and live up to. This film is a titan, a teacher, and a masterpiece that defies all genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Good, Not Great","I saw this when it was first released, and audiences were properly impressed -- and scared. Reviewers who rate it low have seen so many science fiction / horror movies since then that they simply don't understand that in 1979 this was film groundbreaking. It was surprisingly good, highly believable, even for a big-time SF fan such as myself. Watching it in the 21st century -- esp. For the first time -- isn't going to rock your world. You've seen far more gruesome, horrifying movies, even over just the past 20 years. In any case, I did like ""Aliens"" back in 1979, but didn't consider it a great movie. Very good, but not great. I also felt that it was essentially a remake of ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space."" In 2022, I read that director Ridley Scott actually watched that movie before filming ""Aliens.""

Such a dissapointment....Just kidding!,"Yes! It was such a disapointment...That I was only 12 when this movie was released, so I never got to see it on the big screen!Alien is my all time number 1 favorite horror/sci fi & this cinematic perfection would go on, not only to produce an awesome franchise, but it also set a standard for horror/sci fi movie making for years to come. I first saw this in the early 80's on late night TV, watching it with my dad, & just 30 minutes in I had fallen head over heels in love. I loved the story, the amazing characters, the acting, the atmosphere & the beautiful music. The Nostromo appears huge but it gives us an unnerving, almost panic attack inducing sense of claustrophobia with some perfect hand held camera work by Scott himself, which makes you feel as if your actually part the crew. The story is beautifully concieved with a simplistic yet severe brilliance of mind, & the acting from all the cast was absolutely superb. This movie introduced also me to the work of Ian Holm which I still enjoy today. & we must also not forget the stunning work of the sadly late Bolaji Badejo who brought us the Alien itself. May God rest your soul sir.Alien tells the story of a deep space mining refinary ship & its crew, who are woken from hypersleep as the ship has decteted a signal from a nearby plaetoid which, at first they think it may be a distress call. The ship detaches from the main plaform & lands & it is decided a small scouting party will go out on foot to investigate. They discover a cave with thousands of eggs & Kane (John Hurt) goes into investigate further, when a hand like creature springs on a coiled tail, & attaches itself to Kane's helmet, burning through the faceplate to attach itself to his face. The three make it back to the ship only to be told they will have to quarrentine by Ripley (Weaver) however her order is countermanded by Ash (Holm) who opens the airlock & lets them & the creature onboard...I literally can not find fault with this classic, except that still, after all these years I can watch this time & again & never stop enoying it.

Alien is a perfect film in every categorie,"Warning ! SPOILER ! ATTENTION ! Alien is a fantastic film. Each scene is thoughtfully designed and beautiful. Alien shows a a bleak picture of the future and plays on a spaceship that Tons of crude oil transported . When they receive the signal , and obviously need to look into the matter , they fly closer to the Planet . The planet is dark and cold. Unlike other sci- fi Films ( like Star Wars ) here you see a planet , which is completely absorbed in the darkness, what the atmosphere even uncanny designed . Entering the planet is already the highlight of the first half hour . creepy sounds are always listening . The researchers squad is afraid ( At least a part of the crew , the other Part thinks only about profit and bonuses ) . in the background you can see the Star of the system , which has so nothing in common with our sun. it is further away and appears on the dark planet blue (still more scary ) . The camera shakes ( in the rest of the film also awesome) while looking at the alien ship. In the ship. The hallways are dark and wet. Hr Giger and the rest of the film crew have excellent Work done in the field of stage design. Really is not a reveal what they now find , just lots of alien technology . as Kane is attacked in the ""basement"" of the egg ( perfect horror scene) you can see first time the face-hugger . The closest point , which this film makes perfectly , is how the crew is responding the ""Face Hugger "". slowly trying to remove it. The idea and the design of the aliens is simply excellent. The acid, out snapping jaws and then the Chest Buster ( Schockmoment! ! ) . The scenes on the ship , so seen as the second half of the film have nothing in common with Star Wars . the Half of the courses are underexposed and narrow. Because no one knows where the Alien now infected, and which strategy it pursued , you can feel this uneasy feeling of claustrophobia. The finale brings this film satisfactory to an end and the action then remains open. For Score: Jerry Goldsmith has done a fantastic job . In my opinion according to the best of his soundtracks. With only two tones it produces so more tension as the Man of Steel in the complete movie. the Ideas are simply awesome. The action is varied and well thought out. Acting leaves nothing to be desired here . On the subject Voltage I need to say anything more surely .

One of the greatest movies of all time!!,"Now this is how a horror/monster movies should be done, all the new cgi filled rubbish that graces our screens these days are pale imitations of what is a movie of pure mystery, depth, tension, haunting imagery, horrifying score, incredible acting and a movie that is paced to perfection.The whole feel of the movie is unmatched and leaves you with a cold sense of foreboding but at the same time has you transfixed at the pure mystery of the creature that is before your eyes.The movies really is a cinematic masterpiece from start to finish. Starting with the opening credits the pace is slow but because of the masterful score by Jerry Goldsmith this only heightens the inevitable terror which is about to unfold.It's incredible what has sadly happened to the Alien saga when you look back and see that this movies attention to detail from the claustrophobic set designs, a movie score which is unequalled in my opinion, brilliant acting by the whole cast and the most disturbing alien creature design in cinematic history. The creatures mystery has been somewhat destroyed by the Hollywood mess that is Alien vs Predator!There have been many who tried to recreate the horror of Alien and have failed miserably. James Cameron did a fantastic job in creating the sequel Aliens because he knew not to try and imitate the unique atmosphere, tension and isolation created by Ridley Scott's original and produced another masterpiece in its own right.Alien works because of its simplicity, it's a haunted house movie in space but the whole concept is so original and horrifying that this is the key to the movies and saga success!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The Mother of All Horror Films,"¨It's got a wonderful defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.¨ Ridley Scott has had a great career and made several great films, but Alien, only his second film, may arguably be his best one. In my opinion this is the best horror film of all time due to the dark mood, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and several shocking scenes that continue to have an impact on the horror genre 33 years after its release. I have to admit that I just now got around watching this historic movie after having seen its prequel, Prometheus. I liked Prometheus so much that I knew I had to go back and watch the original film that got the franchise started. Despite having seen the aliens in the horrific AVP films, I still was shocked and surprised with the scenes and effects in Alien. The visual effects were excellent and it rightfully won an Oscar in that department. I can only imagine how shocking the chest bursting scene must have been for viewers in the late 70's. The scene was masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and it has to be one of the most frightening ones in horror history. It may be the highlight of the movie, but there are also several other shocking moments that make this the perfect sci-fi horror film. I loved the way they managed to build the suspense without showing too much of the alien. The setting was just perfect and the sense of claustrophobia is all over the movie. You knew that at any moment the alien could pop out of nowhere and attack once again. That sense of dread was also built thanks to the suspenseful score. Thousands of horror films have tried to copy a similar format since the release of this perfect movie without reaching the same success.The film takes place sometime in the future as a towing spaceship named Nostromo is on its way back to Earth. There are seven crew members who are in hyper-sleep and aren't expected to wake up until they get home, but unexpectedly the smart computer running the ship, known as ¨Mother, ¨ receives a signal that seems like a distress call from a nearby planet. The crew members are awaken and are informed of the situation by Mother. Despite some initial arguments over them not being a rescue team, the Captain of the vessel, Dallas (Tom Skerritt), decides to land on the planet and once there they discover a wrecked spaceship nearby. Dallas along with his assistant Kane (John Hurt) and crew member Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) get off their ship and enter the wrecked one in search for clues as to who may have sent the distress call while Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) remain on board of the Nostromo trying to fix some mechanical problems after the rough landing they experienced. Kane, Lambert and Dallas on the other hand discover the fossilized remains of the dead alien pilot on their expedition with a huge hole on his chest. Kane is sent further down the ship where he finds some sort of alien eggs surrounded by a blue mist which seems to be disturbed by his presence. This is where the horror begins as Ripley discovers that the distress call isn't really an SOS call, but a warning.The film has a perfect structure: the science fiction is beautiful taking us to a futuristic world that is well constructed, the visuals are excellent, the editing perfect, the performances are strong, the script is really well written by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (who later collaborated together for another known sci-fi film: Total Recall), the thrills and scares are plentiful, and there are several shocking moments with a couple of twists. The true star of the film is the alien even though we do not see much of it. The reason he's the star is because the claustrophobic mood of the film makes you dread it can show up at any given moment. These characters are stuck in the spaceship with this evil alien that's killing them off one by one. Not even Sigourney Weaver is the star of this film as she practically gets equal screen time as the rest of the cast. She wasn't a known star at the time, and it was actually this franchise that catapulted her to fame, so no one really knew which characters were really going to survive this horror story as the film had plenty of surprises throughout. I wish I would have been around in 1979 to see what kind of reaction I would of got considering I already have seen the aliens in recent versions, but the fear of the unknown is always much more frightening. I still had a great time with this movie and consider it mandatory viewing for everyone who loves film. Alien is as close to a perfect film as you will ever see.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Sets the ultimate standard for Sci-fi horror!,"In the future a team of explorers known as Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Ash (Ian Holm), Parker (Yaphett Kotto), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Dallas (Tom Skeritt) and Kane (John Hurt) investigate a strange planet. However they stumble into a weird spaceship with lots of eggs until one of them accidentally brings a creature on board that will soon be born, a nightmare will soon follow Ripley and her crew.A truly terrifying and magnificent movie that has stood the test of time for many years since it's release in 1979. A highly influential mix of Science Fiction and Horror from Ridley Scott who gave us the masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" for audiences and critics alike praised this motion picture as a visceral and startling roller-coaster ride. The screenplay by Roland Shussett and Dan O'Bannon is quite smart and original borrowing some influence by 50's Sci-fi and EC Comics, Jerry Goldsmith's score is chilling at his best. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley as created a Sci-fi icon of herself for being one of the best heroines to hit the screen, i also love the dark atmosphere that makes it almost a character to the movie much as Ripley and the crew are especially the main star which is the coolest monster to hit Sci-fi cinema known as the Alien. H.R. Giger designed both the monster and the design of the film. There's even memorable moments of graphic gore such as the chestburster which disturbed audiences yet it still does and has been spoofed many times.It became a pop culture phenomenon spawning three sequels with ""Aliens"" almost being better then this as the best of the franchise and a true must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A marriage of science fiction and horror,"More than any other science fiction movie of the seventies; this Ridley Scott classic married the genres of sci fi with the horror genre.

Alien – An Absolutely Amazing Adventure in Another Andromeda,"With this film's much-awaited prequel, 'Prometheus', set for release at the start of this June, I thought that now would be a perfect time to re-visit the fantastic, first-class film that is 'Alien'.First things first, let's get this out of the way – 'Alien' isn't quite as scary as it was back in 1979. Since then there have been hundreds of horror films which have re-defined what we as a whole consider 'scary'. As much as the classic tag line, ""In space, no-one can hear you scream"" is plastered across the DVD case, whether you're in space or not, no-one will hear you scream. Because you won't be screaming. Nevertheless, there are still some very jumpy moments in the film – the leaping face hugger, and the chest-bursting scene, for instance – but on the whole it isn't what it was.That's not to say the overall package has declined in quality. Quite the opposite, for, instead of watching this film from behind the sofa, like many seventies folk did, you soak up all the drama, the adamant emotion, and are impressed by a perfect performance by Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. This film still grasps onto its incredible mood throughout, bursting with enthralling emotion from start to end. The film starts off with a perfect image of grogginess as the crew members of the deep space mining ship, the Nostromo, awake from hyper-sleep. The crew are woken to investigate a strange signal from a nearby planet. While investigating the signal, they discover it was intended as a warning, and not an SOS. From here on the film bursts with wonderful emotion, hurling a feel of gritty survival and impending doom at the audience, as the crew fall apart.Now, the film feels retro-futuristic, a seventies' view of the future, and it still gives you that same sense of overwhelming awe, just as Star Wars IV, V and VI still do, even after all these years. As director and writer Ridley Scott's spaceship-of-the-future vision hums by in the vast black wilderness, lit only by the distant twinkling stars, you are left in absolute amazement. What really adds to the incredible feel of this film is how slow-paced it is, how tense, making it uniquely... chilling. Technically brilliant and visually breathtaking, there is not one single moment in this movie that doesn't excel well beyond the usual genre trappings, yet sticks to the original B-Movie plot formula.Speaking of B-Movies, Alien's production costs were only an estimable estimated eleven million U.S. Dollars, which is just under seven million quid. It may sound a lot of money to you and me, sure, but in terms of films, this is almost unheard of. A film of this calibre made on this budget? Remarkable. Yet despite this setback, the film grossed an incredible $185m, a staggering figure. In comparison, recent horror film, The Thing (2011), on a much greater budget of $35m produced only a measly $17m, despite being okay.Intelligent, unsettling, and distinctly adult, 'Alien' was part of a series that never lived up to the original, the classic. James Cameron's 'Aliens' was too Hollywood-y, and 'Alien3' and 'Alien- Resurrection' are just plain rubbish. A shame really, simply showing that nobody else will be able to pull off what Ridley Scott did. Not even James Cameron and his fancy crew. 'Prometheus', which is the prequel to 'Alien' is directed by Ridley Scott, which is fantastic news. Who knows? Maybe another classic is on the way...",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Boring af, and im a huge SF fan.","I am a SF expert and huge fan and I usualy love a lot of SF stuff, but Rarely ive seen a movie that boring ( except all the Bad movies) but were talking about a Classic with a great imdb rating. 8.5/10 !? It mean that for imdb people this movie right here is better rated than all the star trek movies, better than back to the future 2 and 3 , better than the first X files movie. This is the proof than the human race is stupid beyond limit, and probably with quch bad tastes we dont deserve to be so lucky.Anyway Alien is a boring movie, a total miss shot, I usualy love the 70's 80's movies and I always rate movies kindly, even the Bad First star trek movie i gave it a 7/10 on imdb, and its bad, so imagine what this movie is if I give a 5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Well done but rather a silly movie,"I borrowed Alien Quadrilogy box set from a friend of mine and tried to watch the Alien and I couldn't. Yes, Ridley Scott is a master. He does his work very well and he, it seems, even had studied Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' before. But the screenplay... One of the silliest I ever seen. Every person acts like imbecile that has the only aim - to die. Aliens are very spectacular and illogical (in my opinion). They grow from embryo to huge monster having nothing to it, deposit eggs that have more flesh than grown monster, and pour rivers of acid and slime. Ah, and they kill :) The genre of the movie (according to IMDb) is Sci-Fi / Horror / Thriller. I'd say it's horror/thriller under sci-fi sauce. Some kind of sci-fi Jaws. The only Alien movie I liked is Alien: Resurrection. It's really stylish and fun. And Sigourney Weaver is a killer woman there :)",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One Of The Greatest Horror Movies In Cinema History,"Not only is Alien a great film, it is was a huge influence to future Si-Fi television and cinema. Before Alien came out the idea of a ""spaceship"" was a very clean and shiny, luxurious hotel in space. However that was all to change, because Ridley Scott's vision of a ""haunted house in space"" changed the way we see spaceships forever. It also gives a great atmosphere and look to the film; which is very important when making a horror movie.It is truly spine tingling, and a great artistic achievement on every level. The design for the creature itself is genius. And the way it is always hidden in the shadows, so don't see it, makes your imagination fill in the gaps. And that is something that is scarier than any horror film you'll see in your life time.The whole look and feel to the film is brilliant. It creates a dark, uneasy atmosphere, and Ridley Scott doesn't give us an easy way out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"First rate horror, oozing dread and despair","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" has easily advanced to the definitive modern day horror classic by hiding the horror rather than showing it, thus appealing primarily to the viewer's imagination and omitting in-the-face special effects. The man in a costume, cheesy must-have in all kinds of sci-fi and horror flicks of the fifties and sixties, still serves his purpose in this film, which however has the advantage of being masterfully directed. ""Alien"" is a perfectly slow paced composition of shadows, noises, musical cues, a film of claustrophobic, tense atmosphere oozing dread and despair, all this creating suspense in the most accomplished Hitchcockian sense: The film provides a scenario where the unknown danger is as unpredictable as it is certain that it does strike.Aside from its directorial brilliance, ""Alien"" of course also has one of the most innovative monster designs in movie history to offer (H.R. Giger's incredibly beautiful otherworldly creature), another excellent Jerry Goldsmith score, exceptionally strong characters and an outstanding female lead in Sigourney Weaver - and last but not least there's that perfect script, which makes a relatively simple idea into an unforgettable story.

A brilliantly directed and revolutionary thriller of its time,"""Alien"" revolves around the story of a crew exploring space, that happen to bring an unwelcome guest on board resulting in a cat-and-mouse chase in which the crew members try valiantly to save their lives.""Alien"" was a ground-breaking film that set the standards for both suspenseful thrillers and sci-fi movies. The film in itself may be quite predictable at times and some people would argue that perhaps now it isn't as terrifying in comparison to other films, but it still doesn't detract from how innovative a film this is. Even now, many moments in the film will have you on the edge of your seats with the director bringing suspense to a new level, as well as some iconic movie moments still considered as some of the best ever. The whole film is brought together wonderfully by the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, that really put you in their position, and the special effects is also quite amazing for its time.Overall, this is a stunning film that should keep you entertained throughout, despite its relatively simple plot.

"""In space, No one can hear you scream...""","I have seen a dozen alien movies including Alien vs. Predator. I even knew what the alien looks like so I wasn't having high expectations from this movie. But, It got me, boy! From beginning till the end, the movie was astounding. Unlike other movies which are made today (which show a lot of gore and are very action packed) Alien is the only alien movie that gives a creepy feeling of ""We are not alone"". Unlike today's movies, they spent the first few minutes only to show us the entire the art-direction of the ship and how it works. Surprisingly enough, all the important scenes take place in these areas. Ridley Scott very cleverly creates the tension, slowly and slowly and a bit fast and a bit more fast and then a bang in the end! I still wonder how the hell they must have created those creatures and that too with extremely higher detail. The story to has a hard solid structures with pretty shocking twists. This movie is not like those non-sense action horror movies where you just watch people dying. Alien is way ahead of even today's film-making. It's a true benchmark like 2001 A space Odyssey.

"In space, no one can hear you scream.","There are unsolved mysteries in our space. There are surprises sometime around the corner. And even if it should be left alone, you should know that by now. Alien, which is directed by Ridely Scott delivers a heart-pounding suspenseful movie. The movie is taking place in the deep outer space where the cargo ship, the Nostromo is on its way home. There are seven people in the Nostromo. They soon pick up a signal from distant planet.Rather than make their way back to Earth, the Nostromo crew, which is played by a well known cast including Sigourney Weaver as the control officer on the ship. After leaving the planet, one of the member is attacked by a mutant that basically latches onto your face and stay there. But, what they don't know is that the movie's villain is on the ship. Alien has a great deal in special effects and its set direction is the one I like the most. There are also great shots of scenes involving claustrophobia. But, one of the most famous scenes in the movie is when the member who recovers from being attack by the facehugger and then, he finds out that a chestburster or a parasite is inside of him. This scene is very gory and is not for the faint-hearted. Alien is a great movie because it is like Jaws, or in other words, have a great deal in suspense. The background score is really frightening for those scenes where the Alien pops out. An terrific science fiction thriller. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A truly original survival horror film.,"Jacob's Review: Alien is the first entry to the Alien franchise and so far it is one of the best. The surprising element to me in this film was its pacing. Being raised in an era of film that is so ADD ridden and impatient could influence my thinking ability when it comes to analyzing film but it was so refreshing to see a movie that builds such an eerie and desolate atmosphere. The movie is patient and rather builds tension and character before SNAP and something horrific happens. This is what may dispirit a lot of viewers which is why many people prefer Aliens (1986) to the topic film. It works for me. The characters act like real people and the design, metamorphosis and behaviour of the alien creature is incredibly haunting but left open to interpretation due to the mystery that shrouds the creature (or later known as xenomorph) in its latter stage. If you haven't seen it then I recommend this truly unique gem to those with an attention span. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great Film!,"This is a fantastic example of how horror films should be made. There are few jumps, cheep thrills, and excessive gore. Instead, the film is eerily slow and full of tension. This mostly comes from the way the film is shot. Almost all of the sets are filmed in darkness, and the alien itself gets little screen time. This causes the viewer to feel unsure of the monsters whereabouts, much as the characters would feel.ACTING: 8.5/10The acting in this movie is good. The cast gives life to likable characters, something sorely missing from more recent horror films. There are no standouts however, and the actors have great chemistry.WRITING: 10/10The most well written horror film of all time. The plot is slow and dark, frighteningly so. The evolution of the alien is unique, the characters are well written, and the ending is satisfying. No complaints here.DESIGN: 10/10H. R. Giger is a genius! He alone designed some of the most unsettling sets of all time. He also designed the alien itself, which may be the most frightening creature ever in film. You will never see scarier art direction than that found in this movie.EFFECTS: 10/10Most, if not all of the effects in this movie are done before the camera, the way it should be done. For this reason, it is the most realistic alien movie of the four. The blood and gore is shocking, the alien moves wonderfully, and the sets look real. The darkness helped hide any flaws in effects for this film.MUSIC: 9/10There are no ""songs"" that I would listen to outside of this movie, however the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly and adds to the scariness immensely.VERDICT:This is the greatest scary movie ever created. Everything from the design to the music is nearly perfect. The atmosphere in this film is dark and slow, something that present day horror films could learn from. I give it a 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One of the best SF movies ever,"This is a flawless movie, and plot-wise neat, suspenseful and edge-of-the-seat exciting; Sigourney Weaver's performance (especially in the closing sequences) is simply outstanding. It is one of those rare movies that also has an even better sequel (""Aliens""), but it is still a fantastic stand-alone flick, too. Many of the other actors' characters are terrific, and the first little alien's ""entrance"" is one of the slickest effects I have ever seen--you could almost feel John Hurt's pain. (It is my understanding that the other actors in that scene weren't aware of exactly what was going to happen, so that their reactions could be filmed just as they occurred, and it was terrific.) Every character in this movie is believable and realistic; ""Alien"" really succeeds in every aspect. I have a videotape in which I blended the end of this with the beginning of ""Aliens"" to make a single five-hour adventure and I watch it often--it seems I get more out of it every time.

One of the most frightening horror masterpieces ever made of all time!,"Alien (1979) is a masterclass of terror it is my favorite Sci-Fi horror movie of all time a real classic. A film so terrifying and yet so beautifully done that it demands to be viewed over and over again. The characters are grounded and feel real, the sets are breathtaking (even today), the film feels natural and plausible. But the main reasons to watch the film are for two things: The Alien and the atmosphere. Both make this film, the entire film is full of dread and when one of the most interesting and violating creatures shows up on screen; it is riveting.I can still remember when I first saw Alien back in 1997 as a 13 year old kid, It's scared me back then and still holds up today as one of the best horror films of all time. The direction by Ridley Scott is first rate and the sets and atmopshere are creepy and claustrophobic. The ""chestburster"" scene is brilliant and very effective. Also gotta give a shout out to H.R. Giger who designed those amazing Alien creatures. A must own for any sci-fi or horror fan!!Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is gorgeous and one of my favorite heroine survivors. The ship for Nostramu is great. The effects and desigen for the creature is wonderful great it is a masterpiece fuly done. this is my favorite horror sci-film to me. One of the most frightening horror masterpieces ever made.I love the characters: Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash and Parker. I love the Alien design the costume. Bolaji Badejo as the Alien was great it is really a tragedy and sad because 2 great actors died like Bolaji Badejo and Kevin Peter Hall they both died in the 90's and they both played monster creatures so well. Hall was Predator and Badejo was the Alien they deserve both actors respect and they are missed R.I.P. This was Badejo's only role I wish he would get more movie roles. I miss these actors so much. Veronica Cartwright was great as Lambert I really love her she was sexy. Yaphet Kotto was a bad-ass as Parker. Great practical effect when Parker burn with flamethrower As's remains. That is my favorite scene. Tom Skerritt as Captain Dallas was great and wonderful, his best performance on screen I have ever seen.The movie is master sci-fi classic masterpiece with a horror elements. My problem is the first hour is boring when the crew goes on the desolate planet and they find that empty ship whith a lot of eggs. One of the crew members gets infected and Ripley does not leave the crew inside the ship but Ash opens the gate and lets them in, he does not obey his superior Ripley. By the end we find out that Ash knew what is going on and he was admiring the purity if the Alien. I love the finale and I love the cat Jones, the cat was really trained. The second hour goes fast around and I was more interested in the second hour. It had horror and survival elements I love that.On their voyage home, the crew of the deepspace tug Nostromo investigate a transmission from a desolate planet and discover a mysterious lifeform.Alien (1979) is my favorite horror film, Aliens (1986) is my number 1 favorite horror so I put Aliens (1986) above Alien (1979). To me they are both masterpeices to me. The Nostromo ship is great designed, today the CGI effects are fake, the effects in 1979 were great and excellent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Despite the fact that a couple of girls i am unfortunately aquainted with ruined it for me forever (calling the alien cute as it bursts from John H's body as well as continually giggleing at the insult ""you look dead"" and line ""I'm going down too"") i still believe it is a modern (or not so) classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Overrated, mediocre and plot holes","I don't like these kind of movies which dumb down the characters just for the sake of plot. I don't like how the technology can be so advanced but not at the same time. I'll be mentioning slight spoilers from here on. There was a scene when the captain was searching for the alien through the air ducts and the crew was tracking his position. You would think with a 10+ story ship their tracker would be 3 dimensional but no. That's not the only plot hole though, at the end when they could've just left the ship through the pod the black man and girl went to get coolant for the pod. Turns out that was a waste and they didn't even need it since the pod worked just fine. Not to mention there was absolutely no point in riley going through so much trouble for a damn cat. It just is really unrealistic I mean if i was Riley I would not care about my cat I'd care about my crewmates but no she sent them to get unnecessary coolant just for the sake of plot. I was really hoping for a smart and high tech scary Sci-Fi film but instead I got a dumbed down ""The Thing"" ripoff with even stupider characters and in space. The only good thing about this movie was the atmosphere and technology in the ship. The character progression within the crew was also cool and i really liked the black man since his development is interesting.

Alien,"Alien. The title really says all you need to know. Alien is a science fiction horror film made in 1979 it was very revolutionary and helped mold the modern horror genera and modern sci fi genera. The movie starts by really showing off the sets that were made to stimulate the ship, Nostromo, it all looks amazing more so considering there was no CGI (computer generated images). The movie does start off a bit slow but it's all set up one the crew lands on the planet then the movie really gets going. Ridley Scott, the movie's director, did a marvelous job with suspense. Your always waiting for the next thing to happen and it's very scary. The movie's characters feel a lot like real people, the main character being Ripley. The character of Ripley has now become a pop culture icon and one of the best heroines in any art medium. Alien is also has incredible special effects, most notably chest burster scene were the baby alien pops out of a characters chest, this scene has become an icon of horror, sci fi, and cinema in general. The full grow alien design is another icon in film. It's terrifying and original the Xenomorph (yes it has a name) is easily my favorite movie monster design. So lets wrap this up. Alien has a great haunting atmosphere, good side characters with a great main character, amazing build up of suspense that's able to generate real scares, sets and special effects that are some of the best ever in a movie and all wrapped up with the greatest creature design, Alien gets a 10 out of 10 and at one point it was my number one favorite movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant work of high-brow art,"This film matches my taste in art on every level. It is slow, elegant and perverse in a very intellectual way, and is also a movie which addresses the intelligent viewer: one who immerses himself into the detail of the design and script and, of course, who is expected to use his imagination throughout the viewing.I have shown this film to several of my friends, who were not quite as impressed by it as I was, indeed they yawned and called it boring several times during the very long ""prologue"", so to speak. I was disappointed, but not surprised. Contemporary sci-fi is reduced to a cheap but dynamic story and CGI (of course, there has been a pair of brilliant films in the past ten years, but shoddy is the norm in my opinion). If you are looking for a fast-paced piece with lots of action, this may not be your cup of tea.On my part, I believe that this film comes as close to perfection as possible: the only ""flaws"" I notice and that occasionally bother me are the effects in some parts, such as the android head and drops of water in the end shot. The volume of the score sometimes seems to be too low for my taste and I believe all of Goldsmith's masterwork should have been used as per his idea. Finally, there is a pair of shots in which I believe a little too much of the Alien has been shown, and I don't really like the way the part of the suit beneath the torso was made. Of course, all of these things are trivial in the big picture, and you probably wouldn't notice them on the first viewing.And why do I think this is the finest work of art in movie history? I have already said that it engages the viewer in a very discrete fashion. The scene on the alien planet alone should leave you puzzled, but no sooner do we start asking ourselves the first row of questions, the next one has emerged, and so on. For the first-time viewer, the most enthralling question is certainly what the creature looks like and what might we see in the next shot, which for me was an original experience.The design is probably the finest point of the film. Ron Cobb designed the human element of the film, whereas the great master Giger outdid himself with the alien vessel and creatures. The environment of the alien vessel is the most foreign looking and curious I have ever seen in a movie, and that is not taking into account the many refined sexual themes. The dichotomy of human (functional, wet, sometimes sterile-looking) and alien (dark, massive, uneconomically large and erotic) is why I enjoy watching this work over and over again.Other reviewers have already mentioned the acting, so I will only mention Ian Holm's performance, which I find to be the finest of the cast. There is relatively little dialogue in the movie, and very laconic at that. This actually allows the atmosphere, score and body-language to come into the foreground - especially in the third act, when the flashing lights, sirens and Mother's voice seem to give an unusually loud and urban tone. The fact that we are aware, as the audience, of this illusion (which somehow comforts the viewer after having witnessed the previous events, and by this time likely being thoroughly horrified) underlines even more aggressively, despite the lights and sounds, the solitude aboard a massive, empty, eerie star freighter.Of course, the ending is shockingly sublime, with the extract from Howard Hanson's Romantic Symphony providing a wonderful respite from the cathartic ordeal (this is, in fact, the only part of Mr. Scott's tampering with the score that I approve of), and you will probably continue watching till the credits end, dwelling on the most powerful theme of the movie: the vastness, hostility and unthinkable age of the Universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Scott at his best,"No matter how many times I watch this, it never fails to be utterly compelling and terrifying.

Every character is portrayed with such nuanced and idiosyncratic perfection, everyone occupying their roles like their lives depended on it, including those of the ship and the alien itself.

"An intelligent, deliberately paced exercise in fear","Alien is a most difficult film to define. In one sense it's a sci-fi film, in another it's a Gothic horror film. Ridley Scott's vision of the future was so intriguing at the time due to its modest implications. The usual sense of humans as infinitesimal in contrast with their universe is there, as is the feeling that one could be engulfed without incident. But for all its cosmic commonalities; Alien is grounded in a sense of realism. This is indicated by the Nostromo, a space Junker operated by eight ragtag crewman, which is a remnant of heavy industry and mass production that is void of the futuristic sheen of fictionalised ships such as the Enterprise, or the Millennium Falcon. Moreover, the crew is representative of the working middle-class; a humble collection of eight crewman whose expertise lies within the most basic provisions of engineering, spare two scientists, these people are the everyday collection that make up our society. Which is why Alien is an exemplary horror film: it deals with ordinary people under extraordinary circumstances – its sci-fi trappings notwithstanding.Like John Carpenter's minimalist horror film The Thing; Alien is a subtle exercise in tension punctuated by moments of absolute horror. It deals with the venereal and psychological elements of its characters. The Alien is seldom seen, akin to the shark in Jaws, but its presence is always felt. The horror is engendered by its characters rank paranoia, which in turn instils the audience with the same kind of impending dread. The emphasis on the venereal works exceptionally well because it triggers our most basic patterns of instinct and fear. Alien has a distinctly European quality in that it unfolds through the composition of stillness and music. Dialogue is certainly present; however there is an ethereal quality to the proceedings evoking images and sounds that are both chilling and resonant. This is why Alien is such a superior genre film: it takes well established ideas and endeavours into new territory with them.Ultimately, Alien is a ""B-film"" just as Jaws and the Fly are, but in compounding the formulaic elements with fresh ideas it elevates itself not from its roots, but from people's preconceived views on the genre's limitations. This is particularly apparent in subverting the male-centric heroics in favour of its female lead: Ripley – played with much sincerity and poise by Sigourney Weaver. In fact Ridley Scott discards the film's potentially masculine element so curtly and with such cold precision that he can only really be praised for it. As for the creature itself, Scott was loath to consider having his monster being anything other than terrifying. In defining the aesthetics of the Alien, it is best described as an immensely intimidating figure with a phallic head coupled with a retractable secondary mouth that operates like a dagger coated in translucent goo. But what's more significant is the form it takes. The alien mutates and evolves much like a virus throughout the film and is all the more horrifying for it. Perhaps this was intentional on Scott's part to contrast the perpetually latent paranoia of the characters with the burgeoning senses of the Alien. In any event the Nostromo functions as a proxy for fear and instinct.The greatest virtue of Alien is the sense of sheer terror it invokes, whether it is through the lens of the cosmos, or in the claustrophobic confines of a spaceship. Like all great films, Alien remains a remarkable achievement and cinematic landmark as it engages the senses and invites discussion from the casual and ardent film goer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

In Giger's astonishing alien, cold metallic smoothness is synergised with unmitigated, super-swift killing and intelligent cunning, representing an unprecedentedly fearsome enemy. The bickering relationships among the crew set up an atmosphere of unease and vulnerability that the malign intent of the Company readily exploits.

One of the best horror films,"Filmed more than 35 years ago and still one of the best horror - sci-fi films you can watch. Instant classic! They don't make movies like this one any more! As other users most accurately point out it defined sci-fi and horror all in one! Fear is the main actor in this film... Sigourney Weaver is also a very good choice to lead.If you give Ridley Scott a bit of time to set the mood, surprisingly enough he will manage to scare you! Dark atmosphere and dark setting but because of the initially slow pace, there are a lot of moments that catch you off guard.If you want to watch a horror film and you are a fun of the sci-fi, then Alien is you go to film!

The Best Gothic Horror Film Of All Time!,"Alien ****In Space Where No One Can Hear You Scream. What a great tag line! Alien scares as well as to keep you guessing where the Alien is going to show up next and when it does, without hesitation, you jump out of your seat. What Ridley Scott has done here is take completely quiet moments, (Some horror films take moderate quiet moments), and then make the unexpected happen. The story is also great. In todays horror films, you don't get great stories. Another thing that this movie does is it takes it's time on where it wants to go and doesn't rush it. Today's audiences are so impatient with horror films that takes it's time that the director doesn't have enough time to deliver the goods. Alien also has that Gothic feel to it, and man doesn't have a Gothic feel to it. Suspiria has the same kind of feel but in Alien, the feel is more authentic mainly because it's in space, (However the Gothics in Suspiria is also authentic because of it's subject matter and the weird production designs). Alien has definitely stood the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps the most competently made horror film ever,"There has always been one big debate with Alien. Is it a horror film, or is it a science fiction film? The answer to me is simple, it is both. Although, I do believe that it is primarily a horror film. Barry Keith has said that the distinguishing factor between science fiction and horror is that ""The appeal of science fiction is primarily cognitive, while horroris essentially emotional."" The reason that I think of Alien as a horror film, is that all of the science in it is there to instil an emotional reaction, specifically the emotion of terror. The production design, art direction, make-up, writing, all rely heavily on science fiction ideals and visuals. However, all of these ideas and visuals are presented in a way to scare the audience. The large spaceship with its dark, narrow corridors serves the purpose of a massive, claustrophobic haunted house. The alien is designed to play on the audience's fears. Even the android character is primarily used for scares, as even he takes the place of a villain from a slasher film in the second half of, similar to the alien. If the film were primarily science fiction, all of the inventions and futuristic elements would primarily be in presented to cognitively affect the viewers. Though the film does have some science fiction ideas that aren't meant to purely instil horror. However, none of these ideas have the sense of awe or wonder that is usually to be expected from science fiction. The space travellers in the film are miners who see what they do as labor rather than a journey. The idea of a dirty, muddy, industrial look was foreign to space operas and science fiction at the time of the film's release. This is where the film succeeds as pure science fiction.The fact that Alien is largely a horror film is not a negative at all, as I think it is a great one . As I have mentioned before, I think that film is not the best medium for cognitive art. Books are generally the best as they do not deal with the dimension of time to present their ideas, allowing the viewer to take their own pace in understanding ideals. Alien in many ways encapsulates everything I love about science fiction cinema. The sense of mood created by the locations and cinematography are mesmerizing. Every part of the spaceship feels like its own character, and the superb special effects present them in a perfect manner.'I also feel that Alien is a good example of using realistic acting in a science fiction film, as opposed to Advantageous. Most of the dialogue scenes feel improvisational, and though the actors have everyday looks and qualities, they do not appear or behave ""plain"", instead they are ordinary, but with character. I personally think that the dinner scene after a crew member has been impregnated by the face-hugger is the best scene in the film. The scene is a perfect example how effects that are not necessarily amazing can be used to amazing effect in combination with great filmmaking. The interactions during the dinner scene, which might be the best scene in the film, feel very mundane and ordinary. It has occurred to me that most of it might had been improvised. Scott brilliantly makes us laugh and take comfort for the first time during this scene before the small alien bursts out of the crew member's chest. We are slowly made to believe that everything may actually be okay with the characters and spend some time with them. When the alien comes out of the crew member's chest, the audience is entirely shocked, and at that point it does not fully matter how good the effect looks, as it was not the effect that made the audience feel something, it was the craftsmanship of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

convincing space-opera as well as a character study,"Has this become an all-star cast because the movie is brilliant or is the movie so good because the actors are great?  I think both.  Seven (plus a hairy quadruped) tour-de-force performances make it a convincing space-opera as well as a fantastic character study.  I particularly like the interaction between Yaphet Kotto (Midnight Run, 1988) and Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas, 1984) as opportunistic engineers.  I saw this film every year in the past 15 years, and that will definitely continue for decades.  Since that first time I tend to compare every SF and every horror movie with this one, but just recently I realized that it's an unfair race against this horror-milestone.  Ridley Scott builds up the pace towards the end and doesn't spill his guts (at once) so you aren't able to take your eyes off the screen.This has the most intellectual plot (and coolest plot-twists) of all four alien-films: one of the key elements (why do they wake up in the first place?) of the film is the moral dilemma faced by commercial corporations anywhere to sacrificing employees in order to make more money or to make less profits in order to serve humanity.  Strangely enough, the two SF masterpieces Ridley Scott (Blade Runner) made are also his only two intellectual achievements.Here's one of the greatest movie scores of all time by Jerry Goldsmith (the Omen, Chinatown, L.A. Confidential), because it's subtle and instantly recognizable.  As is the art direction, which was not only flawlessly executed here by Les Dilley and Roger Christian, but could also not be surpassed by any SF-horror without computer animations until now, and by which this genre stands or falls.  No need to mention the concept artists. Derek Vanlint (cinematography) also puts his stamp upon the film very carefully.  The nerve-wrecking hand-held scenes are also used to make the all-time scariest theatrical trailer you've ever seen.  I hope there'll be no computer-animations in part five, for they could not compete with this art and are probably more expensive too.Beware of Alien-wannabees like 'Pitch Black' and 'Leviathan' (entertaining though).  If you liked this you should not miss Aliens, which is more of an adrenalized war-movie but does NOT disappoint.Why o why can't we vote 11 :(",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien,"Back in the day before Sir John Hurt took to being little more than a highly paid cameo-man, he was a great actor and here is a prime example. His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense ""Ripley"" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith's tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The best sci-fi film EVER made.,"Some people say there is no such thing as perfection, maybe not, but ALIENS comes very close. This is a beautiful film, and as with a fine wine, you need to prepare it correctly to enjoy it's uniqueness, i.e NICE BIG SCREEN, NO LIGHTS, SURROUND SOUND, ON YOUR OWN (I would'nt advise that with the wine though!)I remember when I first saw this film, I knew from the first 3 minutes this was going to be something special, it is one of the most absorbing films I have ever seen in the sense that it soaks you into the movie, literally, hence why you should see it alone.The effects are fantastic, the sound is a dream, but it is the atmosphere created from the incredible direction by ridley scott that will make you feel you are part of this cursed crew.After I saw this film I followed everything that ridley scott did, hoping for another taste of this magic, it never happened. I watched the sequels 2,3 and 4 but was hugely disappointed, WHY? Because this is the genuine article and the rest are fakes, as simple as that. Trying to fake this film is like trying to fake the 'mona lisa' with felt tips.--- DO NOT READ THIS NEXT CHAPTER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FILM---(SCROLL DOWN NOW ---------->)The beginning of this film can never be equalled. The camera moving around that sleeping ship, the helmet reflecting the distress signal, the sound of that signal- just pure brilliance. The crew waking, the chat around the table, mother, and the realisation that there 'not home' paints a picture of deep space more vividly than any other film has come close to. Thats just the start. The sound of the wind on that planet, the craft, that alien in the chair - the size of it! The way that alien craft was depicted, pure genius. I could go on and on.---------- OK YOU CAN READ ON NOW ------------------------Ridley is superb, they all are. Unlike the second film with those pathetic marines, this is outstanding acting by all. The crew seem to have been together for years, which is exactly how they should seem, and scott has pulled it off perfectly. This film has not aged a bit, in fact it is way ahead of more modern sci-fi's (with the help of giger) but not only the brilliant design and work of that fantastic artist but also the visuals (screens, computers, navigation) just seem to be so right, even now in 2004. Then there is the tension and horror to come--I could go on forever, one sentence to sum up-DO NOT MISS THIS INCREDIBLE FILM.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien-a review in 2015,"i saw this movie this year and i am one of those newbie film goers.i saw this film because a lot of people said its a classic.i think its a good film even though i am watching it in 2015.i think what makes this film good is the atmosphere,character and the build up to the suspense.the film has less amount of ""alien"" scenes but the scenes where alien is shown is done well.unlike most films today,the characters are also good and we actually care for the characters.that said,the film also has its cons.the problem that is that its slow in certain parts.the film really takes time to show its dark atmosphere and its characters.some audience may not be able to tolerate these slow parts.but i am one of those people who likes to know the characters and the tone of the film.so i recommend this film for mature audience and not for those kids who love films like transformers 2",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Analysis of Alien,"The worst part of ALIEN has got to be the appallingly pretentious Freudian psychoanalytical interpretation of the film put forth by Barbara Creed in The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis (London, 1993).  The assumption that the fear produced by ALIEN is based upon the fear of the castrating archaic mother is so general it fails to carry any weight.  While instances of maternal separation are seen (the Alien bursts through Kane's body) and the notion of individuality being achieved by these means is an interesting one, the attribution of Freudian philosophy to this film as a whole is a stretch to say the least.  How can one argue against such a sweeping analysis when all other arguments are countered with subconscious motivation?!  The unconscious argument assumes that society as a whole maintains the same subconscious interpretation, a fact I find very hard to believe.  It would also imply some sort of unlevelled genius in the film making process who could transcend consciousness and develop a conscious idea into a subconscious response - again, doubtful on such a scale. Creed's approach also fails to take into account filmic industrial history and the audience's interpretation of the movie.My interpretation of the fear induced by ALIEN holds with the idea of primordial instinct.  The natural fight-or-flight instinct found in animals when confronted with a predator is masterfully used to create a feeling of fear due to the setting in which ALIEN takes place.  Trapped in a spacecraft, there is no place to hide from the super-predator.  The setting acts as a prison rather than a womb as asserted by Creed.  The appearance of the Alien in such abject terms serves not to equate it with ""monstrous femininity"", but simply to disturb through the abject itself.  While not as repulsive as many other scenes (the eye-cutting scene in Bunuel and Dali's UN CHIEN ANDALOU being the most disturbing filmic scene in my opinion), the image of the Alien is nonetheless unattractive to human emotion in all its puss-filled, slimy glory.Creed goes on to say that the film deals with the mother's rejection and deception of her children - we find that 'Mother' had been following the robotic science officer's commands all along and had thought of the humans as ""expendable"".  I would add to this argument the role that the company (who the crew are working for) play in deceiving humanity.  It was, after all, the company who sent the crew to their ultimate deaths.  Whether this fact should be interpreted as a commentary on unseen evils or on the soulless and inhumane nature of the corporation, I leave open to debate. However, I would argue that this aspect of the film should be examined further in order to assess the claims of Ridley Scott as auteur.Personally I did not like the film and am not a great fan of the sci-fi/horror genre.  However, if you are interested in film analysis (and not just necessarily psychoanalysis-as is commonly held with this particular film) then I would urge you to see this film if for no other reason than as a subject of debate.  After that, rent THE SHINING and enjoy the best horror movie ever made.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
NOT overrated,"Alien is a movie that some may claim is overrated, but it is not overrated, it is forgotten. People don't realize what a massive shock this film was and still will be for future generations not desensitized by hype that unfortunately makes certain people approach it with an arrogant ""give me your best shot"" attitude. This is a patient horror film, that will never be touched. Anyone who says it is overrated is in my opinion an ignorant snob trying to start fights for no reason. There is no way this film is overrated, there is nothing else like it and it will never be duplicated even though everything after it has tried. How can this movie be overrated when it set the standard for Sci/Fi horror? Name one movie that came after ALIEN that either took place in space or involved creatures from outer space that didn't in some way rip it off? I pity the poor bastard who forgets history and has spit on classic and original films just to make a name for themselves. Alien is not overrated, and anyone says so will only end up exposing themselves as an ignorant fraud who knows nothing of greatness. It is easy to arrogantly claim that this film is overrated, and there will be many more cynical bitter fools to follow, but none of them will ever in their entire lives be anything more than an ignorant snob pissing on greatness just to be heard.

The one,"...and only !I saw him on a video tape when I was 14 years old, and it was a true life experience !All things in this movie seems to be perfect: the story, the actors, the special effects, the atmosphere,the monster, the set and of course the Ridley Scott's masterliness.This is the most fearsome crossing between science fiction and terror: here we found the space travel, the life in space, one of the most beautiful space ship ( the Nostromo ), the most deadly extra terrestrial creature, a real feeling of the gap between the human life form and an inhuman one...The characters are very engaging, and they are very well written: just a few line of dialog in the beginning and you understand who's who. Sigourney Weaver ( Ripley) is one of the first female leading role in that kind of movie, and she knocked me out ! Her performance is very well supported by Yaphet Kotto (Parker) and Ian Holm (Ash). All lines of dialog are effective, and none of them is useless (they really LIVE in their vessel...) , the images and the shots are amazing and powerful ( Thanks M.

inspired instead of being inspirational.,"Alien seems a unique and innovative film when you first see it. It becomes inspired instead of being inspirational. However after 2001: Space odyssey, I began to see Alien as heavily inspired from 2001. The hibernation chambers, HAL, slow pace, external spaceship shots all come from 2001. However Scott does his part in introducing classy alien horror and other features. I prefer such kind of cinema instead of slashers though the film has its share of gore too. Also, I liked the Android character - which was not part of 2001. Other good parts of the film have already been discussed in other reviews.

A Classic in Both Horror and Sci-Fi Genres,"After landing on a planet to perform a rescue, a group of military excavators find an alien life form that isn't exactly friendly. Face hugging, chest popping and outright carnage ensue, as one by one the crew is left to fend for themselves.This film goes down as a classic, and it well should have. A giant in the sci-fi world directed this (Ridley Scott, ""Blade Runner"") and it was written by Dan O'Bannon (who also adapted ""Total Recall"" from Philip K. Dick and wrote/directed the horror classic ""Return of the Living Dead""). And a cast consisting of Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm? Amazing!What makes this film great is the real sense of being alone it leaves you with. Even when the crew is grouped together, they know they're trapped millions of miles from home. They must fight to survive, no running possible. The enemy changes and remains unknown, and even one of the crew may not be on their side.This film contains the iconic ""chest-popping scene"", which was pretty cool. Granted, after seeing ""Spaceballs"" you might be let down by the version in this movie, but it's still pretty memorable. The face-huggers are also creepy, if you can imagine what that must be like to have a slimy, acid-blooded creature suctioned on your face, dropping eggs. Nasty! The film goes from sci-fi to horror and back again, mixing the two together in way that's rarely successful (although I would give a nod to ""Event Horizon"" for being a fine exception).They implement the ""final girl"" scenario well. I don't mean to ruin the plot for anyone, but not many of the crew survive and one of them is Sigourney Weaver (which I suppose is obvious since she's in all the sequels). She knows how to be tough, even if she's not exactly pretty while doing it. (I think horror fans crave attractive women more than science fiction fans do, if this film is any evidence.)My only complaint with this film is the alien suit, which seemed too rubbery and human-like. Luckily, the director was smart and saved the reveal until much later in the movie and kept it to a minimum. Sometimes the unseen is scarier than the seen, especially if you aren't able to make the monster as scary as you planned (which is fixed in future sequels).If you haven't seen this one, see it. It sets the bar for all future science fiction films, particularly ones involving hostile alien life. I don't know if a film in the genre can be made any more without somehow paying their respects to this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

First there was Alien...,"I guess in hindsight you can see why Alien was such a sure-fire winner back in 1979. It took important elements of two of the most successful blockbusters of that time. It combined the science fiction of Star Wars with the relentless killer monster of Jaws and put them into a narrative that reflected the cynical anti-corporate feel of many 70's movies. The result was an iconic and brilliantly presented sci-fi horror movie.Directed by Ridley Scott from a script from Dan O'Bannon, Alien is very intelligently made. None of the cast were stars at the time. This factored into the generation of suspense, as we simply have no idea who will emerge as the hero and who will die - if Charlton Heston was in Alien, for example, you'd have a pretty good idea from the get-go - this casting decision is one that very few subsequent big budget movies have made; to their detriment and to Alien's success. As it was, Sigourney Weaver was the strongest and most capable figure. Apart from a blink-and-you-will-miss-it cameo in Woody Allen's Annie Hall, she hadn't really been in anything before this. Ripley was her calling and she created one of the definitive strong female characters of all time. There are of course other excellent performances from, among others, Ian Holm as the android and John Hurt in the unforgettable role as the first victim.But as much as anything else, Alien is a triumph of brilliant design work. The looks of the Nostromo and the alien ships are entirely different. Both teams created them in isolation from one another in order to create pure designs 'alien' from one and other. The Nostromo is pleasingly rough, with coffee mugs left lying around etc, it really looks like the kind of place that people live and work. The alien ship and the alien itself are of course the work of surreal artist H. R. Giger. To say that his work is effective would be a gross understatement; the alien itself is a terrifically threatening creation. It's a giant phallic killing machine with jaws within jaws. And this is to say nothing of the eggs, the face-hugger and the chest-buster. Really this is a movie with more creativity than a hundred others.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Classic Sci-fi Film That Has A Lot Going For It,"Alien is a classic in both the horror and sci-fi genres. It's got some really great stuff in there and is easy to enjoy. But I will say that I don't quite think it's the absolute masterpiece that a lot of people think it is. If you want to really be harsh to the film, it's essentially a typical horror slasher kind of film but in space. I don't think it should be considered that simple, but I do think that's something I noticed and kind of brought it down a little bit for me. But I do think its a super fun film that is certainly a classic.The plot, while not exactly super original by today's standard, is interesting. It's about a cargo ship in space that is returning to earth and ends up investigating some sort of signal that they pick up on the way, which leads to them picking up a little bit of extra cargo...cargo that kills. It was most likely more original in 1979 than it is now, but regardless I still think it works. The first half of the movie is establishing characters and location and the whole scary situation, and the second half is the intense and frightening stuff. I think for the most part the movie holds up. Yeah, there are a few practical effects that you can totally tell how they did it and see its fake, but somehow even those scenes still work. There are also some really great and intense scenes, such as the ventilation system scene, and when Brett goes to find that cat. These scenes are filled with a sense of dread and really can be scary.I must say that Sigourney Weaver gives a great performance. She feels like a strong female lead without any of that cheesy ""hey look we made a female character really cool"" kind of thing going on. It feels natural and is great. She's a likable character and you feel for her in this terrible situation.Overall, I do understand why this is a classic, it's fun and quite well made, and really gets a lot right. I don't exactly think it's a 10/10 like a lot of people seem to think, but I really do think it's entertaining and influential.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

""Alien"" mixes those elements with the Horror genre and it provokes a revolution in cinema overall.The plot is breath taking since the beginning of the movie and it's supported with spectacular f/x, creepy explanations, technical oriented dialogs, and even settings.Horror happens and is exploited here when the Alien grows up and decides to annihilate the tripulation. We get chilling chasing sequences, creepy environments that breathe death and uncertainty, a scary monster, and nightmarish sounds.The action is non-stop and it's equilibrated with clever dialogs and interesting explanations towards the system of the ship, and a new form of life.This is a groundbreaking film that changed cinema in a positive manner. It demonstrates that Hollywood can be dark, violent, unsettling, in terms of quality. Money well spent here.The legend of ""Alien"" started here and created a new form of fear... in space. Plus it's tag line is amongst the best of history.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great Classic!,"This is a great movie, better than I expected. I say that because I am not a fan of horror movies. Since this movie is involved in the sci-fi genre, I decided to check this film out. I am glad I did.The plot is simple. It's about seven crew members aboard a spaceship returning large amounts of mineral ore to Earth. Along the way, they intercept an apparent SOS transmission. But little did the crew know that the transmission is not an SOS, but an warning. One that will end in devastation.The acting is great and believable led by Director Ridley Scott and unknown actress Signourey Weaver. Scott is one of the best directors of all time. Weaver did a great job with Ripley. I also give kudos to John Hurt and Ian Holm, more great actors.The special effects are excellent. Especially for a movie released in 1979. In fact, It won best an Oscar for visual effects.My favorite scene is the when the alien popped out of the chest of one guy. That was scary. I think I should check out the rest of the Alien movies.I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The scariest,"While Aliens is my favorite of the series, Alien is way scarier. Sigourney Weaver delivers a great performance. The music and effects are terrific. What makes this movie scarier than the others is because you never know when the Alien is going to appear and who's next to get it. Unlike the sequels, Alien was more about scares then action. Overall, my second favorite of the movie series.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Best part was Sigourney Weaver's butal cleft.,"Breezy slow burn that can be more than a little hard to get into since it coasts too much on impeccable production design to install an atmosphere.If you can meet it half way for its third act, this is a highly respectable creature feature that never goes too far but also never sags.Well, some of the more dialogue heavy parts do rather annoy when it isn't strictly banter.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
just because a movie is old doesn't mean it's great,This movie was pretty boring in my opinion. I am a believer that just because a movie is old people will instantly say it's the greatest movie ever made. even if that was the case this movie would not even come close to being great. I understand it's a classic but the movie just didn't please to me.,5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Groundbreaking movie for women (?),"There have always been strong women characters in films. But until Aliens, they were usually strong in the context of typical gender archetypes (e.g., mother, wife, seductress, mob moll, nurse, fast-talking career gal, sexy secret agent, etc.) or with a heavy-handed ""superior to any man"" machismo.In the role of Ripley, Sigourney Weaver was simply the hero we all rooted for. It seemed so natural that I think this groundbreaking moment that went largely unnoticed. I had been pointing it out for years and was generally dismissed. But recently, I saw a woman's blog making this same observation and felt vindicated.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A horror masterpiece,"Alien blends science fiction and horror creating one of the finest of both genres.  It's design is fabulously shot creating a claustophobic atmosphere of pure tension.  The opening silence is eerily felt.  The films pace is deliberate building up to a blow out ending. The cast seem like they walked out of Harry's bar and grill.  That's a good thing!Siqourney Weaver is oh so sexy.  Her strong jaw has the strength of ten aliens and when it drops ever so slightly we know humankind will win the war.Alien plays out like a mystery.  Like Agatha Christie's ""And Then there Were None.""  It's formula is simple: One by one until there are none. The script is simple and could have been turned into a disaster but clever and shrewd minds were at play.  H.G. Giger's Alien creation is scary.  It had to be. It's concept has been mimic and overused and has landed in Hollywoods Greatest Creations.The creation of Ashe and Ian Holmes performance must be placed in this category as well.  It was one of the greatest plot twists in cinema history. Who knew?  We knew he was odd but who thought the white milk was the essence?  The Ripley/Ashe confrontation was frightening.  The true enemy is the Earth Company. The true enemy is Politics and Business. We are all expendable.

Great Film,"Recently saw the Directors Cut version in the cinema, much, much better on the big-screen than on the horrible 20-year old VHS tape I saw it on the first time last year. It's wierd, I saw Alien the last out of all 4 Alien movies, I used to watch Aliens when it was on TV every year in the late 80's/early 90's, must have seen that half a dozen times.I imagine that watching Alien for the first time back in 1979 before anyone knew of the ""Aliens"" must have been incredible, I felt a little closer to those original Alien watchers with my big-screen experience. The movie had much more impact, was more immersive and made me jump slightly several times in the cinema. I'm not sure what scenes were added for this version but it seems surprising that scenes were cut in the first place considering the running time is under 2 hours.Alien is a damn good film, pipped at the post by Aliens for all-around best Alien film. Alien is definately the scariest of the lot and is an expert film in every regard (I'm still not sure about the use of dripping water though). The film had a slightly ""Thing""-ish quality in that there's a lone beast that can stike at any time, and it's not clear who is friend and who is foe, it was good to see all these now well-known actors in younger bodies trying to save their own skin. See this at a cinema get if you get the opportunity, or watch the DVD on a big screen with surround sound in a darkened room.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A classic film that withstands the test of time.,"I watched this again recently as part of the Quadrilogy release. This was perhaps the first time all the way through since I missed it in the theaters (I was a newlywed and still in college...no money for movie tickets back then!). I am very impressed with how well this film has stood up over the years. The plot, while basic, does hold the attention of the audience. The acting is superb across the board and each of the actors makes the most out of the roles and clearly differentiates the characters. The special effects are very effective, even though they don't stack up to Star Wars or Close Encounters due to the film's limited budget. It is actually a very good thing that Ridley Scott did not attempt to make the same type of special-effects movie, since the plot, acting, and directing clearly carry the movie without it. In fact, this movie is much better than most movies that rely heavily on special effects, especially those cgi-heavy offerings such as The Hulk, The Matrix, and The Day After that offer nothing but special effects.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"A good one, very original, but Aliens is better.","Alien was a very good movie, keeping up the suspense and horror all the time, mostly thanks to Ridley Scott's directing. But as a matter of fact I liked Aliens better. Aliens has more action, while the original film is based on scary environments. You don't get to see the creature that much, which is good, because the appearance of this thing is not the interesting part (no offense to the creature designer H.R. Giger, it looks pretty good), the important thing is that it's there. One thing that makes Alien so good is that you don't know if the creature can be killed or not, which you knew already from the beginning in Aliens. But still the sequel gets a higher vote from me... Alien was also a really original film. Alien creatures is nothing new, but living organisms growing inside a human being was well thought out...And the special effects are dazzling for their time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Chest Bursting Panties,"Sigourney isn't known for her chest bursting cup size but she sets a bar for 70s pantie shots. This film isn't just about Sigourney in panties though. It's about Sigourney in panties fighting super cool aliens. And not just any aliens! Acid blood, drooling aliens designed by H. R. Giger! The giant Space Jockey pilot alien you see in this film is awesomely impressive. The visionary version of the future and the way this ordinary work crew is organised all feels very authentic. Many similarities to The Abyss and just as visually exciting. The conceptual art is only part of how cool this film is. The casting is impressive too. All roles are played with subtlety that seems more common in the 70s, but works. And of course you get your strong female lead in panties at the tail end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien,"Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece Alien is a movie that continues to enthrall audiences and critics alike more than forty years after its initial release. It is a timeless classic that blends elements of horror, science fiction, and suspense into a genuinely terrifying experience.The film follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo as they answer an unknown distress call and make an unexpected detour to explore an alien planet. While exploring, one of the crew members, Kane (John Hurt), discovers a strange pod containing an alien lifeform that attaches itself to his face. After he recovers from his ordeal, it quickly becomes apparent that the alien lifeform has implanted itself inside him.What follows is a relentless pursuit of terror and suspense as the alien slowly begins to grow in size and strength while picking off each of the crew members one by one. In addition, there is something incredibly effective about how Scott slowly builds up the tension throughout the film with some clever editing tricks and expertly crafted set pieces that help you feel like you're right there with them in their seemingly hopeless situation.Scott uses practical effects to bring this horror show to life in spectacular fashion with various creature designs that are still iconic today. The titular Xenomorph is incredibly terrifying as it stalks its prey through tight corridors and vents while making bloodcurdling screams along the way. The creature design looks so realistic that it still holds up after all these years, thanks to some incredible work by special effects artist H. R. Giger, who designed the creature (as well as many other memorable creatures).The cast also delivers strong performances, with Sigourney Weaver leading the charge as Ellen Ripley, whose iconic performance in this movie helped redefine what strong female characters could do on the screen and led her to become an icon for future generations of women in Hollywood movies. She helps give Alien added emotional weight as we watch her character go through her journey as she tries desperately to survive against insurmountable odds-and runs into her inner demons along the way. Meanwhile, actors such as Veronica Cartwright (Lambert), Yaphet Kotto (Parker), Harry Dean Stanton (Brett), Ian Holm (Ash), and Tom Skerritt (Dallas) provide more depth to their characters which helps us understand why they are driven by fear or ambition when facing their greatest challenge yet: escaping from an unstoppable force of destruction aboard a doomed spaceship!When viewed today, Alien's influence can be felt in almost every sci-fi/horror movie made since its release; from James Cameron's Aliens sequel, which expanded upon Ripley's story, to the chest-bursting scene in David Cronenberg's The Fly and even to Ridley Scott's Prometheus, which pays homage to Alien by revisiting its themes of existential dread and human survival. Even after decades, Alien remains one of the most beloved and influential sci-fi movies of all time. It is clear that Alien has had an immense impact on both popular culture and filmmaking, a fact that can be attributed to its masterful blend of horror, sci-fi, and suspense elements. Alien created a new genre that has since been embraced by audiences worldwide, and it is a timeless classic that will continue to inspire filmmakers for generations to come.At its core, though, Alien remains one of those rare movies that can actually scare people, even if they've seen it dozens of times before, because it focuses on creating tension between man vs. Nature scenarios instead of relying on cheap jump scares or gore. This makes Ridley Scott's vision timeless and shows how effective filmmaking techniques can still produce gripping experiences no matter what genre you're dealing with.Alien is an absolute must-watch for any fan of horror or sci-fi. Its tremendous impact can be seen almost everywhere today, from modern blockbusters to low-budget indie films that look to this classic piece of film history for ideas. It's an excellent example of what a quality genre film should be like. A suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish will surely leave you wanting more once it ends (Aliens, anyone?), making it an essential viewing experience everyone should take part in at least once, if only just to appreciate the sheer genius behind Scott's vision! 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The Magic Of Alien,"Part of the secret of this film is that you never get a good look at the alien. All you see is hints and glimpses. While this may seem to have been done to cover for poor creature effects, the reality is that it adds to the tension. Alien is an exercise in quiet tension and measured intensity from start to finish. This effect would have dissolved if we had seen the xenomorph in full.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Jaws + Space= Alien!,"""Jaws in Space."" The perfect three words to describe 1979's unique Alien. If you look at it closely, Alien is very similar to Jaws. An abnormal giant creature is terrorizing a bunch of innocent humans, and even the introduction to each monster is eerily similar. I really dig the influences that Jaws made on Alien. I liked how they hid the alien until the end, where we finally get to see him in all his grotesque glory. The 1970's was a hard time for sci-fi. Not many science fiction movies were made in the midst of American exploitation films, but luckily Star Wars and Close Encounters changed everything. Because of the success of those films, one of the best sci-fi/horror classics of the twentieth century was able to get produced. I am not much of a horror guy but if you are able to add a science-fiction element to the horror and actually make it good, well you can count me in. I enjoyed nearly everything about this film from start to finish.One of the film's best strengths is its pacing. It moves purposely at a slow pace. People would expect the movie to be about the alien from the start, but the alien does not begin its reign of terror until the movie has been running for a good amount of time. But we are treated to wonderful characterizations (conversations on money shares), the silence of space, and the anticipation of what will happen next. But from the start, it's worth investing your time into the characters of the ship, The Nostromo. Another strength is the production design thanks in part to designer H.R Geiger. The Nostromo has a wonderful design to it and you can tell the influences from Star Wars. But what about the creature himself? My goodness, they are scary-looking creatures. From the harmless looking chest-burster to the killing machine that is called the Alien, they are visually disgusting creatures (in a good way). In today's day and age of movies, the visual effects still hold up very well. The effects actually won an Oscar.The Nostromo is a commercial deep-space vessel on its way home when it picks up an SOS signal from a distant planet. The SOS signal awakens the crew from their deep hypersleep way earlier than anticipated, The seven-man crew is led by Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and the rest of the crew consists of Ripley (Signourey Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm), and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). Once they get to the signal, they realize that this was not an SOS signal at all. It was a signal of danger now that a very dangerous lifeform is a stowaway on their ship. Will they be able to destroy the alien before they get destroyed themselves? Another reason why the movie works so well is the presence of a strong female lead character. So we have ourselves a 70's rarity: a female-driven science-fiction movie. Signourey Weaver's Ripley plays out like a character straight out of a 1950's movie and I love it. Ripley is a hero worth remembering in future movies. Weaver is the most important character of the movie, but let's not forget about the rest of the cast. I find the ages of everybody interesting. A typical horror or thriller movie has most of their characters between 20-30. Outside of Weaver and Cartwright, everyone is 35 or older. I liked that because they added experience to their characters thus making us care more about their fates. Ian Holm was the oldest cast member at 46, and is the second most important character. His character is actually an android and his profession is a science officer. So you might have the feeling he will play a pivotal role with the alien (and the humans) fates. I must give a shout-out to John Hurt for taking it so well the fate of his character, Kane. Kane happened to be the lucky fellow involved in the horrifying chest-bursting sequence. I've seen this movie several times and the shock value of this scene still remains at a high point.This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, whom would go on to have an impressive career in Hollywood. But this movie is where he was mostly introduced to the film world. He did one hell of a job directing the movie. This movie could have easily been a movie with cheap scares, but he grounded the movie. He made it much more than just the alien. In a way, you can count this as another similarity to Jaws. That shark movie began the mighty career of Steven Spielberg..just like this film did with Ridley Scott.Overall, I really enjoyed Alien so much. This movie spawned many sequels and spin-offs, but none of them impacted me like this movie did although 1986's Aliens is also a classic. The movie is scary and thrilling, but Ridley Scott's powerful directing and Signourey Weaver's acting prowess did much to elevate the movie. Then there was the impressive visuals, the good use of sound (a smooth mixture of silence and Jerry Goldsmith's score), the good script by Dan O'Bannon. This is really an unforgettable classic and its up there with Jaws (yep, I mentioned it again) as my favorite horror movies from the 1970s'. If these kind of films have a good story, then you bet I'll like them.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One word. Classic!,"One of probably the top five most influential Sci-Fi movies, another being Blade Runner. Both of which were directed by Ridley Scott. Making me wonder why he has not returned to the Sci-Fi genre which is far and away his most successful genre. It can be done, Spielberg returned to Sci-Fi recently with Minority Report too great success. This film is superb, it spawned a genre in itself and is still a big influence. Visually this is only matched by probably Scott's other big Sci-Fi movie Blade Runner. The designs and the sets by HR Geiger are fantastic and Scott more than ably makes them look even better. The film was deservedly a record breaking film when it first came out. The cast are brilliant, the film is surprising and fresh and very tense. Sigourney Weaver does well in her star making role, capturing the screen from her initial supporting part to becoming the centre of the movie to many peoples surprise. Even before people have seen the movie they have probably seen many of the iconic pieces of imagery. I can only add that men will drool over Sigourney's tight skimpy knickers at the end. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Terrifying,"It is difficult to believe that director Ridley Scott's frightening and terrifying film was made in the seventies. Alien still possesses an impressive vigor and strength, such as another classic that also seems so fresh and vivid, Deliverance, a powerful adventure about four common people who are hunted down by hillbillies in some river of Georgia. Alien places a crew of astronauts being threatened by an implacable alien that kills each one of them without mercy. The gigantic sceneries and the disturbing visual (the scene in which Kane - John Hurt - explores a cave has a terrific impact) were remarkable and brought innovation for movie making, because at the time, the vision that Hollywood had of space was bright and clean (Star Wars).This dark, tense visual helped to increase more fear and suspense to the story. Ridley Scott's direction is outstanding  - he develops his characters carefully, giving to every actor a chance to shine. Scott develops real ""characters"", and not fearless heroes, in a way this makes the people inside the theaters to identify themselves with the protagonists. Scott created memorable scenes,it's impossible to forget John Hurt's horrible, cruel death : alongside with Ned Beatty's rape in Deliverance, this scene is one of the most gruesome things ever putted on the screen.One of the greatest films of all time, I highly recommend Alien's DVD, Twentieth Century Fox made an outstanding job with it, adding extras, trailers, commentary and more. And don't forget to check Deliverance if you haven't seen it yet.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

There are some scenes where it can get a little gory at times but if you aren't going to faint at the at of blood then it's definitely worth a watch. Also the aliens aren't really that scary either but that's just my opinion. Also the swearing isn't that bad at all.

What's that lurking behind you?????,"I can understand the impact of this film to the moviegoers back in 1979. Back then the form of the alien is not much known. People had to sit until the end of the show to catch the glimpse of the monster. We know that the characters had been killed when we heard them screamed or suddenly the radio went off.But I feel that the younger moviegoers (generation-Y???)nowadays may find 'Alien' boring. First of all the movie move very slowly much like '2001: Space Odyssey'. In addition to this, the alien is no mystery anymore. People can buy the alien figurines almost anywhere. We saw the alien and said, ""Hey this alien is cute, can I keep it?""I think it is not very harsh to say that the scary element in this movie is not that relevant anymore.

1980 Oscar for best special effectsSummary of my review: this movie lives up to its reputation. It has withstood the test of time and I am certain it will continue to do so. The plot, cast, acting, mystery, survival horror, orchestra even, space ship design, alien design, special effects, cinematography, and everything else was done right in this movie. Anyone who gives it less than 9 obviously has zero idea of how movies are made and clearly does not comprehend how excellent this movie was for its time and even now 41 years later.Finally watched this movie for the first time. FINALLY I watched the one that started it the franchise. 7+ alien movies and 20 (?) games?It is incredibly ironic that I watched the PREQUELS Prometheus (2012) and Alien Covenant (2017) when they came out in their respective years, BEFORE I watched this 1979 movie in 2020, so after watching this 1979 film and the 1986 sequel both yesterday, I realized that I already knew how the aliens came into existence and the irony that I was not supposed to know. Anyone born in the '90s and later, will have this same experience if they decide to watch the 1979, 1986, 1992, & 1997 movies after having watched the 2012 and 2017 prequels.As a kid, on TV I randomly saw bits and pieces of one of the pre-2000s alien movies but I never really watched a full alien movie. I first watched Alien vs. Predator (2004), which I loved and have watched it 3x so far? Then Prometheus (2012), and then Alien: Covenant (2017).For a 1979 movie, this movie is excellent and the ratings and the box office make this obvious. And even for 2020, it is still a great film. I have seen footage of how movies are made so I know that it is very tough to not only make movies but to also make them believable, and that it can take up to 1,000+ people to make a single movie. It is really tough work.So for 1979, despite all limitations of its time, this movie successfully led me and all audiences to believe that these people were truly in space, in a real spaceship, that they went to an alien planet, that they were genuinely afraid of the alien, and that the alien was real, alive and terrifying. All of it felt REAL so this was excellent work done.People that do not know how movies are made cannot comprehend how hard it is to make the audience believe that all of these things are real. Whoever gives this movie less than 9/10 clearly has zero idea of how movies are made and is incapable of comprehending how amazing this movie is for its time and even if watched in 2020 or beyond.Strengths:Mystery + survival horror were executed excellently.Plot is simple and flows smoothly. It had a proper introduction of the characters and their circumstances. The alien is introduced and the following events are predictable but flow perfectly. There is mystery for half the film and then survival horror for the second half. Ending was good.Acting - no complaints from me. The characters pretended really well that they were in a spaceship in space and pretended really well to be afraid of the alien. I liked all the actors and they all did good.Alien design / special effects - excellent.Spaceship design / special effects - excellent.Cinematography - excellent camerawork and light/shadow use esp. the close camera shots of the alien were perfect to make it look super scary. The dark atmosphere was perfect to make the alien seem like it could be anywhere and seeing it emerge from the shadows was terrifying. Just excellent.Conclusion: same as summary. Now on to the sequel!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Great!,"Director Ridley Scott's well-honed talents of pacing and editing create a tense atmosphere that superbly conveys dread and fear of an unknown, unseen evil entity. In 1979, the technology didn't exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do. Everyone who loves this movie knows what I'm talking about. Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit. Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger's hallucinations to make a successful picture.The dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Giger's vision of ""biomechanical"" adds a style rarely replicated in film. Only he could create such a terrifying creature. Seriously, the xenomorphs are among the scariest monsters ever filmed. They're not your typical greens or grays....I just wish the characters were stronger. I didn't connect with any member of the cast. Not even Ripley. I couldn't get beyond their occupation, or role in the story. This is a big problem when the movie's pace is slow. Since I already knew a lot of the plot points, the suspense sometimes felt boring. It doesn't need a lot of development, but some more personality would have gone a long way. Also, ultimately, the plot is a typical slasher/creature feature. Its one of the best, sure. Its still predictable.While I don't think its the best movie of any genre, I enjoyed it, and defiantly respect its ambition. If you haven't watched it yet, its pretty good. And if you don't know the details, you're in for some shocking surprises~",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
the words amazing and stupefying don't define this movie; the words stupid and dull do,"This is not a scary movie, but indeed a gross one. The reasons this movie is stupid are that they wasted the first hour of the film doing absolutely nothing, and there was so much use of unnecessary gore and graphic violence that it made the film ridiculously stupid. Just take out the ""stupi"" in stupefying and add a D to the end. That will tell you everything you need to know. If you want a scary movie that won't make you heave when you look at water and milk and think they're alien drool, don't rent this garbage. I wish I had never seen this disgusting film, because I truly would have been better off without seeing it. Back then in the 70's, scary movies were absolutely disgusting and gory, so I'd rent something new that's from our time if I were you.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Has probably the most accurate title of all time,"I'm pretty sure this was the first real horror film I ever saw. I think I was about 13, and that's about all I remember. Haven't rewatched it since then, but I'm really glad I didn't because this felt almost like a fresh experience.I'm also pretty sure 13 year old me must have been really bored by this if I remembered so little of it, and to be honest, I can't really blame him because the first half an hour or so was genuinely not all that interesting to me. As soon as a certain little grabby bugger shows up, that's when it started becoming amazing.It would have been nicer if I cared more about everyone on board the ship, because frankly I didn't, but everything else...wow. The set design, the acting, the atmosphere, the directing, and especially the design of the alien, even for as little as you see it, it's one of the best monster designs ever made.I can't quite say I thought it was a masterpiece, but...come on, it's Alien, and if you somehow haven't seen it yet, then what are you actually doing?

Classically Perfect!,There isn't much that can be said about this film aside from it was the beginning of a Life Long Love of the Science Fiction genre.

"Superb attention to detail, intelligent plot.","One of my favourite movies.What enthrals me every time I see it, is the intelligence behind the whole thing, the way the people and spaceships look and operate is believable (eg a tug towing a huge mineral refinery through space - obviously if the journey takes months, it makes sense to not just transport the minerals, but refine them while you do it - little points like that make this a jewel of a film).Of course the main thing is the Alien, which is again handled most intelligently, instead of the normal Hollywood approach of spending all the budget on special monster effects to the detriment of the story and thus having to justify that expense by showing you the monster in as many different, ultimately boring ways as possible, its left mostly to our imaginations (far more powerful than any effect) with only a few glimpses to keep the tension going.  The incubation idea borrowed from the desert wasp and the lifecycle of the Alien is intriguing, its not just another monster ""created"" by radiation or some superficial reason, somebody put some thought into it, I appreciate that.The temptation for large explosions and massive weaponry is resisted most admirably. Instead the story, acting, attention to detail and management of tension and mood by Ripely Scott still make me cower behind a pillow after seeing this movie many times.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Sci-fi horrors,"""Alien"" is still remembered with merit not only of the film that started a billion-dollar franchise, but also as one of the most modern and tasteful examples of sci-fi horror. The plot is nothing revolutionary, and most of the characters are a little more than meat for the monster. It's the fortunate combination H. R. Giger's modern design and Ridley Scott's taut and precise direction that could elevate the Xenomorph to one of the most iconic monsters in history. Unlike its action-packed sequels, ""Alien"" focuses exclusively on slowly building up the tension with its dark and claustrophobic atmosphere, with endless silences and only measured appearances of the Xenomorph. Its appearances are sporadic and incredibly brief, but manage to create an increasing sense of anticipation and, at the same time, mask the limits of the special effects. A lot of the tensest moments actually happen when the Xenomorph is still off-screen. It's a Lovecraftian horror movie that plays on the psychological side, and that will not satisfy the ones looking for high-paced slasher carnages.The innovative art direction was one of the first examples of ""gothic"" sci-fi in cinema, with gritty and slimy sets opposed to the colorful and monumental fantasy of films like ""Star Wars"" or ""Planet of the Apes"". The meticulous work on the special effects to recreate Giger's design stood the test of time incredibly well, the Xenomorph is a bit stiff but still, everything looks way more elegant and tasteful than any of the sequels. Cinematography and artwork are just on a whole different level.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"The first in the brilliant series, but not nearly as essential as  its sequels.","Alien is the first movie in the saga of Ripley.  The movie has not aged well, but it is worth a watch if you have watched the other three movies. The movie has poor effects and poor acting, which is improved in the sequels. The only thing that makes it worth seeing is the fact that it is an Alien-movie, but it lacks the excitement, action, tension and atmosphere of the next three Alien-movies. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Agatha Christie in Space,"This wonderful film reminds me a little of Agatha Christie's 'And then there were none', and is filled with fantastic actors, superb sets, and a brilliant score by Jerry Goldsmith.Although made in 1979, the actual Alien design is amazing and in my opinion, is one of the best things about this wonderful film. It all semms as though it was made in 2021.I'm a big fan of tense thrillers where there is somebody/something on the loose and it's a chilling game of cat and mouse. In this film, the corridors and rooms of the spaceship, although tiny, almost seem spacious, empty and sinister.The cast really make this fantastic and really play on eachothers' fears, strengths and weaknesses. Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton and Yaphet Kotto all played their parts so well and contributed to the tension throughout.This, and the original STAR WARS trilogy, are my favourite movies set in space.Enjoy!!10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The alien itself is horrifying for its time and gives the movie a great sense of terror and suspense to those who watch it. A solid soundtrack from the Great Jerry Goldsmith and a very well paced and well written plot, which Scott executes greatly and gives the story justice.

A Sci-fi/horror classic!,"This is the epitome of an excellent sci-horror movie that nails everything and still ups today. The cast was great, Sigourney Weaver is still known for the Alien franchise and this one (along with the sequel Aliens) are the reasons why. The small cramp hallways and vents are the perfect setting for building terror. The synthetic crew member added to that tension as well creating this whole question of ""can you really trust him?"". The alien creature was well designed and the special effects were very well done for its time. Again, given the horror elements the effects still hold up in 2020.If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror OR sci-fi you owe it to yourself to watch this film before you die.

Perfect set/alien designs by H.R Giger, top-notch acting from an all stellar cast, a fine musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and last but not least, the very film that put Ridley Scott, on the cinematic map. Of an interesting note the great Walter Hill, with no previous experience of the Sci-Fi genre, ended up as the producer (and also writing one of the first drafts). Originally they had scripted the alien to impregnate a female member of the crew but they thought that this most shocking of concepts, was taking it (what is almost a B-movie plot) a bit too far. Still though a stand alone classic, that in space and time will never be forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"""Oh, God. It's moving right towards you...""","""Alien"" was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. It is difficult to imagine the science fiction and horror cinematic landscape prior to Alien's release. It was the forerunner to audience's expectations of sci-fi and more broadly horror. It won the Academy Award for ""Best Visual Effects"", and it is important to understand the significance of that win, as horror films in general tend to be overlooked when it comes to Academy Award's. In fact, only a small percentage of horror films have ever been nominated for an Academy Award - in any category - and an even smaller percentage of that have won.What I like most about ""Alien"" and the subsequent sequels in the franchise, is how the success of the film gave birth to the fictional world in which ""Alien"" is set in, the terminology, the Xenomorph - essentially the fandom of the franchise. That is one of the reasons why there is so much longevity in the franchise, how they can expand and branch out, and create new fresh plots. The iconic ""Chestburster"" scene lingers long in the memory of horror fans. That scene is truly worthy of nightmare stuff! Alien's terrifying antagonist, the Xenomorph creature, was created using various techniques, and it was largely practical special effects - which only made the Xenomorph that more terrifying. Ridley Scott would later remark that ""The real thing's always better"".Alien really pushed the envelope, with its cutting-edge innovations which helped mould and shape the horror, and sci-fi genres. Quite literally every single aspect of this film is carefully thought-out and tailored to the highest of standards. The cinematography and setting is bleak, cold, and unforgiving - it's akin to the creeping terror of the Xenomorph's!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Top 3 best space-based science fiction films,"Alien, along with 2001 and Star Wars, are the three best science fiction films based in space. All other films of this type contain elements from at least one of these films, usually more than one. Alien's biggest contribution is it's atmosphere. The sets and camera choices give a specific and intense feeling watching it. This is a combination of Ridley Scott's and H.R. Giger's influence. The best shot in the film is the close up of Ripley all sweaty and dirty emerging from the ladder. Beads of sweat lace her fingers and then the focus goes to her face, scared as can be. Great.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Rewatching Alien is like diving into a masterclass of horror and science fiction. Ian Holm's character, Ash, may call the alien ""structural perfection,"" but it's Ridley Scott's film that truly embodies flawless creation. Alien stands as a bona-fide classic, a true study in terror. Even after 45 years, the film remains as gripping and effective as ever.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ripley is nothing short of iconic. She brings a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability to the role, making Ripley one of sci-fi's first and most enduring heroines. I can feel her fear and determination to survive in every scene, which makes the character deeply relatable and compelling.The ensemble cast is diverse and adds rich, unique elements to the film. Each character feels distinct and essential to the story. Giger's designs are otherworldly, adding an eerie and unforgettable aesthetic to the alien and its environment. One of my favourite moments is Cartwright's genuine reaction to the chestburster scene, which remains a highlight in cinematic history.Scott's direction is impeccable. He demonstrates that less is more, using clanking chains, dripping water, mist, and dark corners to build a tense and immersive atmosphere. By keeping the alien mostly in the shadows, he amplifies the fear and suspense. There are a few moments where Scott uses more traditional scares, such as Dallas' encounter in the tube, but the subtle integration of the alien into the ship's environment is a far more effective source of terror.While there are a few elements that haven't aged perfectly, like the alien running across the table or some of the dated computer scenes and sounds, these minor flaws are easily overlooked. Dismissing these aspects due to their age does a disservice to the incredible work and creativity that went into making this film.Alien is a classic in every sense, a film I never tire of watching. It's a flawless experience that perfectly blends horror and science fiction, showcasing Ridley Scott's unparalleled ability to craft a timeless and terrifying masterpiece.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

I gave it a 5 out of respect.,"Respect for what came after it. I'm sure Alien was a fantastic film for its time in 79, but it aged extremely poorly. Though without it's past success we wouldn't have the alien franchise that I'm trying to watch in order. Prometheus, Covenant, and AVP we're all enjoyable, with the first two listed actually ending up fairly good. Those films were what urged me to check out the originals.However, this film is a snoozefest. I watched it three times (attempted), falling asleep each time it was on. I'm writing this review with 45 minutes left of the film and I'm likely not going to finish it. Out of love for the newer installments and respect for the franchise I'm going to move on and try to watch Aliens and Alien 3 and Resurrection, but if they were anything like Alien then I'm sure it'll be another plot hole filled boring film.Again. 5/10.Respect for the franchise. It did well for its time. It's an old film at this point. Just aged very poorly.

"Very good, but overrated","Very good but overrated science fiction film stars Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, a member of an intergalatic crew invaded by an alien, hence the title. What may have seemed in cool in 1979 now seems a bit dated and at times even boring. The film tries to take its time to build up tension, which is a good thing but unfortunately it also makes the beginning seem slow, and the padded running time doesn't help matters. Unlike STAR WARS, ALIEN does not quite stand the test of time. Still, the film stands out as one of the best of the 1970s. The movie was followed by four sequels: ALIENS which was far superior, ALIEN 3 which was awful, ALIEN: RESURRECTION which was just as bad as ALIEN 3 if not worse, and ALIEN VS.

In space no one can hear you scream!,"Alien is a masterpiece of horror and science fiction. Ridley Scott made a film for the ages that sprouted many sequels and a whole industry in itself but it is nice to see how simple the first film is executed. Alien is a perfect example of a director gradually elevating the level of energy and anticipation in a motion picture. The way Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock. This atmosphere-soaked production relies on the viewer's imagination to enhance the alien's nightmarishness. Scott carefully restricts how much we see of the creature - there's enough to provide our minds with horrifying images, but not so much that the illusion is spoiled. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere ""boo"" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest.

Still unsurpassed as a dark sci-fi film,"It's amazing how more than 25 five years (hell, I'm 25) after its release, Alien still reigns as a major landmark in film making, especially in the science fiction and horror genres. Any new film that comes out that features either space ships, or monsters, or both, will be compared to Alien. And 99 times out of 100, it will fall short.Maybe where Alien succeeds and most fail is at building a sense of tension that is almost unbearable at times. Ridley Scott explores the desolation of space, bringing it into the space ships and making it nearly a character in the film. Add to that a monster that is scarcely seen throughout the movie (remember that old rule in horror, that says that the less you see it, the scarier it is?), and you have a masterpiece that refuses to get old.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Superior horror film which executes the basics more than just efficiently.,"They must have thought that that was very clever of them when they first conceived it: depict a female character undress to her briefs, whilst alone in an enclosed space capsule. Then, have her walk around for a bit, distract the audience by leaning over slightly, and then 'wham!' - have the monster of the piece wriggle around a bit in the background within the confines of a crawlspace it has found for itself... Much water has passed beneath the proverbial bridge by this point in the film, however, but it does demonstrate quite perfectly how rudimentary 'jump' scenes such as the one just described can be as effective as this one is if everything around it is executed properly.The cynic inside of me thinks that, at a time when George Lucas and co. were blasting away at the cinema screen via the ""Star Wars"" films - essentially using outer space as a playground for all manner of shoot-outs and interplanetary crafts hurtling around the place at top speed - Ridley Scott and his team were doing something calmer and more effective much more quietly. In ""Alien"", space is a bleak, lonely place - its ships, like the transport vessels on the open oceans of Earth hundreds of years ago, hulk peacefully through tremendous fields of nothingness, its crew eager to get home, its journey devoid of notoriety, its androids not quirky and funny but potentially deadly.The film begins with some seemingly unnecessary tracking shots through the corridors of the ship itself, the Nostromo - it appears empty, and surprisingly narrow for its size. The film appears to be introducing to the audience the venue for the fight which is set to follow. On the bridge, some mechanical whirring brings a computer to life and a screen seems to then uncannily 'interact' with a stationary helmet positioned on top of a seat. We then play witness to the crew of seven waking up from some kind of enhanced sleep for long journeys. What becomes evident here and in the following scenes is that there is no clear lead - a captain, played by Tom Skerritt, might fit the bill; so too might an engineer named Parker (Yaphet Kotto), whose qualm with some kind of futuristic payment scheme the film seems to think is important and is something we expect to be resolved later on.Otherwise, things are fairly anonymous - ""Alien"" keeping its cards close to its chest. When the crew try to figure out why they've been awoken prematurely, given there is no sign of Earth, the film positions the character of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) nearer the back of the bridge and away from the consoles the navigators check for answers. What the crew come up with is a repetitive signal radiating out from a nearby moon every twelve seconds, and conspire to investigate it as per space protocol. In this space-set universe, and unlike Lucas', mankind has seemingly succeeded in avoiding contact with lots of different galactic creatures - convergence with a foreign body not of Earth's proportion is a rare thing.Still with no clear lead, a gang of volunteers venture out into a storm after the ship has landed on the moon - the inhospitable weather, violent winds and unwelcoming atmosphere conspiring to act as a kind of warning or prelude for the situation to come. Having bravely nominated himself to be amongst the first to investigate, and then to go below-deck once they discover a shipwreck, John Hurt's character Kane presents himself to the audience as a protagonist of sorts: the explorer, the discoverer - what he discovers are thousands of small eggs and then something else besides when he gets a little too close.Back on board the Nostromo, the events which play out for the rest of the film have etched themselves into a kind of cinematic legend - is there a person alive who does not know how the biology of the face-hugger works? Or what to expect when you're not expecting? Apparently paralysed by his venture, our volunteer hero Kane is seemingly out of the equation as two others in the form of the aforementioned Captain Dallas and a science officer named Ash (Ian Holm) step up to take his place. But why does the film think it important for Dallas to digress said officer was only instated on the mission mere days before disembarkation? Saints be praised, Kane appears to wake up and we have our lead back...The genius behind ""Alien"" within the confines of its genre and what it's attempting to do lies in what director Ridley Scott does with what he has at his disposal. Much later on, when we sense the creature is in a large storage hold with one of the crewmembers, Scott uses the water dripping down from a vent shaft high in the ceiling to create a leathery sound as it rebounds off a crewman's cap, and we're never quite sure if we're hearing that or the monster's own limbs wriggling into an attack position.As a setting, the old beaten up Nostromo itself makes for the perfect locality - there is certainly something in the way it hulks towards us in the film's opening few shots, heavy in the load it's carrying, and we sense it has seen better days. Its interior lighting is a little funky, illuminating some parts of some corridors and not others, as would reflect its deterioration over time. It feels like an unreliable host, even more so when it is damaged upon landing on the mysterious moon, and this paranoia of the on-board technology betraying us later occurs.Simplicity is the key to ""Alien"" - its three-act structure, the first of which culminates with the egg discovery; the second of which concludes with the alien's birth and the third of which concludes with the biggest bang of them all, before a brief postface, is executed brilliantly. Reputation and place in popular culture aside, see ""Alien"" if you have not already done so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream","Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, is a masterclass in science fiction and horror, blending the two genres in a way that would become a blueprint for future films. Released in 1979, the film follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo, who encounter a deadly alien lifeform after investigating a distress signal on an uncharted planet. What begins as a routine mission turns into a nightmare as the alien begins to stalk and kill the crew one by one. With its groundbreaking visuals, slow-building tension, and iconic performances, Alien remains one of the most influential films in cinematic history.Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Ellen Ripley is a defining performance in genre cinema, establishing Ripley as one of the most iconic and resilient protagonists in film history. Weaver brings depth and authenticity to the role, capturing Ripley's quiet intelligence, her growing terror, and her ultimate transformation into a determined survivor. The supporting cast, including Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, and Ian Holm, are all exceptional, adding to the sense of realism as the crew members react to the increasing horror around them.Ridley Scott's direction is nothing short of brilliant, using minimalism and atmosphere to create a palpable sense of dread and claustrophobia. The ship's labyrinthine corridors and the dark, oppressive setting of the Nostromo become almost characters themselves, amplifying the sense of isolation and helplessness. Scott's use of shadows, slow reveals, and long, tense takes keeps the tension building throughout, relying on psychological horror and suspense rather than cheap scares. The design of the alien, created by H. R. Giger, is iconic, blending organic and mechanical elements into a creature that is both terrifying and fascinating.The film's pacing is perfect, with moments of quiet tension followed by sudden bursts of terror that keep viewers on edge. The sound design and Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score enhance the atmosphere, making even the silence of space feel filled with foreboding. Alien plays with the idea of the ""unknown"" in a way that few films do, exploring the fear of an alien force that is far beyond human comprehension.What truly sets Alien apart is its mastery of genre. It's both a terrifying horror film and a thought-provoking science fiction exploration, blending elements of body horror, psychological terror, and survival. The film's feminist undertones, with Ripley's character standing apart from typical horror tropes, only add to its cultural significance. The iconic chest-bursting scene and the final confrontation with the alien remain some of the most unforgettable moments in cinematic history.In conclusion, Alien is a genre-defining film that still holds up as one of the best sci-fi and horror films ever made. With its superb direction, unforgettable performances, and chilling atmosphere, Alien is a timeless classic that continues to influence and inspire filmmakers and horror enthusiasts alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
I Had To Write About It Eventually,"It's hard to put into words what makes this film so great. At the time when I was just getting into watching movies seriously, this movie captured my heart and hasn't let go since. Every watch feels like a brand new experience where I'm once again faced with the terror of an unknown creature stalking in the dark. This movie presents itself in a dark, worn world that seems like a close, foreseeable future. While Star Wars tried to craft a similarly lived-in world two years earlier, the difference lies in the creator's view of human kind in the stars. Ridley Scott gives us a world where humanity's greed has spread across the galaxy, so that your average spaceship is an industrialized freighter. The horror that this movie accomplishes is tied to this dark atmosphere. These corporate hallways don't feel safe, they feel cold. This atmosphere is accented by Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score that ties together the awe of space travel and the terror of that same abyss into some iconic tracks.Ultimately what Alien leaves you with is the fear of the unknown. What is more terrifying than something you cannot control or understand? Especially when said thing is trying to kill you. I haven't even mentioned so much of this movie that is excellent. The script is outstanding and every person on the cast brings their all to present a believable and lovable group of characters. 41 years after Alien's release, I would argue that it is still unmatched in quality. I love this film more than any other, and I can only hope that it will continue to be passed on to countless generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Mystery & Terror,"There is no big scene, there is only one adult alien from appearance to appearance, but the mystery and fear that people bring is the strongest; the first part lays the ""power is evil"".

one of the best old scary movies,"there were many scary movies made in the seventies that today are considered classics (e.g. Jaws, Halloween, Piranha, and ripoffs & sequels). Unfortunately i wasn't born in that decade, so i couldn't see anyone of these movies, i've only seen them on the small screen. One of my favorite movies of all time was Jaws, and i still think that that movie deserves the title of ""best scary movie of the 70's"". But, after lately seeing Alien, which many people have told me was a good movie, i think it is a good runner-up. I actually had seen Aliens, the sequel first, which was good. Although, after seeing this one, that movie looks much worse. While Aliens was okay, good, Alien is excellent, great! I know that many people think exactly the opposite, but these people are definitely wrong. It also shows because Alien is actually listed higher in the top 250. Alien was definitely scarier, while Aliens is more of an action/war flick. It was also far too loud and dumb and the action would often get boring. This never gets boring, even if there are scenes where nothing happens. It has great music and excellent set design, it really doesn't look old.I really understand why they call it a masterpiece!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
It's all been said before but it's hard to overstate!,"In a world of crappy writing, jump scares and other cliches it's hard to find good Horror let alone anything that plays the Survival aspect well.

Alls I can say is this holds up better with time, if you haven't seen the first 2 Movies then you aren't able to accurately gauge how amazing this series truly is. The writing, directing, acting and sets seemlessly put together a believeble world. The Alien single handedly makes the case for sticking with practical effects in Horror. Heck, ""The Thing"" and ""Alien 1, 2"" would be 3 prime examples I'd use. It's hard to fear for people you don't care for and hard to fear something that isn't really there. You won't have that problem here, our human and likeble cast are people you care for. Ripley, our warrior goddess in 1979 (before any SJW complaints existed) makes getting her Cat a priority in the Movie and does it intelligently. Just to highlight that these characters are likeble and relateble because they have flaws. I can't really go on any further without Spoilers.

Space and Horror all praise Lovecraft!,"To honor the father of horror I thought to review some film which has taken some inspiration from his work. Although a direct good adaptation of his work, apart from Re-animated, many directors over the years have used his elements to create some of the best horror film in history. My personal favorite is Alien from 1979.But some back-story for its creation is necessary:In 1978 in Ridley Scott had a food poisoning he was send to a hospital to take out that infection and he has said many times how terrified he was having such a alien thing in his body and the damage it made to him and so using that experience and adding some elements from H.P. Lovecraft one of the most historic horror-science fiction was made: Alien! The title itself is fascinating for alien means both an exeterrestrial as we usually use it and the original meaning is foreign, something we are unfamiliar with.This unfamiliarity has its roots of the elements of Lovecraft, which the crew of Alien used,with the most important been the fear of insignificance, the terror that we now face something that we can't say for sure what it is, what it can do and if we can beat. In short cosmic horror, the best kind of horror and even 80 years after the dead of Howard Phillips Lovecraft. And this flick did more that enough to made the audience fear desperate ,trapped and out of breath from fear.A note for new horror director (Who do a really good job with flick like Oculus, Don't Breath, The Witch and my man Del Toro with Crimsob Peak). If you want to create an excellent film take notes from Alien and you will be in a good way. As far as I know horror movies are beginning to come back and I am glad that we passed the era of torture porn. As for the jump-scares the eleventh hour is close!And now for the film itself ,this one Shining, Aliens ,Jaws and Oculus are the only movies that have made my crawl out of horror. The atmosphere is perfect the environment in the space-craft is eerie and all the actors do a fantastic job. As for the creature itself ,go watch man ,just that.All in all this movie is among the many films that you have to watch before you die and worth every minute. Also the extended edition is also perfect unlike with other cases George Lucas!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
How scary could one little alien lifeform be?,"How scary could one little alien lifeform be? Turns out, it's pretty terrifying! Alien, with no ""s"", is where it all started! Ridley Scott and team did an amazing job setting up this franchise, creating a world that sci-fi enthusiasts will be talking about until the end of time. It's mysterious, it's intense, it's beautiful, and most of all, it's terrifying! Fans seem to be decisive on whether they love Alien or the sequel Aliens more, but where Aliens might have more action, Alien does the heavy lifting of ""world building"" and with that, it does an amazing job!The basic story goes like this, a commercial space freighter is on its return trip to Earth when they detect a signal from space that according to the ominous ""Company"", the crew is required to investigate or they forfeit their salaries. Once they land and begin to search the planet, they find an alien spaceship and a new organism that will start a cascade of terrible events, several of which are guaranteed to be burnt into your memory! We are also introduced to many main franchise concepts that will be echoed in all of the future films, and we witness Ripley in her most pure form and discover her motives as an essential character. In fact, all of the actors did an amazing job with each of their characters, building depth not just individually, but as the whole crew.Alien is my personal favorite of the franchise, mainly because of the visual feast of cinematography that is served up for us to enjoy in its perfect 70s sci-fi style. Here we get a raw realistic story of what it would be like to be a part of a crew in space. While the sequel might be a better action movie to watch, in my opinion Alien is the better movie to experience!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Captivating thriller but fails to address bigger questions...,"At the outset, I want to say that although I rate the film 7/10, I was disappointed by it. When I first came across the film, its title, its filmmaker and its general acclaim by the public, I was looking forward to something completely different. What I mean is that there are so many complex questions that the idea of extraterrestrial life throws up, and Alien does not as much as attempt to even pose such questions. What is man's place in the universe? What can the form of a living thing (here, the alien's) teach us about being? Science-fiction is a particularly potent literary form to address such questions. And although I sense the influence of that giant of science-fiction cinema, the one that so magically haunts us with its depiction of man's supposed evolution (yes, I speak of 2001: A Space Odyssey), Alien is nothing more than a thriller that capitalises on its setting in deep space, on the terror of being so far away from home.Having gotten the rant about my initial disappointment out of the way, I will now proceed to say why Alien is a good film. It is gripping! The settings are realistic and believable; the actors are great; the scenes of exploration of the alien planet are intense; and towards the end we get a great shot of Sigourney Weaver, her tiny panties almost dangling across her butt, stretching her arms to reach some switches above her, reminding us warmly of the sensuality of the female form after the grisly inhumanness of the alien. But the terror is real! And captivating! And this is what makes Alien worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The ship in this masterful movie (Nostromo) is named after Conrad's 1904 masterful novel,"The seven passengers of the Nostromo spaceship are awakened from their long sleep by the artificial intelligence, soon discovering that the cause is an unknown signal coming from a planetoid in the region. Forced to temporarily suspend the mission in order to check what the signal was about, the crew uncovers the terrible truth behind this detour. An unseen alien, dangerous and utterly hostile, completely shifts the goal from a peaceful return mission to Earth to a struggle for survival against something whose behavior cannot be predicted, which has no known vulnerabilities and no intention to stop.This movie does not rely on cheap shock tactics, since even suggesting a great deal of violence, most deaths are not even shown.It also has a social edge. Earlier in the story, workers argued about working conditions, wages and bonuses, like Newcastle miners in ancient union meetings. They have a sense of the greed of the company they work for. They barely believe the true priority of the mission.But the point in Alien is not a social message, it's rather taking us away from our reality and transporting us to another world-not our own.Despite uncountable imitating sequels and the like , Alien has lost none of its power. One of its side purposes is to explore the inner workings of the mind and share it with the spectator.

Alien: 4/10,"I've said this over and over, that I hate not liking classic movies. It's the whole ego thing, like I can't appreciate a good, classic movie, which isn't true. It's just that a good amount of classic movies aren't as good as they're hyped up to be. I feel that way for such movies as Halloween, The Meaning of Life, and other movies like that. Added to that list will be Alien. It's a slow, dreary, dark sci-fi saga that leads nowhere, and with just slightly better character development than most other horror movies, it's certainly nothing special, and completely undeserving of its classic status.In the future, the space ship Nostromo, headed back to Earth, picks up a distress signal. The crew interprets it as an SOS and goes to investigate it. Besides Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, some other B-list actors here are Tom Skerritt (Dallas), Harry Dean Stanton (Brett), and Ian Holm (Ash). It turns out that an alien attaches itself to one of the crew members, therefore putting all of them in jeopardy.I'm fine with Alien not really being an action movie, as I had expected. I just didn't expect it to be so doggone slow. Whenever something happens, it's played so subduedly (and without music, it seemed) that it almost seemed like nothing has happened. Often, when I'm watching a movie, if I start to get bored, I put the subtitles on so I have something else to do, also, taking away some of the boredom. They were on within about 10 minutes of starting it. And although I'm glad that we actually got to learn some of the characters' names, nothing really happened with them, they all sounded the same, etc., and that final twist with Ash was just plain stupid. It was unexpected, sure, but completely absurd and uncalled for. The sets were nice to look at, but did we really need to see them for two hours? There's more that could happen. The only worthwhile things in the whole movie were the alien itself and the infamous chestbursting scene.The ending scene also came out of nowhere, making the movie go on for even longer than it should have. I mean, come on, why? We've endured 105 minutes of this, why add 10 more on? I can see how Weaver could be made a star from this movie, although she wasn't very good. In fact, none were. But what else can be expected from the vastly overrated Alien, a boring, slow sci-fi movie whose only qualities are its sparse special effects and its tagline?My rating: 4/10Rated R for sci-fi violence/gore and language.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

"A classic that holds up very, very well","I convinced my cynical 19 year old to watch an ""ancient"" film (her phrase) - so I was careful with my choice. I know she likes horror, so thought I would try to see if she could be scared the old fashioned way and pulled the 1979 Sci-Fi/Horror classic ALIEN off the shelves to show her.It scared the crap outta her.Directed by Ridley Scott (more on him later) Alien tells the tale of a working-class deep space vehicle, returning home with a full cargo when they intercept a distress call at a distant, non-descript planet, they go to investigate and...As told by Ridley Scott, based on a script and story by Dan O'Bannon, Alien is a masterwork in suspense and mood. Scott takes his time telling this story, setting up the feel and atmosphere, showing a gritty, working-man's vessel (and not a sleek silver and chrome shiny ship) where the people inside the craft are not heroes, but working class stiff's just trying to make a buck.What surprised me this time around seeing this film is how deliberate (some would say slow) that the pacing of this film is - but, darn it all, if it doesn't work. The tension slowly builds so when violence/action happens it explodes and seems all the bigger due to the fact that it is coming out of silence.The cast - a group of relative unknowns at the time - is stellar. In the DVD commentary, Director Scott said he spent quite a bit of time casting this film to ensure he had the right mix - and his work shows on screen. The 7 actors in this film work well together - and each one of them brings a real character to the screen that is interesting to watch.Tom Skerrit (the film version of M*A*S*H) as laconic, laid back Captain Dallas and Yaphet Kotto (the villain in the James Bond flick LIVE AND LET DIE) as gruff, looking-for-a-buck mechanic Parker were the most well known of the 7 at the time of the release of the film - and they do bring some star power to the proceedings, but are met, evenly, by others like former child star Veronica Cartwright (Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS), veteran character Actor Harry Dean Stanton ( THE ROSE) and John Hurt (THE ELEPHANT MAN). All 3 bring interesting characters - and faces - to the proceedings.But...for me 2 the standouts in this cast is IAN HOLM (TIME BANDITS) as Science Officer Ash - a character with some ""quirks"" (to put it mildly) and, of course Sigourney Weaver (GHOSTBUSTERS) in her star making role as 3rd officer Ripley. I don't want to spoil anything in this film, but Weaver's Ripley is the type of strong female character - fighting the typical, chauvinistic male hierarchy - that was heretofore unknown/rarely seen in film and is the prototype of these types of characters to this day. Weaver's performance and the writing and direction of this character is that strong/groundbreaking that it continues to influence writing and filmmaking all these years later.The 8th character in this film is the look and feel of the ship - the Nostromo - and the look and feel of the titular Alien character as brought to life in an Oscar winning effort in Visual Effects for the team of H.R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi, Brian Johnson, Nick Allder and Dennis Ayling (based on drawings by Giger). This is truly remarkable, bravura and groundbreaking design and filmmaking - one that holds up very well more than 40 years later - made all the more astounding when you realize that these are all practical effects (CGI had not be invented yet) and the filmmakers had to rely on puppetry, editing, performance and what you don't see (but your mind thinks you do) to fill in the gaps.It all works tremendously well - if you haven't seen this in awhile, do yourself a favor and watch it again.

This has the ugliest and scariest sci-fi monster of all time cinema,"Coming at the end of the 1970s, ""Alien"" was the first really great sci-fi monster film since the 1950s. That was ""the"" decade of sci-fi monster flicks that produced some films with fantastic fright factors. Those were some of the best date movies ever - speaking from experience, as girls would huddle close to their boyfriends or dates watching ""The Blob"" seep through air vents of the movie theater on the screen. ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon"" of 1954, ""The Thing from Another World"" of 1951, ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" of 1955 were some of the best sci-fi monster films of the decade that had high fright factors. Of course, there were some films that verged almost on the comical. And some others were outlandish but nevertheless had decent frightful scenes. ""Attack of the Crab Monsters"" and ""The Black Scorpion"" of 1957 come to mind.Well, this film, ""Alien,"" restored the fright factor in sci-fi monster movies, and may have spiked interest in more such films, judging from the stepped up output through the end of the century and into the 21st century. As others have noted, it was the breakout film for Sigourney Weaver's career, and deservedly so. All of the cast are good in this story that topped all previous monster films for horror in its namesake alien. Not until Jurassic Park four years later was there such a heinous monster created. Yet, even with the scary T-Rex of that film, the alien monster in this film still stands out as the ugliest, scariest of monsters of all time cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien has a soft spot for kitties,"Why didn't the Alien attack Jonesy? If it's true that its perfection is matched only by its hostility the kitty cat should have been ripped to pieces. I think the Alien is in fact a sentimentalist, perhaps spending its spare time watching cat videos on Xenotube. I've found its weakness. So I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I think what must be done is to send in a battalion of genetically engineered cat killing machines as a Trojan Horse to lay waste to the hostile xenomorphs. Or perhaps even killer terminator cat robots, they can even bring in Arnold to do the voice it'll be iconic. In any case our furry feline friends are the only hope left for humanity.

One of the greatest films ever made - sci-fi or otherwise!,"ALIEN (1979) **** Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright.  Ridley Scott's genuinely scary and shockingly violent sci-fi masterpiece that re-created terror in the genre and spawned a zillion rip-offs.  "" In Space No One Can Hear You Scream"" was the film's tag-line and appropriately so: a space mission picks up an alien hitchhiker in deep space after being duped into tracing a distress signal and end up with several bloody deaths and one nasty monster. Spooky production values (which deservedly copped an Oscar for Best Visual Effects) and stunning creature inspired by artist HR Giger.

GREAT MOVIE!!,"I decided it was time to revisit Ridley Scott's landmark film after I saw it 30 years ago. And it hit me every bit as hard as the first time I saw it. So here's the question that, even 42 years later, continues to stir through people's minds: what exactly is it that makes ALIEN what it is today?The truth is, it's a tough question to answer, as it's not nearly as action-driven as its sequel, but rather a quiet film that I can't help but compare to a deadly snake slowly crawling up my limbs for two hours. I think fans of this classic can agree that the seemingly effortless combination of that quiet, achingly slow-burning tension along with some terrifying creature/set designs and even a few moments of genuine shocks (I'm not only referring to that infamously horrifying chestburster sequence, which is still a doozy). The cast is uniformly excellent all around, and far more interesting than many of the later films (excluding ALIENS and the surprising PROMETHEUS, which also featured a strong cast). These elements are a major part of why ALIEN has taken its deserved place among cinema's greatest productions.Another thing I loved was the fact that much of the film takes place in a dark, shadowy atmosphere. Then, there's Jerry Goldsmith's sublime and quiet score, and silence is brilliantly used to ramp up the suspense to amazing and terrifying heights.In the film's final act, we see Ripley attempting to escape the Nostromo - and that firestorm of technical creativity and shocking, in-your-face terror could not have been a more perfect way to close this chapter, and set us up for James Cameron's own classic, a sequel which would earn Sigourney Weaver countless deserved accolades, and even an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Not many female movie heroines can say that. Overall, the blend of great writing, first-rate performances, amazingly haunting visuals, and a relentless sense of dread and terror that slowly torments your mind and your nerves are what I believe to be the reason ALIEN is a true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

7.7/10 - Simple But Effective,"Alien is a sci-fi/horror film which follows a crew of astronauts who operate The Nostromo, a commercial ship that delivers cargo for a certain company, only refered to as ""the company"" during the film. These astronauts face a peculiar issue as some kind of an alien life form latches itself into the face of one of the crew members. Things keep getting more deadly and more intense the more this alien stays on the ship, and this is basically the movie.I like the aesthetic Alien has - it's simple, but it's effective. This movie straight-up feels like some comic book from the 80's, and it's really cool tbh. The set, though not extremely varied, still manages to be detailed enough to create the vibe it needs to. From the spaceship where the egg was found, that emenates these cosmic horror vibes and intrigues me personally, and the Notsromo, which feels claustrophobic af - though the set is generally ""just"" the metallic interior of a spaceship, it still has a lot of thought behind it and it adds to the worldbuilding and the vibe really well. Really well made.There's an interesting motif here of sexual horror, and I honestly haven't even realized that this is what the movie tries to do on my first watch. On second watch, after watching some film analysis, it really popped up and it made things way better. The story is solid either way, but knowing the whole sexual horror motif made everything more than a well made movie with some shock value, a decent story and that's it.The characters aren't too deep, I'd say. No character here has a psyche worth deep diving into. Every character here, in my eyes, is quite simple but effective. They work both as concepts to serve the underlying message and both in the surface level of ""being a character with just enough personality so it doesn't get completely forgotten after viewing the film"". Totally acceptable.The story, as said above, is solid. The usage of jumpscares (and the tension building in general) is fairly decent here. Enough things happen so the plot won't be dry. The performances are all good here, too. Nothing worth mentioning in length, but decent.So, Alien is a really decent horror film. Its strength lies in its cool aesthetic, strong motifs and tension building. I had fun, and I feel like I just read a cool, dark comic book from the 80's. Feeling a 7.7/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
A Space Horror Masterpiece,"Ridley Scott's Masterpiece which popularised the Space Horror subgenre, is a stifling atmospheric horror from start to finish. Its about a crew aboard a cargo spaceship who were awakened from cryo-sleep to investigate a remote signal & unknowingly returned with something sinister on their ship. The Art Design, Practical Effects & Makeup done in this film is the stuff of legends & even after 40 years it can amaze the viewers. The screenplay is unique too as Scott subverts all of the common horror tropes, & we get one shock after another. The film gave us one of Movie History's most iconic Monsters, the Xenomorph & it is kept hidden most of the time as the director uses its unknown presence as the source of anxiety and fear among the crew. The camerawork is iconic too with shots worthy of film school studies. Sigourney Weaver as headstrong Ripley is a Breakout Performer.

I didn't like it much,I don't get the enthusiasm for this movie. As of today it's the #62 movie of all time. I found it had some rather dry boring parts that didn't add to the story or to the mood. Cinematography was amateurish. Plot was straightforward without any interesting points to it. No real character development. I just kept waiting for the beast to kill them all. I didn't really care for any of the characters. A suspenseful movie only works when you actually care about what becomes of the main characters and I didn't feel any warmth to this movie at all.This movie hasn't aged very well either. Looks very 80's-ish. I found Sigourney Weaver's hair to be scarier than the Alien itself.,,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Ellen Ripley - a feminist icon for all the right reasons,"With Alien, director Ridley Scott and producer Walter Hill brought B-movie sci-fi horror and the female action hero to mainstream cinema, with first-grade contemporary visual effects as catalyst for the movie's effect and remarkable success. The title character was a villain in the simplest sense; driven by reproduction and self-preservation - basic human needs made into horror. Alien salutes and nourishes off of xenophobia; everything unknown and not human should be feared, lest you end up as some of the more gullible of these crew members. Ridley Scott appeals to your most basal emotions, and probably gets the response he seeks. Luckily, we have Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as our saviour - she's not only cool and emotionally controlled, she's also forward-looking and considerate, like an amalgam of classical male and female virtues. She became a feminist icon for all the right reasons - she's not a dissident, she's a confident go-getter in an unforgiving world. And she can even put up with being desired - in her underwear - by her viewers. Perhaps because she's just as unattainable for her admirers and for her critics as she is for the alien.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

This movie is not terrible by any means, but it's also not as good as everyone says. It's one of those that is built on suspense and suspense only, and if you scare really easy, then I guess you'd really like it. I've seen a hundred movies more suspenseful than this. The ""heartbeat"" rhythm that plays throughout the film adds to the suspense, but not much. Not once did I gasp, jump, or even sit close to the edge of my seat. I watched this movie ten years ago, and forgot the entire thing. Very forgettable story, empty characters, only about ten minutes of the film do you get to even see the alien. I have not seen any of the sequels, perhaps they are better. I don't plan to find out. How is this film rated so high?

I Heard Their Screams From Space!,"Four decades later, Alien holds up surprisingly well. Accompanied by its hauntly romantic score, its elaborate set design, and creative creature FX... Alien is placed in a distinct category of filmmaking that relied heavier on sound design and in-camera effects to thrill audiences. The movie does have a slow and steady pace and I can see where today's moviegoers might be bored with its long shots and dedication to convey the scale of its large space environments. With realistic CGI a long way off, the decision to keep the creature hidden for most of the movie allows your imagination to wander to darker and scarier places.

Why does everyone think this movie is so great?,"If there's one thing I can't stand it's plot holes, and Alien is full of them.Here's is a few things I don't quite understand.Why is the only weapons they have on board flame-throwers? Why are the crew members so stupid as to not realize staying together would be a lot safer? Each time one of them wonders off alone, which they do one by one, they become lunch for the dreaded space monster. You'd think anyone with sufficient training would understand the need for a 24hr quarantine under even life threatening circumstances. That stupid cat. Any time anyone goes near it it hisses and bolts away drawing whoever's following it towards the alien, was it working for the Alien? Why don't they have an escape pod or pods large enough to fit the entire crew? Is Lamberts only role to kick and scream and get in the way (very annoying cliché character)?They don't close the door after the alien detaches from Kane's face (not after there was enough time for the face sucker to possibly escape the enclosed area). And They don't chase the Alien that emerges from Kanes body until after it's long gone.The acting was definitely solid but the characters actual actions not very believable at all.

This movie is a solid 6 of 10.,"Since the release of Alien: Romulus, I felt it was time to watch the first movie in the series: Alien (1979).Before watching, I set my expectations knowing that this movie is from 1979, so I didn't expect any cutting-edge CGI or special effects. I was prepared to accept what they could achieve with the Alien character. The alien's visual design is actually quite promising, although I found it difficult to watch because the alien scenes are often obscured. I can forgive the stiffness of the movements (it is 1979, after all), but I wish there were more full-body shots of the alien. Often, it only appears in fragments.Beyond that, what I really enjoyed was the conflict between the characters, which is very well-executed. From the start of the movie, you can clearly understand each character's personality.Another aspect I liked was the scenes showing the interior of the alien spaceship at the beginning of the movie. The grandeur of those scenes was impressive, and I think it was a commendable effort by the director and the team.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie. You can't expect anything too spectacular in terms of special effects, but the narrative is clear, and the character development is strong. It could have been better, but the movie as a whole is still enjoyable. It establishes itself as a solid movie for a great franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Good classic,Good classic. The audience has to wait more than 1 hour to see the thing they paid for - the xenomorph. And this waiting makes its emergence one of the greatest moments in the cinematic history. Still we see the xenomorph only 3 or 4 times which is quite disappointing but this makes the alien more mysterious and gives the movie a horror character. And of course another reason we see the xenomorph so rarely is because the CGI wasn't very well developed at that time and it was pretty hard to make the alien's appearance. Alien(1979) is a great start for the Alien anthology and even though the bad CGI it's the best movie in the whole anthology. The movie is worth watching.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Who the heck said this was the scariest movie ever made?,"'ALIEN' was directed by Ridley Scott and stars Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit and John Hurt. When the crew of the Nostromo reach a foreign planet that may contain life, a mysterious life form attaches itself to one of the crew and begins to wreck havoc on the ship.If you enjoy this movie then I envy you. I genuinely do. I just cannot see the appeal in this movie and would want nothing more than to understand it but I just cannot. Nothing in this movie is particularly frightening, the story is pretty bland and weak and don't get me started on the evil lighting. Not to say I can't see any strengths in the movie. Sigourney Weaver was, to start, really good as Ripley and redefined the movie heroine. To be fair, the majority of the cast did a good job and sold their role. Except for Lambert, Lambert can go to hell. The Xenomorph is also one of the best designed aliens/creatures in movie history and I do congratulate them for holding that title. Despite these revolutionary things that this movie did for cinema, it's just not scary. The number one thing a HORROR movie should be to make me scared or tense or fearful but I just didn't. This isn't down to the effects which are actually good but rather down to the lack real atmosphere or anything to make the movie feel more intense. Again, If you like this movie then I'm happy for you but I just don't see what is so good about it.In my opinion, the story for this movie is utter stupidity. When some scientists and astronauts, some of the most capable minds on Earth, find an Alien egg on a foreign planet, and their first thought is 'let's stick my face right into it', you know that this movie is god damn stupid. The plot makes literally no sense and its all down to some of Earth's most capable people deliberately breaking rules to keep them alive. That said, I did like the ending and do see it as being genuinely frightening seeing that in cinema's. That said, I think that it meant less to me for the fact I saw it on DVD, and knew how long was less. In addition to that, they do also kind of build up that something will happen without directly saying it, thus ruining the surprise.Again, I will also compliment the cast for this movie. Pretty much everyone from the wonderful Signourney Weaver to the chilling Ian Holm provided a solid performance and in some ways created the tropes so many Science-Fiction movies would follow today. With the reckless captain, the level headed vice, the crazy scientist - all of that probably derived from this movie and I respect them for that. Now for someone who I couldn't stand in this movie: Veronica Cartwright as Lambert. Screw Lambert. If she died before the script was even written, I would have maybe liked this movie. She was so obnoxious and no annoying and whiny - she puts Temple of Doom's Winnie to SHAME at some points. If that was the point, then fair enough but it doesn't excuse one of the most frustratingly annoying characters I've seen in a long, long time.Something this movie was praised greatly for was it's 'eerie' and 'tense' cinematography. How? I don't get it? Sure the movie is tightly edited and the camera was steady but I don't see how this movie revolutionised how these movies are filmed. That and the lighting was ridiculous. If you have epilepsy, do NOT watch this movie. Don't even look at the box because that might cause seizures. I respect Ridley Scott immensely and love him as a director but I had to look away from some scenes purely because of the lighting, and I've never had issues with that; my eyes are actually more used to glaring lights so it shouldn't have affected me but I thought I was going blind at points.A horror movie should be scary, yes? I've always assumed that is what a horror film should do but from the pedestal this movie is placed on, I don't understand why. I was never, at any point in this movie, tense or scared, or even slightly concerned. This is nothing to do with the effects/alien design(which are both pretty good by the way) but more to do with the lack of atmosphere. A lack of atmosphere can make a movie disturbing but I think it just made this movie less enjoyable. This movie's primary directive was to make me scared but I don't think it did that in any way.In conclusion, I do, to some degree, respect this movie. It revolutionised some aspects of cinema and things like the Xenomorphm, or ship design still echo through the ranks of cinema today. That said, I just couldn't enjoy this movie. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters. I felt so actual care. I just didn't enjoy this movie and it genuinely saddens me to say that because I wanted nothing more than to like these movies. Perhaps I'll enjoy 'Aliens' but I just can't say I recommend this movie.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

My favourite space horror,"Rewatching one of my favourite movies of all time just before watching Alien Romulus(2024).Alien will forever be one of my favourite sci-fi movies, one of my favourite horror movies and one of my favourite movies of all time. It´s atmosphere is so dense you can cut a knife through it. It has one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time (if not the most iconic if you really want to fight me) and is just a force to be reckoned with. It´s about family drama, the invasion of privacy, sexual violence and the perfect encapsulation of the mundanity of space. A movie that truly knew what it wanted and didn't need to shove it down our thoughts, it´s solid and competent.After a distress signal is picked up, a cargo vessel is asked to check it out. What they find is a vessel with a terrible thread on board.One aspect of this movie I never get tired off is the practicality of everything. The sets are industrial and claustrophobic. It looks like a great mess of iron and grey smashed together, submarine vibes. The alien planet is just a storm and rocks, nothing romantic or special, just another rock in space. The alien spaceship is grand and disturbing, like the ship was alive since it looks like it was made out of bones. All the environments costumes and ideas are done to perfection and highlights the mundanity of space travel that we will get to eventually. This is not the romantic portrayal of space in vain of Star Wars (1977)that came out just a few years prior. This is boring and just a cargo ship, it´s slow annoying and doesn't pay well. Ridley Scott sets a president to make space this boring and uninhabitable black void that only houses horrors and nothing else. I love this accept to death, what felt like an answer to this romanticism of space, asking the question ""okay now we have done all the first steps and they were cool, what then?""Speaking of design. The creature, later known as the Xenomorph is one of my favourite designed creatures of all time. It is such a nasty looking monster giving vibes of a sexual nature, of death, of bugs and mechanical aspects making it blend in with its environment. While it is not shown in all its glory in this movie as it will in later entries of the franchise for better and worse, it is affective here. It is a force to be recon with, a just pure animalistic creature just killing for killing sake. A truly sadistic creature, pure evil. The same with its pre state the face hugger. Such a disgusting looking and acting creature.This is a very sexual movie in the worst way possible. It is an attack on a core family here. Not a perfect family or by blood, but a small crew that loves each other and fight each other. This creature will ruin their lives. A lot of allegories of rape and sexual violence is here. Having a computer named Mother is also adding to this allegory that Freud would be proud of. This movie becomes more disturbing to me in that way. It is a disgusting show of power that the Xenomorph race displays, playing and toying with men and women like they were nothing, a thing we all fear, having someone or something bigger and stronger disregard our boundaries and lives. The way it moves around the ship nearly invisibly, is also a fact that make the creature so much worse. A predator just waiting for the right opportunity.I really love that you cannot guess who is going to live or die in this movie. Who may live or die is very up in the air in this movie and it makes you question if anyone can get out of a situation like this during the entire runtime.It is a movie that takes it´s time building characters and relationships before violently change everything. It is not a fast moving action blockbuster, it takes it time toying with the situation and that characters, and therefore also toying with the audience.Alien is a phenomenal movie and I will forever keep high on my favourites list. It is just such a simple yet nasty horror that affects me to my core. A pure display of a disgusting concept all wrapped in this boring space world. Alien is the ultimate space horror. In space, no one can hear you scream indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Impossible to beat the original...,"First of all, this is an entirely subjective exercise, but for me, the gothic horror and mystery of the original film is simply on another level. The sound design, Ridley's direction and look and feel for the sets, the actors, the writing... it's not just some cheesy action film like Alien(s) where there's no depth (thanks, James Cameron) that doesn't hold up today. There's no comparison whatsoever. But again, we all like what we like.Personally, I think it's just a money machine now... more CGI, more graphic gore to make it ""contemporary."" All fluff no soul. It's a shame. I'm waiting to stream Romulus for ""free""... I've learned my lesson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Striking,"Alien is a remarkable movie in a lot of ways, from its stellar cast and performances, to its dramatic science fiction elements and mostly convincing special effects. It gets dragged down though by its abundance of jump out of your seat moments, especially when those moments are telegraphed through questionable decision making by the characters. Fortunately those moments don't hinder the overall experience too much. Alien is a gem, it's just a slightly flawed one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Alien,"In space, no one can hear you scream was the tagline for Alien. Although not original, it became a seminal modern sci fi horror/thriller. It also gave director Ridley Scott a welcome calling card.At the very least in having a female action hero in Sigourney Weaver who plays Ripley.The crew of the industrial spaceship Nostromo are sent to investigate a crashed spacecraft in an uninhabited planet. One of the crewman Kane (John Hurt) gets too near a mysterious egg that discharges a facehugger.Kane is brought back to the ship against the advice of Ripley. Partly die to the actions of the sinister science officer Ash (Ian Holm) who has an hidden agenda.The facehugger dies, Kane recovers but he later gets stomach cramps.Scott has made a tight claustrophobic dark haunted spaceship thriller with added jump scares and some gore.

Timeless,"Yesterday I watched this 1979 British-American science fiction horror film on Disney Plus (UK and Ireland) via my Samsung phone. It's very scary but it's absolutely brilliant and I love it. The acting is great especially from Sigourney Weaver herself. It never gets old and it will always be a timeless classic. It's probably the best science film horror film I've ever seen!We know it follows the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo, who, after coming across a mysterious derelict spaceship on an uncharted planetoid, find themselves up against a deadly and aggressive extraterrestrial loose within their vessel. It's actually based on a story by O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett (Gosh, I did not even know).Ridley Scott sure is a real genius and he did a great job for directing this film from the early 1980s.If you are fan of science fiction, you'll love this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The horror-sci-fi hybrid that became a household franchise!,"Is it even possible for Ridley Scott to make an unremarkable film? I don't think so. Yes; I'm also including Prometheus in this argument (with the exception of Robin Hood). And Alien showed that Scott was THE MAN when it came to mustering visually impacting science fiction at the cinema. After Star Wars broke new ground for scifi at the movies, along came Alien in 1979; and this film was a totally different beast. And terrifying!Alien is one of the best space-films of the 70s. Its sense of isolation, confinement in the vacuum of space adds to the tension so beautifully well. The crew of mining ship 'Nostromo' are all alone in space until there's a signal coming from an unknown planet. Little do they know that they're about to bring back with them the most dangerous creature in the universe: The Xenomorph, an alien that bleeds acid and can hide easily in such a vast mining ship.Scott made himself a filmmaking star overnight with this film. Thirty-eight years on and he's still at it, with Alien: Covenant on the horizon, still showing himself to be a talented and committed auteur impressing us still.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre.,"Science fiction in film has faced an uphill battle in terms of being taken seriously. Up until the late 1960's, most sci-fi was low-budget, B-movie schlock more likely to be Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fodder than Oscar potential. This all changed in 1968 with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now that sci-fi could be considered art it took almost a decade for other films to capitalize on Kubrick's groundbreaking work. Star Wars (1977) expanded on the special effects and made sci-fi a fun, action-filled ride. Regarding the horror aspect of sci-fi, Alien (1979) remains the founding film of these combined genres.Not only does Ridley Scott do a fantastic job directing this movie, in particular through the use of elaborate sets, puppetry, and just plain spectacular cinematography; but the fact that Alien has an incredibly strong female protagonist (Sigourney Weaver's Ripley) puts it leagues ahead of its time in terms of character-driven plot. The fact that she was brought back for the James Cameron sequel, Aliens (1986), is merely a testament to how strong her character's impact on the original film was. Of course, part of the reason Ripley stood out as a unique personality was due to the antagonist: the eponymous Alien.The horror of the unseen remains the best technique to build suspense, but the gruesome visage of this creature delivers all the horror the plot had built up. Unlike some of the B-movie horror of earlier decades, this monster is realistic enough to give a legitimate scare without giving away the puppetry technique behind it via poorly designed costumes or visible support wires. The fact that this alien is nigh indestructible (and has acid for blood in case it does get injured) merely adds to the terror of it running rampant on a cramped spaceship.The epitome of the sci-fi/horror sub-genre, I give Alien 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
What sci-fi should be like,"This movie is probably one the greatest sci-fi milestones ever made. The plot seems very simple, and indeed it is. But this is not in anyway a plot driven movie. What makes this movie great are its environments brought to life by a flawless and genius direction by Ridley Scott. The characters, all built by strong performances, specially by Tom Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt, seem completely convincing as 22nd century people crewing the ""Nostromo"", a titanic starship. When the appearance of the alien comes, the designs made by H.R. Giger are quite notable, making the creature itself also a milestone in horror and sci-fi. The only problem I can see in the movie is the fast pace of the end sequence that leaves behind the questions about the nature of the creature itself, that as a scene shows, is a reflection on a broken mirror of humanity itself. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
One hell of an excellent film...,"Ridley Scott has done an excellent job of creating a horror movie in space.

"Amazing acring and cinematography, especially for its time, however its another one of ""those"" horror movies","Though i thought the movie was well acted and visually stunning for its time, it really irritated me , like a lot. It's different from watching a low budget horror movie, where the inaction and thoughtless decisions of the characters is laughable, in this movie, it just irritates you . Only one character had an ounce of common sense(they were not thr main protagonist). Overall it just angered me a lot, and i dont tend to feel this way about films. They do such a good job with the acting pulling you into the characters and feeling for them, or some of them, but then they all follow classic horror movie logic. Also very predictable from start to finish, whenever a character is slightly on their own, you can tell they are about to be killed off. As soon as the main ""plan"" is mentioned, you can predict the ending of the film, and even beyond it. I haven't seen a trailer or anything to any of the sequel, yet simply by knowing sequels exist you can predict the beginning of the sequel midway through this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Best classic Horror,"My first time watching this was at a young age, 9. While ending up having a young crush of ""Sigourney Weaver"", an amazing actress with a beautiful title of ""Sci-Fi Queen"" and still looks beautiful at the age of 70.This Horror classic is beautifully well done, very amazing details despite it being a 1979 film, still amazes me how well this movie was done. It starts off with a crew in space, with each individual strong characters showing the relationship strengths from the beginning. Plus a female leading character in a horror, sci-fi movie, wasn't done a lot back then. Ridley Scott did an amazing job directing, while choosing the actors and actresses perfectly.Story outline is very strong, while seems like a simple story ""Outer space signal response crew encountering an alien"" but it's more than just that. You're constantly smiling how close the crew is, laughing some parts, curious about the humanoid, but then having a feeling something more is going on. The whole movie is just beautiful, between the hype, loving the characters (cough, falling for the gorgeous Ripley), and the details of the alien is fantastic, sounds are original, creepy, especially you're outer space.Outer space is quiet, far from planet earth if anything happens, you're on your own, so the story itself isn't just amazing, the thought of being out there alone is frightening, which brings me to the eerie sounds. Perfectly creepy I must say, offsetting, makes you just fall into a hole sometimes, basically giving you an emotion that they're alone.Story- 10/10 (Best horror classic, best female leading horror, interesting, very unique designs, very detail, original)Characters- 10/10 (Everyone is very good at acting, each individual is lovable, strong character bonds, very depth characteristics)Tone/Music/Atmosphere- 10/10 (Creepy, balanced, good timing, lures you in the situation, eerie)This is my all time favorite movie, it's beautiful, the best classic, and amazing actors/actresses with an amazing directer Ridley Scott",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

In space no one can hear you scream.,"Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) is a masterpiece. From the terrific poster, the tagline and of course Sigourney Weaver, you can't go wrong with this horror classic.2 years after Star Wars: A new hope was released audiences experienced Alien for the first time and I can only imagine how it must have been to go to the cinema and be totally blown away by all the ground breaking innovation Ridley Scott achieved. From the wonderful use of miniatures, incredible set design onboard the Nostromo and Jerry Goldsmith's eerie score, Alien sets the standard not only for claustrophobic survival horror, but horror as a genre in of itself.Alien wouldn't be Alien without the infamous Xenomorph, an acid-blooded extra-terrestrial stalker of the most efficient kind. There really isn't many cinema villain/monsters that even come close to the iconic status acquired by such a well designed hunter.From the moment the Nostromo crew first step foot on LV-426, and John Hurt's Kane looks into that fateful egg, audiences bare witness to a well crafted story of survival filled with fear and dread. The Xenomorph truly is a classic and Sigourney's Ellen Ripley rises to the occasion as an equally (if not more) iconic protagonist and cementing the horror genre's excellent cast of strong female leads.Alien (1979) stands the test of time without faulter, it is a classic through and through and I can't say a word wrong about it. As an all time great, Ridley Scott's Alien will never cease to frighten and inspire movie-goers and movie-makers alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Excellent Blend of Sci-Fi and Horror.,"""Alien"" is by far one of my favorite science fiction series (And yes, I did like the third and forth installments even though I didn't feel they were as polished as the first two.)  The true test of a good movie is comparing how effective it was when it was first released to how it holds up today.  This is still a scary and claustrophobic mood-inducing film.The scenes that I feel best represent the frantic pace of this film are the introduction of the chestburster, the first real look at the alien, Ash's ""secret"" revealed, and Ripley's escape from the Nostromo.  The movie is full of tense moments meant to make the viewer jump, whether it's the sense of impending doom for the hunted crew members, or some false lead used to make the viewer cringe before the alien attacks.  The fact that it's set inside a spaceship with simple designs and sterile white colors makes it all the more unnerving.What's to say about this film that hasn't already been said?  ""Alien"" hasn't lost any of it's fear appeal, and the alien design has always been excellent (Thank you, Giger).  It's a wonderful combination of horror and science fiction with an effective cast and a brilliant use of natural sounds throughout the ship.  I love a good musical score as much as the next film fan, but the raw silence of the ship only adds to the tension.  A great movie, and quite the change from the idealistic ""Star Wars"" released only two years earlier.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
E.T.,"Up until this movie came out, you never saw an alien movie that actually touched a human being to kill him/ her, or to eat him/her, and especially to put there offspring into them. Yes E.T. was cute, and Alf was great, and you had War of the Worlds, where the aliens attacked from spacecrafts, but they never got down and attacked them with their hands. Now, through in Ridley Scott and Signourney Weaver. So you find a mysterious ship, crashed on a scary moon or planet, and you JUST HAVE TO investigate, like you would think that hundreds of years into the future they would have grown brains or something. So you send down a research team, and they keep going down the long, dark, scary tunnels, and just have to go down this shoot to find the pods where the aliens are made. Well, needless to say, you just have to get really close to one so they can get on you and start this entire madhouse. But what a makeup job on the alien. Stan Winston, you get an Oscar from me over this.

"Ridley Scott crafted a Sci-Fi horror classic with 1979's ""Alien,"" and despite it being close to 45 years since its release it still holds up.","From a screenplay written by Scott and Dan O'Bannon, it takes up to space where the crew aboard the ship Nostromo get a distress call from an alien vessel and go to investigate. When they come across a nest of alien eggs, one of the organisms inside it latch onto the face on a crew member and it leads to an atmospheric, tense, and scary thrill ride as everyone aboard fights for survival. I really was expecting this film to not be as good this time around, but this remains one of the best Sci-Fi horror films ever made and one of Scott's best if not his best work.This cast of characters is amongst some of the best in film, as the camaraderie between them makes them feel like a family more than just crew members on a mission. Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, and Yaphet Kotto are all great in their respective roles creating these memorable individuals with personality who find themselves in extreme peril. Weaver ends up being the main character by the time the final act rolls around, as Ripley becomes the heroine and remaining survivor amongst the crew with her resilience and quick thinking skills. Skerritt as Dallas remains my favorite of the group, but Ian Holm as Ash might be even scarier than the actual xenomorph as you're never sure of his angle up until it's revealed why he was brought on the mission to answer the call.H. R. Giger's production design saw this film get nominated for an Oscar and it should've won, as the creation of this alien planet they're inhabiting is absolutely slimy, dark, and obscure. The ship itself stands out with a bright white color amidst the shadowy atmosphere of the scenery, confirming how out of place this crew is in terms of dealing with this xenomorph and makes for a claustrophobic environment for the horror to really be impactful. Derek Vanlint's cinematography works so well to create a distant tone as space looks phenomenal in this film, but in addition is how the visual effects come together with the practical effects to make a genuinely frightening set of alien monsters who will indeed end your life.""Alien"" is a masterclass at creating discomfort in the viewer, as from the opening shot we enter a realm of tension and uncertainty where Scott doesn't want us to ever get comfortable. Even when we're watching this crew have a nice family dinner, it's abruptly interrupted with the iconic chest bursting scene that saw the director not tell the cast what was about to happen which made their reactions authentic. One of my favorite jump scares of all-time comes from this film when Dallas encounters the xenomorph as he looks through the ship with a torch, as it gets me every time despite me knowing it's about to happen. I had to make this film a part of my 31 for 31 horror review series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Cool set. Boring and predictable plot.,"I can't recall being more disappointed in a movie than I was after watching Alien. I imagine this movie was ahead of its time in 1979, but I didn't enjoy it one bit in 2024 and would never watch it again. The characters are undeveloped and constantly do dumb things. Wandering into an alien ship. Leaving doors open. Not closing doors when a literal alien escapes. Going on solo missions after it's escaped. The plot is so silly and predictable I found myself rooting for all of the characters to die. The set design was the only redeeming quality of this movie, but even that was over dramatized. Tons of silly light strobes, random steam, etc. That seemed purely theatrical.I'm selling my blu ray after this.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Incosistently flawless.,"The opening third of Alien provides for an immersive, captivatingly well shot and utterly tense sequence of scenes that sets a virtually impeccable standard of quality for the rest of the picture to match.Therefore it is regretful that, to some extent, the remainder of the picture dissolves into an elongated cat and mouse chase that (despite the best efforts of the writers) occasionally feels dull and excessively long and somewhat dilutes the aforementioned immersion and tension.That isn't to deny that a considerable length of the remainder is composed of commendably tense and terrifying moments.Alien hosts a varied assortment of impressive performances, and consistently delivers some of the most intelligently crafted cinematography I can ever recall viewing.Ultimately , I believe that Blade Runner is the more consistent and overall more immersive picture that succeeds in delivering a more alluring conclusion.Alien may be inconsistent experience, though in it's highest quality scenes it's spectacular and reaches near masterpiece status, warranting viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

The music, the sounds of the spaceship creaking, the creek and hiss of the alien, it all works in great balance.

While investigating the ship, one of the crew members is infected with a deadly creature that proceeds to burst out of his body and kill off the other crew members one by one. This film is very original and imaginative. It also borrows much from classic 50s science fiction, especially The Thing. It's a very entertaining movie with a good story, even better directing, and one of the most horribly realistic special effects in film history.

The characters, acting and dialogue all work to convey the new world we find ourselves in yet populated by characters we sort of recognise in all their normality. The way in which scares and tension are pulled off is just masterful directed. You really actually are on the edge of your seat in many scenes. The special effects are nearly all superb, one particular scene has become truly iconic. Ridley has to be one of my favourite characters I think, the way in which the group fight back and the sweat and the grime of this film just make it so memorable.

Something I don't really understand is where the cat comes from? Was it sedated with the crew? The film stands out as a style-setting and defining one for various films made afterwards. Cigarette smoking occurs completely carefree. Sigourney Weaver's character (Ellen Ripley) is brilliant and perhaps the greatest female action hero in film history. The depiction of life aboard the ship feels unfiltered and believable. My favorite part of the film is the introduction with the slow camera movements that create a sense of isolation and anxiety.

Horror,"Alien is a definitive experience. Just thinking back at the difficulties one had to face when approaching a genre which is nowadays filled with CGI, makes the feeling of admiration just surges within me.Despite the fact that we get the same main element, the alien, the stories change. This first movie, as usually the most important of the whole series, is certainly a milestone for all horror and sci-fi films.I would like to be able to tell the story from an objective point of view, but I consider it quite hard, as this type of movie, the horror type, is a disputed one. Each person can decide if it will or will not view such kind of movies. It is hardly probable that a person who does not like horror movies, will like this one. For one thing, horror movies will never win a major academy award, as they do not have what ALL people want to see. But if you want to be entertained, then this type of movie can get it on for you. Sci-Fi and Horror will always ring a scream in my head: Alien.SpoilersThe story is simple at the beginning...sometime in the future, a cargo ship detects a signal from a planet, and it awakes the crew to check on what it might be. Until the chosen ones get to the planet we get a strange, but scary atmosphere. The planet itself is most obviously against the presence of human life, as the conditions are unfavorable(this will not be the same in Aliens though...does humanity win? Or does that planet really represent the end of human life? We don't get to know that, but when something looks wrong...it usually is wrong). The alien ship stands like a great colossus between the rocks of the horrid planet, and once inside, the unknown attacks. One crew member is infected by what is called a ""face hugger"". A creature with acid instead of blood, with a great defensive system which spawns the worst nightmare of Ellen Ripley.There will be scenes which will make you jump and tremble, and the movie will keep you connected to the terrible events which happen on the Nostromo.Alien exploits the fear of the unknown at its best, from the darkness of space to the alien within poor Kane, from the intimacy of being lost in space to the fear of mega-corporations, to claustrophobia, to solitude, to betrayal. It's all here, all encapsulated in one of the greatest films ever made. And such a world would not be complete without the beast itself.All the things which relate to the evolution of the alien creature are brilliantly thought of. It has more phases of evolution, some phases in which it is truly vulnerable, yet it has the ability to survive, like any animal. Evolved instincts, great strength and a beastly intelligence...it could almost be something from our world. The fact that makes it different is the capacity to kill with ease humans - jolly! The most impressive thing about it is its looks: a fantastic design coming from the bizarre mind of Hans Rudi Giger, inspired - as a matter of fact - by his nightmares!Sigourney Weaver is the actress which will always be the symbol of ""Alien"". I guess it took you some time to guess that one right, didn't it? Well, as always, the story of getting a classic role is filled with near-misses and false impressions. But life has its way of making things right, in such a manner that it always leaves you thinking: it couldn't have been any other way. When it actually could have.Ridley Scott did a great job creating this universe with such a low budget, and he deserves most of the applause. He created one of the most terrific movies I have ever seen, with great horror scenes and great filming. His love for details made Alien what it is today - a huge mausoleum of horror, the wannabe result of any horror movie maker. Sinful in several ways by todays standards - slowly paced and lacking in terms of heavy action - Ridely Scott's film wins by defying them. A master at work can always be recognized.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

First movie of the legendary series,"This is the first movie of the legendary Alien series. Imagine a time where CGI is not possible and even PC's don't exist at homes. You are making a Sci-fi about extraterrestrial creatures and it is still classified as one of the best Sci-fi thrillers 40 years later. This is how we can summarize Alien (1979).Together with its original screenplay, the movie contributed some terms to literature like Facehugger and Chestburster defining notoriously terrifying creatures. It is not only the techniques used but also acting that made this movie age well. Sigourney Weaver was 30 back then but looked 20. She plays a cool reserved lead character who is dedicated to her duty. It is owing to her responsible manners that she becomes the last to face the Alien... like a duel in space.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good but aliens is better,"Ridley Scott's Alien really is a good film, even though it's sequel Aliens (1986) is better. This movie focuses on Ellen Ripley and her crew as this bloodthirsty alien runs amuck onboard. The movie takes a little while to get itself going, I didn't really mind that when something interesting was going on, but there were a few parts in the beginning were I just wanted them to move it along. I don't mind taking a bit longer to get the film started just as long as you keep me fairly interested and entertained while you're building up to things. The acting is very impressive in the movie, of course Sigourney Weaver is spot on great like always. The other supporting actors are pretty good. The effects are very good for 1979! The special effects in this movie is MILES better and a lot more effective than in 1992's alien 3. The action scenes are filmed well, a couple of the killing scenes are similar to like a slasher/regular horror killing, but then others are incredibly original and creative. I think everyone who has heard of this movie knows what scene I'm speaking about. Yes, it involves a man's chest and an alien. That scene is oh so effective! Very well done shocking scene.

Strobo lights ruined it,"The great story, wonderful acting, interesting concept and the whole end were totally and completely ruined for me by the damned strobo lights that gave me a terrible migraine attack.There was no warning about them and they were apparently used for a ""chaotic"" effect, but that made the end unwatchable even in a brightly lit room and dimmed OLED TV brightness. They are also not logical story-wise: how would that kind of lighting help at all in a real emergency? It just prevents the crew from seeing all the instruments they'd need to handle and the only thing those lights accomplished was causing many viewers immeasurably bad headaches.1/10 because of that for an otherwise 8/10 movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Alien (9/10),"It's hard to even imagine how a film like Alien is even conceived conceptually. Yes, it's obvious that Alien is inspired by works such as Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey but it takes the visuals and that lonely concentrated feeling of outer space to another level. Ridley Scott did a tremendous job in directing only his second feature film about a group of ordinary people being terrorized by a hideous breed of monster. The creativity of on how the monsters evolve throughout its life stages is just as intriguing as how they look aesthetically. The movie develops itself quite nicely, a slow start with great details pertaining to the character but it's not long after the gory mayhem ensues. Also, it's safe to say one of the most memorable scenes in horror cinema occurs in this classic, Gothic alien horror movie that is a must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
eyes riveted to the screen,"For a film that came out in 1979, the visual quality was amazing. I was tense literally the ENTIRE time I was watching the movie, from the moment the letters of ALIEN coalesced onto the backdrop of that planet to the very end. Google ""Alien"" and you'll see the basic plot summary, that of a And Then There Were None device of characters being killed off one by one. Knowing that, you know, you already know and are put in suspense before the movie even starts, that characters are going to die, that people will be killed by an alien. Thus the title Alien.The soundtrack matches perfectly with the tension. The orchestra plays sharp notes suddenly at the right moments. When the music begins to keen that recurring motif, you know someone's gonna die. You keep telling certain characters to not do certain things. How stupid we are, humans. How weak we are, humans. We can do essentially nothing with our bodies against unknown species from different worlds, with physiques and adaptive capabilities we can never hope to have.The acting? Oh it's perfect as well. Like Star Wars did for Harrison Ford, this film made Sigourney Weaver famous. How she reacts to the increasingly horrific situation is masterful, very human. Do we endanger the lives of our fellow crew to save another, or lose that one person to save the crew? What can we do, really, against something unknown? It is the unknown that scares us most, for the known can be analyzed, evaluated, and at least gauged in terms of danger. But for the unknown, the possibilities are endless.I found myself imagining myself in one of those crew member's shoes, but with a super power so that I could better tackle the alien. But sadly we humans don't have super powers. And that's what precisely makes Alien such a superb flick, for it depicts a struggle for survival between weak humans and an alien that's scary as hell.

"Ridley Scott's Alien is a scary, gritty, and influential piece of work to the science-fiction genre","Since H.G. Wells's classic novel 'War of The Worlds', aliens have been one of the most iconic fictional creatures to stand the test of time in the science-fiction genre. This sci-fi/horror creature feature takes the trophy of not only marking a solid directorial inauguration for Ridley Scott, but also for redefining the alien subgenre. This spine-chilling alien invasion piece not only shows off Scott's versatile directing chops, but also serves as an influential classic to inspiring many sci-fi/horror tropes of the past few decades. Although some may admire the director's visceral blend of sheering suspense and startling visual effects as the movie's most valued accolade, it is difficult to argue the astonishing influence that this film has spread over the past many years; especially when you look at the large number of cheesy rip- offs Hollywood has flown at us. This film centers on a commercial crew of seven members travelling through space on a spaceship known as the Nostromo. The crew is lead by Captain Dallas (Played by Tom Skeritt) and consists of members Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (played by Veronica Cartwright), Brett (played by Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (played by John Hurt), Ash (played by Ian Holm), and Parker (played by Yaphet Kotto). When the crew receives a distress signal from an unknown source, they soon become terrorized by a mysterious extraterrestrial force that manages to sneak their way on the ship.If you picture John Carpenter's 'Halloween' and replace the masked killer with a grotesque-looking extraterrestrial and the suburban setting with the interior of a rundown spaceship, then you got this movie. This film is a terrifying ride. It focuses on the survival of seven individuals who are forced to use their intellect and weaponry to fend off against an otherwordly force that is beyond what they imagined. Ridley Scott effectively sets the action in an inspiring hodgepodge of firmly constructed atmosphere and a surplus of horrifying special effects. Similar to Steven Spielberg's method in 'Jaws', Scott makes a smart decision of not displaying the monster throughout the entirety the film, but generating a chilling wind of suspense that effectively builds up when the extraterrestrial creature finally shows itself on screen. When the creature reveals itself, it is brutally terrifying especially when the considered the surrealistic design of the sinister creature. And best of all, the creature serves perhaps not just as a cold-blooded killer but a moving force of the sinister atmosphere. Scott's methodology awards us with a powerful string of scares and thrills including the infamous chest-bursting scene. As for the acting department, the cast does mostly fine, but the shortage of character development does serve as a small hinder. The only one who manages to sustain a proper characterization is Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley who displays plenty of grit and heart in her tough female role.Alien marks not only a scary, heart-pounding science-fiction set piece, but an influential sci-fi/horror cinematic entry. It is an amazing work of art that boasts the incredible talent of visionary director Ridley Scott. Although it certainly shows its age, it is effective enough to leave moviegoers pining for more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

A Terrifying Sci-Fi Horror Classic That Redefines the Genre,"The story follows the crew of the commercial spaceship Nostromo, who respond to a distress signal on an uncharted planet. As they investigate, they come face to face with a deadly extraterrestrial creature that begins hunting them down one by one. The film expertly builds suspense and fear, creating a relentless atmosphere of dread and claustrophobia.One of the film's greatest strengths is its meticulously crafted world and production design. Ridley Scott's direction immerses the audience in a gritty and lived-in future, where the Nostromo's claustrophobic corridors and dimly lit interiors heighten the sense of isolation and vulnerability. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and props adds to the authenticity of the film's universe.The creature design in ""Alien"" is iconic and has become synonymous with the franchise. H. R. Giger's nightmarish creation, the Xenomorph, is a perfect blend of organic and mechanical elements, instilling a sense of unease and otherworldliness. The slow reveal of the creature's form throughout the film adds to its terrifying impact.The performances in ""Alien"" are outstanding, with Sigourney Weaver delivering a career-defining performance as Ellen Ripley. Her portrayal of the resilient and resourceful protagonist remains one of the most memorable in the genre. The ensemble cast, including Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto, all contribute to the film's authenticity and believability.The film's pacing is deliberate, allowing for moments of quiet tension and character development before unleashing intense and visceral horror. The slow-building suspense, accompanied by Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, creating an atmosphere of constant unease.Thematically, ""Alien"" explores themes of survival, the fear of the unknown, and the vulnerability of humanity in the face of an unstoppable force.

I love it!,"It's incredible how Alien remains an exceptionally unique and frightening film even to this day, especially when we compare it to the dull science fiction horror movies that we usually encounter nowadays. Despite its release in 1979, it still carries a significant impact. The film script was impressive as it gave just the right amount of information without getting bogged down in too many details. It was easy to follow the sequence of events and understand the crew's background and mission. The pacing was perfect, slowly building up the suspense before reaching full-blown survival horror. The lead actress, Sigourney Weaver, delivered an outstanding performance.The visuals were great as most of the film takes place on the ships, creating a sense of claustrophobia and danger. The set design was exceptional, and it's clear that many films that followed were inspired by it. The lighting was well done, and the cinematography was smooth in the beginning and shaky when things got tense. The film didn't rely too heavily on special effects, which made it even more frightening.The sound design was crucial to the film's immersion, and I found myself completely absorbed. The subtle noises, such as the ship's creaking and groaning, added to the realism and made it feel like I was right there. The score effectively created suspense and made the danger feel all too real.Overall, I highly recommend this classic sci-fi horror film. It's a standout in the genre and definitely worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Interesting Blend of Sub-Genres for an Excellent Film,"This film is one that I'm not entirely sure when I saw it all the way through for the first time. I regularly watched its sequel, Aliens. I'm thinking it was in college. Since then though, I've seen this one more than any other in the series. I've seen this at least once in the theater as well and now on 4K with Jaime as it is on the poster of movies we are working through. The synopsis is after a space merchant vessel receives an unknown transmission as a distress call, one of the crew is attacked by a mysterious life form and they soon realize that its life cycle has merely begun.For this, we begin by getting background information of the story. We are following a spaceship, the Nostromo, which is coming back from a mining mission. They are approaching a planet where a beacon is going off. The crew are awoken early and told by their company to check it out. They are not sure if it is an S. O. S. Or not thoughThe captain is Dallas (Tom Skerritt) and his second in command being Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). They try to land on the desolate planet, but their hull is punctured by jagged rocks in the process. Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) go about trying to fix the damage while Dallas leads a team of Kane (John Hurt) and Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) to check out what is sending the beacon. Ripley monitosr from the ship along with the help of their chief science officer, Ash (Ian Holm)The planet is desolate and hard to see. They move deeper into the spaceship where they discover a large dead alien. Its chest has been ripped open from the inside. They can tell as the ribs are broken outward. Kane goes deeper to find eggs and an odd fog around them. There is movement inside one. Something emerges and attacks him.Dallas and Lambert bring him back to the ship and demand to be let in. They need to get Kane to the infirmary before whatever has attached to his face kills him. Ripley reminds them of their protocol about decontamination and that they need to quarantine to ensure it doesn't infect the rest of the crew. She is under-minded by Ash though and they're admitted back on to the ship.Dallas and Ash remove Kane's spacesuit and assess what has attached to him. They cannot remove it, because if they try it tightens its grip around his neck. The thing has blood that is acid and it feeds nutrients to Kane, keeping him alive in a coma. They try to figure out something to do to save him, but before they can the thing dies and he wakes, starving.At the meal, everything seems back to normal and everyone is having fun until we learn what happened to the alien that was flying the spaceship. Kane meets the same demise as an alien escapes from inside him through his chest. It is small at first, but as the synopsis states, this is just the beginning.That is where I'm going to leave my recap and I'm also going to assume that most everyone has seen this movie before. It is definitely an interesting idea. What makes it so great is the world that Ridley Scott, the director, along with Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett come up with. What I mean here is that we have these blue collar workers in space. It almost feels like Dallas is a truck driver with Brett and Parker being mechanics. It feels quite grounded despite being in the future. The characters feel natural to people you would know they are just in space.Then from that set up, we have the horror elements. I've heard many different theories on this movie from it not being horror, to be a haunted house or a slasher film in space. I can definitely see the last two for sure. Once this Xenomorph, as they will be called in later films, gets on board, the tension is constantly raising until it ends. People are being picked off here. We don't even necessarily need to see things happening, but we do with some quick cuts. It allows our brain to fill in. It is stated in this movie that we have the perfect killing machine which is terrifying.What I've picked up on this time seeing the movie is that there is an interesting social commentary here. There is a company that these people are working for. I don't recall if their name is stated here, but it is a major corporation regardless. There is a computer by the name of Mother (Helen Horton) that they communicate with. I love there is a secret directive here that only Ash is privy to. Throughout the movie there are little hints that he might not be able to be trusted and it all comes together as the tensions rise.That should be enough for the story so I'll go to something that is quite strong here which is the acting. Skerritt is great as our captain here. I like that we feel for a good portion of the movie he could be our hero. He's faced with some tough decisions for sure. The true star of this is Weaver. It is hard to technically put her in the 'final girl' category, but I love how strong of a heroine she is. We just have a strong cast across the board after that. Cartwright, Stanton, Hurt, Holm and Kotto are all great. I will give credit to Bolaji Badejo and Eddie Powell who are the alien in the movie. They both do great as well.From here let me go to the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, they're on point. The cinematography helps here as well. We have this suit that looks quite real and it is amazing for being 1979. The actors inside definitely help as well. What is also impressive though is how real the spaceships look. They have a lived in feel along with grittiness to them. It doesn't feel like you'd get with other space movies where things are white and clean. This feels like a spaceship being held together with band-aids and grease. I think the cinematography definitely aids here, especially with making this feel like the future, while also feeling grounded. The soundtrack also helps to build the atmosphere as well.So then in conclusion here, this is a classic. I might not have grown up with this movie, but I can see why it has withstood the test of time. We have a futuristic movie that feels grounded. This can be seen as a haunted house or a slasher film that is set in space with an alien. The acting is great across the board. The effects are on point for me which are helped by the cinematography. The soundtrack also helps to set the atmosphere that is needed here. This is as close as you can get a perfect film for me. If you've never seen this, I could recommend giving it a viewing for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

They shouldn't have messed with Jerry Goldsmith's score.,"In case you already didn't know, director Ridley Scott has made two movies where Jerry Goldsmith's score was disrepspectfully cut up (as in Alien) or completely thrown away (as in Legend). At any rate, Alien still is a classic. We have a female hero, we have H.R.Giger's imagination, and we have one mean alien. The filmmakers wanted to show an image of ""truckers in space"", hence the blue collar looking workers and chains, and an ""inside a factory"" like appearance.

MINDBENDING in any decade,"This is the film that launched Sigourney Weaver into stardom. I want to get that out of the way because I notice a lot of reviews claiming she was such a big star gracing this film. She was a virtual unknown at this time, just like most of the cast. Judging by her portfolio over the proceeding years, it was Ridley Scott who made her so wonderful in Alien. Sometimes a star can make a movie; sometimes a movie makes the star. Regardless, Alien was positively mind-bending when it first arrived in theatres, right up there with the impact of films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, and The Terminator. Many people like to make lists online of their top 50 or 100 greatest sci-fi/horror films and you get all kinds of stuff in there. But if you had to really narrow it down to, say, the top 10, Alien would be in there. Some reviews go on and on about how the premise has been done before, even many times. But I beg to differ. Yes, a group of people trapped somewhere fearing for their lives wasn't new but that's like saying Cast Away is a rip off of The Blue Lagoon. Show me where an alien bursts out of a man's stomach after being implanted in his face for days on board a giant space craft controlled by an artificial lifeform created by the military! Nope. Never seen that before.Every now and then, I watch Alien again. I've seen it a dozen times. It's still an amazing watch even though I know how it ends. Stunning in every detail. I can't really speak to the other films in this franchise. I've watched them and thought they were entertaining. But Alien follows the norm of the first film being the best, imo, and per the ratings on this site. I know the box office ratings will say Aliens was actually higher grossing, but hey - the cost of seeing a film had gone up to $9.50 by then from around $3.50 in 1979. Very rarely does the second film in a franchise outdo the first, but with Saw (arguably, perhaps) and Terminator, that did actually happen. I will say, I think the Alien franchise has gone too far with churning out the next film just to cash in. I'd much rather watch the original.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Solid acting with sigourney weaver as one of the strongest leads youll ever see in a movie (she is 100% right from the beginning and no one listens to her!). Great cinematography, a very interesting and sprawling story that keeps it nice and tight just for this movie (but opens up for a ton of prequels/sequels and spinoffs to come), and then theres the alien (xenomorph)......this thing is just absolutely terrifying and awesome!The blood/gore is amazing too. There are a handful of super scary and brutal moments so buckle up.Its a bit of a slow burn at times but to be honest, this pretty much has something happening the entire runtime and it does not lose steam at all. Its paced really well and builds tension perfectly culminating into the final battle at the end.I cannot stress enough how great this movie is. For those into sci-fi horror, this is it.

Review of a film about the dangers of being too curious,"The movie is quite good if you know it's from 1979.At this time they couldn't work with great effects like in the new Alien-films.So with no fantastic effects trying to create a Sci-Fi film where effects are from big importance is difficult.But Scott succeeded, it's one of these movies you know from the first minute on that it's something special.And that's quite right, because through that film Scott created a new genre or at least gave now life to Sci-Fi. Very enjoyable is to buy the Alien-films all together and watch them a weekend through.So you get the story at one piece and don't have to remind yourself everytime new.Also you can see how Sigourney Weaver changes in every film.This shall NOT be promotion, but I did so and was surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"

Alien is claustrophobic, nerve racking, disgusting and horrifying all in one.The cast of characters are all believable and each has their own personality. Most importantly, they all break down on their own way as the film goes on. Sigourney Weaver is one of the first iconic final girls known as Ellen Ripley. She starts off as a standard officer doing her job but keeps her sanity in check and takes charge towards the end of the film.The design of the alien itself is iconic. Everyone should know the Alien by sight. It's tall, not very muscular but very fast and smart. It knows where to lurk for its next meal.I don't even need to tell you how uncomfortable this film makes me feel. From scene to scene, it builds up dread and releases the horror in small doses.Alien is a standard for creature features and horror in general. If you haven't seen Alien yet or don't think it's good, you've been living under a rock.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
"Along with its sequel, the best sci-fi horror films ever.","Both Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) are still, to this day, the best sci-fi horror films ever.Both have very different aim despite being in the same franchise, and reflect their directors well.Aliens (1986) is a classic James Cameron film, that is sci-fi horror but more action than horror, with simple heroic characters. Simple but satisfying.Alien (1979) is a completely different beast and a classic Ridley Scott film.It's not meant to be fast paced, action packed, etc. Whereas Aliens in James Cameron's film are just enemies to be shot and killed, Alien (1979) has a single Alien that is more about creating an intense feeling of dread and horror than anything else. Alien (1979) is a masterpiece at creating the ultimate ""foreign life form/viral infection on a space ship"" experience. Everything in this film is about how, piece by piece, an alien life form invades and destroys a human environment. There are also strong political understatements about the role of corporate/capitalist greed in the downfall of the humans.Alien (1979) is slow paced movie that is best enjoyed by noticing all the details, all the mistakes the crew makes (or even the things they do right).Finally, there are two major versions of this film. The original version (theatrical cut) and the director's cut.The DC is a more modern take on the original, that is faster paced and cuts things like slow exposition shots.Personally I think that's a huge mistake and hurts the original movie. I believe the original is the true director's cut and that version should be watched, not the DC.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Twisted,"Scott is a lousy director (a great visual artist, but not good at directing) , Giger is a degenerate who painted monsters and hellish images all his life, and the whole horror genre is by and large a pit of degeneracy. This film is an effective horror, and does impress visually in many ways. It also has a memorable soundtrack. But at the end of the day, it is just nasty. And I am sick and tired of nasty imagery poisoning my mind. Shove it down the toilet.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
Rate and review while improving with age for many of us.,"Now in 2022 as opposed to 1978 and 1979 when created and seen within the confines of a big screen theatre this pillar of film from Ridley Scott improves with age in my opinion. The incredible timing in the scenes, the believable story of horror, and a continuing progress of mankind into space makes for a grand review for young and old alike!Thank you kindly.

Still looks fresh,"It's hard to believe Alien is over 40 years old and yet it still looks fresh. With a very few exceptions, for example the computer graphics during the landing sequence, everything looks modern. But Aliens isn't just about the visuals. The plot, although on the face of it simple has layers of complexity. The acting is first rate, the characters believable, the art design amazing and of course it's a Ridley Scott master class in direction. It would all be for nothing however if the eponymous Alien was just a guy in a rubber suit. Indeed it was just a guy in a rubber suit but the way it is shot means you never actually see it untill right at the very end. It's a great example of working within limitations and producing a superior movie as a result. These days with CGI movie makers can more or less show anything they wish but as the likes of Alien Covernent demonstrate that doesn't produce a better movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Sci-Fi"
