Slick and lots of fun,"Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) assembles a crack team to pull off one last job; a daring heist of a safe which contains $35 million dollars worth of gold bars. However, shortly after the heist has been completed, one of the team turns against the others and escapes with the gold and leaves the remaining members of the team for dead. Following this betrayal, Charlie and his crack team which includes computer genius Lyle (Seth Green), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), and getaway driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) set to work in recovering the gold back from the 'rat' in the group with the assistance of safe cracker Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron).I saw the 1969 version of The Italian Job some time ago and remember finding it reasonably enjoyable (although I recall it having a rather bizarre ending). However, I have to admit to possibly enjoying this remake/reboot slightly more....I think the biggest strength of this film lies with the characters and their dialogues; as we're introduced to each character we're given a little bit of background information on each character in order to explain away their relevant 'expertise' but it's done in a way that was both funny and clever. I quite liked the way that each character was set-up in this way. I also felt a great sense of camaraderie between the cast; the whole production was done in a very slick and tongue in cheek manner; I thought the scenes between Green and Statham were the funniest and strongest scenes, but the rest of the cast were all great as well.Another big strength with this film is that it's just so much fun; some heists films have a tendency to become over-plotted and throw in twist after twist. However, with the Italian Job we're just given a straight-forward plot, but yet it's still entertaining enough to keep you interested.The chase sequences are fun, the direction, editing and basically all technical areas are also excellent resulting in a film that's not only fun, but it's also quite a good looking film too.Perhaps having low expectations helped here - I thought the original was a good film rather than a great one so I wasn't expecting much here, but the plot moved along almost as fast as the Minis, the script and the camaraderie between the cast were also top notch and above all else it was fun. Definitely worth watching (especially if you were a fan of the original).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Maybe not the most original movie, but a very good one in the genre of the heist / action flicks","A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...The story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Highly entertaining,If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place.  It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters.  It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark.  That image is burned in my mind forever.  As an actor though he is pretty good.  This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns.  I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Forget the Coopers, I want a Charlize","Greetings again from the darkness.  Today's giant movie screens and earth rumbling sound systems make action films an exhilarating experience.  Throw in a nice story and some eye candy and it is truly a blast.  OK the story is just a reshaping of the original with Michael Caine, but the added humor - mostly supplied by Seth Green (""Austin Powers"" and ""Knockaround Guys"") and the super cool guys - Jason Statham, Marky Mark and veteran Donald Sutherland add a punch to this one.  Who am I kidding?  The big difference here is the eye candy!  The mini-Coopers and Charlize Theron add a touch of Bond.  Whether the stunner is driving the fun cars or cracking a safe in her hotel room, she is captivating.  The films weak link is the usually dependable Edward Norton who seems to be sleep walking through his role. Maybe he has reached the point where he feels he deserves more screen time. His role is important, but his lackluster performance doesn't ruin the film at all.  Would have enjoyed seeing what a meatier performance could have added to the film, though.  Anyway, enjoy the ride and the view!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slick, amusing caper film; Gray's best movie featuring  Davis' best soundtrack","My reaction to this remake of ""The Italian Job"" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of ""Italian Job"" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth.Still, I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original (though I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes.What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly, witty, pulsing arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brush work and quiet moments - it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this - I haven't heard this kind of ringing, chiming, pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like ""Rumble Fish"". There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here, along with some pop song remakes that range from ""all right"" to ""inspired"". For people to whom the soundtrack is important, this movie is a delight.On to the movie: I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg, but he's okay here as the leading man, and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest ""major"" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid, fat-free performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in (rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film), but he's still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character ""Wrench"", who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast (although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the ""late walk on"" nature of the character). If I were a cynical sort,I would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah, never happen...Production values, camera work, stunts, plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly (with the exception of the ""Wrench"" character, see above).The dialog has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross, and then asks him, ""Were you surprised??"" Hmmm, maybe you had to be there...)Of course the movie requires a certain level of ""suspension of disbelief"" to work, but if you just relax and go along with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc), you'll have a fun ride.""The Italian Job"": it's lightweight summer fluff, but it's very good for what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an ""8"" but I'd give it a ""7.5"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great, fun, caper flick","The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.Special kudos to the background music. They truly set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music, I found it to be the classiest part of the film.8 out of 10. Not awe-inspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.Barky",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Italian Job,"Aside from carrying through the ""Bridger"" name (and he had nothing to do with the robbery either, being incarcerated during Her Majesty's pleasure), this has nothing at all to do with the 1969 film of the same name. This is just an excuse to assemble a decent cast, and have some fun. To that end, it works OK. A gang of clever thieves plan end execute a daring heist to steal a great deal of gold from an house in Italy. On their way out of the country, though, they are betrayed and left for dead in an icy reservoir. Spin on a year, and our gang - minus their leader Donald Sutherland (""Bridger"") have tracked down the traitor, and are determined to get their loot back. It's quite a charismatic effort this - Jason Statham as ""Handsome Rob""; Seth Green as they nerdy ""Lyle"" and Yasiin Bey ""Left Ear"" work with well the daughter of their murdered comrade ""Stella"" (Charlize Theron) to mastermind and execute this audacious theft. Sadly, though - Mark Wahlberg is pretty charm free, as is Edward Norton and the film takes far too long to build up anything like enough pace to get it interesting. The last twenty minutes are quite exciting, but for my money it was all too little too late. Good looking production, though - pity even the minis could not spice it up.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
FAST PACED EXCITING MOVIE,"I went to see THE ITALIAN JOB with mixed reviews in my head.  I was pleasantly surprised with an entertaining close to 2 hours.

If you like fast paced action movies, this is the one to see.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ocean's Five.,"John Bridger's gang of thieves are double crossed and left for dead after a daring gold raid in Venice. The surviving members regroup and convene in L.A. to enact revenge and recapture their gold ... the job is on!This could have been a complete disaster, I'm British and the wave of revulsion that boomed in my homeland upon hearing of this remake was explosive; ""how dare they remake a British institution"" was the cry. Things were not helped in the run up to the film's release by main star (and draw card) Edward Norton, proclaiming that the film was a contractual obligation and that fans of his work would be better advised to give The Italian Job a miss...Had to be a stinker then surely? Actually no it isn't. Director F. Gary Gray hasn't remade the ""Italian Job"" of 1969, in fact he hasn't even re-imaged it, the minis are in there, the gold is in there, but all the stand out moments so beloved by many in the 69 film of the same name are not to be seen at all. So what we get is a very cool heist-come revenge movie, that's maybe a tad too glossy at times, but it has got a pretty sharp script, tight action sequences and a group of actors working very well as a team. Mark Wahlberg, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Seth Green and the delectably delicious Charlize Theron all come out smelling of roses, whilst Edward Norton really had no cause for concern because his portrayal as Steve is a smarmy delight.I have jokingly titled this film ""Ocean's 5"", but that is in no way detrimental to ""The Italian Job"", it lacks the jazzy coolness of ""Soderbergh's Ocean's 11"", but it's a fun and enjoyable picture all in its own right, thus the rating of just under 7 IMDb is actually spot on. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
non-stop action film,"I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job& is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I do love this kind of movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nothing like as new and inspiring as the 1969 original,"The original 1969 film offered something different. Set mostly in Turin-Italy the film is about a group of clumsy English villains who set out to grab a stash of gold bullion during transit. They find themselves up against it with both the Mafia and the Italian authorities. Much of the film is very typically British from the cast and their accents to the Austin Mini cars (red, white and blue with GB stickers on the back!).This is one of the few films I can think of that doesn't have a happy ending but it does have the feel good factor and an excellent cliff hanger to boot. When viewed today it obviously lacks some of the refinements we have come to expect from the typical Hollywood blockbuster, some of the acting and camera shots are laughable. However 35 years on it still hold it's own and has many merits including...Good music Lovely cars 60's Fashion Stunning backdrops Good stunts Original and plausible plot Memorable cliff hangerA very British film with plenty of character 8/10The new film is very different to the original movie. In fact most of the good features that the original had going for it were lost. In it's place is a blatant marketing exercise for the new BMW mini mixed in with some good but uninspiring action sequences. The new film starts in Italy but then moves to the U.S. which for me misses the point slightly. I found that the plot involving the traffic light control method used in the new film to be rather geeky and unbelievable at best (another feature that worked better in the old film).Despite it's faults the film contains some nice action sequences and is watchable (although one viewing is more than enough).If I hadn't already seen it all before, by itself this might be a great film. However I have and this isn't. 5/10",,Anonymous,Crime
Charlie's gang rather than Charlie's crew,"In crime films, protagonist's side breaks laws, steals money, and do all illegal crimes, so it is important that they win the sympathy of audience. They are usually intelligent and charming. The more important thing is that they do not cause damage to harmless people first. However, threatening pedestrians by taking car race into peaceful sidewalk and messing with public transport system filled with many citizens are all started by Charlie's gang as Steve puts it. Steve becomes the one who follows 'gang' into totally unrelated innocent people. Also Steve is the one who distances from the mass and the mess on the road.Story seems disconnected at the half of the movie. Preparation and planning part of the crime become totally different and useless after what's put into action hastily at the end. Finally, Wahlberg and Theron's performance is not charismatic enough to lead the movie, audience, or their team.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Medium, ordinary but nonetheless fun to watch","Overall a good movieThe bank job it's the typical action film, with some minor improvements. Team work is not something which i didn't see before, this isn't the first film which insists on the robbery business, and won't be the last one. The cast tough famous wasn't so good, actually it was medium to overstate. Still what makes it a good action title?this time is in the details, this is the most important plus. Not the acting, not the end, not the far fetched story, but the details.It was lively I admit, which made it pleasant to watch, but it's not all about the rhythm. There are other things which should be take in considerings, like: characters. The character typology was standard: the beautiful, dangerous woman, the impulsive leader, the computer genius, not to mention the handsome skilled driver. It wasn't something new, and surely wasn't fortunate.The simple alignment of a title, to action genre doesn't or shouldn't undervalue important aspects such as originality and authenticity, which are clearly neglected here.Not bad but still lacking originality and authenticity.

Very Entertaining Heist Movie & A Big Plug For MINIs,"I wonder how many MINI Cooper automobiles were sold thanks to this movie? It couldn't help but add to the sales of this little car, which is featured in this film, along with an attractive cast.This is a very, very entertaining heist-and-chase film. It features a ""cool"" cast with Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham.The best chase scene is right at the beginning with a boat pursuit in Venice, Italy. The film doesn't overdo the violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few short exceptions). features interesting characters and is nicely firmed. The cat-and-mouse game between Norton and Theron's characters is suspenseful and fun to watch.Once again, however, we are manipulated into rooting for criminals portrayed as ""the good guys."" How many times has this happened since the days of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" in the 1960s? It's twisted Hollywood, for you. In here, one of the criminals (Norton) stole and killed the leader and father figure (Donald Sutherland) of the gang, so he's the worst of the bunch and the film's villain. Also Theron's character is in the typically overblown-feminist mode of Hollywood in which women can do all things (including driving a car) better than a man. A third minor irritation is Seth Green's smug, smart-ass attitude which we also are supposed to go along with because it's hip and cool.Despite these hindrances, it is an extremely entertaining movie and it also doesn't overboard on the profanity or sex....and, yes, those little cars are cool.

"Enjoyable, if inferior to the 1969 film...","The 1969 film I don't revere as a classic but it was very entertaining, and I have to say this film is just as enjoyable. While inferior in some aspects I actually noticed one or two improvements. The plot does meander slightly in the second half, and I found Edward Norton's villain too sleazy and one-dimensional. The film is also a tad too long by about two or three minutes. But it is very fast paced, looks great, has a great soundtrack and has some wonderful set pieces, very like the 1969 film. Where the improvements come are in the direction and the script, here the direction is super-charged, in the 1969 film I found it too flashy, and the script was smarter and more consistent. And the acting wasn't bad either. Mark Wahlberg takes on the Michael Caine role with real enthusiasm and charm and Seth Green is very funny in a very different role. Not to mention Charlize Theron, who is very beguiling as the sassy safe cracker. Overall, entertaining and enjoyable. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thanks for the Trailer Paramount!,"With all the money that movie studios make, it's nice to know that there are still people out there who can take the time out of their busy schedule to thank the people who got them where they are. Paramount for example has been kind enough to shrink down their latest caper movie, ""The Italian Job"" in to a nice 45 second trailer. If one is fortunate enough to catch this on TV (which shouldn't be a problem), they should take the time to write Paramount and thank them for keeping $7-$10 in their wallet. This movie was THAT 45 SECOND TRAILER STRETCHED OUT OVER 90 MINUTES. I am sorry, but they put everything that would have been enjoyable about this movie in the trailer.

Unrelenting action!,"This is your basic remake of an old caper film and while it has nothing new to offer as far as the plot is concerned, the action sequences are thrilling to watch. The story is about an older thief named John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who is in Venice with his gang and they steal 35 million dollars in gold bars but when they are in the Alps they are ambushed by a bunch of armed men headed by Steve (Edward Norton) who is in their gang as well. John is killed and Steve takes off with the bars. A year later Charlie (Mark Wahlberg) gets the gang together again and have tracked Steve down in Los Angeles. The gang consists of Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def), Lyle (Seth Green) and they also enlist Johns daughter Stella (Charlize Theron) who is an expert safe cracker. They elaborate a scheme to steal back the gold bars and the action never lets up. Sounds like a very familiar story and it is but director F. Gary Gray does a very wise thing with this material. Its loaded with car and boat chases with helicopters and the way they steal the gold bars is actually pretty creative. The action never really ceases much so the film never becomes boring. Forget about logic, this is one of those summer films that you can just sit back and enjoy. Its nowhere near being a great film like Michael Mann's ""Thief"", but it is a little better than ""Swordfish"" minus a beautiful actress getting topless. Edward Norton has stated that he only did this film out of a contractual agreement but he does seem to be having fun playing a real bad guy. His character Steve is your cliche' backstabber but he is enjoyable to watch. Seth Green has the funniest moments in the film as Lyle who insists that he is the original Napster and doesn't generate much respect from his fellow gang members. If you go and see this film you can expect the same story you have seen many times before but the characters are engaging and the theft itself of the gold bars is done in a very exciting manner.

slight but moderately entertaining caper film,"Urbanites who spend half their waking hours stuck in non-stop traffic jams may get a kick out of `The Italian Job,' in which one of the characters finds a way to bring almost the entire metropolitan LA area to a gridlocked standstill.The film, a remake of a 1969 vehicle starring Michael Caine, is an entertaining caper tale that provides all the elements we expect to find in a film of this sort: the elaborate heists, the high tech gadgetry, the inevitable double crosses and the benevolent thieves who would give Mother Teresa a run for her money in the pure-of-heart sweepstakes.  The story begins in Venice, Italy, where a cadre of thieving buddies, under the tutelage of one Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), pulls off an amazing heist of some gold bars valued at $35 million.  But before any of the guys have had a chance to even cash in and enjoy their stake, they are betrayed by one of their own  Steve, played by Edward Norton  who kills their mentor, the beloved John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and leaves the rest of the gang for dead in a near-frozen river in the snowy Alps.  A year later, thawed out and not a little peeved at the turn of events, Charlie and the rest of the crew discover Steve's whereabouts in Los Angeles and plot out an enormously complicated scheme to exact their revenge - more for their slain buddy, of course, than for the gold itself.The plotting is never really as compelling as it could be, but `The Italian Job' boasts enough finesse and skill in its execution to make the film fun for most of its running time.  The biggest flaw in the screenplay is that it doesn't take full advantage of the tension and conflict inherent in the narrative setup.  We want to see more confrontation scenes between the `good' thieves and the one `bad' one, but Steve rarely spends any screen time confronting his pursuers.  That's why the best scene by far is one that occurs in a restaurant when the antagonists DO actually square off against each other fact to face.  The overall lack of interaction between these two forces might have been less noticeable and detrimental had the filmmakers come up with any internecine conflicts among Charlie and the other members of his brigade.  Instead, these guys all get along so swimmingly with one another that all we are really able to do is watch the mechanics of the storyline as they play themselves out.  The men have no disagreements, no differences of opinion and no conflicts of interest within their happy little group, a defect in the screenplay which robs the film of some of the tension it might otherwise have had.Still, `The Italian Job' is a smooth, fairly standard, fairly enjoyable little time waster with a few good chases both on land and sea, some deft acting and a smattering of amusing one-liners to keep us from walking out of the theater.  That one forgets the movie the minute one leaves the theatre is pretty much par for the course for this genre anyway.",,Anonymous,Crime

But then Norton gets real greedy and in turn steals the bullion from the rest, killing Sutherland and nearly all the others. Of course they're out for revenge, but revenge is a dish best served cold. Still they're all a little emotional on this one given the circumstances.New on the team is Charlize Theron who is Sutherland's daughter and she brings safe-cracking skills into the mix. They will be needed before the film is over.Edward Norton in his career has done a nice variety of sociopathic types from The Score, Primal Fear, and American History X. He's some piece of work in The Italian Job, but Norton is an actor who creates a peculiar fascination with the evil he does.The key man as the team attempts to heist the bullion again from Norton is Seth Green the computer hacker. What he does I can't say, but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the greatest heist films ever made!!,"The Italian job is an amazing heist film, and probably one of the best remakes ever made. The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker a brilliant thief who's team pull off the perfect heist and get's away with one of the biggest stashes in film history. But after Charlie and his boys get away with the loot somethings goes terribly wrong and now Charlie and his gang are off to L.A. to settle the score. The Italian Job is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it, it's an enthralling and pulse-pounding heist film that will have doubling over with laughter at the same time keeping you on the edge of your seat.

"Sometimes remakes are a good thing, sometimes they're not.","Sometimes remakes are a good thing, sometimes they're not. This one is very loosely based on the film of the same name in the 1960's starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward with Benny Hill as the comedy relief. That film was a so-so farce, but this one is a runaway hit. The action starts at the beginning and keeps the pace throughout the film. Mos Def and Seth Green are our comics in this film, but their abilities to shift from comic to dramatic are well played. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are well suited to their roles and come off with a very reserved but appropriate sexual tension to add interest to the already interesting hi-tech portions of the film. Sutherland's role, while brief, is the perfect set up for the remainder of the film. Statham does what he does best, and his character is a mix between The Transporter and The Mechanic, with a splash of smooth to balance it out. As always, whether good guy or bad guy, Ed Norton's presence is perfect to create the correct tension in the movie. Good plot, great scenery, and exceptional photography make this a film the entire family can enjoy together, despite the PG-13 rating. Collectible if you like action adventure, although you will probably pull it out as an afterthought.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not brilliant, but not too shabby either","It's not a movie you watch over and over again, but this ""re-imagining"" is not that bad. In fact, give it any other name and the only similarities between this movie and the Michael Caine version would be the presence of mini's. The story is pretty predictable and forgettable, but it is the characters that make the story watchable. Or at least, some of the characters.Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, though OK, aren't the larger-than-life characters you'd expect from a film like this. Accordingly they pale next to the likes of Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def, all of whom seem to compete amongst themselves to see who can steal scenes off each other. Seth Green seems to win most of the time but Mos Def in particular was a pleasant surprise. I'm no great fan of musicians turning to acting, especially ones with weird names. But he gave a great performance and gives me hope for ""The Hitch-Hikers Guide..."" out later this year.As mentioned, the plot is best forgotten in favour of watching the characters interact, which is where the film really scores.It's good enough that I'll watch the sequel when it arrives, but just for the characters, you understand.

not inventive enough,"In the past couple of years, I've seen much better heist films, like Ocean's 11, the Heist, and the Score.  Those were much better and had better double crossing plots.

But, I didn't think much of the Mini-Cooper chase. It wasn't that great or original.  And there wasn't that twist at the end where someone you thought was good or bad is exactly the opposite.FINAL VERDICT:  I like smart, somewhat funny, last robbery job movies.

"Plot twists and dialogue are not the film's strong point, but the lack of conflict is compensated for by the dominance that Gary Gray exerts over the action and chase scenes","Directed by F. Gary Gray, a filmmaker guided by a screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers, inspired by the original 1969 script, signed by Troy Kennedy-Martin, a classic with Michael Caine as the protagonist. In the line of the frenetic heist movie booklet, The Italian Job presents us with a millionaire heist in Venice, commanded by John Bridgen (Donald Sutherland), an old-time bandit who is planning to retire. In a very specific situation, he and his group are betrayed by Steve Frezelli (Edward Norton), a member of the gang that, in addition to having taken an immense amount of money, annihilated the life of Bridgen, a man very dear to his pupils, in particular, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). When he meets Stella (Charlize Theron), the daughter of the mentor killed in the act of betrayal, everything indicates that he will be a companion in the plans of the smart and agile girl like her father: revenge on Frezelli.This The Italian Job leaves nothing to be owed to The Italian Job (1969), starring Michael Caine in 1969. In fact, the two films don't even look alike: while the original film bet on a comic atmosphere and Caine's cynic-filled charm, this new version takes his story seriously and portrays Wahlberg as an extremely rational and far from irreverent guy. Another important detail: if the 'coup in Italy' that gave rise to the English titles of both films only occurred towards the end of The Italian Job (1969), now it happens in the very first act of the story - and the 'work' does not occur. More in Turin, but in the beautiful Venice (which, contrary to what was seen in The Extraordinary League, is correctly used this time).Even if it doesn't openly invest in comedy, The Italian Job has its moments of good humor - especially when dealing with the interesting criminals who work for Charlie, who have distinct and always curious personalities (in the '69 version, only the anti-hero played by Caine stood out, since his gang had more than a dozen elements). Presenting the viewer with remarkable facts in the past of each of the bad guys (in short but hilarious flashbacks), the great script written by the couple Wayne and Donna Powers justifies the nicknames of their characters: Handsome Rob (Statham), Left Ear (Mos Def) and Napster (played by Seth Green, who has some of the best dialogue and whose explanation for his nickname is genius - but you'll have to watch the movie to get to know her).Meanwhile, Mark Wahlberg once again delivers a restrained but paradoxically intense performance, giving Charlie Croker a strong air of decency - something very important, as it redeems him with the viewer, who ends up ignoring his 'line of work' for realizing that the boy is a nice guy. In addition, Wahlberg is one of those actors who manage to always be vulnerable, which leads us to question the fate of his characters (unlike, for example, Vin Diesel, who seems indestructible). What's more: finding a worthy antagonist in Edward Norton's villain (who appears with a very naughty mustache), Charlie is forced to use all his experience to try to trick an enemy capable of anticipating his every move, which gives a great dynamic to the narrative - after all, there is nothing more fascinating than seeing two equally intelligent individuals facing each other.Another brilliant aspect of The Italian Job is the way in which the script illustrates the 'heroes' preparing for the coup - especially when they are surprised by complications that require improvised solutions (at a certain point, they have to figure out which, among three armored cars, is transporting the gold - and the way out is simple, but ingenious). Keeping the suspense going through a growing atmosphere of tension, director F. Gary Gray surprises the viewer at every turn thanks to the well-choreographed action and the great use of his locations (especially Venice).Things start off interesting and stay that way even in quiet scenes like planning retribution. The robberies being shown from planning to execution, interestingly, never spoils the surprise: they reveal just what is necessary to keep the viewer interested for when they get their hands on the dough. That's when the action steals the show. With a level of absurdity well dosed, such scenes are unreal enough to fit into a fictional universe, but also realistic enough to not require the viewer to detach themselves too much from reality. One of the great merits of such sequences is the minimal use of CGI to get a good result - minimal because there's always a little bit of it in explosions and the like. Either way, it's pretty clear that the scenes were shot with real people in real cars in real places.The base plot is simple and opens up the chance for director F. Gary Gray to bring out the best heist films have: charisma and charm. Charisma comes with the finely tuned cast, which also includes Mos Def, Seth Green and Jason Statham. The camaraderie between everyone is clear and the way in which their different abilities are presented and explored works really well. Even when Charlie needs to detail who they are in a very expository way, Gray makes fun flashbacks of each other's past feats appear on screen, in which the past of one of them claiming to have created Napster alone is worth a laugh.Favored by a high level production, beautiful locations (which include Italy and Canada) and an eye-catching cast, The Italian Job is a film that greatly appeals to fans of the action genre. The pacing is great and the chases are very convincing. On the other hand, he also doesn't let those who prefer a more elaborate story down, as the script brings good ideas and good moments of humor. The direction of actors is one of the most competent, creating quick and efficient empathy links between the (large) cast and the audience. Anyway, it's a work that fulfills what it promises... as long as the audience manages to forget for a few minutes about George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts...A curiosity: the character Lyle (played by Seth Green, from Austin Powers) swears he was the true inventor of Napster, an idea that would have been stolen from him by Shawan Fanning, his then roommate, and recognized worldwide as the real creator of the program. The fun thing about the film is that in the scene where the alleged robbery is shown, who plays the ""thief"" is Shawan Fanning himself. And finally, another junk culture pill: three Mini Cooper cars powered by electric traction had to be specially built for the film, as the Los Angeles subway does not allow gasoline vehicles to travel on its tracks, as seen in a of the scenes.The Italian Job does justice to the original - mainly because it doesn't limit itself to copying it. Of course, it would be impossible to create an ending as ironic and unforgettable as the original film (there's no way to forget Caine saying 'Hold on, guys. I got a great idea! '). Still, the conclusion of this remake is fitting and more than satisfying. The plot twists and dialogue are not the film's strong point. In fact, the outcome lacks predictability. But the lack of conflict is compensated for by the dominance that Gary Gray exerts over the action and chase scenes. He knows how to excite without being too frantic or virtuous.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Above Average Action Crime Movie,"I have to give them credit for making an original plot and not falling back on a remake of some tire 1960's film.

Fab-u-lous!!!,"This movie is on my ""Bucket List"" of best movies ever. When my kids are old enough to handle it, this movie will be required viewing. Every time it pops up on the movie guide, I can't resist watching it. I should share the fact that I enjoy movies that provide entertainment. Do I notice some goofs and factual errors, absolutely! Do I care? No! Here are the facts about this movie from my perspective.Rock solid character development and story line. Story is simplistic, characters have fairly 2 dimensional development and it all requires some suspension of disbelief. If you don't like this, watch a *&%$#@& documentary.This plot offers classic characters from Greek tragedies and Shakespeare. The thief with a heart, the thief with a heart who is going straight after this last job, the heart breaker thief, the geek thief, the brilliant thief with a chip, the scum thief who betrays everything and everyone. Then, as added spice you have the straight laced daughter who goes rogue to avenge her father. Lastly, this is the story that illustrates the edict of ""Honor among thieves."" All these thieves band together to pursue the thief who has violated this sacrosanct honor.I LOVE the relationships in this movie. That is what makes me watch the film time and time again. All these characters are so attractive and conflicted. I love how they interact with each other. Naturally, they complement each other, but the beauty of this screenplay is how they enrich each other in the one-on-one interactions. There is good natured teasing between Charlie, Rob, Left Ear, and Lyle. Gradually, Stella is allowed into this ""boys club"", but with respect for her skills and contribution not because she is just a pretty face.Honestly, this is the movie that makes me want to embark on a life of crime. If I could find partners like Charlie, Stella, Rob, Left Ear and Lyle, I would be willing to consider high stakes theft! Please, people, this is movie making at its summit. If you love deliberate suspension of disbelief, watch this movie. Just enjoy the artistry of the story/character development and the craftsmanship of the actors and directors.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Entertaining, but that's about it","I agree with several people - this film is entertaining.  But that's about it.  It's perfect for teenage girls - Charlize Theron is definitely the gem of this movie. But everyone else comes off as some sort of overblown caricature (even of their ethnicity - Mos Def, and Franky G come to mind as bumbling or over-macho colorful characters, and the white people are always ""IN CHARGE"" here).  My favoritecharacter was Jason Statham as Handsome Rob - he pulls off the character with class and wonderful acting.  Seth Green and Mos Def were more intriguing than the main character, Mark Wahlberg as ""Charlie"".  WAAAAY to much product placement in this film - you can't help but notice it.  The Red, White, and Blue minis driving around as some sort of ??? American statement really reminded me more of the French flag.  And if that is some sort of stupid patriotic statement, then why do the main characters engage in acts of crime so huge that I'd consider it terrorism (shutting down a government computer system).  The best things about this film were the big golfing guy, Skinny Pete, and the Ukrainians.  Edward Norton doesn't deserve this... he did pretty good (you've seen Edward in so many good performances at this point that he always SEEMS good), but was he under some contractual obligation? He seems unhappy making this film even as he's acting.  Some wonderful action scenes, on par with anything that I've seen, but a better story with less big budget solutions and big plot and realism holes would have made this a better movie than it is. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than expected,"Okay, I got to see an advanced screening of The Italian Job and I must say I was impressed.  I expected less from this movie than it delivered.

I won't give anything away, but you can probably guess what the motive is from the trailers.  The plot is simple but that's okay because the movie goes along at a fast pace with some humor sprinkled in here and there.  One scene to note is when handsome Rob picks up the cable girl to which Seth Green does some really good comedy.  I'd liken the movie to Ocean's 11.

The original was better.,"Hollywood doesn't learn its lesson very well. This remake of the original English film with Michael Caine and Noel Coward, among others, should have been left alone, as it suffers in the translation to the American screen big time.This film also points out how can a great actor of the stature of Edward Norton, work so differently with two directors. In the 25th Hour"", he gives a great performance under Spike Lee's direction. Here, evidently surrounded by such mediocrity and directed without any spark by F. Gary Gray, he acts by the numbers. His being in this film was the only reason I adventured to go, in spite of reports of his conflict with this production. It is very noticeable how bad things must have been on that set.As capers on screen go, this one is only about car and helicopter chases. It just doesn't add anything to the genre. It also suffers from Mark Wahlberg's almost expressionless approach to this ""genius"" he is supposed to be within the gang.

"Despite all the Mini Coopers and film's title, it's really NOT a sequel to the great 1969 film.","Although IMDB lists this 2003 movie as a remake of the great 1969 film of the same title, they are so very different from each other that I'd hardly consider it a remake. So, despite all the Mini Coopers (they were prominent in both movies) and the robberies, they really are separate movies and it's worth seeing them both. I am actually glad of this, as the 1969 film was PERFECT and remaking it seems silly!In this version of ""The Italian Job"", it begins with an elaborate heist in Venice and soon a group of thieves are in the possession of $35,000,000 in gold. But one of the group turns out to be a creep and he kills their boss and steals the gold...and leaves everyone else for dead. So, in this case, it's less about getting the gold back and more about paying back the creep for his villainy.The film has a ton of stunts...so many that it makes the original film look like a children's movie! Now this isn't necessarily a huge problem...but it could result in some 'stunt fatigue'. As for me, I do wish there'd been a few less. But the story works so well, I didn't mind terribly and it had its moments. Well worth seeing...just don't expect it to be anything like the 1969 movie.By the way, with so many stunts, it's not surprising that the Goofs section on IMDB is huge for this film.

One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time :(,"I was really looking forward to this movie.  I like slick heist movies (Ocean's 11, Good Thief, etc) and i think this is a great cast.  But be warned -- there's a reason that Ed Norton didn't want to do this movie and it is very obvious about 2 minutes in.First off, the dialog is terrible.  very few ""funny"" interactions are actually interesting (Seth Green imitating Jason Statham is a notable exception).  The director (who has done nothing noteworthy since Friday) clearly didn't care if there was any chemistry on screen or if the words coming out of the actor's mouths actually fit their characters.  He just wanted all the words in there.  At one point, a Ukrainian does a whole routine about how the CIA rigged the 2000 election -- why even keep that in there?most of the characters have cute nicknames, which just makes the whole script seem even more forced.  in the first 20 minutes, you are hit over the head repeatedly about the relationship between Marky Mark and Donald Sutherland so that you know he'll be dead before the second act. obviously there is a romantic relationship that suddenly blossom's between Sutherland's daughter (Theron) and Marky Mark.  Like you couldn't see that coming before you even walked into the theater.Speaking of which, Theron clearly filled in for Angelina Jolie, playing exactly the same role that Jolie played in Gone in 60 seconds.  there are several points in the movie where she is vulnerable (maybe trying to show more range than Jolie?), and in each of those scenes, when Wahlberg comforts her or says ""you can do it"", i thought i was going to puke.worst offender of all is Norton who sleepwalks thru one of the least complex characters he has ever played.there are all sorts of continuity problems with the movie and several characters are introduced and then grossly underused (there's a 400 lb somoan looking dude who may have been an interesting character if we saw him for more than 2 minutes).every plot twist is predictable 30 minutes ahead of time, every ""funny part"" is given away in the trailers (except some of seth green's screen time), and everyone is dragged down by the poor script and direction.

Gets the Job Done.,"I do not know what it is about movies like ""The Italian Job"", but I just love to sit and watch them. A couple of years ago was like a dream with ""Sexy Beast"", ""Heist"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""The Score"". Admittedly I do not like ""The Italian Job"" as much as any of those four aforementioned productions, but I still enjoyed this film very much. Old-time master thief Donald Sutherland has hatched an elaborate plan to steal $35 million in gold bars in Italy. He has assembled a dream-team of criminals (Edward Norton, Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def and Jason Statham) to pull off the complicated heist. Naturally the robbery goes off without a hitch and it appears the six will get away free as birds. However Norton turns on his partners, kills Sutherland and takes all the money for himself. Fast-forward a bit and Norton is in Los Angeles living high, but revenge is still wanted by Wahlberg and the others who were double-crossed. Master safe cracker Charlize Theron (also Sutherland's only child) also seeks vengence on the man who took her father from her. Thus the five plan to take the remainder of Norton's money and take care of their enemy for good. ""The Italian Job"" suffers through sometimes with an often silly and cliched story, but the production saves itself late with an outstanding final act that will leave your heart pounding and your pulse racing. The cast is all right and Theron is just one of those actresses you can't take your eyes off of. Norton is not really utilized as much as I would have liked. He ended up stealing the show from DeNiro in ""The Score"" but he becomes willing to share the spotlight here with lesser performers. When all is said and done ""The Italian Job"" offers just what it advertises: a couple of hours of fun without much thinking at the theater. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
It's not just for the money.   It's the job that counts.,F. Gary Gray directs this rehash of a 1969 Michael Caine project of the same name. A group of expert criminal nice-guys led by career crooks Charlie Croker(Mark Wahlberg)and John Bridger(Donald Sutherland)successfully pull off the heist of $35 million in gold bricks in Venice. A crooked partner Steve Frezelli(Edward Norton)gets greedy and swindles the others out of their shares by hijacking the heist and leaving them for dead. They actually survive except for Bridger who is murdered in cold blood.A year later Frezelli is living in a Los Angeles mansion whole heartedly believing that money damn sure talks. Charlie convinces John's safe-cracker expert daughter Stella(Charlize Theron)to help the crew steal the gold back. The movie seems to get better and really picks up the pace with mini Coopers racing through an engineered Los Angeles monster traffic jam.

acceptable caper film,"This film is one of those that gets such a slow start that I considered giving up on it. In spite of the presence of Donald Sutherland, the first half hour is a rather dull setup for what follows.Fortunately, the movie picks up as planning starts for the caper that is the centerpiece of the film. I developed some hope for the movie during a series of vignettes introducing members of the gang. From then on things were pretty good, and the extended caper sequence itself was quite entertaining.Still, the movie feels hollow. Theron is unconvincing, simply because she looks like she just stepped out of a shampoo commercial. The cars in the movie all have that shiny look of something in a car commercial. It's not that I object to glossy caper films; the 1960s was very good at those, but this movie lacks the overall polish so the glossy slick elements don't feel integrated into the whole. Generating little feeling for its protagonists, the film is somewhat entertaining for the most part but completely insubstantial.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Now I, like most people, really enjoyed the original film and I expected that this film wouldn't and couldn't hold a candle to it. Surprise, surprise, it doesn't, although it is a solid action film. This movie can best be thought of as a precursor to the FAST AND THE FURIOUS franchise as it feels very similar to those films. The dialogue is snappy and the action is fast paced, with lots of enjoyable car chases. This and the GONE IN 60 SECONDS remake would make a good double bill.A word on the cast: Edward Norton is ill at ease, making a film he has no interest in, but Mark Wahlberg is a solid enough and charismatic lead. Donald Sutherland is ever the professional and Charlize Theron does well in a star-making turn. The real stand out is Jason Statham as one of the crew; he did well enough to turn his back on ensemble movies for many years, instead making a series of fun action vehicles occasionally more entertaining than this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fun but forgettable movie.,"The movie has some fun characters and some nice moments. A really entertaining movie but also a forgettable one.What makes ""The Italian Job"" a forgettable movie? Well, most likely it's the story which makes it forgettable, it's quite standard and not handled in the best way. With so many great and fun characters you would expect a better movie.The action sequences are nicely done, you can tell F. Gary Gray is a real action director. The movie has a good fast start and ending and nicely done car chases involving Mini's. I have a friend who drives a mini-cooper which now makes him officially a cool guy in my book.This movie shows that Seth Green is actually a good actor. Too bad that Mark Wahlberg and Edward Norton were not the two best casting choices from the movie, an extra shame because they were the two main characters in the movie.The movie has some nice musical moments by John Powell and a good pace and atmosphere but overall that can't help it that this movie is a forgettable one. I don't think it's a good idea that they are making ""The Italian Job II"" right now, a pointless sequel to a forgettable movie, even though I will probably still watch it when it arrives on DVD.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

More of a different version instead of a remake,"'The Italian Job' (2003) is really not a remake of the 1969 film, as such. It's basically the same concept involving chase scenes with Mini Coopers, but this film has a lot more to it than that. It's completely modernized, and it involves the use of technology in the criminal mastermind as well as romance and revenge. The character story is more in-depth in this version, and the characters have a sense of reasoning for their actions. There is also a lot more action throughout the film in this version than there is in the 1969 version, and there is a different story and subplot and ending. I don't think the two versions can be compared, and I do not call this a remake.Although it contains a lot of action and good characterisation, I found that the action got old quickly. It's still a good film, but it felt too ordinary and unoriginal in some places. It just feels like a typical 1990s/2000s movie following the certain mold of character scenarios and stereotypes.The Mini Cooper chase scenes are done well, and I guess it helped Mini sell their cars in America, although I've always loved the Mini Cooper and now everyone else seems to. Anyway, this is a good action film and a good film to watch to liven up the day.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mini-Cooper Saves The Day!,"`The Italian Job' is not based on the documentary of my favorite restaurant Pauloluigi. Hey Paulo! Free plug there! What about sponsoring my weekly movie review show? Anyway, `The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, a renegade brigand who is on a vengeance journey against a former colleague who violently betrayed him. We have experienced this plot development before numerous times, so that is why I feel they should have changed the title of this film to `The Battalion Job'.  Yes, the same old redundant premise of a protagonist seeking revenge to a former friend who is now a present foe. Charlize Theron co-stars as Stella Bridger, the safe breaker who joins up the Marky Mark `Steeler' team. Even though  it is a safe bet to say that Charlize looks hot, her work here was a dull & unchallenging one. Obviously, unlike her daring Oscar-winning performance in `Monster'. Edward Norton disappoints here as Steve, the bad boy nemesis. However, I must state that `The Italian Job' does present a marvelous exhibition of product placement. Which product you ask? As if you did not know; let's just say, we will call it: `Mini-Cooper'. These stylish transports will drive you crazy to purchase one. `The Italian Job' had plenty of pasta but was a bit cheesy.

"""Ocean's Eleven"" on wheels...","...""The Italian Job"" stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron as Charlie and Stella, a pair of thieves trying to get back at Stella's father's killer (Edward Norton) by stealing his gold.  Helping them are Lyle ""The Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham) and ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def).You can be sure that the producers remade this film after ""Ocean's Eleven""'s success, but unfortunately, ""The Italian Job"" lacks the style of the 2001 remake.  Sure, the writers give their characters 'cool' nicknames that are explained in brief flashback sequences.  Lyle claims he invented Napster, but it was stolen from him.  Left Ear lost the hearing in his right ear because he set off too many explosions as a child.  Handsome Rob is, well, handsome.  Unfortunately the nicknames just don't cut it.  Everything from the wardrobe to the background music in ""Ocean's Eleven"" was cool, but ""The Italian Job"" tried too hard.Still, it managed to be a very fun and funny movie.  The wisecracks from Left Ear and Handsome Rob are hilarious at times, and every word that comes out of Seth Green's mouth is amusing (as always).  The action is good too, involving tiny cars known as Mini Coopers racing through streets and subways.The acting is probably the low point, but nothing as bad as ""Gigli"" or ""From Justin to Kelly"".  The best performances probably come from the three side characters played by Green, Statham and Def.  Unfortunately, Edward Norton's character is both annoying and boring, something you wouldn't expect from such a great actor.All in all, ""The Italian Job"" was an exceptionally fun movie, but nothing more, 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A satisfyingly entertaining re-make with a techno-approach, with equal suspenseful fun and humor of a heist with mini-coopers and traffic jam in L.A.","""The Italian Job"" 1969 I fondly remember - those three red, white and blue mini FIATs scooting around dodging the Italian police - high and low, whizzing up onto the top of a dome or splashing down by the waters, a 15 minutes worth of quite a caper of chase through Turin. It was a British-Italian production from Paramount, then ""A Gulf + Western Company,"" directed by Peter Collinson with Michael Caine as Charlie Crocker, and Noël Coward as Mr. Bridger, a figure in prison well-respected - there lies the British humor to the plot. The opening and ending frames were also memorable: Rossano Brazzi driving a cool red sports car while Matt Monroe singing ""On Days Like These"" (music by Quincy Jones, lyrics by Don Black), and pardon the pun, a cliff-hanger of a bus with the essential glistening load and Caine uttering, ""hang on a minute, lads, I got a great idea"" ending with a rallying chorus singing the catchy tune ""The Self-Preservation Society""...amusing, indeed.""The Italian Job"" 2003, also produced by Paramount Pictures, directed by F. Gary Gray (""Set It Off"" 1996, ""The Negotiator"" 1998) with refreshed screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers of Troy Kennedy-Martin's original script, successfully delivered matching fun and humor with a smaller concentrated team of six - well, it's Mark Wahlberg as Charlie with three essential partners: Seth Green the computer whiz ""Napster"" Lyle, Jason Statham (of ""Transporter"" 2002) as Handsome Rob the car expert, Mos Def as Left Ear the explosive expert (that 'don't do dogs' as the trailer suggested). Also there's Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron, as father and daughter John and Stella Bridger - both expert safe crackers, and from the trailer, we know already, Ed Norton as Steve the betraying nemesis. We actually get double scoops of action thrills of two heist setups in this version. An exciting start and the pacing throughout keeps audience going, rooting for Charlie and co.Here we also have three mini-coopers in blue, red and white. They also gave fêtes of acrobatic agility: speeding down subway steps, flying high jumps, swirling through splashing cylindrical tunnel, down to the ""open the door"" routine that finishes off a pursuant on bike. The Powers' script had fun with the key players, giving each specific characteristics that provided chuckling amusement. The plot may be nothing new to a heist story, but it's tight and just as suspenseful with its modern day techno approaches. The father and daughter drama gave Theron a more substantial woman's role than Angelina Jolie's in ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" (2000).

A Breathless Adventure With Nice Thieves,"In Venice, a very specialized team of thieves, composed of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg),  John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), Lyle (Seth Green), Left Ear (Mos Def) and Steve (Edward Norton) heist US$ 35,000,000.00 in gold bars in a cerebral plan and without any shooting. However, they are double crossed by Steve, who steals all the gold and kills John. One year later, they find Steve living as a millionaire in a mansion in Hollywood. They invite the straight specialist in safes, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), daughter of John, to join the group and steal the gold from Steve, in a sort of payback. In their plan, they intend to provoke a traffic jam and the Minis have an important participation. This story has many cliches, is totally unbelievable, but what could a viewer expect from an action movie? Exactly what this movie offers to the audience: a breathless adventure, funny, full of action, a great entertainment. Of course, we cheer on the nice and daring thieves against Steve, the real bad guy in the story. The DVD has many extras and shows that practically all the action scenes were performed by the cast, who had a specific training. Charlize Theron is very beautiful in this film (as usual).

Surprise! It's not pants,"Being a fan of the original Italian Job, I feared the worst. What friends and I got tonight, on its first night down here, was a well-paced Hollywood film that's a nice throwback to actioners that aren't disgustingly violent, with lighter moments and a distinctive flavour.For once I agree with Mark Wahlberg when he described this third classic-remake starring him as a 'reimagining'. While it's clearly based on the original 1969 film, director F. Gary Gray (to whom I take off my hat) moves the proceedings along at such a pace that during its viewing, you aren't thinking of Michael Caine's Charlie Croker and Noël Coward's Mr Bridger. In fact, you like, but not sympathize with, the new characters of Handsome Rob, Left Ear and Lyle  a.k.a. Napster.To show how different, there are very brief flashback sequences to the childhoods of Left Ear and Charlie Croker, appropriately accompanied by period pop music  and fortunately these aren't as bad as they sound.Gray allows his performers room to move. Therefore, their own characters emerge, in particular Seth Green's unscripted imitation of Jason Statham's voice and accent in one scene. Gray places the camera inside the cars with the actors to get some great shots of Charlize Theron (in particular), Wahlberg and Statham driving.It's apparent to the audience that they enjoyed making this film, with the exception of Norton, whose real-life lack of interest probably suited his role of double-crosser quite well.But these aren't substantial characters. They are caricatures. You root for them because it's part of going to a movie for entertainment value and enjoying yourself. There is no additional reason: Wahlberg pales in scenes with Donald Sutherland because there is a too-evident comparison against a great actor. And thank God he drives so much because he sure as heck cannot walk like a man.But Wahlberg, while lacking presence, is acceptable at all other times, as are the others. While we know she can act and act well from her earlier movies, Theron has her great beauty on her side, but largely goes through the motions.Green is the only exception, turning in an excellent performance as a frustrated hacker who claims to be the inventor of Napster.The entertainment value continues with far less blood than modern actioners and the ending  which I won't reveal  is less controversial than Troy Kennedy Martin's original.In fact, don't expect any of the layers of meaning of the Kennedy Martin script, the commentary on a declining British national pride and economy and the idealism of ""Britain with her back to the wall"". Don't expect the interplay of the soccer game between England and Italy and its parallel against the Croker gang and the Mafia in the ""job"". There is a single track here, no extra meaning.And don't expect memorable Quincy Jones melodies such as 'On Days Like These' or 'Self-preservation Society'. John Powell's score is standard, early-2000s Hollywood fare that will seem very period in five years' time.Despite some moments, this film is largely predictable. The trailer lets most things out of the bag and the involvement of a separate Mafia  this time Ukrainian  is minimal. Still, it's a mainstream audience-pleaser that can stand strongly on its own merits. It's a 9 on the entertainment scale (a point off for a naff ending)  so let that be your motive when seeing this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Enjoyable heist movie,"Criminals are betrayed by one of their own and become set on revenge in ""The Italian Job,) a 2003 film starring Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, and directed by F. Gary Gray. Gray never lets the pace up, keeping the viewer hooked all the way.The beginning of the film is really the best, when the thieves pull off an astounding heist of gold bullion in Venice. The scenery alone is worth the whole film. Then the action shifts to Los Angeles some time later. The thrills never really let up. It's reminiscent of ""Ocean's Eleven"" where, if you stop and think about what the criminals are doing, you realize it's completely impossible, but you go along with it because it's so clever.What made the film especially interesting for me is that the story and execution really depended on the actors not at all. Someone commented that Charlize Theron was doing an Angelina Jolie role - all of the actors, while okay, were doing roles that could easily have been played by someone else. This includes Donald Sutherland's short but sympathetic role. Some films are dependent on special effects; this film is dependent on moving breathlessly from one thrilling car chase or dangerous situation to another. This was particularly true at the end, when every time it looked as if the situation was resolved, there was another roadblock to overcome.I did not see the original film but will seek it out.

The Italion Job in L.A.? Mark for Michael? Surprisingly it WORKED!!!,"I have not seen the classic version from 1969 with Micheal Caine so I had no preconceptions of how it should be but what I saw was very enjoyable.  It is very similer to Ocean's Eleven in the sense that the two most important factors to a Heist is teamwork and an unlimited budget.  Both feature heists that are very convincing in explanation and execution but as far as the heists being a plausible reality (in terms of real thieives actually seriously going about a heist in such a way and then executing it flawlessly), is a whole other story.  However, just like Ocean's Eleven, this implausablility only makes the movie that much more fun.  What also makes it a fun movie is that all of the actors go about their characters in a very enjoyable fashion.  They seem to know that this type of Heist is very unlikely but still go about it as if it is such a heist could be done and pay attention to little details (like the cars having the proper power and suspension for transporting gold) which, in most cases goes ignored. That is not to say that the movie had no fun or funny scenes, in fact, it is quite the opposite.  The majority of scenes were light hearted and only got real serious when it called for such seriousness (like mourning the death of a character).  Ironically though, given the incredable chase sequence at the end, the best part about it is the mutual respect that every character has for one another and not resulting to the compitition of genders (Charlize Theron plays a very important part in the Heist) which usually leads to scenes that are nothing more then showing the woman having the advantage or the man having the advantage which really amount to nothing (unless you are either a male shovonists or a femonist).Moving onto the action, there are actually only two action scenes both of which are chase scenes.  Again, these chase scenes are executed very convincingly but are very unlikely in terms of practicality but still 100% fun.  The rest of the movie is comprised of heist preporation scenes which are as interesting as they are fun.",,Anonymous,Crime
Better than I thought,"I remember seeing the original ages ago and really enjoying it so I've always been on the edge about this film and put off watching for ages. And I'll be honest it was actually pretty entertaining.So, I personally didn't see this film as a remake at all. I got heavy Oceans vibe off this and if it wasn't for the minis I would have never guessed this is the remake of the 60s film. So if you go into it with the attitude of ""this is just a regular heist action film"" you will probably enjoy this.Of course it's not out of this world good, but it's kept my attention for the whole 2 hours and even though you kind of know how it's going to end, the journey getting there was entertaining and still kept you in suspense. I will say the film never went out of it's way to surprise you, would have enjoyed a small twist or something in there to keep it fresh.I thought the humour, in classic early 2000s fashion, was forced at times. However the characters were all quite enjoyable and the star studded cast did a good job on the whole.I honestly just don't have much else to say about this one and I'm quite annoyed at myself that I put this film off for so long.

John Bridger, (Donald Sutherland) played the father to Stella, however, she was a very young girl at the time and he had other endeavors to keep him busy.

Less a remake; more a homage,"More a homage to the 1969 heist caper than a true remake, the 2003 'The Italian Job' fascinatingly takes place in a universe in which the Michael Caine film exists with our heroes plotting to carry out a heist and ""do it like 'The Italian Job'"". What similarities exist between the films are entirely due to the characters here taking inspiration, and the parallels are very few, one chase sequence aside. With an essentially new plot, we are treated to better fleshed out characters. Donald Sutherland only appears briefly, but the surrogate father bond between him and Mark Wahlberg (in the Caine role) is so strong that it provides ample motivation. The chemistry between the characters sizzles more here too. There is a lot of great repartee and some genuine laugh-out-loud bits, such as Seth Green imitating Jason Statham, accent and all. More interesting as the characters may be though, the performances are not quite as good. Wahlberg is particularly ineffectual - too withdrawn and uncharismatic for the leader of his gang, and his predictable romance with Charlize Theron lacks sparks. Some of the stunt work is also a tad over-elaborate. There is an instance in which Wahlberg survives a glass window shattering in his face without any cuts or bruises.

"An Archetypal, Generic Heist Film","The Italian Job follows John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) & Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg), who set up a team to pursue a heist of $35 million worth of gold in Venice. After the heist is successful, Steve (Edward Norton) betrays the group by taking the gold and killing John in the process. With the help of John's daughter & professional safe cracker Stella (Charlize Theron), the group must reunite in Los Angeles to reclaim the gold from Steve.This film stands up on it's own as an archetypal, generic heist film. However, as a remake of the 1969 original, it is incomparable. For a start, most of the Italian Job 2003 primarily takes place in Los Angeles with a very small portion at the beginning taking us to Venice. And although there are some clear homages to the original such as with the scenes featuring Mini Coopers, most of the film has a modern Fast & Furious / Mission Impossible look and feel that the original didn't have to rely on to be successful
Also, I personally feel that Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham were both miscast. Although both are perfectly fine in the roles that they are given, Statham should've played Wahlberg's character and vice versa.Overall the 2003 Italian Job is a decent and rewatchable heist film with some good merits, but completely incomparable to the original film it's based on.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Action Film - All of the stars shine.,"My whole family went and enjoyed it enormously.  It was a great action film, and all of the stars shine.

"Not a bad film, but the wrong name","As far as heist/crime/action films go, this one isn't bad and is worth a watch on a Sunday evening, after tea. It's full of action and enough silliness to keep it entertaining.What does suck though is the title. This movie should have never, ever been called the Italian Job. It's practically sacrilege to the original, to give it this moniker and to give the lead character the name of Charlie Croker.Anyone for 'The life of Brian 2' starring Jim Carrey and set in downtown New Yoik? Thought not...The only other gripe, and it's a personal, picky crime, (that not only this movie is guilty of), is when will movie makers get the sound right on motorbikes? IT'S A TWIN CYLINDER DUCATI FFS! I don't expect the exact replica sound to come ringing through my TV, but for crying out loud, a twin engined bike should sound like a twin, not a bloody R1. It's like removing the sound of an elephant and replacing it with a lion. Slap-dash sound editing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Junk food for the tween mind,"""The Italian Job"" (2003), a commercial product after the tween/teen buck, is an uninspired action flick with a very soft PG-13 rating and a simple-minded make-it-up-as-you-go plot about a bunch of thieves (the good guys) who are after 7 tons of gold and another thief (the bad guy). A mindless mess of Hollywood action busyness, this flick might have been worth watching if any of the stunts or chases or techno-babble had been new, creative, or unique. However, this turkey is just more of the same-o same-o we've all seen before sprinkled with some contempo buzz words in a new wrapper. No matter how you slice it, this time-waster is just more cinematic junk food and market clutter. (C)",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I wasn't expecting much from this film when I settled down to watch it.Hey, come on. It was a modern remake of one of the most famous British crime films of all time which STARRED one of the most famous British crime actors of all time; Michael Caine. However, I was proved wrong and I'm glad that I was.The ball is set in motion very impressively in the city of Venice when the gang and main actors attempt to rob some gold. One of the actors in this case was Jason Statham who played the character of 'Handsome Rob' I enjoyed his performances in two other great films of 'Snatch' and 'Lock, Stock' and he gives another great performance here as well. Each character has a certain uniqueness about them and we really seem to 'get to know them' as the film wears on.Impressive stunts and chases, madcap ideas in the form of manipulating L.A's traffic light system AND quite a few moments where you just can't work out what'll happen next or what'll happen now that a certain event HAS just happened. Each scene there is something new and unique about it that was different to the last scene. Something happens that moves the plot along. Something is either said or done by one of the characters that will make you either chuckle or continue watching with interest, something that I can only praise the scriptwriters for.I thought this new version of The Italian Job was well worth the money and the time spent watching it. It was an enjoyable film with some good acting, good action and a good, strong plot. Nothing better than that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining is implausible popcorn flick,"I had fun with this one. Generally heist films are an enjoyable category of films and this one is no exception.

I mean, aren't there like a million variations that would all have to align to make something like that work, that could ruin it all in a minute and... ah whatever, it's fun, a little silly, and Charlize Theron is very lovely as the master safe cracking expert too.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Heist Movie!,"This is one of those summer films that the only intention is to please the audience, not win any Oscars.

Unfortunately, they were double-crossed by one of their own and were left for dead. Now it's a time for vengeance and payback.The acting is pretty good. There are a bunch of A-list actors that were great. I don't care what people say about Mark Wahlberg, but he's a good actor. Charlize Theron is very good to look at. I love all of Jason Statham's action movies including this one. But the star is Edward Norton. He makes a great villain.Overall, this movie is a good adrenaline rush. I loved the mini cars in the film. Better than those hotshot cars in the Fast and the Furious movies. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Modern technical version of original film,"This Paramount film is a remake of the 1969 movie of the same name that was a very good comedy caper. This 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" doesn't measure up to the first film, but it is entertaining in its own right. This film is sans the comedy, and in place of that with the clever scheming in the original, this second rendition is all modern. That means lots of technical, electronic, mechanical, scientific caper stuff. I do enjoy these films, but find that they tend to be awful formulaic absent a good and different plot.The highly technical aspects of some films render them almost sci-fi movies. This one is an example. While the final plan of this plot may be technically feasible (very doubtful at that), it's so implausible that it is more sci-fi than crime caper. Of course, that makes it more of an action thriller as well.The cast are a quite good. Donald Sutherland isn't on screen very long. Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron play their roles very well. The rest of the cast fit their roles to a T. The film location scenes in Venice and the Alps are beautiful, and reminiscent of having been to those places. The crowded Los Angeles streets and scenes are Los Angeles.This is an enjoyable action film to watch, but there's not much suspense to it. Be sure to watch the 1969 film that stars Michael Caine, Noel Coward, Benny Hill and Raf Valone.The best line in this film is from Sutherland's John Bridger: ""How many times do I have to tell you. I trust everyone. I just don't trust the devil inside them.""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Gets the job done,"The Italian Job is a 21st century remake of a 1969 British caper film starring Michael Caine. And they certainly didn't pull any punches with this one. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland, Seth Green, Mos Def and so many others. This is what I think of when the term ensemble film is mentioned.The plot goes that a team of criminals get betrayed by one of their own. They barely survive and vow revenge. Time pass and they manage to locate their betrayer. And now it's up to them to pull a heist against one of their own to get their loot back. It's workable, if not particularly inspired.And that's probably the biggest problem with this film. It's workmanlike. Everything in it is as it should be, but at the same time it's very formulaic and nothing new is really added to the tired and old clichés.That being said, it's a fun film to watch. All the actors are clearly having fun with it. Most notably Seth Green, who's having an absolute blast with every scene he's in. Edward Norton is as great as ever, although the script doesn't give him much to work with. I do hope they had given the main characters, mainly Wahlberg and Theron, a bit more to chew, but as I've said: workmanlike.The Italian Job is a great watch if you're a fan of caper films. If you're not, it's still a relatively short, breezy film that's sure to keep you entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A spectacular robbery in a not so spectacular film,"With a promising opening scene of a great robbery, you would think this movie would have more potential like other robbery films such as The Score, which, ironically, also stars Edward Norton. However, as most other B rated movies, this movie falls short on many levels.The Italian Job is a remake of the original The Italian Job (1969). It's about revenge over the death of John Bridger (Sutherland) after a $35 million heist. Charlie Croker (Wahlberg) leads his team of men and long with Bridger's daughter, they take a vengeance on Steve Frezelli (Norton) who stole the money from them in the opening scene.The three mini-coopers seem to get a lot of attention in the movie (I wonder how much mini-cooper paid?). So much attention, in fact, that they had to show them from almost every angle for a good 3/4 of the movie. In fact, by the end of the movie, I myself was wanting one of the little powerful machines.Actually, that's unfair to say because in the original, mini-coopers were also used. In any case, these cars swerve in and out of traffic during car chase scenes like no other. But even with these small, manueverable cars, they never make the action feel complete. When you go into an action movie, you expect action. Though action is delivered (during the robbery scenes), the action during car chase scenes never holds up. It's what you've seen in just about any other car chase scene ever, nothing spectacular.There are a couple scenes though, which make you just laugh. Lyle(Seth Green) brings comedy to the screen and though the jokes are always on the same subject, they never get old. Norton, on the other hand, does not deliver. Not so surprising though, as he said in an interview that he did not look forward to making this movie.The worst thing about this movie was the fact that it cut too many scenes short and made too many scenes long which should have been shorter. This was probably done so that the pacing would be steady throughout the movie, but it never makes the viewer feel satisfied.6.5/10",,Anonymous,Crime
"Great cast, decent caper remake","I've never seen the original 1968 caper film starring Michael Caine so I can't compare at all but this was a pretty good time. Mark Whalberg takes the lead here as a master thief out to retake the gold stolen from his gang after they pilfered it from a palazzo in Venice.The entire cast is of course fantastic and works well together, playing off each other and I enjoyed the non-romance between Wahlberg and (a very beautiful) Charlize Theron.The opening heist that takes place in Venice, including speed boat chases through the canals, safes falling through multiple floors of buildings and underwater shenanigans is thrilling and super well done as is the ensuing double cross (poor Donald Sutherland) and escape.I also liked the (I guess iconic) Mini Cooper chase scene towards the end, on train tracks, down stairs etc. Very cool.Ultimately this was an okay movie for me, not fantastic as it dragged a bit in the middle but one of those classic (remakes) that you just have to see. 12/26/14",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

After watching it again recently, it is a good heist film in its own right. It's not a complete remake of the original, though the minis speeding through the streets, gold bars, traffic chaos is a respectable nod to it.

"See the preview to know the story, see the film out of curiosity...","This remake of the 1969 caper film (I haven't seen the original) is the kind of movie you watch on a night by yourself when nothing else is on TV.  You know you could watch better, or pop in a DVD, but since it's on you might as well see it through till it's pre-ordained climax.   If anything, it has its moments, notably from a A-list cast.After a successful heist in Venice, Sutherland's character wants to call it quits, or at least take a break.  But when Norton's character sets the crew up (which includes Wahlberg, Green, Def, and Statham) and kills off Sutherland, it puts the old crew into a shattered state.   Cut ahead months later and Wahlberg and Theron decide to get back at the conniving Norton, who has his own bit of wealth in Los Angeles, and assemble the old crew.Despite the obvious story, there are aspects of the Italian Job that kept me entertained, if not entirely excited or enthralled at the turns of the film. The supporting work from Green and Statham gets some laughs, and Norton delivers some fine work as well (though another heist film he co-starred in, The Score, is much better), and the action set-pieces remind the audience that Gray is a competent director.   Bottom line, this is one of those blockbuster-typos that came out during last summer and gave a just enough of a squeeze of popcorn-fun to compete with the other blockbusters.

So much better than the original!,"'The Italian Job' is a remake of the 1969 film of the same name.

"A Slick Re-make, Fun, Great for Techno Buffs","The original of ""The Italian Job"" was good.  Director F. Gary Gray's re-make is better, a real winner.Don't look for depth in this caper flick.  The story has been done a number of times before but not often with such crisp acting, great stunts and the infusion of up-to-date cyber-technology gone amuck (or gone in the service of crooks).John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is the substitute dad for a young fellow safecracker, Charlie (Mark Wahlberg).  Dispensing sharp advice on pulling off a huge gold bar heist in Venice, he also counsels his protege on the true meaning of life.  Steal, he exhorts the worshipful younger thief, not just for wealth but to be able to savor a rich (no pun intended) life.Bridger has been a largely absent dad (because of long tenure in correctional facilities) to his locksmith daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron).  Before embarking on the big Venice job he calls her to say a present is on the way.  She's worried that's he's skipped out on his parole officer but is remarkably sanguine about his resumption of career opportunities.  They seem to have a great relationship - no mention is ever made of mom.It's no spoiler to report that the larceny is successful but runs into a problem when confederate Steve (Edward Norton) and his thugs decide splitting the $37M loot isn't the way to go.  So they kill poor John and think they've also wiped out Charlie and his oddball associates, an explosives expert, a computer nerd and a master of the wheel.  Well, we know they haven't and the movie follows their complex scheme for revenge. Steve's the target and, of course, an eager and alternately vulnerable and steely Stella is the key to the program.From high speed chases along Venice's canals to near mayhem on L.A.'s freeways, the action comes fast.  Lile the Geek (Seth Green) runs through techie madcap tweakingethat my kid thought not impossible.  Edward Norton is deliciously evil - a role that requires little depth becomes entertaining to watch.Fans of road action will see the hottest cars since ""Q"" outfitted James Bond go through wild maneuvers.Charlize Theron is appealing as a quick-witted, super-skillful locksmith temporarily putting aside her successful and legitimate career to use her talents to avenge dad's murder.The outcome:  c'mon, what director or screenwriter could leave Stella's broken heart unmended?John Powell's score works very well.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Italian whatnow?,"Okay. This is a remake. And I usually try to judge remakes on their own merits. I usually end up failing, often because the remake HAS no merits (eg. Get Carter, Planet o' the Apes). This movie, however, DOES have quite a bit going for it, it's just that the original Italian Job happens to be one of my all-time favourite movies. So I found it pretty difficult not to think of it while watching this.In theory, this movie should have been crap. First of all, it's set in America. I'm not going into buy into the argument between the English and American film types...English: You're butchering a classic, a film which defined 60's Britain, blahdy blahdy blah!American: Yeah, but you're just jealous 'cos we're better 'an you....for the simple reason that I don't belong to either nationality, and am therefore unqualified. Not that I have any allegiance either way. Honest.Come on, people! There are plenty of other frivolous reasons to fight wars. You don't need to start one over a Mark Wahlberg movie.My problem with it being set in America is that the movie is called ""The Italian Job"", and not ""The American Job"". Yes, I know the job at the start of the movie is pulled in Venice, in BOATS (""Boats?"" I hear you ask? ""In Venice?""), but that's not really the focus, is it? I suppose, at least, they HAVE chosen to set the main job in a city (LA) where not much effort is needed to create gridlock. But planning to leave themselves a thoroughfare in the chaos kind of defeats the purpose of using Minis, which were used in the original due to their ability to fit through tight spaces in shopping malls, drive through narrow drains and turn on the proverbial ""dime"". Bloody yanks. Sorry. Oh, yes, now I get it! They needed to clear a path because the new Minis are FRICKIN' GIGANTIC, and wouldn't FIT through the narrow spaces in Turin. So they moved it to LA, where everything's BIGGER! Even the DRAINS! IT ALL MAKES SENSE!! Kind of!! Um, maybe!!I seem to remember saying something about merits. Um...oh yeah. The fact that this story isn't a duplicate of the original kind of makes it work like a sequel, if you forget the 30-year gap and the whole England-America thing, and think of Michael Caine and Benny Hill whizzing through Venice in a boat (well, I DID say ""kind of"").The script is also pretty funny, and the team have good chemistry. Marky does fine as the straight-man, and his funky bunch of cronies work well as a team. Jason Statham (who would have made an excellent Charlie in a more faithful remake or sequel) is great as the driver and ladies' man, Handsome Rob. Seth Green is funny as Lyle, the computer hacker geek (an obvious update of Benny Hill's Professor Peach). Mos Def, one of the better rapper-turned-actors around, does a good job as Left Ear, the demolitions guy. Edward Norton is okay, but below his usual standard, as the slimy Steve. The big surprise for me, though, was Charlize Theron. I've seen her in quite a few movies, but never thought much of her. I found her kind of wooden, dull, and not even very attractive. But I thought she was great in this. Funny, cool, and very sexy. Maybe it was because she was the only one who got to drive a ""real"" Mini, her red Cooper S making a meal out of rush hour traffic. That scene, while entertaining, actually detracts from the rest of the movie, because it just heightens the absurdity of them opting for the NEW ""brick"" to pull their job. It's just product placement, I guess.And where was Alan Cumming as Camp Freddie? Talk about a missed opportunity!Anyway, It's a serviceable enough crime caper movie, but with logical holes big enough to drive three armoured cars through. It's no Ocean's Eleven, and it's not a patch on the original Italian Job. But it's good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are movies that are very good, but one little factor kept them from being classics (The Bourne Trilogy). And then there are movies that you kick back and watch on Friday night.

The acting was good as well. How could it not be? Modern greats like Wahlberg, Theron, Statham, and others were all cast in this movie in ideal roles for their style. But the thing that keeps this movie from being something truly special is the most important element in a good film- the storyline.Let's be honest. How many times have we seen movies that revolve around a group of criminals that go after someone else that in most cases double-crossed them? This storyline simply does not have anything unique in it that sets it apart from any other action/crime film.Reservoir Dogs had the unique characters and unpredictable story. Godfather was sheerly epic. Italian Job was......just a fun little movie.This was one of those movies. We've all seen them. They have so much potential to be something great, but they don't have anything truly original in them, and they end up becoming nothing more than a standard action flick. I'm not saying this is bad, because it's a very fun movie to watch. I'm just saying if you are looking for something special that will leave you in awe, this isn't it.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fun ride,"I've read plenty of negative comments about this movie, but I found it quite entertaining from start to finish.

Sort of Ocean's Eleven Meets Die Hard-- Descent Heist Flick But Nothing Special,"Ever since the brilliant remake of ""Ocean's Eleven"" with Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, et al, heist films have been in vogue. There are about two or three per year since circa 2001, a few have been outstanding, most are about average, and a few are duds. They are entertaining, more or less, but sometimes they rely on too many known plot devices. Some of the exceptional ones include the first ""Ocean's Eleven"" film (not the Sinatra one), ""Inside Man"", one of the cleverest of such films, and ""The Score"" (also with Edward Norton, by the way), which keeps you guessing all the way. (If you want to see a really great heist film set in Victorian England, I suggest ""The Great Train Robbery"" with Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland produced in the 1970's.) Some average but descent fair include ""Tower Heist"", and ""The Art of the Steal"". Among the less memorable ones include both of the ""Ocean's Eleven"" sequels, ""Ocean's Twelve"" and ""Ocean's Thirteen"", and the remake of ""Fun with Dick and Jane"". The present film, ""The Italian Job"", despite a few nice moments, fits into the middle category of being marginally enjoyable but not great.Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, an up-and-coming sophisticated thief who uses high tech to achieve his plundering aspirations. His mentor is older thief John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) who helps him plan for a heist to lift $35 million in gold from a safe which happens to be in the hands of the Italian Mafia in Venice, Italy. Like Ocean's Eleven, they use a team of safe-crackers and embezzlers who enact the theft. Everything goes as planned, almost too easy, until after the heist is completed, everything goes wrong.Without giving away what happens exactly, the thieves lose the gold, which is possibly the best part of the film, The film then focuses on about the thieves finding out where the gold resides and how to retrieve it while also getting revenge on those who stole the gold from them which was stolen originally from the Italian Mafia, who also must have stolen it from other people. They also solicit the help of Bridge's daughter, a crackerjack safe-cracker, to lift the gold. The film then uses a lot of Ocean's Eleven-type devices, describing each of the henchmen which will be involved in the heist to retrieve the gold lost from the original heist.While the film has a couple of unexpected twists, particularly at the beginning, unfortunately it lapses back into tried and true formulas. There's lots of the standard car chases, some subplots and a few characters get ""offed"" for their troubles. Despite the shortcomings, Edward Norton offers a stellar performance in the clothes of one of the most ruthless characters I've ever seen him play. His performance saves the film. At the same time, I felt some of the other characters were rather flat, especially Mark Wahlberg as the Danny Ocean equivalent in ""The Italian Job"". Sometimes I find Wahlberg just a bit too humourless and rather stiff. Clooney in the first ""Oceans"" film is always playful with lots of unexpected comic relief. The film in question is a descent effort, but again the script needed more work, and the ending was a bit predictable. I was hoping for a major unexpected twist at the end, but it never happens. The film tries to be another ""Ocean's Eleven"" using its devices but little of its charm. I guess my expectations are too high.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
This Heist/Theft Film Outshines Its Competitor Oceans,"As far as heist films goes, The Italian Job was a fun popcorn flick. I liked this film better than its competitor, the Ocean's 11-12-13 series, since there is more action and a better plot.You can sympathize with the main characters in this film, unlike in the Ocean's films. Who cares if Clooney wins back Julia Roberts? The guy is a stud anyway and could get any girl. But, you hate to see Donald Sutherland die and you can sympathize with Charlie (Wahlberg) who was like a son to Sutherland and Theron who is Sutherland's daughter.Edward Norton puts in another brilliant performance as the bad guy. It is truly a pleasure seeing this guy on screen; he can play anything! Norton is one of the best actors in the business today.If you want to see a typical popcorn flick with a decent story, fun characters, and a little action then check out The Italian Job.

Enjoyable but pointless,"I really enjoyed the Italian Job with Michael Caine i thought it was a exciting,funny and a perfect Brit action/comedy. This one though i had mixed emotions, Maybe if i never saw the original i could give it 9 or maybe even a 10 but after only recently seeing the original i just couldn't like it as much. But i do admit that it was better than expected i will give the producers and writers a pat on the back because mainly when Hollywood remake a classic British film it is awful but this beats the average remake, I liked the cast even though i'm usually not to fond of most of them though like Mark Whalberg even though he seems like a nice guy i just think he makes to many poor choices and he same for Charlize Theron i think she's talented and very pretty i think a she has quite a long list of bad choices but i liked them both in this.Overall-I found it better the than expected i taught the acting and writing were very good and the way they make the truck ""Disappear"" gives two thumps up from me. But it lacks the humour and action of the original.I am relieved they didn't ruin ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off"" none of the cast could have pulled it off better than Sir Michael Caine",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Little to do with Italy or Logic,"This movie is not to be confused with the 1969 Michael Caine film, which was about an heist in Italy. This movie does not take place in Italy, but provides a weak excuse for the title. Although Ms. Theron is lovely, the movie has little else going for it.

The Italian Job Review,"""The Italian Job"" is nothing like a real ""job"". This on the edge of your seat movie, makes you wanting the job of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg). The Italian Job is a great action packed movie which keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next and gives you everything you want in a movie, from comedy and romance, to high intensity action that is joined by superb acting. Charlie Croker, his mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), and six man team assemble to steal millions of dollars of gold in Italy. Charlie and John plan and execute this mission to a tee.However, after the mission is over their planning can not help them with what happens. The aftermath of losing the money affects all of the men on the mission team in a different ways, and they all go their separate ways. However fate brings them back together for a once in a life time opportunity to get back what is rightly theirs. A new member is added on to the team as a safecracker, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron). She is not only bringing her expertise but also revenge. The team assembles and new bonds are connected between people especially Charlie and Stella. A past leaves these two with mixed emotions and tension towards each other, but their chemistry is undeniable. They were connected because of Stella's father, who was Charlie's mentor and more of a father figure to him then Stella. This creates the chemistry and tension between the two and leaves them caring for one another more than either one of them could expect.After careful planning by the entire team. It is time to take down Steve (Edward Norton). The mission has its ups and downs and in the process the action keeps you on your toes along with some laughs such as Left Ear's (Mos Def) hearing problem from a childhood mishap.From driving cars through Los Angles's busy streets to making deals with mobsters. Director, F. Gary Gray, uses Los Angles along with Italy to provide a setting that makes space tight and the action ten time more suspenseful because of these places restrictions in ways to escape. This adds suspense to the film because of the populous places they are in.Mark Wahlberg along with Charlize Theron and Edward Norton are captivating in this movie. The casting was phenomenal because of how each character worked with each other in the movie. Norton portrays the enemy so well by making the audience despise him. His careless and less than remorseful attitude toward Wahlberg and Theron, when realizing he has fallen for the man's daughter that he killed, makes you want to get up and punch him as Theron does in a restaurant scene. Theron's no B.S attitude makes the viewers give her respect, especially when she fights through working with the people that ultimately costed her her father. Walhberg on the other hand steals the hearts of the audience by caring for Theron's character and wanting to steal back the money from Norton to, in a way, avenge Theron's fathers death.The action packed movie will leave you cheering for the team of cons and feeling connected to the all-star cast. This movie has everything you would want to see in an action movie, car chases, guns, fist fights, and even some under and above water chases. Even if that is not enough for an audience the clever acting, comedy, and romance that are intertwined will leave any viewers happy, and asking yourself why no other action movie has ever kept you on the edge of your seat like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Good heist film, with the exception of Wahlberg","The Italian Job: Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward NortonThose are just a few to grace this cast. I don't know what it is about heist film always having all-star casts but gotta love it. On to the movie, its about a group of theives who steal $35 million in gold only to have a member of their crew (Norton) double-cross them to take the gold for himself and leave the crew for dead. Well don't you know it the crew survives (minus one) and want payback. Thus introduce car chases, neat gizmos, cool cars, and lots of humour, while attempting to be serious.I didn't have high expectations for this film because by the trailer it looked rather cheesy, but that doesn't mean that I didn't want to see it. I have to say that I like most of Mark Wahlberg's films, but I don't like him as an actor. He was mostly mono-tone throughout the whole film, even when trying to be saddened or mad. He showed virtualy no personality, no charisma. The rest of the cast was a joy to watch, fitting their characters perfectly. I have to highlight Seth Green and Jason Statham. All of Seth Green's films are just so great because he comes off so slick and smooth in his character. Edward Norton is a great villain and really worked by the response of the audiance at my theatre, I heard one person calling him an asshole after killing someone (won't say who).The car chase scene was worth the wait, nothing really special but pulled off well. Its a change of pace from SUV's or Ferraris. The one thing that might happen is througout the film you will either say ""yeah right, like thats possible"" or you will be enjoying the film and not care. I enjoyed this film with a few exceptions, I would of liked to see a lead with more personality but it didn't hinder the film. There is actually a pretty good back plot (won't tell what), and great side characters. I will say one thing, ""skinny Pete"", you will know what I mean when you see it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Heists are Fun,"I can't say I was overly looking forward to The Italian Job, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Anyway, it's a fun film, with a great boat chase in Venice. And an even greater chase in L.A. involving three Mini Coopers and a helicopter!

Serves the audiences with enough excitement.,"The Italian Job is unlike any other heist movie that you may have seen.
To be quite honest I found myself getting invested in its storytelling which is something highly unlikely for a film of this genre.
The first half of the film carries the momentum in the plot quite excitingly enough and a fast pace.
The second half however takes sometime to catch up to the momentum leading up to the events in the climax. But, hang in there beacause this is one of those heist films that try to be logical considering all of its actional consequences which ultimately helps it to deliver an exciting tale boosted with a strain of comedy in it.

Sugar-coated pill's just sour!,"This isn't just a senseless bash at America or its movies, like many other comments. (For example, I agree that the musicals of the 'golden age' was Hollywood at its finest). However, modern Hollywood has once again proved itself to be a shadow of its former self, with this feeble remake of The Italian Job. Virtually every movie now HAS to have Americans recast as the heroes and the backdrop of 'downtown LA' a must for nearly every action thriller on the market. What a yawn! The excuse that it would have more global appeal is nonsense. What's London if its not one of the largest, most famous cities in the world (twice the size of LA), not to mention being the centre of the largest former empire on earth. How's that for global appeal? They talk about 'box office', but being British never did James Bond any harm! The new mini looks great, but the chase is not a patch on the original, despite being 34 years on. However, my biggest problem with the remake, which no critics on TV have mentioned, is the lack of humour and irony. The original had it in spades. It's a typical British thing that we can laugh at ourselves, hence the gang's quirky misfit nature (Professor Peach, Camp Freddy, etc.) and yet while they were massively outgunned by the Mafia on their own turf, they still 'took 'em to the cleaners!' The original was also typical of our 'lads, pints and pubs' culture that fitted the film perfectly, especially as we had recently won the World Cup in 1966. Paramount made both movies. It allowed the original characters to be English, so why the change now? Despite modern communication (like here), America seems more insular than ever! However, while this movie may be annoying, it's still based on fiction. Surely, more sinister is the new American habit of rewriting real history. Their plans to remake The Battle of Britain, provisionally entitled 'The Few' with - you've guessed it - an American in the title role, is not only scandalous, but dishonours the memory of those brave pilots of the RAF, who fell (outnumbered 3-1 against) whilst fighting off the Luftwaffe bomber offensive in 1940. Britain stood alone in the world then, as it was a full year before Pearl Harbour, when America officially joined the war! (There were only a handful of Americans on unofficial attachment during the Battle of Britain). Other movies have also had the Hollywood treatment. (The Enigma machine on a U-Boat was discovered by the Royal Navy, not the Americans. The list goes on...) This surely sets a dangerous precedent. Most American kids probably view the sugar-coated gloss of Hollywood when it comes to history, as fact. Now more than ever before, I think it has a responsibility to tell the truth and forget 'box office' when dealing with such massive issues ..... or alternatively, just stick to the Sci-fi and Bruce Willis in a vest!!By the way, the spelling above IS correct ... REAL English (something else they've nicked!)",,Anonymous,Crime
"Not a patch on the original, but not bad entertainment","I was biased to this movie from the announcement of production. I mean a film that is touted not as a remake, but as being influenced by the original and truly wonderful Italian Job, immediately struck me as another idiotic Hollywood idea. My feelings were twisted even more when I heard that the heist in the new movie was happening in LA, so what was with the title? You've pretty much guessed that at this point I thought very little of the movie, had I known Donald Sutherland was in it then some of my respect may have been won back, but I didn't.In the interests of my movie reviews, I was determined to see it, after all even if it was awful it needed to be seen. So I rented the DVD and began to watch. I was surprised. To be fair Sutherland carries all of the movie he's in, and Mark Wahlberg struggles to get anything near acting while he's on screen with him, his mumbling monotone voice fumbling embarrassingly through their scenes. It's only until Sutherland is off screen that Wahlberg begins to gather some acting talent back.However most of the cast still seem like they're walking through it. Even Edward Norton seems to tackle this with a half hearted gesture. To be honest there are two people who really stand out in this movie, and that's Jason Statham and, believe it or not, Seth Green. They're both lively and watchable characters. The others appear flat and emotionless.That's not to say it's an enjoyable movie, in the entertainment sense it's quite fun. Some of the heist moves are set up well, and the stunts are particularly good, mainly because of the effort put in by the behind the scenes team to make them all as real as possible and try to avoid any special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quite entertaining,"Hollywood loves making movies about con artists and thieves. It's a tradition, and it sure has its own place in all the movie categories. This one seems a very typical thief movie, although I have to admit I did enjoy it. The plot is well laid out and executed, though mostly predictable. Two scenes are worth mentioning, one is the ""original"" Italian job at the opening, the way they got the gold out of the safe under water right beneath the ""job"" spot; another one is the mini coupe chasing scene. The performance of all characters (including Charlize Theron who just won Ocsar for her role in ""Monster"") are just flat, which does not bother me at all. Keep in mind that both producers and viewers are looking for FUN here, not gripping performance. In these kind of movies, there are really not much to it towards building up characters as to telling a story.Overall, it's a movie worth watching for a good time.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The best way to describe this movie is ""fun""","The best way to describe this movie is ""fun"". It's a quality heist flick with a very nice cast...and the mini coopers! You might say there's nothing really new here, but it's all done well. I've easily seen a dozen heist movies in the past few years, but this one is one of the best of the bunch. All of the actors played their characters well and really brought them to life with their little quirks. And the stunt work was phenomenal. From the minis to the boat chase in the canals of Venice, it was all very believable with the actors doing most of their own stunt work. This movie is a remake and I've been a little down on the large quantity of remakes in recent years. But the term remake is pretty loose here. The only real similarities are that it's a heist film that uses mini coopers for the getaway cars. The story is very different. With all due respect to the 1969 original, which I also enjoyed, this movie stands on it's own.*** (Out of 4)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film.,"One part `The Score', two parts `Ocean's Eleven', a twist of `The Heist' and shake then serve chilled at a European locale. This is the almost recipe for `The Italian Job'.`The Italian Job' is a film loosely inspired by the cult British film of the same name. In the way that `Ocean's Eleven' was a remake of the Rat Pack classic of the same name, `The Italian Job' borrows a couple elements but never tries to clone the original.In this version of `The Italian Job', Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie Croker, a protégé to the infamous retiring thief master, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). It's John's last heist and he hopes to bring in a haul worth $35 million dollars in gold. All John wants is to hug his now grown daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron) and retire into the shadows. But all goes to hell when a vindictive and jealous member of the gang, Steve (Edward Norton), decides to double-cross the team. John's last mission ends in blood-shed and the team loses their 35 million dollar prize. Now it's up to Charlie and the rest of his gang to take out Steve in one giant heist.`The Italian Job' is a very subtle heavily encased heist film. There is a lot more talking and planning in this film then the actual action sequences. Because the film is laid out that way it makes sense to have assembled such a colorful cast.In some ways the casting choices are great but the film also has some hang-ups. In the scenes with Edward Norton, you can definitely see his lack of enthusiasm with the role. There could have been so much more tension and poisoned-filled vengeance if Norton would have put more into the role.The other casting hang-up is the romantic chemistry between Wahlberg and Theron. I really do like each actor a lot but I found it very hard to believe that there was anything more than a brother-sister or colleague kind of relationship. Did I miss something?The great casting choices actually are in the film's supporting cast. The chemistry between Seth Green's techno-whiz, Napster and Jason Statham's Handsome Rob were pure magic. These two really are the hi-lights of the movie. I really want to see more of both in the future. How about a Handsome Rob and Napster flick?I really did enjoy the stunts and action sequences of the film. I especially enjoyed the new version of the Mini. To bad those cars weren't in the `The Fast & the Furious'. `Italian Job' could have been in the same league as `The Fast & the Furious' if it would have relaxed a bit. I can just imagine what this film would have been like if it would have been revved up some. (3 out of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant Film!!,"I must admit, when i first went to see this i hadn't seen any trailers and thought it was going to be a bad under-funded film. I had not seen the Original Italian Job before i had seen this, although i have now as i was that impressed with this new version of the film. Firstly, many people say that the film is going to be rubbish as in is set in America where the title of the film suggests that the film takes place in Italy. The film explains this as the story goes on, and it does it well too! Right, now onto the film itself. The story line in my opinion is one of the best out of all films in 2003. The character choices are very good, with Mark Wahlberg playing Charlie Crokers part excellently, and i especially liked Seth Greens part as a computer 'genius', being into computers myself, i particularly liked his role in the movie. THey have kept some of the original things in the new movie from the 1969 version, including starting the movie with a heist in Venice and the inclusion of the new Mini Cooper S's, as the original minis were used in the 1969 version. Overall this is my favourite movie in recent years, and i wouldn't normally give a vote of 10 for any movie, but this film certainly deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
No honor amongst thieves,"For the most part, I hate thieves. Yet it amazes me how Hollywood can get me to appreciate the skill involved in stealing, even if for a couple of hours. Movies such as ""The Heist"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""The Italian Job"" are just the movies to make me forget about my despise for thieves.Edward Norton plays the familiar weasel role that he played in another burglary movie, ""The Score"", with Robert DeNiro. In this movie he plays Steve, a member of a gang of master thieves led by John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After the gang successfully lifts untold millions in gold from Italy, Steve double crosses them all and takes the gold for himself.What makes a movie about stealing good is the creativity that the thieves use in stealing. Even though they are committing a crime, there is a certain level of appreciation for a person doing a craft well. ""The Italian Job"" was about innovative ways to do the impossible, much like the other theft movies I mentioned. The acting was acceptable from Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, and the others, but the focus was never on the actors. All of the movie's stock was in the scheme. The scheme for the embittered gang to take back what was theirs.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pulled Off,"An opposite-field single.  Gray keeps from overswinging a la Bay & Bruckheimer, going with the pitch he's served up.  This incarnation of `The Italian Job' doesn't have the cache, wit, or style of the latest `Ocean's 11', but then again it doesn't have delusions of grandeur either.  There's nary a scrap of fat on its bones, and the characters are drawn expressively and efficiently enough to keep it from being a soulless exercise.  But an exercise it is.It's an especially nice change to see Mr. Wahlberg appearing to have so good a time, looking so pleasant a guy; this is the wrong kind of movie to be gritting your teeth in, so he's smart to be playing it cool.  More 'Judy, Judy' here than he was in `The Truth About Charlie'- which is not to say that `The Italian Job', or his role or performance within, is worthy of Cary Grant.  For one, his biceps betray his effortlessness- at least fit the forearms into the regimen too, Marky. Sheesh!",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score.","`The Italian Job"" is a stylish heist film beginning in Venice with exciting photography of St. Mark's and canal boat chases. As a `re-interpretation' of the 1969 Michael Caine caper film, it stands up well with fast pace, fashion consciousness, and unique score.   Its modernization is primarily in technology: Computers can program all the stoplights in LA and graphically reproduce all the dimensions of a heist location.Mark Wahlberg has taken Steve McQueen's place behind the ""Bullitt"" wheel in a cute-as-hell mini Cooper, racing under LA streets as McQueen did above-ground in San Francisco. McQueen is a better actor; in fact, Wahlberg has a smile as his only defining emotion, but still better than his tepid recent roles in `The Truth about Charlie' and `Planet of the Apes.' (`Rock Star' is an exception, possibly because of his music experience).  Donald Sutherland's cameo as the grizzled veteran is worth the admission price, and director F. Gary Gray (`A Man Apart') shows he can pace a film with the best of them. Edward Norton would like you to forget his  traitor turn, and I find that easy to do.Adding to the updated success is location shooting in Venice, LA, and Philadelphia by Wally Pfister, whose `Memento' cinematography is memorable. John Powell's (`Bourne Identity') musical score is modern without being intrusive. Additionally, some supporting roles are strong in concept and performance:  a computer nerd (Seth Green) claiming to be the original creator of `Napster,' a half deaf thief (too many M-80's at one time in a toilet bowl) called `Half' Ear (Mos Def), a tough crook called `Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham), and a lithe blonde (Charlize Theron) described as a ""professional vault & safe technician.""The two major heists are carried with the watchful eye of an accountant and the spirit of `Ocean's 11.'  I laughed heartily at the outrageous but believable mechanics of removing huge safes but then remembered the equal true grace under pressure in `Rififi.' I also reflected that this is just summer (`The Hulk' is still to come), and I relaxed with my brain at rest and my sensibility tuned into just enjoying slick films which don't need to impress critics with lofty themes and remorseful protagonists.

An amazing movie for the dateless computer geek,"""The Napster"", or Seth Green, in this movie is awesome!!! If you're like me, you'll love the scene at the CATV parking lot where Handsome Rob goes to talk to a girl and The Napster just watches him make the moves. He also does a funny-as-all dialog of what the two of them are talking about. Soooo funny! Thumbs up!!! The DELL laptop also made a good impression on me. As far as all the hacks go, they're pretty unbelievable and wouldn't happen in real life. But, the whole story behind ""Napster"" was definitely believable!I didn't do the research to see if it was true or not, but it was awesome! And, no...

The Italian Job: 7/10,"Move over, Sharon Stone! Somebody who was once at the top of their game is now reduced to this. Yes, I'm talking to you, Charlize Theron. Of course, it isn't as bad as an amorous night with the little AOL man, but when you're second billed to MARK WAHLBERG, your career's in hock. Although when other actors such as Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham, you can look and see that it's not all bad.What I'm talking about it The Italian Job, F. Gary Gray's addition to the ever-popular genre of heist movies. In fact, Gray is a big fan of these type of movies, naming Snatch the greatest heist flick ever. Unlike straight heist films like Heist, The Italian Job has humor and takes itself more humorously. Of course we don't understand everything that the computer whiz/geek Lyle says, but neither do the people in the movie, adding to the mocking tone of the movie. It's not exactly a parody of crime movies, just an homage.Donald Sutherland must have been aching for a paycheck. He stars as John Bridger, an aging thief who is doing.guess.one last job! Clichès run high, but so does fun (I'll get to that later). He's with his team doing a job in Italy, and they successfully steal about $35 million. One of the team, Steve (Edward Norton) turns against them, shoots and kills John, and runs off with the gold. The rest of the crew plan to steal the gold from Steve because of revenge, including Stella, John's daughter.PT Cruisers used to be the fad car, but now Mini Coopers are becoming steadily more popular. Thanks to The Italian Job, where everyone drives one, that is. The car chases weren't that many, but the culminating one was great. When three Minis were driving on the subway tracks, it was just amazing, I really loved it. Of course, there was a lot of advertising. It's basically a two-hour car commercial, with a few Pepsi adds added in.However, there's an interesting note I found. Wahlberg, who plays Charlie, the ringleader, said that The Italian Job had some of the most amazing special effects he had ever seen, while Norton repeated several times that he joined this movie only because of contractual agreements. Wahlberg is most definitely not a leading man.his acting's like a log on a stream. It starts off high but then falls down. Theron, who plays a beautiful safecracker, also isn't that great of an actress. When the high point of your career is a RECENT Woody Allen film, you're in trouble. Norton, my second favorite actor, heaps on the camp, but still doesn't come off that well. Other actors, including Mos Def, Stathem, and Green, were all funny, especially Green.The Italian Job is very fun and entertaining, but can't stay away from clichés. Sutherland does one last move, Norton has a moustache, Green is geeky, Theron is beautiful, there's a token African-American. Also, the ending is more predictable than, well, a Disney movie. Overall, The Italian Job is a fun two hours. If you're looking for more than that, stay away.My rating: 7/10Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great action, intricate plans and good acting.","This film is really exciting and the plots are just so intricately thought out. What I really like about this film is how engaging it is, that it pulls you in by sheer force. From the beginning the film shows us how they pull off heists, and this sets the expectation for what this group can do. So while we are unsure of what they plan to do later on, we willingly follow knowing it will be great. Also, I think this was the film that made me appreciate mini coopers.The acting was great in this. Mark Wahlberg is a little mild, and does not really seem to be the robber type, but he played his part well. Charlize Theron did great too, unfortunately she is the only female in the film and so obviously is given the emotional role. Plus it was her father who died, so there is justification for her tears. But I must admit, her character was pretty tough and badass which I give props to. Jason Statham, Seth Green, Yasiin Bey and Edward Norton did their parts well too.Apart from minor background stories of the group and how they started their career, we do not see what motivates them to steal in the first place. When planning the revenge on Steve, the phrase 'it's not about the money' constantly comes up, so if money was not a big motivator for them, why did they become robbers in the first place? The rest of the film is motivated by revenge obviously, but without giving a reason for their start in crime, it depicts that these robbers aren't really robbers, since they are robbing from the biggest robber of them all. Also, Charlie is pretty much the only mastermind in the film which makes the rest of them there to provide muscle or just for comedic effect.Overall a really engaging and exciting film that did not exaggerate masculinity which I am grateful for. It would have been nice to have more than one female character though.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Snap and Polish of a fie Topkapi-type Caper,"THE Italian JOB has style and a grand sense of speed and action in one of the better caper films of recent years. Where other heist-based films push the button for unremitting tension, THE Italian JOB combines sleekly written dialogue and character interaction which makes all of the tension scenes (and there are plenty) all the more credible. The photography of the inevitable car chases and 'inside shots' of the capers is terrific, with the scenes set in Venice, Italy among the best. The cast is electrically charged without that all too familiar over-the-top push. Donald Sutherland and Charlize Theron (father/daughter team) are superb, and Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G establish a camaraderie that is destined to overcome their betraying partner Edward Norton. With a cast like this you almost don't need a script, but the writing has a fine balance of bite and wit. For sheer explosive entertainment by a crew of winners this movie is among the best in this genre. Grady Harp, January 12",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Supporting cast almost makes it worth it,"I'm not exactly sure what to say.  I guess this was a good movie.  I kept getting this feeling that I wasn't seeing anything new, however.  It's a remake, sure, but it wasn't just that.  Like many heist films of late, the thieves are so smart, that they seem to have little trouble pulling off these ever so complex schemes.  I thought the car chase that I saw in the trailer was going to be spectacular, but it was only so-so.  Why can't movies make car chases like 'The Seven-Ups' anymore, or 'Bullitt?'As for the performances, Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, and Charlize Theron dutifully performed their roles, while the supporting cast stole the movie from them.  Seth Green always brings a little extra flair to the characters he plays.  Check out his scene-stealing role in 'Can't Buy Me Love.'  Mos Def really impresses me every time I see him.  He has a cool presence that will undoubtedly bring him into leading roles in the near future.I can't really see any huge flaws with this film.  The plot flows.  It kept my attention.

This is not a remake,"Maybe it was because Michael Caine turned 70 or maybe it was because there was a remake' of The Italian Job in cinema's around the world, but halfway the August of 2003 the BBC aired this film. That gave me a somewhat unique chance to go and see this version of The Italian Job before seeing the remake', since the 1969 version was not for rent or buy anyplace I could think of. Now there were basically two reasons for me to see this film, first of all because I think Michael Caine is a good actor and second of all because it is rumored to be a classic. Well I did not find this film to be a classic. Sure the car chases were well filmed (and probably spectacular for 1969), but they didn't do much for me. Neither did any of the acting or the story. Also I found the music to be quite irritating at times (especially in the applauding scene near the ending, which dragged on and on and well you get the idea!). Nevertheless, this is not a total stinker, it just isn't anything special. If I were you I'd skip this one and see the remake', something I did a while after seeing the 1969 version.The thing with the remake' is that is actually not a remake. The only things these films have in common are the heist, the Mini's and the title. That's is. The underlying story in the 2003 is a lot better and more elaborate than the story in the 1969 version. It also leaves much more room for character development and all of that adds to the excitement of the film. Also the actors are a lot better in this film, than they were in the original. No offense to Michael Caine, but the average actor in this film, was much better than the average actor in the 1969 film of the same name, even when Edward Norton made a somewhat pale' performance. I hate to say it, but his character in this film, was about the worst I've seen him portray yet (which does not mean that he was bad though). Charlize Theron on the other hand surprised me a bit, with the depth and emotion she brought to her character.The action scenes were good as well and the heist(s) were very well planned, executed and filmed as well, but despite all of these good things I did not feel that this was a great film. It just lacked that extra edge and excitement at times. That extra edge, ironically is originality. Whereas this film succeeds in portraying a very original story and original heist(s), some of the characters missed a bit of originality, as did some of the dialog and a twist or two. In conclusion I'd have to say that the 2003 version of The Italian Job is not a classic, but definitely worth a look, since it is better than it's predecessor carrying the same name.The Italian Job (1969): 5 out of 10The Italian Job (2003): 7,25 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good movie - Too bad Mark Wahlberg was so distracting,"There is a scene at the beginning of The Italian Job that let me know I was seeing something different from the average action, heist caper. During the opening chase sequence, a boat goes flying in the air and lands aground without exploding into a great ball of Hollywood pyrotechnic fire. This may seem obscure or insignificant to most, but after viewing such biennial action films as Bad Boys II and Terminator 3 this past year, where everything including a kitchen sink was blown to pieces, it was refreshing to see an explosive opportunity passed on by such a young up-coming director.That director by the way is hit and miss F. Gary Grey who had success in 1996 and 1998 with Set It Off and The Negotiator, but came back to earth pretty hard with the gawd-awful Vin Disel vehicle, A Man Apart in 2002. To his credit, the fact that Paramount would hand the reins to such a young director to bring to the screen a remake of a Michael Caine 1969 film that is still revered by many today, is an indication of the talent he must contain. And the result, is a fun heist yarn that gives you your monies worth for two hours.The similarities to the original film are minimal. Mark Wahlberg takes over the role by Michael Caine as Charlie Croker, a thief who has assembled a team to help steal a shipment of gold stolen from them years earlier. The assembled crew all come with new cool 21st century names and talents. Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron) is the daughter of former slain crewmember John Bridger and is an expert at cracking safes. Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) is the getaway driver, Lyle (Seth Green) is the computer expert and Left Ear (Mos Def) is the explosives expert that got his name due to a botched explosion in his youth. Together, they conspire against Steve (played by Edward Norton) who assisted in the original heist then turned on his team and confiscated the gold leaving the others for dead in the frozen waters of the Italian mountains.As caper films go, The Italian Job zips along at a fast pace and keeps us entertained with its thought process on how to pull of the perfect crime. In homage to the original, there is an extended chase scene by three mini-Coopers through the Los Angeles subway system and into rush hour traffic that might not make the best of list that contains such classics as Bullit and To Live and Die in L.A., but does offer an entertainment value of exceeded expectations. All this culminates in a concluding chapter that is both enjoyable if not foreseen.The Italian Job's biggest drawback however is the incredible cardboard acting of its lead, Mark Wahlberg. Consistently the weakest link in better than average films (Three Kings, Boogie Nights), Mark falls this side of Ben Affleck as one of the worst actors that get plumb roles in new-Hollywood. On subsequent viewings of his filmography, I can't help but think of the lack of talent presently being exploited on screen to moderate success. Ashton Kutcher, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just three more examples of why we still stand in line to see Jack Nicholson play himself over and over again in films like Something's Gotta Give.But I digress. The review in hand is The Italian Job and despite its inferior lead actor, the movie does deliver on many levels and if it's domestic box office is any indication (over $100 million), audiences tend to agree.

"""Italian Job"" nails down all the elements of a fun, modern heist film","""The Italian Job"" is a great getaway film and we're not just talking about robbery getaways. This movie never bores and is solely focused on action, technology and crime strategy lore, moving along at a brisk pace and giving the bare amount of drama to provide fuel for its characters and story line. It's a 110 minute vacation that has all its bases covered, delivering a smooth ride with little to no chinks. While it may be a remake that doesn't really improve on the original, it successfully defines itself in a modern context as a fun heist flick.The film takes us straight to Italy for a job being done by well-acquainted accomplices. There's the mastermind John (Donald Sutherland), his protégé Charlie (Mark Wahlberg), the odd explosives expert named Left Ear (Mos Def), the trying-to-be-cool hacker (Seth Green), the lady's man driving expert Handsome Rob (Jason Statham) and the inside guy (Edward Norton). This is a pretty good ensemble with a wide array of talents. Wahlberg doesn't carry this film and that's how it should be. It's a very ""Ocean's Eleven"" style formula, but director F. Gary Gray gives this film its own more relaxed vibe, limiting the comparisons.The job is successful, but after the getaway, Norton's character goes rogue and takes the loot for himself. He retreats to California and the guys plan to get it back, with the help of Charlize Theron. The rest of the film they devise their plans and execute them, with the script incorporating character development into those scenes. Still, it's not particularly dialogue heavy and no moments ever lag.This is not a very flashy heist film like ""Ocean's Eleven."" The action and car chases are much more subdued, with little gunfire and no extravagant crashes or explosions. It's not going to wow you, unless you're a 30-year-old single woman who loves Mini Coopers, but it's definitely creative. The elements of the heist will interest you if you're into that whole crime strategy stuff, though there's no unforeseeable twists. Best of all, the drama is minimal and not distracting from the film's objective of pure entertainment.So ""Italian Job"" doesn't exactly raise the bar with action/heist films, but it understands the genre and knows how to deliver it the right way, providing exactly the kind of entertainment one would expect watching this kind of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Why do so many people like this movie,"Am I the only one that hates this movie? To me it was an utter failure on every level, with Edward Norton reduced to a taunting brat and Donald Sutherland playing the all-knowing ""father figure"" for maybe the zillionth time in his career. I cant believe standards have fallen so that people can walk out of films as dumb, formulaic and shallow as this and tell themselves they've been entertained. Since watching The Italian Job, I've revisited recent heist pics like Ronin, Mission: Impossible and The Score, and saw what the Italian Job could have been. This film cant even fall back on mindless action, since it's much-hyped chase scene with the mini coopers felt like a slight tremor after experiencing the earth-shattering action sequences offered by films like ""The Matrix Reloaded"", or to a much lesser extent ""The Fast and the Furious"" or ""Bad Boys 2"". Those films may have been many things, but at least they tried to up the ante instead of retiring to formula and copying everybody else. Believe me, people, I am not a film elitist to say the least...I enjoy trash as long as it's good trash, and The Italian Job is not that. Even Triple X, which I thoroughly loathed after leaving the theater, tried to do it's own thing...The Italian Job doesnt have any balls, in addition to wit, skill or exctitement.",,Anonymous,Crime
Unrealistic but Entertaining,"The Italian Job is about a robbery done for money and for revenge on a man who betrayed them in an earlier robbery.First off, this is a very entertaining, very cool movie. It glamorizes thievery but also shows a noble side among thieves. Charlize Theron is by far the most attractive woman ever, and in this movie she is just sizzling hot. From every angle she is a work of art.One of the things about this movie that annoyed was the branding. I don't know whether the brands were deliberately there for marketing purposes or whether they were essential for the plot. At the beginning of the film we notice the divers are wearing Casio G-Shocks. One hypothesis is that the film is marketing Casio watches. The other hypothesis is that G-Shocks are normally what divers use anyway because of the brand's shock resistance. There are plenty of references made to Aston Martins, and the film probably help market many new MINIs. Of course, they're not going to use a Ford Suburban for this robbery because of the SUV's size and slowness, so the MINI was probably necessary. The MINI is an icon for many people. Even though MINI is owned by BMW many believe the MINI is a symbol of Britishness. The car's status as a cultural icon is probably what justifies its price premium, as it is about double the price of a Corolla. Probably not worth it for a small car if you were totally utilitarian, but most people don't buy cars just to get from A to B.While watching The Italian Job, I kept thinking to myself how unrealistic the whole plot was. Everything was planned to perfection and only one small thing had to go wrong for everything to fail. For everything to fall into place so perfectly is like flipping a coin twenty times and getting it to land heads up every single time. The film is definitely over-the-top but that was probably what made it so entertaining in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
This job is well done...,"If you like fast paced action thriller this one is a must see. It offers from beginning to the end a nonstop ride. It starts in Venise with nice shootings. Edward Norton gave here perhaps his best performance as a villain. The last time I saw him in a good role was as the serious cop in Hannibals ""Red Dragon"". I think he made big steps in the last years. The picture is superb and the direction well executed. I didn´t see the original version but this remake is very entertaining and suspenseful. I liked very much the chases through the city L.A.  For all these reasons I will add it to my best of dvd collection. My vote 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Con film. Good cast. Fun story,"The Italian Job is similar in style to the Ocean's films. A large cast filled with very good actors that deliver a splendid performance. An interesting story with twists and turns. Just as the ocean's movies, the film shows the viewer how the con is planned out, and then executed. Its a fun ride with witty lines and gritty characters. Most of the stunts were done by the actors themselves and there inst much that was computerized. One big factor that helped to contribute to how good the movie is. If your a fan of Ocean's Eleven then more then likely you will like this film. Its similar in style.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A fun heist movie with a great villain,"I think I may have been too harsh on The Italian Job in the past. It's a fun heist movie. Yes, it's a little dated now, but the performances are enjoyable, the action is solid, and it's entertaining to watch the plot unfold. Plus, it has an antagonist that you really hate, which makes the movie stronger. I'll say it, this remake is better than the original movie. At least this one doesn't end on a cliffhanger.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great movie,"Would have had 10 stars but the Mini's were always in the wrong order. In the original film they are always in the order Red, White and Blue. The story was good, making this a worth sequel. The only downside is the fact that Norton seems to have phoned in his performance. Stunt sequences are done really well. Story is a bit predictable after the initial twist, but nice to see the a hole get his comeuppance. As with all these types of films, they underestimate the weight of gold and throw it around like Lego bricks. Still a nice popcorn film where you don't need to turn your brain on.

Sweet Summer Confection,"This is the kind of movie I want in my summer.  It's not brain surgery, but it's just plain fun.  A true ensemble piece, everyone shines in this movie. Mark Wahlberg reprises his ""stoic leader"" role from The Big Hit, and does fabulous things for your average white dress shirt.  Seth Green looks like he had a great time making this movie, and has some of the best lines. Jason Statham makes me more of a fan every time I see him, and it was nice to see him play a more humorous character than those he's done in the past. And I'd never seen Mos Def before, but he was hysterical.  Charlize Theron didn't have a whole lot to work with - her character seemed to be the least fleshed out - but I still enjoyed her performance.  She's one of the few ""It"" actresses out there these days that I can stomach.The action sequences were great, and the Mini Cooper chase made me want to take a trip to the local BMW dealer (which I'm sure was half the point). Those little things certainly took a beating in this film.All in all, good summer fun.

"Slow start, builds up, but loses steam","Movies about large-scale heists are just so fun to watch. After George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia thrilled with a casino heist in Ocean's Eleven, Donald Sutherland, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham, Seth Green and Mos Def steal back hundreds of bars of gold from a double-crosser in The Italian Job.Like Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job involves extremely ambitious plans to steal. The movie starts off with an Italian job of stealing gold bars. Unfortunately one man within the team double-crosses them and makes away with the gold. John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) is killed. The team enlists the help of his daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), an expert safe cracker, to help them steal back the gold.The movie builds up tempo pretty well, although much of the main plot happens in the later part of the movie. The action sequences were well executed, and how they got the van into the subway was an eye-opener. The getaway seemed to easy, and the two security guards on the motorcycles were very quickly gotten rid off. Unlike Ocean's Eleven, which sprung a surprise getaway method, the rest of The Italian Job's getaway was predictable and was almost on the verge of being boring.I would say I enjoyed Ocean's Eleven more than The Italian Job. But honestly, The Italian Job is still a pretty good movie. If you haven't watched it, you should give it a try.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Worst movie I've seen in years,"I am utterly amazed by the comments that have been left by other people who've seen this movie.  My college was presenting a free preview screening of The Italian Job, and I STILL left feeling ripped off.  The film is utterly absurd.  The dialogue is among the most atrocious that I've ever seen.  ""You can do it"" serves as inspiration.  A single moment together is supposed to make the ""subplot"" of a love story believable.  Even the car chases, which I'm told are what made the original stand out, are completely cookie-cutter and uninteresting.  I haven't fallen asleep in a movie since I was a little kid, but it took several pokes from a friend to stop it from happening this time.  Overall, the plot was ludicrous on all counts, there was absolutely no character development, and even the action scenes were mediocre at best.  Hearing the praise that some have chosen to give this movie boggles my mind.  It is perhaps one of the worst movies that will be released in 2003.  Save your money.

They are greedy pricks.,"While the car chase and boat chase was interesting, it doesn't keep the story tight.Now I'm all for action, and car chases too...but in order to justify their anger, they put thousands of lives at risk just to get even.In order for this team to complete their goal, they had to cause major destruction and heartache to thousands of people that have no involvement into their personal lives.Do the other folks who are hindered in traffic due to car accidents and traffic pileups and road constrictions share any of the gold? NO! Do the people injured in the vehicle accidents have to deal with problems resulting from the accident? YES!Now people's lives are thrown of course, their insurance rates go up. Their personal problems are increased and they just wanted to carry on with their simple lives that had nothing to do with anybody else's gold or murder.Do people going late to work have to deal with problems due to being held up in the subway or traffic? Yes, they do...but how are they to know why all this trouble for them came about? They don't...but it affects many many people who should not be affected due to greed...and that is what is was all about.If the team wanted to get even with this guy...there are thousands of ways to do so without disrupting the entire traffic flow and emergency system of the city.They were selfish and greedy and stupid...all while trying to look cool.So with Charlize at the wheel and some few chases which were pretty awesome...the rest of the story is pathetic.The moral? It's OK to screw somebody over as long as you disrupt everybody else's life in order to get what you want.This story got lost after 25 minutes and somehow the writer thought that to make it interesting, he had to cause major havoc and destruction.You'll make your own judgment...My votes are for Charlize and the cars...the plot is thin...Now there is to be a second film made...why?

Exceeded expectations,"""Italian Job"" is a slickly made heist movie that exceeds expectations with its cleverness.The movie contains a well-proportioned amount of action and comedy. It is almost self-aware that it is a remake, but doesn't worry because it knows it has a killer cast with some strongly conceived action scenes and decent dialogue to drive along the witty plot.Edward Norton adds a lot to the entertainment with an oddly mixed muted yet over the top performance, while Mark Whalberg and the rest of the men in the gang fill out the movie nicely. In alot of action movies, these ""gangs"" don't work, but each actor in ""Italian Job"" performs their purpose well. Charlize Theron stands out as the daughter of Donald Sutherland, in an excellent casting choice.Director F. Gary Gray knows exactly what he's doing, and in many ways, this is the movie that Bruckheimer's ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" remake should have been.The verdict: a Hollywood heist movie the way it should be done.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
No Cheesy Heist,"On June 27th, I stood outside of Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to possibly meet Edward Norton or Mark Wahlberg. The only star I met was Jessica Alba, but I did see Mark and Seth Green arrive in their Mini Coopers. Later, we were handed some tickets and got to see the movie! It was GREAT!!! Seth Green was funny, they were all funny. And Charlize Theron actually kept her clothes on! One of the best heist movies yet!! I think I'll go see it again (with appropriate seating). There was tons of action, great humor, and a creative plot. And it wasn't cheesy; hardly any guns, no ridiculously extreme cars (only a few Mini Coopers) and no obvious, fake computer graphics (ex: Spider-Man). Overall, a wonderful experience!

Better than Ocean's Eleven,"I think this one is better than Ocean's Eleven. It is still somewhat slow, but has a much better pacing. Especially if I am to compare how both movies started. Where Ocean's Eleven was more about talking and talking and some more talking, Italian job actually started with a job, and showed that the characters are professionals at what they do.And this is important distinction: this movie actually ""shows"" stuff, and not just tells you that something has happened, someone did this or that. This is the whole point of moving pictures - to ""show"". It does not mean you should not have dialogues, though, and they are here, too, and they are fine.

Appalling film and worst re-make ever,"What was the point of making this movie? I went to see it with friends thinking the stunts might be good, but they were nowhere near as impressive as in the original. The stunt with the helicopter was original, but the rest were yawn-inducing. The script is appalling and the resolution of the relationship between Theron and Wallberg at the end was laughable (I dropped my Coke container in the cinema in shock). It was so obviously tacked on to fit the traditional Hollywood hero-gets-the-girl ending. Jason Steatham had some awful lines to deliver. Whereas the original is very tongue-in-cheek, this was too serious and the little humour in it was weak. What is it with screenwriters today? They think they can fill a script with weak one-liners and we'll all be so happy? Mark Walberg is a terrible actor. He ruined Planet of the Apes too (another poor remake). There was no chemistry between Theron and Walberg at all and them getting together at the end was clumsy and contrived. Donald Sutherland had the right idea by dying early on. He didn't need to suffer the rest of it like we did.One of the worst films this year and possibly the worst remake of all time.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Reasonable Thriller film not on a par with the original.,"The film, per se, is not bad, but what I object to is its title. The Italian Job was a superb crime caper made in the sixties and took place, as its name suggests, in Italy. Here we have a film that starts out, true, in Venice, Italy but for the most part takes place in Los Angeles. There are some elements from the original, the three minis of course ( but which were much more of a showcase in the original ) plus the name Croker / Bridger which where a throwback to M Caine / N Coward.The original Italian Job was a ""highly funny and original"" film, it had a comedy element in it ( notably with Benny Hill as the Computer Geek ). That was lacking here. This film could not be ""remade"" as it has a unique stamp to it. Even its ending was highly original, plus the theme tune ""Self-PReservation Society"".The remake is devoid of any originality and just seems like normal crime thriller film with some good action scenes. There is no comedy and some of the action scenes are overblown with too much noise and also appear highly improbable. And it does not take place in Italy.Basically, I have no objection to the existence of this film, but a different title should have been used, and certainly nothing hinting at the original. It's not a film that I will remember in future years unlike the original, which is a true ""facet"" of English culture of the Sixties. I'm seriously not one of these ""systematically anti-remake"" people but the case in point here is one that could have been dispensed with !!",,Anonymous,Crime
Style over Substance,"I went into this with a fond memory of the original, being the first film I ever saw and all that. And I left with that fondness still intact.The Italian Job 2003 isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. The main problem has to come down to the plot or lack of it. Its too simple. There's never a moment in the film where something happens you don't expect, it's as if the writers just joined the dots to come up with their story.Starting off in Venice, where a motley crew of characters in Charlie Croker, Left Ear (He's deaf in one ear) Lyle (Who swears he invented Napster) Handsome Rob, who's well handsome and John Bridger, an aging mastermind who's determined to pull of ""one last job"".After an exciting and rather original Venice waterfront chase its into the Alps, except there's trouble in store. If you've seen the trailer you'll know what happens next.Back to L.A. and its up to Charlie (Wahlberg) to recruit Bridger's Daughter Stella who crumbles like a biscuit and succumbs to the revenge plot of Charlie and his crew.See, the plots simplistic. It tries to flesh out the story by introducing Russian gangsters and a huge Asian bloke, but really everything builds to the climatic job and subsequent escape.Sure, it's cool and stylish but its really a disappointment. Apart from a cool moment where a chopper and a Mini tangle, it's textbook stuff, much like the rest of the film really.Despite all these flaws its still fun. Seth Green and Jason Statham play their parts for laughs and there's plenty of little jokes (The actor learning his lines in a L.A. traffic jam then stealing Statham's accent once he yells at him) and cool moments (At one point it looks like they'll take the Mini's into the house, maybe for the sequel.Apart from the plot though, the biggest problem has to do with the script. It unravels incredibly simply and everything that could happen does happen. It's also hampered by uneasy switch from comedy to drama, one minute we have short, entertaining vignettes introducing the characters lives then the next we see Theron, all crying and vengeful. It's an uncomfortable mix and Theron plays her role way too seriously.If you like heist movies, see this. If you like car chases, see this. If you like Mini's, definately see this (I want one!) but don't expect to come out of the cinema and know anything new or feel like you've watched something extraordinary. This is just a bit better than average, due to its style.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not very original but......,"I didn't expect a whole lot from this film but was pleasantly surprised.

"Not as good as some, but better than most","Well, I'm partial to the odd heist movie from time to time. You generally know what to expect, so the success of the film is measured by how much fun it is. The Italian Job certainly delivers on that account.The gang's all there: the old guy on his last job, his heir apparent, the slightly shifty guy, the nerdy computer guy (Seth Green is excellent!), the muscle guy and the oddjob guy. And away we go - it's good fun watching the original heist, and then we come to the fairly predictable twist (which I won't give away here). After that, the rest of the gang obviously try to get the loot back from the traitor, with their plotting - and therefore the film - occasionally more than slightly reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven.OK, the film might be played by the numbers a bit; Mark Wahlberg will forever remain Marky Mark for me, and not a leading man; the car chases are overlong if good (how much did Mini pay them?) - but the script is fast-paced, happily devoid of soppy love-scenes and basically, any film (except maybe Trapped) that is willing to devote a lot of screen time to the ever delectable Charlize Theron gets two thumbs up from me on general grounds.

Unforgivably contrived,"From its shallow plot to its ""Scooby-doo"" ending, this film was a major disappointment. (And I wasn't expecting much to begin with.) I found the chase scene which promoters claimed to be one of the most exciting ever to be about as thrilling as Sunday drive to church. At least the forced, awkward dialog felt right coming out of the mouths of the underdeveloped, unbelievable characters. Edward Norton and Seth Green can't help but let their talent show, but the rest of the cast's performances were forgettable at best.This film remained in my local theater for the nearly 4 months, which proves I live in a rather tasteless community.

Fun and flashy but them Minis deserved better,"I've yet to see the original film, so I don't know if this is an improvement on or detriment to it...but this was an okay movie unto itself. The capers were quick and a bit ridiculous, but not so much so that they weren't involving. F. Gary Gray kept the action going fast enough to where you could ignore the plot-holes and occasional stupidity of the characters. It sure did LOOK good and had that technical polish we've come to expect of modern American chase movies.But...I don't know how to say this, but the film was like...I dunno, like a helium balloon that's four days old. It still floats, but hasn't got the happiness a fresh balloon has. And I can't really fault the director, this time; he did better than journeyman work and had some really flashy moments. And the writers...well...they didn't try to get away with all that much dumb or irritating stuff, unlike some other thrillers have tried. It's mainly the performances.Oh, Donald Sutherland was letter perfect, as usual, and Seth Green can do no wrong in my eyes. But while Mark Wahlberg handled his lines well enough, he seemed like a kid. Edward Norton, who has done some powerful work in the past, seemed even more like a kid. Mos Def seemed like a kid. Charlize Theron seemed like she was only there to make sure the guys came across as straight. But not one of them had any heft or danger or threat to their actions, despite the punches and doublecrosses and threats and gunplay. Even at the end, when Edward Norton is facing his inevitable end, he seemed more peeved than anything else. The fact is, aside from Sutherland and Green -- who carried more weight when he was mimicking ""Handsome Rob"" than when Jason Statham was mimicking himself -- the most convincing performances were turned in by the Minis. And that is sad.Compare this film to ""The Bourne Identity"" or even ""Speed"" and you can see how lightweight the acting in it is. That's not to say it's not a fun movie...it's just nothing more.

No guns in the hands of the protagonists, a nice low-key love story almost from another age of film, a bunch of distinctly drawn characters (even the secondary ones, and who cares if they are 'types': was anybody looking for anything else?), nifty car chases, and...AND!...a very impressive helicopter scene (in the garage: was that flying or WHAT?? - God, I love helicopters!), plus lots of quotable lines that you can anticipate on the next watching and have quizzes about with your friends.And, what is it with guys complaining about Wahlberg?

The single best movie about a heist of all time,"This movie blew me away. Intelligent, interesting characters, great action, absolutely incredible all around.

"Good movie, but one of Norton's lesser roles.=","The Italian Job: 6.5/10Although the concept of ""The Italian Job"" only appealed to me mildly, the inclusion of one of my favourite actors, Edward Norton, made me decide to check it out. I was reluctant even with Norton involved, as he was forced to take this role to break out of a contract. The plot is based around a theft in Venice that goes perfectly, only for one of the team members (Norton) to betray the others, killing the mentor of the lead character (played by Mark Wahlberg). Said mentor just happened to be Donald Sutherland, who was excellent and underused in the movie. The movie followed a basic plot of revenge, and was fun to watch, if not perfect. Charlize Theron was very good as the daughter of Sutherland's character, who hesitantly joins the team for revenge on Norton's character. However, Mark Wahlberg is a very ""blah"" actor, who often fails to distinguish himself and make himself worthy of a leading role. Although he wasn't bad, I felt that many others could have worked the role better. Now as for Norton's role, it was one of his worst ever. It was very run-of-the-mill by Norton, who didn't work too well as the main villain, although had his moments. Many of the things that make Norton such a great actor were missing, and you could tell this wasn't exactly a role he wanted. Overall, a good movie that is worth watching once, maybe twice for the awesome heist at the start, that is worked so well.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Average Heist Movie,"I haven't seen the original film and therefore cannot compare, however, whatever was unique about that one seems to be missing, except for maybe the ending.The acting is flat and uninspired - you've got Wahlberg and Theron as your stars? Yikes. (Apparently Norton made it clear this was a contract and you can tell he hates being here, which maybe helped his performance as a villain). The characters are all clichés from other heist films: explosives guy (also token black guy), computer nerd/comic relief, ""crazy"" foreign dude/driver, hot girl and way too cool hero. There is not really any character development as this is plot driven and action heavy, not that this is necessarily bad.The technicals (sound, lighting, cinematography) are all great but the real winner here is the editing pumped up by a steady soundtrack. Without giving much away the best part is the ending. This film is not really memorable but it is entertaining Hollywood action and I can't say I disliked it, but it's nothing spectacular.As the title implies, this is just another job for everyone involved (which explains the average acting).OVERALL: 6/10.

"Very plausible action sequences, excellent flow, I loved it!","Most of the movie was very realistic.  The only part I thought was a little far fetched was at the beginning when the thieves were loading the gold into their submersible craft.  For one, I'd think the weight of the gold would be too heavy for the craft to support.   But also they never showed how they actually escaped underwater.  The movie cut from the scene when they were loading the gold bars, to all of a sudden they are celebrating on top of the snowy mountain.  I'd think it would be hard to drive and steer the craft underwater, afterall, in murky water, even with goggles, it's hard to see 2 feet ahead, so they could have easily crashed into say, a cement pillar of a bridge.Oh, one other thing, near the end of the movie, it was foolish for the backstabbing thief in the helicopter not to think of just lifting the cover off of the hole that Wahlberg order his car remodeler to cover up with the side of a truck, and then lowering down on say, ropes, and then they would be instantly at the location of their armored car full of gold!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""The Italian Job"" is a remake which pays homage to the original, but creates an enviable legacy of its own.","The faithfulness of re-made films to their original material run the gamut from shot-for-shot remakes, like 1998's ""Psycho"" (starring then little-known Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche), all the way to movies that bear almost no resemblance to the original except for the title and basic concept, like 2013's ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" (Ben Stiller, Kristen Wiig, Adam Scott, Sean Penn). 2003's ""The Italian Job"" is somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter. This movie is a remake of the 1969 Michael Caine vehicle of the same name, and known as one of Britain's most popular films. The 2003 version is, according to director F. Gary Gray, ""an homage"" that is ""inspired by the original"". The remake changes the location of the story's main caper, but keeps the focus on stealing gold bullion. The homage aspect of the remake can be seen in the names of some of the characters (even though their roles in the plot are different), the part of the plan that involves carefully controlling the escape route, the prominent use of the Mini Coopers, an escape through a small tunnel and a dramatic scene in which a vehicle is perched precariously over a large drop. But I'm getting ahead of myself.2003's ""The Italian Job"" begins with a creative and daring heist of $35 million worth of gold bullion in Venice, Italy. The gang consists of Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg, in the Michael Caine role), Steve (Edward Norton), ""Handsome Rob"" (Jason Statham), ""Napster"" (Seth Green), ""Left Ear"" (Mos Def) and the group's senior member (pulling his final job), John Bridger (Donald Sutherland). After cleverly making off with the gold, the crew is celebrating on a mountain road in the Alps (also a setting from the original film), when John praises Charlie (the group's new leader) for planning the perfect robbery and pulling it off ""without even holding a gun."" Unfortunately, the group doesn't get much farther than that. One of their own turns on them, leaves them all for dead and makes off with the gold.The story now jumps ahead one year. The original group's traitor is living large in his L.A. mansion, while those he thought were dead are planning to steal back what remains of the gold bars. John's daughter, Stella (Charlize Theron), an expert safecracker like her father, joins the gang. They also take on a mechanic named Wrench (Franky G), who the group needs to customize those Mini Coopers that are essential to the plan – and so prominent in the story that Gray referred to them as ""part of the cast."" After dealing with some unexpected challenges and having to completely change their plan, Charlie and his crew go after the gold in a climax that is even more inventive and exciting than the original robbery in Venice.""The Italian Job"" is exactly what a movie like this should be – a whole lot of fun! Every cast member is fun and interesting to watch and they have great chemistry between them. The story contains some clichés, but you won't care. The screenplay by Donna and Wayne Powers has some very funny moments amidst all the scheming and double-crossing. Gray balances it all perfectly, makes the whole thing entertaining and what comes out is a ""Job"" definitely worth having.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bland acting and plot interspersed with heist scenes.,"They borrowed the minis and the traffic jams and that's all that's left of the original. They even stayed clear of the tightwire ending. So why not just call it the ""Hollywood Heist""?The scenery in Italy is nice and keeps one interested for that part of the movie. Once it moves to L.A., it becomes just another heist movie, with none of the characters holding one's interest. Ed Norton is losing his initially interesting ""bad guy looks like a wimp"" persona. Mark Wahlberg is flat. Charlize is as usual adorable to look at but unexciting.The holes in the plot are elephantine, so leave your brain at the door if you want to relax and be entertained. For example how does Ed Norton afford a house that costs more than the gold he stole while he still holds on to 3/4 of it?

An agreeable romp and a nifty heist flick,"THE ITALIAN JOB is a good entertainment.  You won't learn any deep truths about the human condition, you won't really see any oscar winning performances, but you will be entertained.  Which really is what most movies should try to do.Okay, I've never seen the original Michael Caine ITALIAN JOB (I keep missing it on BBCAmerica), so I cannot compare the two.  What I can compare it to are recent heist flicks, like CONFIDENCE, THE HEIST, THE SCORE, the OCEANS ELEVEN remake, and (as my Dad pointed out) THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.   It compares quite favorably.  You know the gang is going to get screwed by a confederate (thanks to the trailer, grrrr!) and that they are going to get their revenge.  The fun is watching how the intricate plot they plan is going to be carried out.  And the greater fun is watching how, when the first plan falls through, they improvise the second plan.I am especially impressed that the film is a true heist flick, like THE SCORE and THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, rather than a shoot-em-up like THE HEIST. When John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) says ""We pulled it off without drawing a single gun"", he sets the ground rules for the gang's later revenge plan.  Any dumb crook can shoot people; it takes brains to pull off a nonviolent heist.One interesting little cameo-by-proxy.  Watch closely when Steve Frezelli (Ed Norton) turns on his giant TV.

"Ouch. Bad, Really Really Really Bad","Crafted with all of the style and grace of a 70's TV movie, this smelly turd of bowl flotsam might be an interesting movie in about 100 years, as the movie that first featured the new (current) Mini.I urge you to wait.Besides time capsule value, there is nothing else to recommend it.Perhaps the producers thought Donald Sutherland and Ed Norton would give their movie gravitas; boy were they wrong. I hope they got paid well, cos this is something they are sure to leave off the C.V.Perhaps the producers were tasked with making the car the star, but in heavily edited scenes which defy credulity, it does more to make a joke out of a vehicle that since this was released has quickly lost much of its luster- and I put it to you that this movie is responsible.Marky Mark breathes really convincingly, but doesn't have more than one sentence of dialogue in any scene, leaving one to wonder if his lines were cut back- cos he's barely in the movie. Conspicuous by his presence, he _appears_ in most of the scenes, but you start to notice he adds nothing, and lets the others around him carry the weight. Since he is male lead, top-billed, it is odd when you, as a viewer, notice he simply does not pull his weight and decides to sleep walk through his ordeal and get that paycheck. One cannot help but wonder 'what is the deal?' Based on his 'work' here, I can't see much of a future for him as an actor in movies.Nobody plays a weasel like Norton plays a weasel, and he is at his weaselly best here. Marky Mark's anonymity is such that you want Ed to be the victor and smash him to pieces. It would have been a lot more enjoyable- and interesting- had they seen to that. I'd pay $1 to see that.So to sum it up, see something else, don't waste your hard earned $4 to rent this, you'll regret it, and wind up breaking either the teevee or the dvd, or angering your mate.

Well, for pushing their new Minis, ridiculously expensive and sadly, lacking the charms of the original, they obviously decided that for the millions they paid for being an unrecognized Extra in a James Bond movie, they might as well fund an entire film.

But the Italian Job is full of character's that I personally liked (Norton is a God and I love him.

Definitely never saw the original(don't like Michael Caine or Benny Hill),but doubt I would have enjoyed it from what has been described, Think of it as a new film, just some same charecter names.

So obviously funded by product placement, this movie has not one OUNCE the wit of 'Oceans eleven' which it tries so hard to ape. I've seen bricks with more charisma than Mark Wahlberg- and Charlize is his 2D, Cindy doll counterpart. The dialogue was hewn  by cretins and polished by potatoes.

Very poor,"Okay, I went into the cinema determined to forget that it was a ""remake"" of a damn fine film. I was going to judge it on it's own merits. I chose to do this I already knew it had little to do with the original or even Italy as the title suggests.Even if I look at it as a film on it's own, it fails on every level. The script is stunned, the delivery of these poor lines is also lacking, there is NO character depth and it is amazingly slow. After the gang pull the job in Venice and are discussing spending the cash in the Alps, the conversation is so stilted, it's like an awkward moment at a dinner party, no one seemed to know what to say. That's just a small example. The lines were standard pap and predictable in every way. When the film moved to USA it totally slowed down, big long discusion and recon of the baddies lair, convulted explainations on how they could involve the minis. A pointless subplot with ukranians that suggested it might get interesting but totally failed. Wooden acting from Mark Whalberg and Edward Norton just looking unhappy to be even involved in the film. All this without even thinking about the original.Just to compare briefly, the original was a fun crime caper, it was all about the hiest with a minor sub plot of the Mafia to keep Caine on his toes. It was excellently paced too, the development of the job, the set up and the actually heast and mini chase, all evenly spread through the film. The mini chase lasted for quite a while and used them to maximum effect. Whereas this remake uses the mini for about 15 mins at the end (the only decent bit) and spends too long on the setup.All in all, it just seems a waste on all levels to me but it might improve mini sales.",,Anonymous,Crime
A different heist movie,"A good technical heist movie which was completely different from other heist movies. The story was different and build intersting.

Better Plot than 1960's version - And shows off Minis Again,"I liked it that the film starts off at a modern pace, establishes characters, and gets moving right away. The story unfolds at a friendly speed with a few interesting features thrown in, including meaningful dialogue between a man and a woman that is not a lame seduction scene. Sometimes, an all-star cast becomes frustrated by the inability of big stars to work unselfishly as an ensemble, but this film provides a satisfying exception and example of how it can be done right.The 1969 Caine version has little to offer in the way of complications and subplots, which this update rectifies with flair, while maintaining an excellent standard in unique car chase elements. It is an action flick, however, and does play a little loose with scientific verities, such as how long a person can survive at a low body temperature.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A brit perspective,"People have been waiting to criticize this film since it was first announced.  Everyone ready to pounce at the opportunity to say how it is `no-where near as good as the original,' and that `the original was a classic and shouldn't be remade!'  (although when you look at the original now, it isn't really a classic!  Yes, there is THAT mini scene, and the `bloody doors' quote, but aside from that it was a slow film.  Good, but not classic.)Anyway, here is the chance for all you naysayers to pounce, and then find that you are really disappointed..'cos Italian Job is a pretty good film. Heck, I'd even go so far as to say it is a damned enjoyable film!The film doesn't remake the first film, and a recent interview with the director revealed that the intention was never to remake, but to homage. Indeed it does pay homage.  A bullion heist in Venice is successful, until one of the gang of thieves betrays the rest and leaves them for dead. Months later, they all seek to steal the gold back, and get their revenge.One of the things that makes this film so much fun (aside from the mini scenes, which I won't go into detail about, suffice to say they are 'cool') is the caliber of actors on display, and the likeability of the 'good guys' (if indeed a thief can be a good guy).  Much in the same way Oceans 11 seemed perfect in the casting, so does this.  Mark Wahlberg is the smooth mastermind behind the scams, and with Ed Norton as the bad guy, adding Seth Green, Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, and Donald Sutherland into the mix is pure genius.  The personalities bounce off each other well, creating a group of players that you do care about.  Norton is as good as ever, but seems to be just playing by numbers.  He has been vocal about how he didn't really want to do this film, and now I understand why.  He is an actor who likes to take on different roles..this was just a repeat of his performance in the Score.  Nontheless, still a good actor.Direction is pacey, and the story keeps moving throughout, with the initial heist being a work of genius, to the introduction of the players (with amusing flashbacks), then the set up for the new heist.  Witty dialogue is scattered throughout, giving that extra character to each of the stars.So, feel free to criticize this film, and compare it to the first..but make sure you watch it first before you make an ass of yourself!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"cool, entertaining crime caper","A gang of career criminals, led by young mastermind Charlie Croker (Wahlberg), pull off the heist of a lifetime in Venice, Italy when they successfully steal a cache of gold bullion. The one thing they didn't count on however was that they'd be double-crossed by one of their own. Roughly a year later—with the help of an accomplished safe cracker—they track him down in Los Angeles and attempt to settle the score. Slick, hip, often funny heist film has a first-rate cast and provides lots of fun from start to finish.

An incredible heist,"The Italian Job was as greatly thought out as Charlie's detailed plans in the movie. I may not be a Roger Ebert, but I am hoping that my review is respectable in saying that it well-fit the description of a must-see movie. The Italian Job goes along the lines of action and comedy, yet a touch of romance for those type of viewers as well. I was actually amazed that such a male dominated movie did not contain any sex-oriented scenes. Without that being the point, the audience is introduced to a number of interesting and entertaining characters who have nothing in common other than a good heart, great motivation, and immense knowledge in each of his or her trade. As the movie succeeds in putting its viewers mentally in the heist with Charlie and the gang, each chase and heart-racing moment is an adrenaline rush. The Italian Job is a movie for those that admire masterminds filled with imagination and have a love for adventure. Thus allowing those who want to create diversions and act on such genius plans to be taken on that intense ride through the movie and feel accomplished. It is just that type of a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

It is great fun and I hated to see it end.The only two extremely minor objections were 1) I prefer Ed Norton as a good guy. 2) The only ridiculously ridiculous issue was their parking right in front of the gate. Of course, almost everything in a movie like this is ridiculous. That's a given. But, the staking out the gate so visibly was over the line.Still those are so minor that they almost are irrelevant.

Vengeance takes it all and the brain wins it all,"I didn't hold high hopes when I picked up the VCDs because neither the cover nor the blurb is attractive. However the more my eyes rolls over it, the more earnest my heart grows. Now I am even tempted to see the 1969 Michael Caine production. It remains me a Hong Kong hi-tech stealing movie ""Downtown Torpedoes"".The death of John Bridger causes his daughter and his ""co-workers"" to retaliate with a vengeance to cook up an international $35 million Bali dancer gold bar heist carefully. Their plan is perfect, flawless and the car racing-chasing scenes though not stunning, it's well-designed. Bravo to the safecracking skills and the building blasting skills!One mis-cast is Edward Norton. He expressed that doing this project is out of responsibility but not choice. Well, this tells why his face does not match the ambiance. His face is not villain-looking, not cunning even though he wears a mustache. John Travolta, Clive Owen, Tim Roth all can replace him. Strangely, the top-notch team is too gentleman-looking, too soft, craftier faces are wanted.Thank God it's a decent action film of brain-teasing game and rivalry, it doesn't reek of sex, however, it might be due to this spicy void that the box office gave a less satisfactory report, and a re-release was desired. It's a sacred formula of Hollywood movie that: ""sex it up and sell it well"".If a love or sex scene is to be inserted to vacuum up more money, easy, Charlie and Stella strip, but first kick out Mark Wahlberg, put Ethane Hawke or Brad Pitt or Keanus Reeves instead. And bingo, bingo, money will come.It is evident that cinematography is not the selling point, and so my beloved San Marco Piazza, Venezia water canals are portrayed as drab district, mamma mia. If cinematography is done by Giles Nuttgens, the screen vision should surely be entirely different. The beauty of this world famous scenic city will be exposed to its fullest.

Good fun but its no classic like the original,"I went into this movie with an open mind.

I could write a lot about comparing it with the original bit on every account the original would win. So ill just comment on the film as if it is not a remake or sequel.The Good and BadGOOD - Characters (apart from Charlie, Stella and John). Lyle, Left Ear and Handsome Rob are great characters. I could really she those three having a lot of fun and they had a little in the film. But Charlie and Stella where so serious all the time. You cannot be serious sitting in a mini even if they r quite big like the new ones.The cars are all about cheekiness and fun. But Rob, Left Ear and Kyle fitted them.BAD - Car Chase at the end. I was expecting a big finale that would completely over through the original films car chase at the ending. But it didn't happen. All that happened was what happened in the original exactly and a bit less at that.BAD - Music- Like I said before the minis are cheeky cars and not serious. The music was more fitting for an epic chase not a fun ride through pipes and on the pavements. They should of has ""Self Preservation Society"" playing.GOOD - Action scenes. The boat chase and the car chases where un-original but still good to watch.THE ITALIAN JOB (2003) out of 10 - 8/10THE ITALIAN JOB (1969) out of 10 - 9 and a half/10",,Anonymous,Crime

shocking,"Terrible, terrible movie, the only good thing that came out of me going to see this film was that i got to sit next to a sexy young lady. it wasn't even a good bad film, it was so insanely rubbish that i found myself laughing out loud more than a few times.inanely predictable, insipid acting, and less than compelling viewing, quite frankly, i only stayed cos i paid £4 to see this and i figured anyone that stupid deserves some sort of punishment.what this film does is what most dull and souless sequels do, makes money, gives people a few hours of entertainment, hits a few chart positions. great. what it doesnt give you is that feeling you get long after watching a truly great movie, the feeling that you have really experienced something, its not a movie you will remember for years afterwards, it's simply a film to take you from late evening to a little bit later evening without any danger of actually achieving anything. you wont find yourself quoting lines from it, 30 years on..thats for sure.all in all, i'd say if you don't particularly care what you go out to see tonight, go and see this, its got action, somewhat of a storyline, and a bit of good old fashioned geekery from carrot boy himself, no, not Jasp. the perfect film to while away a few hours, doing something which doesnt get you too involved and leaves you feeling the same as when you went in, only with the ability to appreciate going home more than you used to.yeah, go home and get drunk. thats better, go on, you know you want to. it's ok, you can just tell people where you've been for the last two hours..its ok, they'll forgive you in time. it's been 3 months, i'm allowed to sleep in the dog kennel now..",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not too bad,"When I first heard of this remake, I was sure it was going to be awful, and that it would never live up to the Michael Caine original.As it happens, there's not much living up to do, since it bears so little resemblance to the original that directly comparing the two would make no sense.  There are one or two points which can be compared (and I will get to them), but other than that, this film can quite easily be considered by itself.The first comparable point (which is quite minor, really), is the characters.  Yes, Mr. Bridger and Charlie Croker have the same names as the original characters, but that is where their similarities end.  Please, if you're doing a film with the same title and same character names, make the characters at least similar.The bulk of the film is very enjoyable- a heist is pulled off rather successfully, one partner double crosses the others, and things kick off when the cheated partners go out for revenge.It has casing jobs, safe-cracking, breaking in and a couple of great getaways- all the ingredients of a good heist film.Unfortunately, it has one thing that heist movies do not need- emotional ties.  What is it with Hollywood these days, that means that every film needs to have some kind of personal reason for things happening?  Why couldn't they just make a heist film about a group of thieves trying to steal gold because it's there, rather than because it was taken by someone who killed your dad / friend / brother / favourite poodle?So... the ties are set up, the heist is planned and pulled off, and they make their getaway.  This is where the second comparison comes in.  The original film featured a very long race through underground shopping centres, down church steps, over roofs, all to avoid a traffic jam.  Whilst this new film features cars racing down steps, and through tunnels, it's very obviously a case of ""fans will expect this, so we'll put it in"", as there's very little of it, and it does to some extent seem tacked on.Admittedly, this section of the film did please me a little bit, in that Croker says ""let's do it like The Italian Job"".  Although his reference to the characters is referring to the job pulled in the film's opening, it also seemed to be a nod to the original as this section did bear the most similarity to its namesake.Overall, I quite liked The Italian Job.  It did have some flaws, but then it had some great moments.  I found it very enjoyable to watch, and would advise others to see it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome!,"Ocean's Eleven fans, take note!  This is most definitely one of tbe best films I've seen in the past six months (tied with Matrix Reloaded).

Explosive performance!,"ITALIAN JOB- *** A band of highly trained criminals are on one of the biggest heists ever trying to steal 22 million dollars in gold.  John(Donald Sutherland) who is the leader of the group. The robbery is a success but Steve ( Edward Norton) double-crosses the group for quite alittle profit of his own.  Escapes with the money.  Charlie ( Mark Whalberg) promises revenge to the daughter of John who is played by Charlize Theron. Comical performances came from Seth Green who announces to all that he wants to be acclaimed as the ""Napster"". A dose of car chases, quick-witted plots, and a series of break-out laughing moments gives the right amount of medicine to give this movie a just action-comedy to start the summer off.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Enjoyable but not as `fun' as I'd expected it to be,"After a daring gold robbery by stealth and cunning in Venice, a group of criminals celebrate their job.  However one of the group, Steve, turns on them, killing John and leaving the rest for dead.  The rest survive and one year later they find Steve selling the gold in LA.  They recruit John's daughter Stella, an expert safe cracker, in order to steal back his gold and thus get revenge.While I was writing a review of the video game about a year ago I spotted that this remake was in production.  I'll admit that my initial thoughts were `sweet Jesus' and `not everything should be remade', but I was still open to seeing it and, by now, those thoughts had subsided a bit.  The film opens hesitantly and the early scenes with Charlie and John positively stutter.  After the first job the film really picks up and gets enjoyable without every really letting rip.  The downside of this is that it never really becomes a feel good spectacle in the same OTT way that the original was.  Yes, some moments are funny and the final job is quite exciting and quite clever but it isn't `fun' in the way I'd hoped.Some scenes are really weak and I'm sad to say they are most of the ones that rely on Wahlberg.  His scenes (with  Theron and Sutherland) are quite dry and he fails to captivate as a leading man.  Thank God then, for a pretty good support cast.  No, I don't mean Theron, although she is used for her looks quite well, but the male cast.  The rest of the gang bring the laughs and the characters, they are not as emotionally important to the story as Charlie and are much better for it.  Statham does good work and is cool and funny, Green is as good as you'd hope he'd be  although his Napster stuff gets a bit tired after a while.  The highlight for me again was Mos Def  this is the second time in a few months he has been in a small support role but has lifted a film (Brown Sugar being the other).  All three do good jobs round the edges and help support the very iffy Wahlberg.I enjoyed Edward Norton even if he was clearly slumming it a little bit.  I detected a bit of mischief in his eyes when his character is placed second after Charlie by John  ironic as Wahlberg was favoured to play Charlie over Norton who wanted the role!The mini action is good as it doesn't use effects to a great effect  almost a good old fashioned car chase  but to say it compares to some of the other chases this summer is just silly.  Overall this is an enjoyable film but is weak at it's core and suffers as a result.  The film doesn't flow as freely as it should and it is only the enjoyable car chases and sterling work by the Mighty Mos et al, that lifts it to be better than the sum of it's parts. Not great but enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Crime
The only thing that is copied here are the use of the mini-coopers... and one or two names,"(2003) The Italian Job
ACTION/ ADVENTUREThe reason the film is called ""The Italian Job"" is because the use of the mini cooper cars that was used on the original 1969 version to steal gold from a greedy back stabbing nemesis, Steve played by Edward Norton. There is not too much action, but is extremely interesting in terms of how the group were able to coincide and work together to retrieve their gold back using ""current"" technology. What is making this film from receiving a perfect rating are the slow scenes in certain spots.The set up has Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) and the rest of his crew seeking retribution on the double crosser and backstabber, Steve for killing their mentor, John Bridger (Donald Sutherland) and stealing all of the gold bricks. Charlie does this with the help of John Bridger's daughter, Stella Bridger (Charlize Theron), Lyle (Seth Green), Left Ear (Yasiin Bey) and the charismatic Rob (Jason Statham).",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Slightly entertaining....,"Since this movie got a relatively good rating, I guess that these types of movies are just not for me.

"Talking, talking and talking","I don't call it fun, because the movie was too slow paced. It begins good, the opening scene arouses attention, but then talking, talking and talking. It is weird, isn't it? Many people say it is fun, fun and fun and also fast paced. May be, they forget Die Hards, Mission Impossibles etc. at that moment. I believe that comparing original movies and remakes are a bit wrong, so I won't do that, but I want to say that as a note, the original film was excellent and real fun from the beginning till the end. In addition, it was very flowing, because it did not consist of talking like this movie. And its great (and unusual) final had the last word. This remake is not even an action movie, because there is no action except the expected car chase scene which takes place very late. Then, the movie livens up a bit, but that's all. Edward Norton is interesting, there is Jason Statham who is the man of action movies and more, but none of them can save the movie, because as mentioned, not only it is slow paced, but also it is not a stylish picture, just OK in terms of direction. Such movies sell themselves as action movies, thrill rides, but they are not. If you call a scene that they drive a car for test before the heist as action, then it changes. The chase scene was fun, but there are much better car chases, it does not raise the bar. Just a fun car chase, but before, you have to watch the uninteresting conversations between Wahlberg and Theron to see this chase. By the way, they get closer of course later. A soap bubble movie.",,Anonymous,Crime

Honor Among Thieves Redux,"THE ITALIAN JOB (2003) *** Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, Franky G., Donald Sutherland.  Entertaining remake of the 1969 Michael Caine flick of the same name, this time with Wahlberg as the leader of a band of thieves who demand revenge when snaky partner Norton double-crossed them on their last gig (a $35 M cache in Venice) with a lot at stake including the daughter of his late mentor wanting vengeance (Theron).  Fine action sequences and clever plottings thanks to the husband/wife screenwriting team of Wayne and Donna Powers who wisely add humor (largely to techno-geek Green who steals the show) to the criminal acts at hand.

Classic Heist-recipe,"Let me be honest: I enjoyed this movie right from the word go.Why? Well basically because it takes the recipe for a classic heist movie and updates to suit a new millennium.You have all the stereotypes in there, the nerd that break into every computer in the world, the explosives expert, the babe, the brains and of course the 'crook that can't be trusted' which in itself is a paradox.You have a big loot, state of the art alarm systems, computers, guards, guard dogs, the police, Russians - and not least 3 tuned Mini Coopers.All in all you have all the ingredients for a classic heist-movie.The good thing about the movie is that it doesn't spend too much time 'assembling the squad' - that is taken care of before we enter the movie, so most of the focus is on the actual heists.The acting is decent, but not overwhelming and the plot does offer some twist and turns, which makes it an enjoyable ride from start to finish.It isn't better than the original - but then again it doesn't try to be either as it changes the premises by changing the plot - and it isn't better than Ocean's 11 either, where I think the acting is better.It is still recommendable, and I have given it a 7 (out of 10 naturally - I follow the standard IMDb scale).",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

OK heist,"As a heist movie The Italian Job is neither a noir heist, but could have been, nor a really suspenseful heist, but might have been. Instead they played along the line of the source material, the 1969 flick, and set up a movie about a cool bunch (minus the swinging sixties style).Hey, there's the rub. As a cool actioneer it works pretty well, much better than the original indeed since action then was thought as a big farandole joke in line with the rest of the movie. But they added other stuff around the heist in it: above all there is not one single big heist, it's more about a setup for the original idea of having minis speeding in narrow subway tunnels; then things that are not sparklingly cool also clutter up without adding much.To make it short without giving away plot points there's a line that says fine for a thief means ""Freaked-out Insecure Neurotic Emotional"". These are precisely the points that never come to fruition along the story although there's supposed to be a strong emotional background.Bottom line: OK movie that could have been much better paced (quite a few lull ends in it between the expected action, comic strip characterization), hence entirely forgotten the next day.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

A fun riff on the classic original,"For those who are unaware, this movie is a remake of a classic British film starring Michael Caine. The 1969 original is a nifty heist caper that contains what is, in my opinion, one of the best car chases ever committed to celluloid. You would be right to assume that a remake would struggle to live up to the high standard of its predecessor but in this case the remake sets itself apart by not sticking too closely to the source of its inspiration.This time around, the titular 'Italian Job' happens right at the beginning of the movie and serves as the impetus for the events that follow. The simple premise is this: Following a betrayal by one of their own, a team of high-tech thieves plan to take down their former ally and hopefully get rich in the process. There are definitely many elements from the original that found their way into the remake's script but the plot is distinct enough to keep you interested. What's more important is that the remake captures the same light-hearted feel of the original with its combination of comedy & heist-centric action.The cast is better assembled than you might expect. This is definitely a Mark Wahlberg star vehicle but there were a couple of casting coups in the form of Charlize Theron (in her Oscar year) and the always-interesting Edward Norton. Granted, Edward Norton only took the role to fulfill a contractual obligation but he still excelled as the film's villain. Mark Wahlberg may be no Michael Caine but he was charming enough to anchor a cast that had undeniable chemistry with one another. The supporting trio of Jason Statham, Seth Green & Mos Def ended up being the unsung heroes of the movie. Add in Donald Sutherland and you've got a cast that's more than capable of stealing the show.Being a $60 million production, ""The Italian Job"" had plenty of resources to draw on in bringing its heist to life. There's lots of stunt work here but it isn't just in the movie for its own sake. The heist does indeed come off as a carefully orchestrated affair, which is a credit to both the screenwriters and the crew. Personally, I don't think that it quite reaches the heights of the original but that was admittedly a tall order. The bottom line is that ""The Italian Job"" is a well constructed piece of Hollywood entertainment.It seems that most people who dislike this movie do so on the basis that it supposedly pales in comparison to the original. To me, the movie manages the tricky balancing act of being faithful enough to be recognized as an homage without being overly faithful to the point of predictability. Taken on its own terms, this 2003 version of ""The Italian Job"" is quality popcorn entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nonsense; but somewhat entertaining,"It started off okay: the Italian heist scene; But when one of the thief crew, (Edward Norton), decides to take the gold for himself, the situation resulted into the rest of the crew ending up in freezing water, for several minutes - the death time exposure would kill anybody, but the crew lived through it. There must have been some heavy doses of vitamin intake by those guys in preparation for unusual events, because, not only did they live through that, they sat around on the rocks beside the water, in that freezing cold, pondering their next move, which of course, was revenge. And then, the double-crossing 'Norton' ended up in Los Angeles, of all places. Shamefully the movie reverted to a lower class atmosphere. With the 35 million in gold, Norton then buys a house that looks to be worth 30 million. Doesn't figure? To which then all he does, and is concerned about, is to watch TV. Mark Wahlberg gets Charlize Theron, (the daughter of the only crew member to die), to help with the revenge plan; she's a safe-cracking specialist with an idiot passion for driving outrageously. Some hype dung there. Matter of fact there's hype dung everywhere. You've got your typical computer geek--nothing new there. But you don't have your typical ladies man--this guy looks like a street fighter losing his hair, and he's used to seduce a TV cable woman for the purpose of arranging, (wouldn't you know), the look-alike Charlize into getting inside Norton's house: a house that Charlize scans for a safe that might have the gold. Okay, continuing in short: getting to that safe is complex and watchable--street traffic scenes highlight the obtaining of the truck containing the safe. But . . . Man O Man . . . With those dinky cars that they used to transport the gold: one scene--get this, they went into a subway rail system by driving along the platform and then take a right turn to get onto those tracks (ten feet below)! Man, that's just so damn undoable: in actuality they would have nose-dived . . . Crashed and piled up. And that's this movie; it's full of the undoable! --Made because Hollywood only cares about entertainment, not quality. Edward Norton had been getting some respect from me, but now I've lowered him a notch or two. As for the rest of the crew (other than Sutherland): give them pink slips and directions to the Salvation Army.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

Really Really shoddy,"I've seen the original Italian Job with Michael Caine, and that was a classic action/comedy.  This version shifted its action to L.A., and its theme from action/comedy to action/drama.  Unfortunately, it delivers very little of either.  The acting is listless and the story, lacklustre.I'm a fan of Jason Statham, but he's not enough to save this movie.  Seth Green plays a computer whiz who claims he invented napster (another annoying and pointless schtick). And somehow he's got enough remote hardware power to wirelessly hack into the L.A. traffic system from a baggage claim cart to throw the whole city into logjam.The mini-cooper car chase scenes are hardly reminiscent of the car chase scene from the original movie, which still remains a classic.The relationships between the characters are poorly developed for a pseudo-drama, which they try to toss in between Donald Sutherland, as Mark Wahlberg's mentor and father figure; and his romantic interest, Charlize Theron.  The worst part had to be the abrupt end to the movie, which culminated with Charlize and Mark living happily ever after without every developing a history in front of the viewing audience.  Another major disappointment is Edward Norton's character as a greedy, ruthless villain, who apparently is not smart enough to avoid transporting his gold putting it at the greatest risk possible for looters like Mark's crew.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The mistake was calling it ""The Italian Job""","Naming this movie after a classic and taking certain elements and characters from it was essentially a mistake as it turned off lots of people from what is actually a really tight, well cast and entertaining action movie.

But as a stand alone movie, the script has humour and the cast gel together well, the Minis used don't really add anything but the action is exciting and entertaining - I really like it and it's worth a watch, just don't go comparing it to the 60's original and you'll come away satisfied.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
no no no,"A very poor Italian job, another poor American big money remake. The whole idea or the Italian job was that it was British, and a Britain against Europe. The new film can't leave Europe quick enough and replaces the minis with German BMWs, thus negating the two founding points of the film. This is an average heist flick at best and calling two characters the same as ones from the original doesn't make it a remake, nor does using a car called a mini make it a mini. In short this should be flushed into room 101 along with the remakes of get carter, taxi, the assassin and ring. - - - save your time and just watch the original.

This movie's characters are a little more realistic: They have dreams, pasts, feelings and everything.

Good (bad) guys to root for,"In recent years, it has been commonplace for movies to have many twists and turns, and/or the big shocker at the end.  The Italian Job, from director F. Gary Gray, proves that neither are necessary. A gold heist turns sour after Edward Norton, who plays Steve, has his own plans for the gold, and makes sure of that once the team reaches the Italy-Austria border.  A year later, the leader of the team, Charlie (Mark Walhberg) recruits Stella (Charlize Theron) to join the remainder of his team to steal back the gold.The Italian Job, free from fancy visual effects, feature actors who are perfectly suited for their roles. Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, Mos Def as the demolitions guy who ""had a bad experience"" with dogs, and Seth Green, who claims the idea for Napster was stolen from him.Simply put, The Italian Job is fun to watch from beginning to end, the boat chase in Venice, Italy to the Mini-Coopers in L.A., the sneaky but simple-minded bad guy played by Norton.

definitely better than the first,"I saw both the original and this re-make and I must say that this is much better than the first. Although, according to the DVD commentary, the writers for this film didn't actually see the original before writing for this one, it really looks as if they did and made a conscious effort to improve on it. Because where the original seemed to meander and drag, this one quickly takes you into the story and continues non-stop until the finish. And while the first lacked emotional punch, the re-make added some via the seeking of revenge for death of the team's father figure. And I liked the way how the mini-cooper was introduced by allowing us to see its usefulness early on in the film so that we could understand the team's choice for it in their heist. In the first film, the mini-coopers were simply arbitrarily chosen with little reason as to why. The heist and getaway plan in this film was more intricate, clever and interesting than the one in the first. In short, this is a fast-paced, exciting and smart film. The original was just too slow and boring. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's better.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

With a good cast, cool cars and exotic locations you'd think it'd be hard to screw up but every element of this is bad. Anytime people speak it's like watching a high school play. There's no pacing, no humor, no tension, and zero chemistry. This film should be Exhibit A in illustrating exactly what a director does. F.

Also...there's a quick cameo from Spider-Man! Blink and you'll miss it! Right when the guys are blowing up the ground to get the truck, there's a quick shot of him.  Good stuff, enjoyable popcorn that is most definitely worth seeing.  My only complaint is that the most talented actor in the cast (Edward Norton) is given the least interesting character, made especially disappointing since the villain is usually supposed to be more interesting than the hero.

very well executed and well acted,"The Italian Job is a complete film with few weak links.  The acting is superb - and by extension the casting.  Well directed, great camera work, good special effects - but the writing is what I believe set it apart and took it to the next level.The inevitable comparisons to Soderberg's ""Oceans 11"" are unfair to Italian Job in my opinion.  I felt this film was much better written, the acting was better and overall execution a cut above what Oceans 11 accomplished.  When watching the latter, I felt like it was more escapist entertainment, whereas Italian Job did a much better job of drawing me in to the story -and- entertaining me.The criticisms that Wahlberg didn't have enough 'charisma' to pull off the leading male role in this film are unfounded.  If they came from the same people who gushed over Clooney in Oceans 11, then they obviously value Clooney's 'pretty boy charm' over Wahlberg's more substantive acting talent.If you haven't seen this one, you should.

Not very Italian.,"I'm not sure that there's enough of the original here to call this ""The Italian Job"", instead it's a bit more like 'James Bond' gets together with 'Ocean's 11' with hints of 'Now You See Me' and they used the character names from the Michael Caine version to make it seem like a remake.That being said, as films of this ilk go, it's generally not that bad in its own right (If you discount any connection to doing a job in Italy). I might have been more impressed if I had seen it upon its release instead of 14 years later. Years that have been filled with some pretty amazing double-cross, heist and mobster films. As such I've kind of seen all of this before.Mark does a good job, but there's nothing about him that stands out as particularly different to any other character he has played.
Seth Green is incredibly enjoyable as the comic relief too.
Mr Norton on the other hand. I just want to repeatedly slap him around the face with a flip flop and not just in this film. Something about him just rubs me up the wrong way. In this film I want to rip off the stupid bit of hair below his lip.Also, the mini chase is far too short.If you're in to your 'Fast And Furious', 'James Bond' and anything by Guy Ritchie or featuring Jason Statham then you will probably enjoy this one, but if you want to see a remake of 'The Italian Job' featuring Michael Caine, then give up and watch the original instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are remakes and then there are remakes.,"There are remakes and then there are remakes. At one extreme is Gus Van Sant's recent shot-for-shot version of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", not so much a remake as a carbon copy. At the other extreme you would have something like the Robert de Niro/Sean Penn ""We're No Angels"", officially a remake of a Humphrey Bogart comedy from the fifties but having virtually nothing in common with it beyond the title and a storyline about escaped convicts.The 2003 ""Italian Job"" comes somewhere in the middle, although perhaps nearer to the ""We're No Angels"" end of the scale. Like its British namesake from 1969 it is a heist film about a bullion robbery. It keeps the names of some of the characters and part of it is set in Italy. It features a complicated plot to steal the gold involving the modern version of the Mini Cooper, a piece of product placement quite as blatant as that in the original film. The plot, however, is quite different; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous ""cliff-hanging"" ending.In this version Charlie Croker and most of his gang are American rather than British, although there is one Englishman among them, played by Jason Statham. This is perhaps unsurprising; the film was, after all, made by an American studio, Paramount Pictures, although given that the original was never a great success in the States I am surprised that Hollywood showed any interest in remaking it. There are in fact two robberies featured in the film, the first taking place in Venice where Croker and his gang succeed in stealing a large amount of gold and making their getaway in speedboats in a sequence doubtless inspired by a similar one in the James Bond film ""Moonraker"". Unfortunately, one of the gang, Steve, betrays his colleagues, shooting one, John Bridger, dead and making off with the gold himself. (Bridger, older and more experienced than the rest of the gang, is the rough equivalent of his namesake played by Noel Coward in the 1969 film, although unlike that character he is not currently serving a jail sentence).Croker and his surviving comrades swear to get revenge by stealing the gold back from Steve. In this they have the assistance of Bridger's beautiful daughter Stella, a character with no equivalent on the original film, which had no major female characters. Stella has inherited her father's skills as a safe cracker, although unlike him she has hitherto only used those skills for lawful purposes, using them to assist the police. Her desire for revenge on her father's murderer, however, leads her to throw her lot in with Croker. (Inevitably, the two fall in love). The rest of the film tells how the team manage to double-cross Steve, retrieve the loot and make their getaway through the streets of Los Angeles in a trio of Mini Coopers.As in the original, the three cars are red, white and blue, but here no patriotic significance attaches to those colours. The original film was markedly nationalistic in tone- the message seemed to be ""We Brits may no longer have an empire, but we are still better at stealing things than Johnny Foreigner""- but, fortunately, the remake does make similarly jingoistic claims on behalf of the American criminal fraternity. Nor does it replace ""Rule Britannia"" and ""God Save the Queen"" on the soundtrack with ""America the Beautiful"" or ""The Star-Spangled Banner"".Because the two films are so different in terms of plot, it is difficult trying to compare them. In the end I gave both the same average mark because I did not enjoy either very much, although I disliked them for different reasons. The 1969 version is marked by a certain amount of originality, and has two charismatic stars in Coward and Michael Caine, although I dislike the nasty xenophobia which lurks just below the surface veneer of smug patriotism.The 2003 version is at least free of xenophobic tendencies (something one cannot say about all recent American films), but has little except its connection to its famous predecessor to distinguish it from a morass of similar movies. Apart from Donald Sutherland who gets killed early on, none of the cast displays any charisma, least of all Mark Wahlberg who replaces Caine as Croker. As usual, Charlize Theron looks better than she acts, and I was surprised to see Edward Norton, an actor I normally associate with more intellectual fare than this, as Steve. (Apparently he was obliged to take the part for contractual reasons). As with the original, most of the interest lies in the action sequences, especially the getaway, but overall but this is little more than a standard-issue heist movie. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

The plot revolves around a tight-knit group of friends who specialize in executing large-scale heists. However, when one of their own betrays the group and escapes with the stolen loot, the remaining members embark on a mission of revenge.Directed by F. Gary Gray (Set It Off), the film boasts a star-studded ensemble, including Donald Sutherland (Animal House), Mark Wahlberg (The Departed), Jason Statham (Meg), Edward Norton (Fight Club), Charlize Theron (Monster), Seth Green (IT), and Mos Def (16 Blocks).This movie caters to the cravings of any action genre enthusiast.

Charlize Theron's beauty shines, Mos Def and Seth Green inject humor, Mark Wahlberg delivers a strong lead performance, and Jason Statham provides an exceptional supporting role. The movie maintains a well-paced narrative filled with engaging situations and dynamic interactions among the characters, culminating in a satisfying conclusion.

This is pure adrenaline and pure enjoyment. Watch it without and hesitation. Brilliant. The ending is well crafted and well acted,the cars and awesome and the chase scene is nicely done. This is perfect or Mark Wahlberg's ""Emotionless"" face. And perfect characters for all the leading actors, especially Jason Statham as the British pin-up. Maybe if i am going to pick a bad part it might be Charlize Theron, maybe just a little weak , but thats a minor irritation and nothing major. 9/10 really, really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This isn't the Italian Job you're looking for,"Yes, it's got Mini Coopers. Yes, it's got a character called Charlie Croker, Yes, it's got someone called Mr Bridger, Yes, it's got gold stolen from an armoured car. Yes, it's got bits of the film shot in Italy.Sadly, that's where the similarities with The Italian Job (1969) end, and this becomes an entirely different film not deserving of the title ""The Italian Job"". They should have, and could have, given this film it's own title, because it's an entirely different plot. For the rest of my comments, I shall refer to this film as IJ2003, and the original as The Italian Job.There's a cameo role from a single Rover Mini Cooper, but the real action is BMW Mini Coopers; IJ2003 has far more violence and unnecessary killings, maybe this is a sign of the times. In 1969 very few criminals used 'shooters'.In my opinion, if you have seen The Italian Job, and feel like watching IJ2003, because you liked the original film, don't bother. If you haven't seen The Italian Job, go and see the original first, admire it, then go and watch IJ2003, a totally different film without any preconceptions as to what it should be like. You might like some of the sequences. You'll probably come out of it realising that Paramount only made this film because they messed up on the American marketing on the original.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Light-hearted enjoyable caper remake,"Clever enough to keep your attention without being so complex it's hard to follow.  Humorous in spots without trying to be brilliant and hysterical. Interesting enough characters without trying to do an in-depth character study (without time enough to do it).Beautiful actors who are a pleasure to watch.  Good chase & action without destroying much or wiping out large populations. Amazingly devoid of the gratuitous sex, violence & profanity, giving it a well-deserved and appreciated PG-13 rating. One of my favorite film types, with no major criticisms.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Still a very cool movie!!!,"Yeah, just started rewatching Italian Job after so many years and it still holds very well and is very entertaining. It has aged very well as a movie that was made in 2003. I don't care about plot or storyline I am an action movie fan; I consider this an action movie more than a heist film because it has car chases, guns, explosion. To me a heist film is more a who done it with mystery. Italian Job is clearly an action film and a very good one that is worth a watch on a boring cold day in the winter time. Anyway, someone from Fast and Furious must have watched this film because it's plot and characters are eerily similar to what Fast and Furious became beginning with FF4.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

With a cast filled with stars from Mark Wahlberg to Jason Statham to Charlize Theron, this high-paced, high-energy film oozes swagger and awesomeness. This close-knit band of thieves is on a mission of revenge to steal from the man that betrayed them all and murdered their leader. With the moral high ground and proper motivation, these characters become that much cooler and are that much easier to root for as they break the rules in pursuit of their quarry. The stunt driving and camera work meld together perfectly to create a stunning high-octane movie that is exciting, fun, and worth seeing again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylish. Classy. Clever.,"No one can play a slimy character as well as Edward Norton and he pulls this heist off better than ever before  he is able to make the viewer admire him and even envy him, yet be utterly happy that they are NOT him.This re-make of the 1969 film of the same name with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is far superior to the original  rare in this day of endless copies and re-makes.Mark Wahlberg plays the character that Michael Caine originally acted  and while Wahlberg is certainly not an actor of the same ilk as Caine is he is certainly more entertaining in this role than Mr. Caine was. He is written as intelligent, witty, charming and, even though Michael Caine epitomizes class, far more elegant and sophisticated than Mr. Caine was able to achieve in the initial film; kudos to Mr. Wahlberg.Charlize Theron is what I would want Cameron Diaz to be if I were ever lucky enough to wake up next to her  sexy, intelligent and just immoral enough to make her a truly fun romp. I totally approve.The supporting cast of crooks (Mos Def, Seth Green (!), Jason Statham and a woefully brief appearance by Donald Sutherland) is just delightfully fiendish enough to completely inveigle and entice the viewer to be completely caught up in their wicked, wicked ways.Whenever a film starts with a catchy and compelling opening sequence I am always wary  all too often it is a way of hiding the woefully inadequate film that is to come. Fortunately, even though `The Italian Job' started out on a high note, this time it did not let me down. It started cleverly and did not disappoint.The sound track was an absolute delight  hitting all the right elemental notes in all the right places  with themes that the viewer will recognize (in all the proper spots) mixed with new music that was completely appropriate to the action on the screen.Action is the key word. This was a film full of encounters and excitement  with never a slow moment or a let down.The use of the Minis as get away cars was a stroke of genius  where many screen writers or directors would have used a car a la James Bond the utilization of the not-so-exciting Minis gave an enormous sense of fun and exhilaration to the chase scenes.`The Italian Job' is the best time I have had at the movies so far this year and I highly recommend it to any and everyone that is looking for a good time replete with action, humour, romance and wit.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Legally, the Italian job","When BMW bought the Mini and relaunched MINI, there was a string of cease and desist orders to small companies selling spares and aftermarket parts for the original classic mini, alienating what was then a thriving Mini fan scene. When released, this movie felt like more of the same: let's also dilute the legacy of the classic British mod movie of the same name.Taken by itself, it's a slow burning heist caper with a bunch of fun character interactions and reasonably well written dialog that gradually increases tension until the big set piece third act. The characters are colourful but the acting/direction lacks depth: it looks like Charlie croker is supposed to grow from a control freak to someone who is finally comfortable improvising, but instead we get a Mary Sue who calmly smiles his way through all adversity.The mechanIcs of the heist are fun, there's plenty of eye candy and enough humour, just don't expect too much of a soul to it or to have your doors blown off,.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Italian Job 2003 - too much garlic and no base,"I have read the other comments on on this page regarding this film and most, if not all, praise it. Yet, throughout the entirety of these(inane) 'reviews' no one compares it to or even mentions the fact that it is a remake of the vastly superior 1969 Michael Caine vehicle. I have to admit I had low expectations of this new film, and they were not disappointed, it was actually even worse than I anticipated. All performer presence, witty dialogue, and the action of one of the best car chases on celluloid (perhaps the best) has been removed to be substituted with blinding teeth, slicked back hair and constant, unimaginative, intrusive cutting. Even if the director wished to have a car chase to match the earlier set piece (he does not) he could not accomplish it because the demands of the ludicrously short takes in mainstream modern American cinema (to suit short attention spans) mean the stunt drivers cannot drive more than a few metres before 'CUT' must be called. The performers of the first film have, as with so many modern examples, been replaced by young, vacuous, uncharismatic and ineffectual model types. On the strength of the first film I went against my better judgement and gave part of my life to this trash: its enough to make me now hate the first film too.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
A review of The Italian Job,"The Italian Job is one of my favorite films. It is remake of the same film from 1969. It is an American action thriller about heist. The film stars are Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham.
The film is about a group of people who want to steal gold from a safe in Venice, held by Italian gangsters who had stolen it weeks earlier. The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional serviceman, Lyle or ""Napster"", a computer expert, Handsome Rob, their driver, Steve, their agent, and Left Ear, their explosives expert. They planned the robbery to the last detail. But after heist one member betrayed them and kept the gold for himself and he killed one member of the group. A year later in the United States, Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her the chance to get revenge on Steve for her father's death.
In my opinion, this is fast, funny and gripping film. There aren´t many special effects in the film but I like the stunts. The best thing in this movie is the soundtrack. And the cast is also great.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nothing wrong with fun,"Sometimes you go to the movies for a serious experience; sometimes you go just for fun.Tonight we had fun seeing ""The Italian Job.""I have no idea how it compares to the 1969 original, but this one has suspense, intrigue, humor, action and just enough technology to make it cutting edge.From the opening credits -- an interesting montage sequence with riveting sound and music -- to several fantastic chase scenes, F. Gary Gray shows his versatility as a filmmaker. (I've not seen ""A Man Apart,"" but now I will.)Without giving anything away, the chase scenes are really exciting. If you liked the chase in ""The Bourne Identity,"" you'll like these.

Raises the bar on the Gold standard,"""The Italian Job"" is carried out by real pros, a delight from beginning to end, with superlative casting, clever dialogue and one beautifully-directed scene after the other.The film, a re-tooling of the earlier Michael Caine movie of the same name, has the simplest of plots: get the gold, lose the gold, get the gold back. It's the way it's done that elevates this one: all the characters are well-written, it's got the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheekedness (is that a word?!), the style AND the substance are there in equal part, and it's supremely easy on the eyes to boot.Particularly outstanding: Charlize Theron (dazzlingly gorgeous as always, with a well-played touch of vulnerability underneath her character's more-than-capable exterior), Donald Sutherland (elegant and cool in his brief appearance), Seth Green (as the self-titled ""real"" Napster, who gets to play God with the Hollywood traffic grids in his very own ""matrix""), and Mark Wahlberg   (in a perfectly nuanced performance, controlled and clearly on top of his game). And oh yeah, Edward Norton as the slime-bucket who gets his just desserts is sufficiently and sublimely sleazy.

Where Was I . . .,"for the last 111 minutes? I seem to remember watching The Italian Job, a remake of a heist movie from the late 60s, now set in Los Angeles, and starring a bunch of pleasingly vacant actors and cute little cars.But that's not possible because I have so little memory of it already (last night, was it?). I do recollect having a pleasing sensation of seeing Charlize Theron, bra-less in a tank top, but they make mannequins with nipples, and I was in a clothing store a few days ago. Mark Wahlberg was there, all angry, wounded puppy-dog handsome. Donald Sutherland popped up, then popped out after crossing paths with ferret-faced baddie, Edward Norton. Venice, Italy and Hollywood, California both looked nice. There were millions of dollars in gold bars, some scuba gear, laptops that could do things I don't think can be done even 11 years after the movie came out, a couple of bullet holes, a number of giant Samoans, cusswords looped out with non- cusswords, and a feeling that this was all just so much fun for a bunch of popular actors and their action-movie-addicted audience.Yet, I can't be sure. I think The Italian Job was an equally pleasant and vacant bit of duck fluff for summer consumption. I know Wahlberg has so much animal magnetism that if he screwed a light bulb in his ear, the damn thing would light off instantly. Theron exudes such a dangerously sexy vibe that, even though she has nothing to do here but act as if she's happy to be invited to work with the boys, we don't mind because there's something primal in her provocativeness. Norton could narrate a documentary on Pope Francis, and the viewer might want to clean his ears out with Lysol, all because he's so . . . um . . . icky.I just don't know for sure if I saw this movie.

Watch if female under 16---Amtrak pours cold water on anything,"Mindless car chase heist thriller apparently a remake of a much better film. The early film is of course not available on Netflix streaming.Cost 60 million grossed 176 million...Had a black director...so won all kinds of prizes...it was not taut and the filming below average so it gets a 5. Usually in this price range Hollywood can crank out tight beautifully crafted camera work....The idea of repeating the tactics of having the 1 ton safe crash through 2 floors into a canal with a 20 ton armored truck was clever and had a nice touch of covering up the hole made with a sheet of steel...why not make it asphalt covered that would have been even more funny. Having them escape on an Amtrak train made me scratch my head as probably the worst idea they could possibly come up with if this was a real heist. I have yet to take an Amtrak train that was not at least 6 hours late.They must have consumed all their money on the stunts which were quasi believable plus car chases all of which are kind of ho hum any more...controlling traffic lights yawn...Amtrak??? pours cold water on any thing.Add better writers. Tight Hollywood film craft for hard to do angles etc...then it would have got a 6 or even a 7 as normal fareI like this kind of genre but there needs to be some suspense this takes skill and subtlety not dollars...this thing has the twists but they are not scary nor suspenseful---it also has sort of corny humor feel good 50s squareness to it (one gang member dreaming of how he would spend his money wanted a stereo that would blow women's clothes off)--added half a star for that oddity though others might subtract half a star.Read some of the 1 star reviews they are entertaining...this thing doesn't exactly bore but I looked at the time left several times....Recommend? if you have time to kill or a female under 16 apparently the largest audience group...(they thought the male stars hot ????--and I am gay they did zero for me--except maybe the 500 pound guy or the Ukrainians--joke) This is your review, you may delete or edit it.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Well made but pretty adolescent,"This is a heist movie. I am fine with heist movies but they have to be ironic (like Ocean's Eleven). After all we watch thieves and in the case of The Italian Job we watch pretty adolescent thieves taking what they do much too serious. Heist movies are to be about stealing something in a very elaborate and cool way, not about very deep emotional problems. So this film here mixes cool, state-of-the-art technological stealing and a revenge story. And Edward Norton's villain is much too mean, he destroys the ironic heist story. It is the same problem with the James Bond movies: it is pretty tasteless to see Bond tortured. Bond is supposed to be a comic strip hero, not really serious. Because if you take the characters in this movie serious you want to sink them all in prisons to teach them a lesson how to behave in the world of adults.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Of course, it's not so much of a thinking man's movie, but pure popcorn entertainment. Thankfully it's not quite as dumb as most of those films are. There are little things throughout the film that gives a little bit of extra spice.The cast is good, having fun with their likable, albeit rather clichéd, characters. The biggest dud, however, is Wahlberg who simply can't bring any life or interesting features to the screen. A more charismatic lead would have been better.At two hours, the film is a bit too long. Especially the middle part that drags on for some time without really getting anywhere. Of course, the main reason for this film being made is the car chases (or blatant product placement). If you're really in to cars doing impossible stuff at high speeds, then you'll probably like it more than me (car chases are one of the most boring things you can put in a film), although these scenes are a bit less annoying than usual.The film looks great and technically there's not much to complain of. The biggest problem comes towards the end, when all that better-than-average writing is ditched in favour of stupid action and gaping plot holes. This happens in so many films that I'm starting to wonder if there's some secret organization out there, stealing the final reels of big budget films and messing them up on purpose...

Heist Adventure,"While it was a fairly typical heist movie, this film was more in the adventure category to me than action.

I'm not saying that there needs to be another movie in which everyone betrays each other and ends up dead, but rather that the honor among thieves theme may have been pushed too far in this movie.The energetic and enjoyable score and the cool but entirely unartistic camera work help to give the movie some of its character.  The acting was fine, with nobody particularly memorable and without much opportunity for good acting; despite this, the characters' individual talents were fun throughout the film.  Two static but still entertaining characters are ""Napster"" (who's funny) and Handsome Rob (who's just sweet).  The plot is utterly predictable in every way; they made no attempt to disguise Steve's betrayal at the beginning (even though I'm informed that the previews showed this--never watch TV).  Neither was there any doubt over whether Stella would help them.  As a result many of the early scenes were dry and cliché.The action scenes are typical, but typically entertaining.  I was impressed by the fact that they made those stupid looking minicoopers semi-cool, and the final elaborate plan unfolds rather well.  If you're into heists or cool non-violent action but you don't mind a Deus ex Machina, a trite plot, and an unmemorable cast, this is one for you.  I should mention that for reasons entirely unfathomable to me, my female friends seem to be of the ludicrous consensus that Ed Norton and Mark Wahlberg are hot (never mentioning Jason Statham whose coolness boosts him far above them IMO), so if you're one of those kind of people that might make the film better for you.

Not many reasons to call this 'The Italian Job'.,"The latest version (there being only two.....so far) of The Italian Job has no merit to its name. Director F. Gary Gray and screenwriters Troy Kennedy-Martin and Donna Powers have taken the best out of Michael Caine's original (three Mini's in a car chase, one thought-out heist) and glamourised it (Hollywood A-listers, pristine, clean shots) but with out the charge and the adrenaline we assume that's there. Wahlberg is a flat front-man. Edward Norton makes for a surprising bad guy, annoying and outsmarting Croker (Wahlberg) and his team left, right and centre. The other cast members struggle due to a lackluster script and and its inability to succeed our expectations. You'll be least disappointed in this film if you get the chance to watch this before the 1969 classic.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
NICE MINNI COMMERCIAL...,"...and that's just about it. Should i write more?I would, it's just that, it's hard to write a review of a movie, that it's just one of a million coming from Hollywood lately. Some action scenes, a guy gets killed and a daughter does hers best to revenge it. Throw in some (in this case NOT) funny lines, a love scene or two, some explosions and computer tricks and whoa, you get a a movie. Actually to bad to waste such a great actor as Edvard Norton for this one.In this case not that dull movie. It can be quite entertaining, if you are bored or a Minni lover, but i wouldn't watched it again. And that's why5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
I expected more,"Actually a simple plan of revenge in a predictable plot, but with some pretty cool thieves. The action was ok. Not anything like as good as Ocean's 13",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
I Can't get past the obvious,They break into his house to film and find the safe. He killed her father why not just shoot him then? Much easier. Fun cast and great settings.,5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Fast and chasing.,"It's a gaiety delivering, thrilling, enhancing one were we have to sit back to sense the chase scenes at the beginning and the end. Yes this is a fast moving film that thrill us to find out the new ways of robbery and the fresh fragrance of doing it. Find Edward Norton best all among them because he was a small, simple, style 'mustache'-ed antagonist. A wonderful experience to watch it only for the chase sequences.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Meh,"The Italian Job tries hard to be intelligent. Problem is, the writer doesn't seem to be an intelligent person. So entire thing comes off as pretty dumb and childish.Even the endless charm of Wahlberg, Norton and Theron can't save this one, although they are delightful to look at. First act is halfway decent, but then the movie quickly turns into episode of Scooby Doo.A waste of time.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
A car chase in L.A.  How Original.,"This is a pretty good movie.  Well-plotted and directed, good infusion of humor, yet it falls flat.  First, the one sheet gives you no clue what kind of movie it is, with the cast all standing around. Unless you remembered the original 1969 film, you were clueless.  Second, I have rarely seen such an interchangeable cast in any film.  Other than Seth Green, any of the men could have been playing any of the male roles.But my huge objection to this film was the car chase in L.A.  There's not a foot of interesting tarmac or any surface that we have not seen cars racing over in a hundred films or on the nightly news.  This movie is about a car chase.  The original did it on wonderful European locations.  So did the Bourne Identity.  Not a single surprise in L.A. Of course the Minis went over the Sepulveda Dam.  Of course they drove on sidewalks. Of course they drove the flood control channels and the LA River.  But even the thoroughly ordinary Metrorail tunnels couldn't make this chase scene interesting.  Made me want to shoot the neighbors for having that party.  How much better it would have been if the chase had been in the mansion (which is why they chose the Minis in the first place).",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The beginning has style, but that does not help the rest of the film","My Rating: ** out of ****.The Italian Job was one of those summer movies I did not see but I heard it was good. So tonight I decided to give it a try. The result was a mediocre movie.The Italian Job opens with very stylish opening credits. It features nice cinmatography of Venice and has a clever constructed heist scene. Then it moves into snowy mountains which are also beautiful. Unfortunately, from then on it was mostly down hill.After the sylish beginning, the characters come on and we have to accept them. This is something that never happens. Why? Because the characters are not likable in the slightest. You do not care if they die. As a caper movie, Oceans Eleven was much better because the characters were all likable and had some very clever dialogue. The Italian Job occasionally has some clever dialogue but it is much less successful than Ocean's Eleven.The performances do not help either. Mark Wahlberg is stiff throughout the movie.  Charlize Theron is looking beautiful and is convincing but again her character is not likable. Jason Stratham is fine, but his character is so arrogant that you can not stand him. Seth Green has his moments but hes not entirely likable either. Mos Def is good and he is pretty much the only likable character in the gang. Edward Norton is no better than ok as the villain. Donald Sutherland is good but really wasted. He is only around for a few scenes.The Italian Job is too long. It really is too long when you dont like these characters. The chase scene with the minis was overlong and not exciting. Even though I was not interested in the characters I felt the movie was hard to follow. The DVD I rented did skip(only for two minutes) but I feel it was more than that. If I was a little more interested maybe I would not have noticed.Overall, The Italian Job was not quite a failure. It is a good example of style over substance. It has some good moments but not enough for an hour and forty-five minute movie. If fifteen minutes were cut it could have been better.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
where's the people?,"I found that the characters weren't fleshed out enough. They were like robots. This in turn made me unable to care for them, or what was going to happen to them. I don't think I remember any memorable dialogue or character interactions in the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pretty average heist flick,"Poor cinematography, terrible script, and bad casting are the lowest points of this average heist flick. Wahlberg--a capable actor--and the rest of the cast are not able to flesh out the flat, lifeless characters they are given.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
