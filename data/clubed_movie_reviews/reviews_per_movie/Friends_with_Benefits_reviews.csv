"Cliché, predictable, but so honest and funny!","This movie was all things cliché and predictable. Even though you know what is coming, the honesty with life's little quirks and human behavior was incredibly well done.Timberlake is an okay actor. I found him to be a fresh breath in this movie. The dialogue and scenario fit his charm quite well.I found Mila Kunis to be quite funny, and she pulled off that cute, charming, awkwardly damaged woman, perfectly. She was chic, yet easy to relate too. Down to earth, but an air of success and confidence, hidden in all the girly dreams and fairy-tales.If you want something original and never done before, this is the wrong movie to watch. If you wish to appreciate a good spin on an old concept with stellar humor and humanity, it is worth the watch..",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Friends with Benefits""","""Friends with Benefits"" has a predictable and unoriginal rom-com storyline and a lame ending. Yet while Timberlake and Kunis are on screen sharing sharp and witty dialogue and projecting a charismatic presence which is found with great stars like Marilyn Monroe and Nastassja Kinski, there is hardly ever a dull moment. And the reason for this seems to be simple enough. In most rom-coms, the actors play pretty dim-witted, boring and superficial people and therefore there is no reason to take interest in anything they may say or do. In this rom-com, ""Friends with Benefits,"" Timberlake and Kunis play fresh, independent and smart people and for this reason we are interested in the lives they lead and what they say to each other. So ""Friends with Benefits"" does not have much of a plot, but that does seem to matter because on this rare occasion we are happily distracted by the magnetism of two capable on screen actors who are playing two well-craft parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good chemistry for sure,"I was expecting to have to compare this movie with No Strings Attached (or whatever that movie with Ashton Kutcher was) all the way through however I was pleasantly surprised that the story was a bit more complex despite the obvious parallels.Yes it's the typical ""boy and girl decide to be friends only but end up loving each other"" movie .... but I must admit that it was a lot smarter in the delivery. Timberlake and Kunis have a lot of chemistry on camera ... It's shot primarily in new york so expect the clichéd new york locations ...The complexity of Timberlake's character is slowly revealed through the show as opposed to being revealed in the first 3 minutes like most other movies.A good watch ... not slap your knee funny but certainly entertaining to the end ... clichés and all",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A sweet satire that's almost good (but not quite),"What I can say for Friends with Benefits is that it's a cute movie that doesn't reach it's full potential. The main problem to me is that when it starts, the film is being played as satire and when it ends, it's being played straight. As a result, Friends with Benefits does not quite rise above the romantic material it mocks, but on occasion it's funny and adorable.Actually for a while, the movie is on fire. The opening is cleverly handled, and is a good way to grab the audiences attention. Then for the next several scenes, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake demonstrate charm, comfort and overall competence and end up delivering a couple of the funniest sexual encounters I've seen in years. What I like about them both is that they bring enthusiasm to whatever they do, and this film is no exception.Around the halfway point, the film starts to feel a little boring. with a running time of just over a hundred minutes, Friends with Benefits is not a long movie, and while it's not exactly short either, it feels shorter than it should be. There are a few hints to suggest that a longer movie was intended but the Studio may have forced a cut down. In addition to an ending that feels rushed, all the supporting characters in the story seem futile, and underwritten. Woody Harrelsson, for example, can be a really funny guy, but he's not given the material or the screen time, to make his appearance worthwhile.The film has it's ups, it has it's downs. It doesn't end up being a bad Rom-com, but I've seen better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A raunchy sex comedy that starts off sweet but becomes sour all too quickly,"I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.Jamie (Kunis) is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan (Justin Timberlake) land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends, and after a discussion about their relationship failures, decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz (hence the titular phrase). But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.Rather surprisingly, the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and one-liners drop at a steady pace, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film, and how well co-writer/director Will Gluck (who knocked Easy A out of the park last year) helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies, and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre, and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious, but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky (which the trailers have ruined slightly), but helped add to the humour.Except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.Kunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable.Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances, but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman (who I did not realize was still acting) does a little better in a warm and significantly low-key role as Dylan's sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously over-the-top, but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own, and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film's best dialogue quips, and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance, Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.In the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti- romantic comedy, and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however, and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Nutshell Review: Friends with Benefits,"2011 will probably go down as the year Hollywood tells us having F* buddies is OK and encouraged, with no less than three films this year set around the premise of pure sex without strings or emotions attached, with Love and Other Drugs and No Strings Attached setting the precedence earlier with an incredibly good looking cast in all sorts of undress - Anne Hathaway, Jake Gyllenhaal, Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher - and added to the list will be current IT guy and girl Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis rolling beneath the sheets in a typical love story between the emotionally unavailable and the emotionally damaged.Mila Kunis stars as Jamie, a headhunter in New York who persuades her target Dylan played by Justin Timberlake to ditch his young, upstart blogging team to join GQ (how's that for a little bit of subtle advertising) in revamping its website and to infuse new content ideas. A night out prior to the offer seals the LA based Dylan to relocate and take up the offer, with plenty of activities thrown in that if it's not Jamie being his only friend in a new, big city, they would serve as activities that would fit in for an awesome date night out. Before long they become firm friends, and made a pact to keep things physical since they each have their wants, and with the other party game to get down and dirty, so begins their game of tennis (though personally I prefer analogy with, and the term ""bedminton"" - it involves cocks after all). After all, why complicate what would be a beautiful friendship, if sex can be treated just as sex without the emotions thrown in to mess things up?You know the clichéd drill by now, with things moving along fine and dandy, the hint of emotions coming into play to really turn things upside down, the narrative montage to show how frequent they mate like jackrabbits, before some large, needy episode or statements uttered that will probably reveal the true state of affairs, and the list goes on. Deny all you want, but one cannot help but to agree that the fairer sex will have things rough if pacts of this nature turn sour, and expectedly in a movie they always do, otherwise everyone will be happy without adversary, frustration and challenges to overcome and provide that change in strength of character.And it is this power of the cliché that absolutely calls the shots in films like these. You know what will happen, but want to see them happen anyway even though you're multiple steps ahead of every character. And it is precisely these expectations that anyone would want to see covered, and try as the filmmakers want it is the clichés that they find hard to break away from, even if characters here proclaim very early on that romance in their world shouldn't be like an unbelievable Hollywood film, but in what would be art imitating art, look who's talking to begin with. And what's with the fixation about consistently taking the shine off the captain of US Airways Flight 1549 in its emergency landing onto the Hudson River?Justin Timberlake is fast becoming the busy bona fide movie star since The Social Network, and continues his run with this film and In Time which will hit the screens here soon. He has that boyish charm that the camera just loves, and being a real life singer meant covering a number of songs here, from Stereophonics to Kris Kross made it look all too easy. Mila Kunis plays her role as the emotionally damaged girl with aplomb, and shares an effective chemistry with Timberlake that makes this film a delight to sit through, even if as mentioned the story's cliché and we know just about how these two nice looking people will likely get together.The supporting characters while one dimensional almost always threaten to steal the show, from Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's sex crazed mom extending the lifespan of a running joke involving the nationality of Jamie's unseen dad, Woody Harrelson as the gay colleague of Dylan who always have innuendos offhand to share, Jenna Elfman who plays Dylan's sister and Richard Jenkins starring as Dylan's dad who's suffering from advancing Alzheimer's disease, which is especially poignant as it deals with the subplot of how a family copes with a loved one who's behaviour develops erratically, and holding the key to a pivotal personal experience to share and turn things around.With Andy Samberg and Emma Stone making cameos (the latter being extremely crazy as a fanatical John Meyer fan), Friends With Benefits has its main leads to thank for in milking quite the cliché story for the masses, who are likely to make a beeline just to see those two in some down and dirty action, not that you get to see a lot to begin with anyway. Recommended, and stay tuned until after the end credits roll for more commentary when the two are sitting at a couch watching the outtakes of a DVD movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Cliché Romantic Comedy that Pokes Fun at Other Romantic Comedies,"I was able to see a sneak screening of this movie almost 1 month prior to it's official release. I honestly walked in simply thinking I was seeing another typical romantic comedy with my girlfriend. To my surprise it was much more.Timberlake plays an LA Blog Art Director who has just been recruited to work for GQ in New York by Kunis who is a headhunter. The two had great chemistry through out the movie.What's funny is that even though it does contain the usual Cliché scenes that most romantic adult comedies contain, it does tend to poke fun at them and have some sort of realism to the plot.Both Timberlake and Kunis are likable and really funny. Woody Harrelson was the best addition to support this younger cast. Harrelson plays a flamboyantly gay sports editor who goes from making sexual advances to JT, to offering him some pearls of wisdom with his love life.I would have to say this movie was very enjoyable and if your skeptical about seeing it in the theaters, definitely put it on your ""must rent"" list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Leave it to Justin and Mila to make a better ""No Strings Attached""","So is Friends With Benefits better than No Strings Attached? Yes. And if that's all you needed to settle a bet with your friend, you can go call him up now and plan a trip to the theater July 22 to find out why.Justin Timberlake has proved once again that he can actually act... Pretty well, actually. And that automatically puts him lightyears ahead of Ashton Kutcher. Additionally, Justin and Mila have some excellent and convincing chemistry that really supports the film, along with a handful of jokes and hilarious cameos that make for some good laughs. But the story falls flat where it tries to parody the typical romance movie because ultimately, it adheres to the exact same chick-flick formula: Guy meets girl, they hit it off, complications arise, they fall apart, they resolve their issues, and voilà... happily ever after. And Mila's mother in the movie... where have we seen her character before? Oh that's right, literally copy+pasted from Easy A.I suppose you probably wouldn't expect anything more out of this movie than the run-of-the-mill romance comedy, but it's a solid one at that and worth your while if you're interested!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Surprisingly Enjoyable with Great Chemistry Between its Leads,","Friends with Benefits is a good movie with a pretty well developed storyline and a fantastic comedic cast.I thought this would be exactly like No Strings Attached,and I really hated that movie so I wasn't going to bother watching this,but my friends told me it was much different and better,and while I didn't believe them I gave this a chance and I'm happy I did,it is much better and it isn't similar at all to No Strings Attached other than the set up of two friends having casual relations.I cared about these characters a lot and wanted them to get together,there was really great chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake,and there are also hilarious cameos from great comedy actors such as Woody Harrelson,Andy Samberg.Emma Stone,Rashida Jones,Jason Segel,among others.My favourite part of the movie was Richard Jenkins,he delivered a great performance and the emotional addition of him struggling with Alzheimer's was a good idea and very sweet,I cared about him more than anyone else.It isn't anything outstanding,but it's funny and certainly a better than usual romantic comedy that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good one.Two friends who despise romance decide to add a bit of love making to their friendship without any complications.Best Performance: Richard Jenkins Worst Performance: Patricia Clarkson",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hectic dialog - it's better when things slow down,The faults of this movie slightly outweigh the good points. It tries to have an informative SATC type look at relationships. But it kind of feels silly more often.Good points: Nice locations in NYC & LA beach. There is some chemistry between the leads. Patricia Clarkson is different in her hippy type role. Mila is pretty and okay to watch. The part with the father is quite touching.There are some laughs here and there.Bad Points: Too rushed dialog trying to jam in too many jokes in too short a space of time. The sex scenes are a bit like jack rabbits. Justin's voice is a bit high pitched and the singing is juvenile. The supporting cast are used kind of briefly and then discarded like Emma Stone. The screenplay could have been tightened and edited a bit.Overall OK for one watch but not one of the better ones.,4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie without benefits,"Don't waste your time on this one. A weak, predictable plot highly dependent on simulated sex scenes between the two main characters to maintain viewer interest. Of course, if you're into that kind of thing, you'd probably think this was the movie of the year. If you're looking for some depth or acting quality, you've come to the wrong film.And what's with Justin Timberlake? Is he gay or putting a little too much glitter on his speech to give it a gay twist? I'm not trying to be funny here because one of the running gags is that people keep asking him if he is gay. I suppose this is supposed to have us all convulsed with laughter, otherwise I don't have any idea why they are beating us to death with this angle. I suspect Mila Kunis did her best with the underdeveloped character she was given, and its the reason I rated the film so highly.

"Formulaic plot, average dialogue, but still watchable","I thought the movie would have more laughs and I felt the storyline itself wasn't intriguing. The jokes were repetitive and the movie transitioned awkwardly. I'm giving it an above average rating since Kunis and Timberlake are naturally talented, and did have good chemistry. Also, the scenes of New York and LA were visually stunning. I found myself spacing out during some of the dragged out dinner table scenes or other scenes that didn't add much value to the plot. Would I recommend it? Probably not. But it wasn't a waste of time and the ending sort of summed up things fairly well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good one,"I've read many different reviews on this movie. Some people describe it as predictable, boring, or ""a simple movie for horny teenagers"", which I can't honestly understand.I obviously agree that the movie, as everyone has already said, VERY similar to 'No Strings Attached', which is by the way also a good movie to watch. I can't determine which one is better, so let's just focus on what I like in this production.The first thing that hit me were the jokes. The movie is filled both with 'simple' jokes, typical for any comedy movie, and intelligent ones. I really enjoyed it.Another thing I'd like to mention is an original ideas and a unique screenplay. Yes, I've said that this movie and 'No Strings Attached' are very similar, but it's still unique. I agree with some people who say the movie is very cliché, as it has standard screenplay formula of a romantic comedy. It is, however, made in an interesting style, which makes you enjoy the movie.I also need to mention a very important topic that the production shows, which is the importance of honesty and good communication in relationship and during sex. You don't have to agree, but I think that the producers did a really good job showing the problem ""discreetly', hidden behind the comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Friends with eventually regular Hollywood clichés,"There is a recurring adjective that is attached with Mila Kunis's character Jamie which is used by all her sex partners to their advantage i.e. she is emotionally damage. According to Justin Timberlake's character even Magnum P.I cannot solve the case of what's going through Jamie's head when she thinks relationships. What makes a person emotionally damaged is not really elaborated in the movie. She is raised by a single mother, but the quest to know who her father was, is more or less laughed off. While she breaks up with her relationship with Andy Sandberg, it seems she has enough admirers as Shaun White is shown as one of her secret admirer and she also has a passionate set of friends with whom she parties around. So what exactly is her state of being emotionally damaged related to? Or is it a statement that would help the director bring some complications with her friend that provides sexual benefits Justin Timberlake! That might be the case in this totally romantic comedy film.The new romantic comedy 'Friends with benefits', which does not shy away from taking a shot at mocking at every romantic comedy clichés, more or less falls into trappings of the romantic genre from the beginning. Mila Kunis (Jamie), a corporate headhunter in New York, is just out of a relationship with SNL fame Andy Sandberg, while an upcoming blogger in Los Angeles, Justin Timberlake (Dylan) is also dealing with a break up with his girlfriend played by Emma Stone. When Jamie sets up an interview for Dylan at GQ magazine, he comes up in New York and meets Jamie for the first time at the airport. Right from the beginning Jamie performs all the cute stunts a romantic comedy female lead is expected to but also balances out by mocking Hollywood's take on romance and New York. Soon after Dylan moves into NY City to take up the job, Jamie gets him into her friends circle and they both start hanging out together watching Hollywood Romantic comedies and mocking it. But they both are missing sexual intimacy in their lives and since Jamie is emotionally damaged and Dylan claims to be emotionally unavailable they both decide to have just a sexual relationship without any emotions involved.It's all fine and dandy till all the sex lasts for them and unfortunately for the audience as well. Once the sex dries up the movie just goes south and we are introduced to all the regular clichéd family characters. As Dylan takes Jamie to his home in Los Angeles for the 4th of July weekend, we are introduced to Dylan's good hearted elder sister Jenna Elfman (Annie) and her magic obsessed son Sam and more importantly Dylan's Alzheimer inflicted father Mr. Harper played earnestly by Richard Jenkins. The stories about Dylan's not so happy childhood is what eventually melts the heart of our emotionally damaged Jamie and they go on to have their first sexual encounter added with emotions. But these emotions are only noticed by the emotionally damaged girl, while emotionally unavailable boy clearly ignores and start off a chain reaction of complications in their friendship. So this is what is served as suspense romantic complications to our audience and since this is a pre-determined summer blockbuster the eye candy and emotionally hopeless couple have to get back together. How? Well with the usual Hollywood charm and pot full of cliché ridden sequences.For a movie that mocked the romantic comedy genre at regular intervals during the first half of the movie, it was quiet an irony that it had to use more or less the clichés from that same genre to bring the movie around its eventual happy ending. And for all the dissing of Katherine Heigl by Mila Kunis, she is the new Ms. Heigl for romantic comedies. Easy on eyes with magnetic screen presence Ms. Kunis has the charm to breeze through the clichés of this particular genre of films. Justin Timberlake also provides an insight of what to expect in the future in his acting career as he also elegantly passes romantic comedy test.As for the film, apart from the intimate relationship and scenes between Justin and Mila, it always seems to be hanging on extreme to carry some laughs. Woody Harrelson plays its Gay sports editor part with good amount of enthusiasm, but Patricia Clarkson as Mila's flirtatious sex obsessed mother just tries to be extreme and we should be thankful that few scenes from the promotional videos were edited out from the final reel. While there is another extreme moment between Justin and his wild date who tries to act as being wild in bed by licking and smelling Mr. Timberlake's armpit, which neither grosses out nor induces laughter but guarantees yawn from the audience.To an audience who has seen it all in this year's romantic comedy hit 'No strings attached', which was also about friends 'hooking up' just for the pleasure of the whole act; Friends with benefit has nothing new or better to offer. It glides along on the charm of its two leads, but fails to hide its flaws as a good romantic comedy entertainer.For more reviews visit http://cinemadose.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is absolutely an guilty pleasure of mine,"This one is a typical romantic comedy but it pokes fun at the other romantic comedies that take themselves too seriously.

Also the characters are individually very charming. You'll find this movie surprisingly funny and entraining. She comes from New York and his from Los Angeles, the difference between the two root from the differences between the L. A culture he follows and the New Yorker personality she strongly presents.

Predictable fun!,"The movie was entirely predictable since it was, after all, a formulaic chick flick (Boy meets girl, good moments, bad moments, almost break up and then patch up leading to Happily ever after).

Mila Kunis was better and they had pretty nice chemistry together. I like how they broke couple of stereotypes (art director, sports editor, who was probably the funniest, BTW).

Again, the writing isn't as clever as it thinks.It's also boring to promote New York so much.

It could have been so good,"While the movie is aware of the clichés that are thrown into the mix when making (or watching) a romantic comedy and they also play with them at the beginning (with a kind of harsh comment concerning a Miss Heigl), it does fall back on the same ""mistakes"" it criticizes. And while it does so with a wink (and a great ""number"" towards the end, which in itself is a great payoff), it does feel a bit like a cheat. The movie should have stuck to its guns.But with Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake it has a great cast, that almost make you forget about those little mishaps. Even a sub-story with Richard Jenkins though, feels a bit forced. There are quite a few funny moments and there is no doubt where this will lead, but it could have been a real good stab at romantic comedies.

When Justin Met Mila,"In 1989, Meg Ryan faked an orgasm, Billy Crystal droned about ""sex getting in the way"" of male- female friendship, and the basis for nearly every romantic comedy since was formed ""When Harry Met Sally"". This film follows the same basic premise...but at the same time turns it completely on its head.For a basic plot summary, ""Friends with Benefits"" sees ""headhunter"" (or business recruiter) Jamie (Mila Kunis) meet Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and try to convince him to move to New York City to work for GQ. After seeing the sights and getting to know each other a bit, Jamie & Dylan (in order to avoid all the ""complications"" of a normal relationship) decide to engage in a ""just sex"" type of mutual agreement. From there, of course, things begin to veer off course and get a bit tenuous between the two.Considering that this type of film has been done to death, ""Friends With Benefits"" is actually pretty good. Justin & Mila have great on-screen chemistry, the plot is a good mix of sappy & serious, and (at times) it will make you laugh (although many of those will be uncomfortable chuckles if watching with an audience).Besides the irreverent fare (which would probably prevent this movie from being a ""classic"" anyway), the only problem I had with this film was how strange it was for the two leads to be playing against type. Usually, Timberlake is the ""crazy guy"" and Kunis is the ""uptight witchy girl""...that is how we are accustomed to seeing those actors. Here, however, Timberlake is a bit more reserved while Kunis goes through a gambit of emotions from beginning to end. The chemistry between the two, as I mentioned, was great, but it was awkward seeing them against type.Overall, though, this is a decent rom-com that provides (in equal parts): sexual escapades, tongue-in-cheek humor, character development, & an engaging plot. It may not be an all-time great, but ""Friends with Benefits"" most definitely has its moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

JT and Mila are what make 'Friends with Benefits' work. Without them, I have a feeling this movie would bomb. The scenes where Timberlake's Dylan has to deal with his father's worsening dementia are touchingly and sensitively done.Fantastic soundtrack: Train, Steppenwolf, Semisonic, to name just a few.Great New York City setting.The ending is reminiscent of every other rom-com you've seen, but creatively done.Fun stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
JT and MK carries this wagon that lacks fresh ideas and full of clichéd treatment,"Reviewed July 2011Well the movie turned out to be exactly I have pictured it to be. Lots of clichéd romantic stuff. Decent humor occasionally. Lovely Mila Kunis. Surprisingly not so annoying Justin Timberlake. Good chemistry between them. Happily ever after ending.This very same concept has been exploited quite a few times recently with 'Love, Sex and Other Drugs' as well as 'No Strings Attached'. So I am not going to get into the details about the plot baring one, it has different leads.Now that I am done with my neutral and positive points of view, lets get to the critic stuff. There is absolutely no fresh point it deals with that has been dealt 100 times before. No innovative/brilliant screenplay or narration, cinematography/visuals or background score. There is no element of surprise and it doesn't even try to be a tearjerker as it is not packing any of the above other qualities. Just trying to be a money spinner riding on it's likable leads.You don't miss anything by missing it, you don't gain anything by watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Really Beneficial Movie to Watch,"Friends With Benefits is exactly like No Strings Attached. Except it isn't. The plot is the same, but the movie dynamics are totally different.FWB was one of the funniest romantic comedies in years. No formula, no b.s., just good comedy.There were a lot of satirical elements in the movie that were surprisingly witty.I'm not sure Woody Harrelson's character was actually needed to progress the story,but I'd equate it to Melissa McCarthy's character in Bridesmaids. Just really, really funny every time he's on screen.The chemistry between the two main characters was very real most of the time. Both Timberlake and Kunis played off each other fairly well. And the rated R is what the adult viewer really wants. And trust me, FWB delivers.Another thing FWB had that No Strings Attached didn't was a lot of heart. Very real emotions were often displayed in the movie.There were some great cameos in the movie, like Jason Segel, Andy Samberg, Emma Stone, and Shaun White playing Shaun White.Good for Will Gluck for making a good follow-up movie to Easy A. I think he's really starting to find his niche in Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A film with nothing,"Friends with Benefits seems like it might be a satire of Nora Ehpron's feel good films,or Neil Simon's one dimensional types with just TV cracks as substitutes for any kind of genuine dialogue. Not the case here. This film makes Ephron's screenplays and directed films, along with N. Simon's stuff, look like classics. Friends with Benefits has no acting in it, except for Patricia Clarkson, and she is debased as one of those old women- mothers who swear and screw around with men etc.There isn't one line that is funny,there is not a scene between Timberlake and Kunis that has any chemistry to it. He is always seen as potentially gay, and Woody Harrelson's gay character keeps us wondering, if anyone would care to wonder.Timberlake plays it all as sort of gay and sort of straight, but comes up neuter. I think the reason why there are so many nude shots of him is because you never take his gender seriously, like one of the dwarfs in Snow White, you never fear for Snow White's sexual safety; the dwarfs have nothing that would cause fear. So it is with Timberlake. Even when there is sex between Kunis and Timberlake, it looks like wrestling at summer camp.The Altzheimer scenes are appalling, along with the gay male model scenes that are deeply homophobic.This film needed a script, director, producer, and stars, not non-actors, who stomp around the set with no sense of mimesis, mimicking at all.Avoid this, and watch ""The Nanny.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Near-disaster,"I was surprised to learn that this film was by the director of the engaging ""Easy A."" In ""Friends with Benefits,"" he elicits so-so performances from a wonderful cast as if it was his central purpose.The script was written by three men, but sounds as if written by a middle-aged-plus lady a la the horrible Nancy Meyers, straining to seem ""daringly"" dirty, up-to-the-minute hip and fitfully ""meta."" There are plenty of references to movies and digital culture, but few laughs, and I never felt any human connection with the characters. The dialog is delivered in a pressured way, with each new line beginning at the instant the previous speaker finishes, with never a pause or overlap. The editor would usually cut at that instant, giving some scenes a very clunky rhythm, with consequent injury to any flow or naturalism.FWB's scattered references to standard romcom memes don't seem so witty finally, given the script's failure to subvert or transcend them. Its would-be feel-good conclusion is unearned and false.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Benefits to be had if you spend time with these friends,"Following on from the almost identical ""No Strings Attached"" staring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman which grossed over $100 million, this movie replaces Kutcher and Portman with the impossibly gorgeous pairing of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis who make an engaging romantic couple.Modern Family's Nolan Gould has a small role as Timberlake's nephew and Woody Harrelson simply steals the movie, he owns every scene he is in as a gay sports editor.The writer and director set us up for what could have been a great moment-one which we expect to see, but it never takes place. Harrelson is constantly asking Timberlake to go out for drinks, so the can hit on men and women respectively. Timberlake always refuses, but half way through the movie he agrees. At this point we expect some funny scenes watching Harrelson on the prowl. When we don't see it, we miss it.Friends With Benefits is not without it's clichés, but overall a pleasant way to spend some time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"It's predictable, but still quite enjoyable.","It's quite amazing to notice how similar Emma Stone and Mila Kunis look to each other; I wonder what went through the director's mind that he ended up signing up both actresses for this film. I wish there were some scenes with both actresses in it, watching both of them in the same frame would have felt unreal! I decided to watch 'Friends with Benefits' just to have a good time because I was tired of watching serious stuff, or movies with award winning or worthy performances. Every once in a while or perhaps more, one must watch a movie that is an out an out entertainer; it's truly a great stress buster technique.Friends with Benefits doesn't waste too much time in getting to the reason why anyone would want to watch this film. Of course, you know what will happen ultimately between the two protagonists, you can see the direction the story will take, but you still take the ride because it's a lot of fun and also because the female protagonist is Mila Kunis.The concept they take up in the film is needless to say, absurd; there is no such thing as sex without emotions and feelings, which our protagonists do ultimately realize; but in all its absurdity, the screenplay does manage to make you laugh. Eventually the movie turns into a sweet romantic comedy, and a good one at that. It's not something groundbreaking or anything that you haven't seen before, but you will end up enjoying it nevertheless.Both Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have done a pretty good job in the film, and as a cherry on top you also have the always outstanding Woody Harrelson. It's quite surprising to see that an actress like Mila Kunis, who has so much caliber, is yet to reach the heights that a Kate Winslet or Nicole Kidman have reached. I don't understand how she hasn't done a career defining or an award winning role till now. Mila Kunis, who looks absolutely gorgeous in every single frame of the film, is much better than the kind of films she ends up doing.If you are looking for an easy going film purely for the purpose of entertaining yourself and can do without Oscar worthy performances and a masterclass in acting, then this film might just do the trick for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A movie with (some) benefits,"**1/2 out of (****)Just three weeks after the new year, ""No Strings Attached"" was conceived. It was a raunchy, yet lighthearted comedy about friends using each other for just sex, with no emotion involved. Simply a mere physical act. Fast-forward to half the year and you got ""Friends with Benefits"". With a story nearly identical and characters just as zippy and charismatic, you think the quality would be the same. And well... you'd sort of be correct. The difference is ""Benefits"" is a slightly better production thanks to a few new tweaks here and there, but technically, it really is just the same movie.Let's start off with the performances. Kunis and Timberlake have decent chemistry together, but not as great as I was led to believe. They portray a realistic couple and are enthusiastic and well-suited in their roles, but only when they need to be. The story? Nothing groundbreaking. Some heartfelt and touching scenes, along with the more comical ones, so it's all a win-win. Now for a sex comedy, does it push the envelope? If you thought ""No Strings Attached"" was a little skimpy on what it promises, then you'll be more than satisfied with this one. The sex is there, it's explicit, and just downright raunchy. Make no mistake here. Mix in a plethora of sex jokes and multiple f bombs and you pretty much have this movie. But to my surprise, the sex element wasn't that substantial. Probably just for the first third.All in all, is this a film I'd recommend? Yes, but take it as a mild one. It hits all the right notes but it's not as great as others lead you to believe. If you are impulsive and can't wait to see this movie, hit up a matinée. It's a cut above most of what's offered, but it's nothing you have to rush out to see. Overall a decent movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

In fact there is a fake rom-com in this movie where they point out all the movie clichés that they won't fall for. There's just something unlikeable about an anti-rom-com. There's a reason why formula rom-com has been successful for so long. The fact that both Jamie and Dylan try so hard to be detached emotionally makes this story emotionally detached.

"A comedy like all the rest, but still fun.","Who doesn't love Mila Kunis? Not many people! She's so compulsively watchable that it's hard to think of an actress more popular with males AND females at the moment. Her teaming up with JT makes Friends With Benefits everything No Strings Attached wasn't. Obviously the two films have the same plot line, there are a few bits and pieces which are different but all in all pretty much the same, the characters in this film are so much more fun, sexy and worth your time.There's a bit more raunch in this movie which I think adds a lot to the plot, the fact that the characters actually do seem like friends is definitely a plus for this movie, for me the chemistry between Mila and JT is electric.Full props to Justin Timberlake too, he gets better and better with each film, he has made the transition from music to film quite well. Patricia Clarkson is divine as usual, I take it that she's a friend of the director, now being in 2 of his films, the other being Easy A, she is fantastic in these wacky parent roles. Speaking of Easy A, Emma Stone's cameo at the beginning of the film is priceless...... I was on the ground in stitches, I've been yelling ""John F**kin Mayer"" at random times ever since. Love Emma Stone!!!!!!!!!!In closing, Friends With Benefits is a fun romp to be had with friends or your partner, it towers over NSA in spades.

Clever writing and genuine comedic acting help mask the inevitable clichés,"If I had the ability to time travel (and who's to say I don't, because I'd never tell you if I did) and felt inclined to show a movie to the citizens of the '20s or '30s that would fully capture for them life in the 21st Century because I wouldn't be able to take them there myself, I think I'd choose ""Friends with Benefits."" For one, it's predictable romance — that much hasn't changed in 80-90 years. For another, the presence of technology is rampant, which would awe them while also proving another thing that hasn't changed in 80-90 years: product placement. In all sincerity, however, Will Gluck (""Easy A"") has crafted yet another comedy that's savvy to its audience, and though the contemporary attitudes, humor and references come heavy-handed at times, he captures our sensibilities and can identify the talent that can make that writing work.The only thing the screenplay doesn't write its way around is the formula to which the film's premise inextricably links itself. As funny and even touching as the writing can get, it can't outrun the predictability factor of two friends who try having a relationship built on emotionless sex. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) moves out to New York City from Los Angeles thanks to Jamie (Mila Kunis), a head hunter who sets him up at GQ. Knowing nobody in the Big Apple, Dylan spends a lot of time with Jamie and they connect over bad past relationships and some healthy sarcasm. Each plagued by their own issues, they determine they could try sex without feelings.Yup, we know how this story goes; we even had a refresher course in January with ""No Strings Attached,"" a botched exercise to say the least. What that film lacked were (outside of Natalie Portman) the talents that ""Benefits"" has to sell us this recycled story as if brand new.It's a tough sell, so any measure of success should be hailed a victory. For starters, Kunis and Timberlake are funny people — sincerely funny people. Undoubtedly improvisation was involved, but they understand the material and they make it natural and honest (as well as hilarious often times). Maybe more importantly, the supporting characters defy the norm of best friends and roommates. There's Woody Harrelson as a charismatic stereotype-breaking gay colleague of Dylan's at GQ, Patricia Clarkson as the free-wheeling and somewhat unmotherly mother to Jamie and other that pop up along the way. Certainly they only exist to provide the key advice necessary in these types of rom-coms, but their characters serve that purpose in fresher ways.Although he didn't write ""Easy A,"" Gluck helped pen this film using similar techniques to try and subvert the rampant clichés. Much in the way that ""Easy A"" (which gets a shout out in the airport scene at the beginning if you watch closely) mixed modern humor with homage to teen comedies of the John Hughes variety, ""Friends with Benefits"" both honors romantic comedies and calls them out on their crap. Jamie is a hopeless romantic who despises the movies for warping her views on love and as she and Dylan drink beer and broach the subject of sex for the first time, they're even watching a rom-com, albeit a made-up one ""starring"" Jason Segel and Rashida Jones. The extra pinch of satire softens the fact that we all know even this film will descend into similar mushiness because that's what these movies do. The fact that we still embrace this obvious outcome speaks volumes to how well ""Friends with Benefits"" avoids being the awfulness its premise suggests.Occasionally the film struggles to balance its excessive contemporary humor with moments of actual sincerity and a few characters and subplots (such as Dylan's family with his troubled father played by Richard Jenkins and his sister played by Jenna Elfman) though well done, feel out of place or unnecessary. Otherwise, the jokes hit and the sentimentality takes root as needed. Although I could've laughed half as much as I did at some of the jokes, the cast proves to make the difference in feeling the sting of some of the mediocre humor versus letting it slide.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Awesome soundtrack,"This was a very 21st century movie. It seemed like it was trying too hard to avoid being cliché, but it just ended up being cliché with a twist. It was enjoyable to watch, and fun to see Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in action. Above all, the soundtrack is awesome; just like the movie hints. The good thing about this movie that stands out against the rest of its kind is that there's more to it than the title implies.

enjoyable romcom trying to be ironic about romcoms,"Olivier or Oscar worthy this is not. Enjoyable, likable and fun this most definitely is. Mila Kunis is the believable headhunter wanabe-happily-living-in-a-post-romcom-disillusion world, who falls in like with Justin Timberlake, the unlikely prince charming given his commitment issues. It's predictable, the trailer showed too much, and at times it's just a vehicle to show Justin's six-pack (I'm not complaining) against the back/front drop of the beautiful Kunis. Their chemistry is great, you liked them together, and that really added to the film's premise of the titular friends with their bedroom benefits.It's not all silly, there were touching moments, the two leads dealing with family and life issues - wayward Mum and Dad with Alzeimer's - but there's a lot of genuine humour with some very clever writing and witty one-liners (some of which I'm pretty sure were Harrelson (playing gay sports writer at GQ) ad-libbing) and he brought superb comic-extra-relief with his ""strikily dickily"" rather sound but usually crude relationship advice.This IS formulaic, of course, but it actually mocks that... narrates it, even. It's trying to do romcom ironically, and it works rather well... it's quite honest, and I liked that. Also beautiful shots of NYC and LA (*sigh*) to add lustre to a rather stylish well-groomed GQ-esque look to the film. I liked this a lot more than I expected to; was prepared to be ""meh!"" but actually wouldn't be averse to seeing it again. Maybe. If it came on TV.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"It's like No Strings Attached, but it's much better.","A couple days ago, I was lucky enough to attend an early screening of the new romantic comedy, Friends With Benefits.In the film, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play Dylan and Jamie. Dylan is a businessman in LA recruited to work for GQ magazine in New York, and Jamie is a co-worker who shows him the ropes or New York. They're both just getting out of shaky relationships, and have become fed up with the concept of true love. While mocking the typical rom-com clichés of a movie they watch one night. They decide to make a plan to add sex to their friendship, with the intention that it doesn't lead to complications. But, as cliché would have it, adding sex to friendship does lead to complications between Dylan and Jamie.The movie has kind of the same idea as No Strings Attached, a movie released earlier in the year, and even though we did not need two of these movies, I will say Friends With Benefits is a better movie. It's not great, it's just that I found No Strings Attached to be so dull, Friends With Benefits just gets more things right.The screenplay is pretty straightforward, but I liked how it would poke fun at the clichés of romantic comedies, and then would use those for its comedic advantage later on. The movie is predictable, and it goes on a little longer than it needs to, but that was something I could overlook, because the film had me laughing the whole way through.At the very least, the cast is right. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hilarious in the movie, and they share great, and sometimes steamy chemistry. They both have a bit to be desired, but their charm, especially that of Kunis, makes that forgivable. There are also some laugh out loud supporting roles by Patricia Clarkson and Woody Harrelson, and a brief, but awesome cameo by Emma Stone in the film's first few minutes.But the movie does still tend to shake in tone, and every so often, there's a rare joke that doesn't work.Friends With Benefits is ALMOST a good movie, but it'll sadly have to settle at **1/2 out of ****, subject to change upon possible rewatch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"First half, funny......second half, giant chick flick cliché' trap.","After seeing that pile of garbage that is ""No Strings Attached"", why on god's green earth would i see a movie that harbors the same concept. Well, ideas can be crapped on. Case in point, ""Batman and Robin"". Just because Joel Schumaker took a dump on my childhood doesn't mean the idea of Batman is still in the toilet. But can an idea as simple as this be somehow salvaged? I must admit, the movie did start off quiet entertaining. Both characters are likable, the dialog is witty and at times very funny, and the cameos are great. Needless to say, the direction this movie was taking was VERY different from ""No Buttholes Attached"". They made the sex portion of the film both hilarious and very sexy. The guys will love watching Mila Kunis strut around in next to nothing, and the girls will love the constant shots of Timberlake's ass. Combine that with the quirky awkward situations that we all encounter with sex, and you got a pretty humorous concept.However, around the half way point of this film, it took a turn that i was hoping would never come. And that's what happens with the majority of these chick flick traps, they trick you with their humor, and they turn all emotional. And that's exactly what happened with this movie.I mean come on, how can a film that's really witty and funny turn all serious in a blink of an eye? I mean, one second i'm laughing, and the next, i'm not forced to deal with the sad situation with Timberlake's father having Alzheimer's. Then it trickles down even more when Kunis overhears Timberlake's feelings about her, and of course, the movie gets all emotional and turned into ""No Poop Bombs Attached"".By this point of the movie, i gave up all hope. I already knew what was coming. I was bored, and i actually took a phone call in the theater, which is something i never, and i do mean NEVER do.Bottom Line.....like i already said before, the first half was funny, witty and clever. And the second half is a giant chick flick cliché' trap. I didn't hear one laugh or chuckle in the theater for the remaining hour of the film.

"Uff, this was bad","My motivation for see this was that I thought 'No Strings Attached' was hilarious and I like Milla Kunis. The previews for this film looked like it would be funny, and though I don't really care for Justin as an actor, I like him on 'SNL,' so, I thought he would at least be funny. This seemed to me like it was a rushed project. I got the feeling the whole time that this was written by some decent writers in the 2 nights and filmed in 2 weeks. Everything felt rushed, predictable and cliché. Maybe a better actor could have pulled Justin's lines off better, giving them some punch...but instead, whenever he and Milla and long diatribe's of banter, I felt like I was watching an acting scene in a class, rather than a movie. It also felt like maybe they had as much time to rehearse the scenes as a cold reading. The only good thing about the movie was Woody Harrelson. He was great. Milla's mom was good..., some of the lines were good, but too rushed through to really come across as good or leave any weight, and Milla and Justin had good chemistry. The only thing believable about this film was that they would make good friends. A good couple, is questionable, but they at least seemed to be having fun together. The movie was also extremely formula with no twists or surprises. I didn't see the flash mob coming, at the end, but, really, who cares. I would not call that a good or emotional scene. It seemed more like this went on in a producer meeting. ""Flash mobs are big right now. We should throw one in there at least a couple times. The audience loves it when the actors do a group singing number in a film, and flash mobs are the next big thing!"" EHHHHHH!!!!! Wrong. There was one, of sorts, in 'Enchanted,' but it worked only because it was a musical and was more of a Broadway number than a flash mob. I didn't care about anyone in this film. And how can you when it's paint-by-the-numbers formula without any real depth whatsoever? Everything in this film was a gimmick to make you ""feel"" something, but it was so all so transparent and spoon fed that it didn't carry any weight.Justin should stick to singing. He's not a good actor. Being a good sketch actor on 'SNL' does not mean you can read lines. The only reason he was halfway OK, but I wouldn't go as far as good, in ""The Social Network' was because his part was small and he wasn't really acting, he just seemed to be reading lines and being himself. Not to mention, he's got a nice body but kind of Cro-Magnon looking. Without singing and dancing I don't really get his appeal...unless, of course, when he's Photoshopped. And him as an action star is even more ridiculous. What happened to the days of guys like Keanau Reeves? I mean, Jeremy Renner, Justin Timberlake, Adrian Brody? Seriously? None of these guys look like they could even take a serious punch, nor do they look lithe and stealth enough to avoid one. Though, I'm getting off track of the romantic comedy massacre, of this film.It was on every level bad, other than Woody Harrleson, and completely unbelievable, on every level. The fact that Justin, or a 26-yr-old, is some high-paid sought after art director is ridiculous. They might as well have said he was a wealthy astronaut, which would have been just as believable. Topher Grace could pull off the young, over-achieving marketing director in that Dennis Quaid film, because he's a good actor...and they played up the fact that it was unusual for someone so young to be in that position.Watch 'No Strings Attached,' rather than wasting any time on this film. Two great actors, great script, great chemistry, feel good. This is a film Milla should have turned down 'cause it did nothing for her career, and only cemented for me to avoid Justin in starring roles. He's just not good. The only film I liked him in was 'Southland Tales,' but he didn't say that much, does a musical number, and it was more of a cameo that added a funny element to the film. This was probably one of the worst romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Two thumbs down.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Overly cliché and laboured,"After another failed relationship high-rolling blog entrepreneur Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) and head-hunter Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) decide to forfeit on love and commitments. Per chance Jamie headhunts the LA settled Dylan to become the chief editor of GQ monthly, the New York. On his arrival to the Big Apple the two hitch onto their instant connection, chatting through the days and wise-cracking on the same wave-length. Not wanting to dissolve the friendship, but at the same time in the midst of an ongoing sex-drought, the two decide to enter an understanding: Just sex. No strings attached. What happens from then on is... pretty anticipatable. At first things are perfectly fine, but then an epiphany or two changes the state of affairs into something less raunchy and more heartwarming.Romantic comedies are essentially my guilty pleasure (psst... don't pass the word around), often intaking a few to lessen the intensity levels following more ambitious cinema. Despite being able to fill in the dots several scenes ahead, they do offer a certain respite and touch the less cynical side of a human being. However cliché and stereotypical the two leads or predictable the outcome, the key issue is proper chemistry and some honest laughs. Unfortunately ""Friends with Benefits"" offers two mildly intriguing characters with pet peeves and supposedly cute idiosyncrasies, who are provided with well-meant, but laboured, dialogue. They end up attempting to talk there way into the viewer's sympathy with mildly entertaining punchlines, forced deliveries reeking of pretentiousness or mistimed comedic flow. Even worse some of the ideas spun into the move are outdated (like the whole flash mob concept) and just don't help to build the character's credibility.The best thing in the movie is Dylan's father (played by Richard Jenkins), an Alzheimer afflicted heart-warming character, which single-handedly manages to instill a sense of honesty to the end resolution, despite all the dismembered emotionality of preceding events. Unfortunately for the lead cast the show is basically stolen by supporting actors with Jamie Clarkson as Jamie's hippie sex crazed mom and Woody Harrelson as a gay sports editor stealing all of the thunder whenever on screen.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Quick, Smart, and Self Aware","Another R-rated comedy? Come on, right?Okay, even though this summer has seen the release of a litter of R- rated pups, including Horrible Bosses and Bridesmaids, there's definitely room for WIll Gluck's fast paced effort, Friends with Benefits.Beyond the obvious similarities to No Strings Attached, the barely watchable rom-com that left everyone wondering how the hell Natalie Portman came off as less charismatic than Ashton Kutcher, Friends With Benefits is a sharp and satirical look at the modern landscape of romantic comedies.A comparison to Scream isn't exactly off the mark here, as many of the same self-aware elements that worked in Scream work for Friends With Benefits. There are obvious breaks of the fourth wall when the rom-com clichés are checked off the list, but Friends With Benefits knows what it is, a romantic comedy, and a fun one at that.During the opening few minutes, Jamie (Miila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) are both dumped by their respective significant others, prompting each to decide that it's time to take a break from everything resembling an emotional relationship. These opening bits are truthful, biting, and played off with a wonderful wink and smile to set up the entire tone of Friends With Benefits right from the starting gate.Dylan is a veritable hot-shot at a dot-com when head hunter Jamie is hired to wrangle him as GQ's newest art director. When Jamie wines and dines Dylan in New York, attempting to close the deal on his taking the GQ gig, there are moments of genuine chemistry between the on-screen couple. Kunis, who is at the absolute peak of her celebrity right now, is charming, beautiful, and generally full of a real personality. Jamie is not perfect, and Kunis plays that perfectly.On the flip side, Timberlake is extremely well cast, pulling on his boyish charms and good looks to breeze his way through lines and moments that could be extremely corny, but come off with poise and ease in his hands. Timberlake has now earned his place in movies -- he can stay, even though this and his performance in The Social Network feel more ""directed"" than ""acted"" per se, he's been smart in choosing roles that fit him as he gets his feet wet. Honestly, it sounds like the start that a lot of mainstay Hollywood stars have had.After a few months in New York, Dylan and Jamie decide that they should adopt a friend with benefits lifestyle, as each are done with the dating game. After the ground rules are set, the two get to it. These first sex scenes between the two are some of the most entertaining in the movie, with Gluck's direction never letting one joke linger too long, just in case it didn't hit with the impact it needed. The first half of the film is a combination of clever writing (think Nora Ephron, but she's grown up with the internet) and quick editing to keep the pace and flow as upbeat as possible (exactly the same way Easy A , Gluck's previous effort, operated).The plot finally comes around, as the back and forth connection between Dylan and Jamie becomes apparent, and the two are forced to actually deal with their feelings for each other, and share other feelings between each other as well. Friends With Benefits is a romantic comedy, so the typical situations of overhearing a conversation that was misunderstood and a brief entrance of a potential love interest are all in place. It's obvious Friends With Benefits is aware of the mold, but it's not about to go breaking it, either.Overall: It's obvious that Gluck is perfecting the art of the new rom- com. Fired Up!, Easy A, and now Friends WIth Benefits have given rise to the John Hughes of the internet generation. Pulling in the best elements from the classic '30s and '40s ethereal cinematic romances, touches of Woody Allen's pace and conversational flow, and dialing up a Nora Ephron-esque charm in his screenplays (and screenplay adaptations), Will Gluck has another winner -- far better than that ""other"" sex without attachment movie.Easter Egg: When Jamie is waiting to pick up Dylan from the airport, notice the name on the sheet of paper she steals: O. Penderghast. (Olive Penderghast was Emma Stone's character in Easy A.)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Basic romantic movie, but nice!","The plot of the movie was basic, most 2010's romantic movies were kinda the same. The storyline was basic too, everything was totally expected. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and so likeable. The filming locations of the movie (New York and Los Angeles) were basic, too. The opening scene of the movie was totally unexpected and kinda clever (I think so). Overall, it was just a nice romantic-comedy movie, full of sex scenes and some funny jokes. The casting of the movie was nice and the acting was really good (Mila Kunis is awesome on every comedy movie). The ending scene was expected and gladly, it was a happy ending..!

The story is relatable to most single adults as well.It was just missing ... something. I can't quite put my finger on it. I enjoyed the movie, but it really needed more substance to take the film to the next level.There were just too many cliches and run-of-the-mill moments.

"Insulting romantic comedies, its fans, and everything else","The thing about 'Friends with Benefits"" is that you have, in fact, seen it before. Not in the generic way the film implies that all romantic comedies are the same. But this exact movie was released earlier this year with the title ""No Strings Attached"". And what's worse is that vapid, uninspired, Hollywood-love-fest original is actually better.Unashamedly, I admit that I like romantic comedies. I do get very upset when Hollywood makes stupid ones that I don't like it, but I still watch them. The problems here stem from the fact that ""Friends with Benefits"" is a romantic comedy but thinks that it isn't. One of the jokes that lasts the entire run-time of the movie is that romantic comedies suck and the people who watch them are fundamentally stupid. I don't like being insulted and I especially don't like being insulted by something that is trying to survive on put-downs and pretending to be better than the very genre they belong to.There is a fake romantic comedy that plays during this movie, usually serving as fodder for insults, and allows the film to point out everything that is wrong with it. I don't think the filmmakers are so daft to not realize that they are doing the exact same things, but I do think they expected their audience to not pick up on it.Recently Jason Segel has been doing the rounds promoting his new Muppets movie. One of the points he likes making is that the humour is pure and innocent; that the jokes don't insult or put-down anyone or anything. I like Segel as much as the next person, but it astounds me that he could be so hypocritical that just three months earlier he appeared in a movie where every joke insulted somebody or something.And I do mean every joke. We start with John Mayer insults and the obligatory Katherine Heigl jokes, move on to standard romantic comedy insults, then come back with some out-of-place jokes making fun of the Hudson River-landing pilot, and on the way back to more romantic comedy insults, shoot off some remarks about Kriss Kross, '90s pop bands, and of course, homosexuals. And I likely forgot some.Contrary to the current popular stance, I like Justin Timberlake. He has been in a lot of movies recently, and he's usually one of the best things in them. He also has no problem insulting himself. Surprisingly, the movie never took that path.If for some reason, you're still watching, beware that ""Friends with Benefits"" probably has the highest product placement total in recent history. There's a reason Timberlake's character is a marketing exec at GQ – if they didn't make enough money at the box office, they would have off of their sponsors.To be clear, ""Friends with Benefits"" is a romantic comedy. Girl is emotionally damaged, boy is emotionally unavailable. Girl falls for boy, boy falls for girl, but let's see how long before they both give in. If you don't like romantic comedies, then you won't like this. If you do like romantic comedies, then the filmmakers think you have a worthless opinion and you won't like it anyways. It is odd how that works out.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
unconscionably smug movie with annoying characters,"This is an unconscionably smug movie. Smug characters. Smug tone. Smug subject matter, and smug condescension towards its audience. It's infatuated with its own cleverness, staring adoringly at the rampant cynicism that propels it. Certainly, there's nothing wrong with cynicism, but every single character seems like an annoying caricature. After the first hour, it really starts to grate on the nerves. Sure, the leads are pleasant to look at for each of the sexes but Milia's part is all tease for the viewer.

Standard rom-com - does what it says on the tin,"It's a romantic comedy.

It's about Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis who decide that, instead of going out together, just to stick to the 'bedroom aspect' of the relationship. Wait a minute, I hear you cry - didn't they already do this in Love and Other Drugs and that one with Natalie Portman. Yes, is the answer, they did. And they're doing it again. Is this a bad thing? Not really, if you like romantic comedies.Justin and Mila are as likable as the next couple you watch who end up falling in love (I refuse to put the word 'spoilers' in a review of a romantic comedy as you know as well as I do what will happen in the end). They have good chemistry and you'll smile a few times along the way. What more do you want from this kind of film? It also tried to poke fun at rom-com clichés, then ultimately adheres to them. But, if you're bored, break out the popcorn and watch these two annoyingly attractive specimens of humanity exchange some witty banter.If you like this sort of movie, you could do worse.If you think this review is overly-cynical - it's probably because I'm single.

Decent Movie !!,"""Friends with Benefits"" is a decent enough Rom-Com movie starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. This movie starts with placing a cliché on the romantic comedies but soon the protagonist who both just ended their relationship meet when Jamie (Mila Kunis) who is a headhunter meets Dylan (Justin Timberlake) regarding his new job at ""CQ"" in New York. Their mutual relationship gets underway when Dylan who is in dilemma whether to accept the offer from ""CQ"" or not. So to sell off that offer she decides to ""Sell New York"" location rather than the Job itself. Their friendship develops eventually and they come out with a plan to have casual intercourse considering it a game just like tennis. The relationship grew day by day before they actually fell in love without each being aware of it. During the run of play, Dylan visits his hometown in LA to his family and decides to take Jamie along with himself. As they developed a friendship with sexual benefits, they had one course at their home but to the surprise of Dylan, his sister watches him leave Jamie's room and they think that they both are in a relationship. But when Dylan was saying some ill-words against Jamie to his sister to shrug her off, unfortunately she listens to it and decides to leave back to New York early next morning. Now when he comes back to New York he finds Jamie behaving strangely and they both decide to put an end to their friendship. But the moment of enlightenment comes to Dylan when his father visits him in New York and he pour his hearts out when he admits of having an incomplete loving relationship which he was unable to make reach its penultimate goal and how that has hampered his life ever since and suddenly he realises what Jamie meant to him in his life. So he make amends and movie ends on a high note wherein both admits their eternal love for each other and lives happily ever after. The review would be incomplete without placing a special emphasis to the character of Tommy (Woody Harrelson) who plays a small but beautiful role of a content writer at CQ. His philosophy and approach makes the movie hilarious as well as interesting. His dialogue wherein he tells Dylan about his philosophy is the pick of his character and helps him to realize his friendship with Jamie. I would give a decent 7/10 for this Rom-Com and hopes people would appreciate a simple movie as it is rather than getting dissection of each of its aspects.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake Equals Good Movie,"¨I have the perfect body for Photoshop. This (face) gets more angular, these (legs) get longer, and this (nose) get way more Christian.¨ I don't think anyone would have a problem in real life believing that Mila Kunis could be a model, but this is just a movie so we go with the flow when she tries to convince someone she works as a model in order to find Justin Timberlake's character in a photo shoot. Friends with Benefits is director Will Gluck's follow up to his very successful 2010 comedy: Easy A, and although it isn't as great as a film as that one was, the movie still manages to entertain thanks to a decent script and a great chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. This movie actually had all the ingredients to fail: First of all there was a very similar movie that came out in the same month staring Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis's Black Swan partner, Natalie Portman. Second the film follows the same formula most romantic comedies do, and we can anticipate the ending miles away. So, why did I enjoy the film as much as I did? I admit the chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis was great, but that isn't enough for me to make a film of this caliber enjoyable. I also have to admit that I love Mila Kunis and think she is extremely gorgeous on film, but that neither is enough for me to enjoy this movie. I actually enjoyed the plot quite a bit and found most of the things happening believable. I know love doesn't work like this all the time, but there can be a couple of occasions in which true love can be magical and predictable. Some girls have found their Prince Charming, and that is the story some filmmakers have decided to tell despite all the clichés and formulas.Justin Timberlake plays an upcoming successful blogger from Los Angeles named Dylan who happens to have some good job offers coming his way from New York. Jamie (Mila Kunis) is a work agent who makes Dylan the offer to come to New York to work as the editor for GQ Magazine. Dylan just ended up being dumped by his girlfriend for being emotionally unavailable and decides to give New York a shot. Jamie was also recently dumped by her boyfriend, so both Dylan and Jamie realize it is better to focus on work and not enter relationships at this stage of their lives. Jamie convinces Dylan to accept the job by selling him the idea that New York is a great place to live and he agrees. Once in New York, both of them begin to form a strong bond together and become real good friends. They both agree that they don't want to be in relationships at the moment, but they miss sex. All of a sudden they both come up with the idea that they should sleep together without dealing with the whole relationship issue. They decide they can have sex just like two friends would play a game of tennis together, without all the romantic emotional stuff involved. Of course the plot gets more complicated than this and emotions begin to affect their relationship. Patricia Clarkson plays Lorna, Jamie's hippie loving mother, while Jenna Elfman plays Annie, Dylan's older and caring sister. Richard Jenkins is Dylan's father, while Woody Harrelson also has a supporting role as Tommy, the sports editor for GQ magazine.The entire cast is really fantastic in this film. The strong chemistry between the two lead roles (Timberlake and Kunis) is supported by a magnificent cast. Richard Jenkins is always great, and in this movie he plays the role of a father suffering from Alzheimer to perfection. Jenna Elfman is also great in her role as the sweet and caring sister, but the two supporting characters who get the most laughs are Patricia Clarkson and Woody Harrelson. Patricia is great as the free loving hippie mother, and Harrelson shines as the gay sports editor. The plot also works really well despite following all the Hollywood clichés that the film sort of tries to make fun of when they have Jamie and Dylan watch romantic comedies together and rip them off for being so predictable. The screenwriters were a little hypocritical because they followed most of the same formulas those movies did, but I still had a good time with it and laughed at several scenes. I also liked that there was more to Timberlake's character than what we were first introduced to. We got to see some of the depth that he had in the film and he did a great job with his role. I thought I was going to hate this film, but I was surprised at how much I ended up liking it. The first half hour was a little strong for me, but after that the film picked up and ended up having a good message after all.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nothing new in Hollywood.,"The premise of ""Friendships with benefits"" is not a novel thing in Hollywood. Some might even say that it is a very old motif and lacking in originality. And, ""They"" would be right! More so, when two extremely similar films are released within the very same year. If you missed it, the other one is No Strings Attached and looks like a carbon copy of Friends with Benefits. The punch lines and jokes delivered by main leads, Kunis and Timberlake, are often clinical and sound rushed in. It fails to connect emotionally, seemingly missing the mark as a romantic comedy; On the other hand, the comedic parts are rather acceptable, due to the help of supporting cast- Specifically, a note worthy performance from Woody Harrelson and amusing cameo appearances by Shaun White. I have no problem believing that Kunis and Timberlake are good off screen friends. But, on screen, they completely lack chemistry thus leaving the stereotyped ending lifeless and unromantic!

Just OK,"Aimed squarely at the 14-30 year old crowd, BENEFITS has two young professionals becoming friends and then sexual partners, the idea being that they will not become emotionally attached. They will not be the conventional boyfriend and girlfriend as played out in the movies they love to mock. This sort of relationship is common enough in real life -- all one has to do is watch Divorce Court. But for purposes of this fantasy, we accept the situation as out of the norm. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are the leads, and Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson and Pat Clarkson are on hand for support. Veteran character actor Richard Jenkins plays Timerlake's dad who is slowly slipping into dementia. The sex scenes are tame for an R-rated flick, and played strictly for laughs. They are in no way erotic, for you worried parents out there. Also, for most of the movie, Kunis doesn't look all that appealing.

Shallow but charming romantic comedy,"So ""FREINDS WITH BENEFITS"" gives us a very typical new york love story, and as usual, the way to the love is not so easy. Lets start with the plot, we have Dylan, the shy an handsome young man from LA who made his way to the NYC. The man who takes this place is no other then Justin Timberlake, who did a perfect job as the young charming and horny young man that as the movie goes on appeared as a sensitive boy with a complicated family background. The movie started with Dylan getting a job offer in new york, he came to the big city, there he feels unconnected. But he has Jamie, a ""had hunter"" who helped him during his first days in the city and soon became his best friend. Our Jamie is the lovely and supper sexy Mila Kunis, Jamie is the urban new york girl with hopes to ""Hollywood style true love"", she defines herself emotional defective and a lot of her problems comes from her ""special"" mother (Patricia Clarkson). Dylan and Jamie are lonely, and misses sex so they decided to start an unemotional relationship, based on sex only, from now on you're about to have a really good time with Jamie and Dylan's hilarious and sexy adventure. Now let's take a look at all the aspects of the movie, the story of this movie is far from being unique, I think that after 15-20 minutes every one can see how the end is going to look like, but the main actors are pretty good and they take this ordinary plot to a young and wild place. I also like the presenting of Dylan's family and their issues, which gave this movie another measure, a deeper one.

It's a happy little feel-good movie, and certainly nothing more. However, what makes it so good is that the film knows that.

Unbelievably irritating,"I was staying in on Saturday night and wanted to watch something light hearted and humorous. Friends with benefits seemed the perfect fit. Mila Kunis is usually talented and Justin Timberlake has done some good stuff. Add to it the glamour of NY and sharp comedy, things looked promising.I lasted about 30 minutes. I don't know how they managed turn talent and sharp humour into something so annoying. Mila Kunis came across as a fake, arrogant brat and Justin Timberlake had about as much charm as a broom stick. I ended up just being irritated by a lot of things in the film. Such as when Mila Kunis asks Justing Timeberlake if he thinks she's pretty. This is Mila Kunis - voted the sexiest woman in the world for god sake. They both have glamorous jobs, look perfect and have perfect blend of humour and wit...just too damn perfect with absolutely no touch of reality. Not even a hint of chemistry between the two.It's such a shame because Mila Kunis was excellent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and her voice over work in Family Guy is brilliant. So I can only blame the director in this movie for turning her into such an annoying character. As for Justin Timberlake...bland, just bland.Irritating film.

I want to see the movie that Jason Segal and Rashida Jones did,"Good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.From the very beginning we're overwhelmed with the pretty people that are Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake (and a confusing moment where he would dump Emma Stone), and their ""horrible"" problem of finding so many partners that sadly don't work out that they just decide to bang, and because (clearly) sex, communication, and openness are not problems for these two it solves their needs. Now the obvious flaw in this is that nulling emotion to achieve these other things isn't actually possible, what we're removing is the social inhibitions: they just did it arbitrarily.If the entire movie wasn't about how the thing that they're trying to avoid is inevitable, then I would say that it was actually somewhat progressively leading towards a world where social expectations didn't lead our romantic encounters, but we did, however long they may or may not be.The clear problems lie in both the biology of a woman having to carry the child (though not necessarily THE woman, but that causes issues as well), and the egotism that leads people to attempt to control the entire situation because of a biological tick: i.e. when one is ""suddenly"" ready to have a baby, those hormones prevent considering if the other person involved wants that, and don't necessarily open one's mind to having the baby elsewhere.Part of that is the design of passing genes forward, and the rest is social conventions: i.e. it's a very complicated problem.Back to the movie, it's a lot of fun, it's funny, it's sexy (they're naked and pressed against each other like a 3rd of the movie), but it's not deep because being deep on these topics isn't palatable, see above or the 3rd act of the movie.I think the people that will truly relate to all of this movie wouldn't watch this movie, but there are likely parts you'll relate to or at least enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Disappointed - Great actors, bad language, worse plot","I liked so many of the actors in this film from other projects, I thought it would be a fun movie. I'm not a prude, but I was tremendously disappointed by the foul language and graphic sexuality, which ruined the film for me.To be honest, I was ready to walk within the first 15 minutes, only staying to see if the plot and script would improve, since the actors were favorites of mine. When Patricia Clarkson uttered one word which I shall not repeat here, about 3/4 of the way through the film, I left. What a total waste of some remarkable talent and my time and money.There seems to be a Hollywood trend of replacing real plot and dialog with a generous sprinkling of the F-bomb and lots of crude sexual remarks, situations, and references, then calling that a movie. ""Horrible Bosses"" and ""The Hangover Part II"" come to mind as recent examples of this trend. I find it sad to see otherwise talented actors taking the road downhill in some of these really awful new movies.I'm fairly open-minded and see everything I can, but the trend towards trash talk, mindless plots, and endless remakes, is a sad state of affairs for a classic movie lover like me.Class seems to be woefully missing from many of the more recent movies. ""Bringing up Baby,"" ""High Society,"" and ""Monkey Business"" all come to mind as great films loved by some of us who value classy, witty, and intelligent films.I was so happy to recently see ""Midnight in Paris,"" which was well plotted, intelligent, funny, and from the heart.Hopefully Hollywood will remember people like me in more future productions and give audiences (and these good actors) something more engaging to do with their time and talents.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

There are a lot worse movies than this one, and if you think this movie deserves 3 over 10, then, Hollywood must stop the 90 % of their films.Justin's other recent movie, ""In time"", has got 6.8/10, and hasn't nobody else seen the toy car crushing scene and the rest of the crap in that movie?

Bitter Sweet,"The main positive thing about this film that caught my attention, is the realism in it. The movie does poke fun of cliches, but it also shows a side of relationships that isn't normally seen in a movie. The film picks on all the little details that happens in real life in relationships that makes the movie very down to earth and relatable. The story was intriguing and fun to follow, but the biggest downfall to the entire film were the actors. They made it feel cheep. Justin Timberlake comes across way too feminine, it's hard to relate or even see the appeal in him with the way he acts. But it's not like we are making fun of it, or even bringing it to extremes, instead he is supposed to be a ""normal guy"" who is appealing to the audience. He's to feminine to be appealing. As for Mila Kunis, what is up with her eyes? Her acting is very annoying as she comes off winey and irritating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Friends with no strings but benefits attached,"Hollywood movies often come in pairs as films with the same premise are released within months of one another. ""Friends With Benefits"" and ""No Strings Attached"" were released very close to one another and both pose the question of whether it is possible for a couple simply to have sex and be friends without becoming emotionally or even romantically involved. Many men have never had any problem with this concept and Hollywood is now toying with the issue of whether liberated women can think the same. There are no prizes for guessing the conclusion of both romantic comedies but it's entertaining to see how each film works round to essentially the same ending.This time round the guy is Dylan (Justin Timberlake) who moves from Los Angeles to New York to take on a new job at the behest of headhunter Jamie (Mila Kunis). Like ""No Strings Attached"", ""Friends With Benefits"" has a lot of talk about sex - the script is sharp and often funny - but remarkably coy when it comes to showing it with nothing more risqué than a bare back. The film makes fun of movies that are overly romantic while coming quite close to being one of the works it parodies. So innocent fun which finishes up being rather old-fashioned. The French would have done it differently.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Far Better Than No Strings Attached,"I came into the movie skeptical, not knowing what to expect. Before the screening I expected Friends With Benefits to be a carbon copy of No Strings Attached just with different actors/actresses. Having watched the movie however it is much more than that. While following the same basic idea, the story line, jokes, and acting made for a much better movie. The movie managed to feel less like a common chick flick and more like your traditional comedy, appealing to both men and women. The target audience is clearly the 20-somethings but its appeal extends far beyond that. Friends With Benefits manages to produce laugh after laugh without being overly raunchy which is impressive given the subject matter. The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis also gave the romantic side of the movie credibility. All this being said the funniest part of the entire movie was seeing Woody Harrelson play an extremely outwardly gay man, a stark contrast to the majority of his acting roles. At the end of the day Friends With Benefits pulled off what few romantic comedies do, combined the right amount of laughter, romance, and plot to create a movie perfectly fit for your night out with your significant other.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great watch and a good comedy. Little too long though...,"This film was fairly good and had a few chuckles in it but the story was dragged out a little too much. As a projectionist I tend to miss the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film because I'm busy sorting stuff out up in the projection booth. This means that I sometimes miss the true meaning of some films. But with this film I caught on pretty well and rather liked the film. I would definitely recommend going to see this film if you enjoy a mixture of romance and comedy. This film is only 1hr and 49min long but I thought that it went on for over 2 hours. The story line in this film could have been a little more fast pace to keep the audience a little more motivated. The story line is great but a little confusing, so keep your hearing at a high when watching this film. This film is definitely suited for both male and female audiences and is not another one of those chick flicks that girls enjoy watching and the boys just cant stand. It's an all-rounder for both male and female viewers and a great laugh. Don't think that you don't want to watch it because I said its a little long... go and enjoy yourselves.

"H-A-T-E the ""music""","Aight, the picture itself is not too bad. It's clichéd, shallow, crude, predictable. It's replete with impossibly talented non-entities cracking wise left and right. Both women and men, gay and straight, are portrayed as annoying jerks, without any old-school values or integrity. If the human race ever devolves to the specimens as depicted in this movie, I'm getting a one-way ticket off the planet.All that, however, can be glossed over.What REALLY got to me, and which got me to write this feedback is the supremely irritating muzak. I mean, literally EVERY SINGLE scene concludes with a score, and each and every score is basically some schmuck banging on a guitar and intoning nondescript, forgettable words. It's the kind of thing that passes for ""profound"" in a hippie commune with everyone stoned and half-comatose. I don't know what genre it officially is... - ""indie,"" is it? I know the said ""music"" is meant to give pause for thought, reflection, to make us pensive... - but it's just imbecilic and bland. It totally lacks any character. Jeez Alou, you could literally replace all the so-called lyrics with ""nya nya nya"" in the style of someone who takes a break from drooling into a cup, and the effect would be identical.Anyway, so the O.S.T. entirely ruined for me what would otherwise have been a 5/10 feature.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny Hilarious!,"I LOVED this movie! Saw a free preview of it last night and was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting much because I'm not a huge fan of Justin's but it turned out great and Mila was perfect and gorgeous! Very sarcastic, funny, and reminded me of some friends of mine. I laughed the whole way through! Only a couple of small corny parts that slightly threw it off but you had to expect it because it's a chic flick. I would actually pay to see this again! I tie it with the movie The Ugly Truth. Wish they had more of Mila's mom and Justin's gay coworker and the ending could have been more like the movie- chill/funny/not so mushy.

The anti-rom-com,"Similar to how Scream poked fun at horror films while also being a horror film, this movie pokes fun at rom-coms while also being a rom-com.

Avoid this film like the plague,"I was actually embarrassed for the headline actors, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. The material was not good nor were the jokes. Justin Timberlake was bad enough to begin, as usual. Mila Kunis is normally better than this. I guess she was playing down to her material and co-star. Either way the acting was horrible as was the plot and the direction. A negative trifecta. If there were any redeeming factors to the film it was the supporting actors. All of which I felt did an excellent job with the material they had to work. Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Richard Jenkins and even Jenna Elfman, respectively. The film was predictable which is OK in this genre. Just a sloppy project in every facet. Save your time and bypass this one.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Slender premise,"The main angle here, as with No Strings Attached, is that of the booty call - sex available on request from a 'friend' who you fancy but don't wish to date. Problem is, it's a slender premise for a comedy in this case, because the two leads hang out together, chat, as well as have sex. So really, from the viewers' perspective, it's just your average romantic comedy. There's never any clash of tension, such as one of the leads bringing back a new beau and receiving an inappropriate or untimely 'booty call', or either of them facing disapproval from a friend or relative over their cynical arrangement. In many ways, this is like When Harry Met Sally, only condensed into two months rather than 20 years or so, and the sex out the way from the start. Even then not as funny, because here the two leads pretty much agree on stuff from the get go.Otherwise, this does take off and becomes more likable as it goes on, but the two leads aren't too great to watch with their kit off and none of it seems too sexy or even kookily sexy to me. It has to be padded out with other themed stuff - the LA/New York divide and their respective parents. It becomes quite watchable and passes the time, but it's never that sexy or that romantic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Moderate fun,"Friends With Benefits was definitely fun, and it was what I was expecting. And yes, of course it was easily predictable, but what kind of romantic comedy isn't? Friends With Benefits was mostly simple and fun, easy to watch.Most of the sex scenes are very good, they weren't made too deep nor were they just physical action which would make you awkward, hoping nobody enters the room. It was realistic and showed how fun sex can be with the real person, which is something movies don't usually show you. Movies just try to glamorize sex way too much, in Friends With Benefits it was very casual.I'm not so sure about Justin Timberlake's acting though. He seemed decent, but not particularly good. Mila Kunis however, is brilliant and funny as always. Also she's gorgeous, which makes the movie easier to watch.I was kind of hoping more from Woody Harrelson's character, but every time he opens his mouth, they just had to point out how gay the character is. I think the audience got it after the first time yet still it needs to be said so many times it felt like the only feature the character had. Sexual minorities need much better representation than this.The whole story felt like it would be making fun of them, but still they ended up using them. I can't decide if the movie was ironically playing with the clichés or if it fell into its own trap.Friends With Benefits is fun, but I can't imagine watching it a second time. There are way better romantic comedies, like Keeping The Faith, but sure it's worth one watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delivers on its premise,"Friends with Benefits which has been described as a romantic comedy with plenty of uninhibited scenes, explores the idea that affairs can be carried on satisfactorily without any complicating notions of love or commitment. Several to only four writers are credited in this film, including director Will Gluck, along with five producers, and they've come up with a storyline, a screenplay and some engaging performances from a first-rate ensemble cast.Friends with Benefits was released several months after No Strings Attached (starring Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman) which are of similar plots, however Friends with benefits did slightly better at the box office (worldwide), and received far better reviews from top critics. What makes the film good and enjoyable is the chemistry from its leads, otherwise the film would have been a predictable and typical romantic- comedy which we have seen many times before. As a rewach 08/09/18' Friends with Benefits remain an entertaining and highly watchable film. Strong message and tons of a laughs throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More friends with more benefits.,"Friends with Benefits is much funnier and raunchier than your average romantic comedy. What really makes it work is the on-screen chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, who have both never been more charismatic or appealing than they are here. The two keep things interesting (and sexy) even when the story takes a turn for familiar territory.Which it inevitably does. Two attractive friends decide to have a strictly physical arrangement in order to avoid the typical complications of a relationship, but things inexorably get messy when feelings start to encroach, despite their best attempts to keep things casual. We're hardly in spoiler territory, here, and while the story isn't revolutionary, there are enough wrinkles in it to keep it from feeling stale. And as I said before, Kunis and Timberlake are so likable that just having them on the screen is entertaining. The first half of the movie is quite amusing, too, though that gets toned down some as things get more serious.In the battle of ""friends having sex movies"" between this, Love and Other Drugs (admittedly, that movie ultimately goes for a very different vibe) and No Strings Attached, Friends with Benefits is definitely the winner in my opinion. Both guys and girls should have a good time with this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice movie...,"""Friends with Benefits"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch two friends changing their friendship from just friends to friends having sex without being a couple. This parameter will complicate things and they will have to find the balance between them again.I enjoyed this movie because it had a clever idea that was converted into a nice plot. The direction which was made by Will Gluck was very good and he presented very well both his main characters and the plot. The way he presented also the history, the dreams and the secrets of his main characters, created a bond between them and the audience, something that we could relate to. The interpretations of Mila Kunis who played as Jamie, Justin Timberlake who played as Dylan and Jenna Elfman who played as Annie were very good. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Richard Jenkins' who played as Mr. Harper and he was simply amazing. To sum up, I have to say that ""Friends with Benefits"" is a nice, entertaining comedy movie and I recommend you to watch it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very very bad!!,"STAY AWAY!!! This is a terrible movie!! Neither a fun bloke joke film or a sweet chick flick......this is just so bland!!

NYC audience only,"Not sure why I endure films I know I'm not going to like, I mean the title gave a lot away, it could have worked but this went into the deep end of all things modern & superficial.The flash-fire friendship, not believable and the subplot about free love hardly makes one think much, its been explored a million ways already.Enter continual gay evangelism, militant feminism, a drunk mother who's OK with watching her daughter have sex and joke about her unknown father! For crying out loud this is offensive for some of us from real broken situations.Multiple derogatory religious references? There are 1/4 of a Billion religious people in America did you make a movie purely for liberal-progressives from NYC? One good scene includes grandpas memory loss, a stark contrast from the rest of the fluffy junk.

Bit of Fluff with Advantages...,"FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a bit of a twist on the usual run of romantic comedies; hook-ups are for sexual gratification only with no emotional strings attached -unless.... And that is where this film starts out, with a lot of promise. The story is by Harley Peyton with assistance from Keith Merryman and David A. Newman who with director Will Gluck adapted the story for the screenplay. Sound like a lot of cooks to spoil the broth? Well, in part it probably is as there are many little subplots here that bump into each other.Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a New York head-hunter trying to sign Los Angeles-based Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) for her client. When he takes the job and makes the move, they quickly become friends. Their friendship turns into a friendship with benefits, but with Jamie's emotionally damaged past and Dylan's history of being emotionally unavailable, they have to try to not fall for each other the way Hollywood romantic comedies dictate. Add to this fairly substantial idea the gay character Tommy Bollinger (Woody Harelson in a fine little cameo) and Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's galavanting mother and the mix becomes funny. Despite a rather intrusive copout ending there is PLENTY of eye candy from Timberlake and Kunis and lots of bed romping. It's goofy but entertaining and it does show that Justin Timberlake is becoming a fine leading man on screen.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fun in parts with definite sparks between the leads,"Similar to the recent ""No Strings Attached"", this rom-com asks the question, can you have sex without love or a relationship? Of course if you are Milas Kunis or Justin Timberlake your chances will be somewhat higher than the average Joe but as an average Joe, you probably know the answer to that question already.Maybe but it would certainly be difficult, human nature being what it is.Dylan Harper (Justin Timberlake) is the archetypal young ""designer type"", doing lots of flash stuff on a ""Minority Report style"" board and being paid lots of money to do art/design for a blog site.Meanwhile Jamie Rellis (Mila Kunis) is a headhunter in New York attempting to fill a senior art/design position for GQ in New York. Following a bad start at the airport the two meet and Jamie attempts to ""sell"" New York to Dylan by giving him the grand but secret tour, after a quick flash mob and obligatory out of bounds rooftop view of the city, Dylan is sold.The pair then decide that not only have they become firm friends but the idea of becoming ""bed buddies"" is rather appealing, both being healthy specimens with compatible body parts, no strings attached, no nasty breakups and they will remain friends forever, all sorted.We are then treated to the usual movie montage of sex scenes that are reasonably explicit in a main stream movie and on occasion stray into, ""did we really need to know that much detail"", territory.Timberlake and Kunis have good chemistry together on screen, making a believable young couple having a great time, with good jobs, lives and apartments.Woody Harrelson pops up as a flamboyantly gay Art Director, befriending Dylan and adding a few good one liners, although the character is largely irrelevant to the story, aside of providing an audience view of Dylan's thinking but it is always good to see Harrelson back on screen.Kunis is sexy and natural, Timberlake plays an extension of himself and does nothing to dispel concerns over his range, following his excellent turn in ""The Social Network"".So far, just your usual sex comedy, the film then deviates from the norm by looking for some depth as Dylan introduces Jamie to his family. This takes on a more serious tone which does rescue the movie from some of the usual rom-com clichés. Not that it avoids them all, queue Hollywood sign rescue but there is an attempt to move away from the shallow end.Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson & Richard Jenkins all contribute to this widening of the story and add some necessary acting weight, providing perhaps the best segment of the film. Yet more demonstration, if it were needed, that generally good actors help to make better films.As they say, ""who would have thought....""SummaryFun in parts with definite sparks between the leads, an adequate rom-com for the under 30's but older audiences may wish for a more chaste approach.Marginally better than ""No Strings attached"" but overall adds little to the genre but at least aims a little higher, albeit falling short into acceptable date movie territory.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Favorable, yet familiar","Friends With Benefits, while good, serves as one of many 2011 sizable disappointments next to Bad Teacher. Maybe I don't like this type of cliché storytelling, but I think what is partially to blame is that the film is marketed like a laugh-out-loud comedy, when really, it's more or so made up of the occasional chuckle and the rom-com parody that is more clever than funny. Still, it is in no way bad, just misleading and expected.The big thing with this film that I found very smart and very effective is its cast. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are some of today's hottest celebrities. Timberlake is popular with the ladies, and Mila Kunis is popular with the men (I am no exception). Not to mention, we get cameos by Emma Stone and The Lonely Island's Andy Samberg. If this isn't an ensemble comedy cast, I don't know what is.Right off the bat, when thinking of this film, the film No Strings Attached comes to mind which came out earlier this year. I say big deal. If we can have multiple superhero films come out this year, each one dopier than the next, multiple comedies about grown men trying to have sex, and even CGI-ed Alvin in the Chipmunks, Garfield, and The Smurfs, I don't see why two films focusing on the same topic, asking the same question can't be made.The plot is as simple as it has ever been. Dylan (Timberlake) is an art director who works in Los Angeles. Jamie (Kunis) is an Executive Recruiter who tries to recruit Dylan for GQ Magazine. Both have been recently dumped, and miss sex, but don't feel the problems that follow sex are worth it. Dylan and Jamie meet, they become close, and they both agree they are emotionally complex in some way. So they decide to have casual sex, no feelings, nothing personal, just sex. They swear on the Bible - iPad that is.Dylan meets and befriends the sports writer for the magazine, Tommy (Harrelson) who is one of the funniest characters in the film. He gives Dylan advice like a straight man, when really he thinks a man and a woman together is ""creepy."" This film is funny, but not as funny as it suggests. It is better than No Strings Attached by a little. For one thing, it treats its characters like human beings and not just ""Man"" and ""Woman."" Not to mention, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are clearly having fun with their characters.The humor, most of it coming from Kunis, comes natural and isn't forced. But I would've thought more laugh-out-loud moments came out of this picture. The trailer suggests this was nonstop comedy from two shining stars. I only recall laughing-out-loud twice in this film, and I dare not speak the scenes.Vulgarity in Friends With Benefits is one thing it does right. It has a lot of it, but enough of it. It isn't in every sentence, yet it isn't squeaky clean. Plus, it's always fun to see a couple having a serious conversation throwing in swear words like fourteen year olds.I liked Friends With Benefits, but I left disappointed. Maybe this formula is near-impossible to freshen up because of the inevitable outcome everyone sees coming from the moment they sit down in the theater. It's not a bad thing to be cliché, especially in a time like this where it's hard to avoid. It just doesn't work in the film's favor. There are scenes where the film tries to parody other rom-coms, and is successful at that. But what this boils down to is a good comedy, with a disappointing effect. It gets us where we need to be, but then says ""eee, uhh. I'm done."" Starring: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, and Richard Jenkins.

Horrendous,"This movie was absolutely horrendous. There was not a single positive aspect to this movie. First of all, it's not funny. Second of all, the acting is lousy. I understand that this is a romantic comedy and it's supposed to be a bit light and not so deep...but this was really bad. I mean, there really wasn't a single truthful moment in this movie from an acting perspective. I've seen children have more substance that Justin Timberlake and his female counterpart. Third of all, this movie was really awkward- like neither of these individuals have had sex in their life..... Fourth, the plot/story is literally non-existent--> we are literally forced to watch the first hour of the movie in this sort of trance-like mirage of weird images of Justin trying to be funny in bed with this chick....but all the audience could do is cringe in utter embarrassment at this fiasco.Fifth, they kept trying to get Justin Timberlake naked--> but is he supposed to have a great body or something? I mean he looks like a highschool kid...what woman is salivating for the body of a highschooler? They should have been doing everything possible to keep his clothes on and not off. The list of flaws could go on for infinite....this movie blows. I give it an F.The only thing that keeps this movie from being a 1 is Woody Harrelson who's awesome as usual. I.e. he's the only positive to the entire movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A feel good and enjoyable sex romp! It proves good sex is a benefit it leads to attachment and possible love!,"I have to say that watching ""Friends with Benefits"" is one feel good time of a watch! The film is very sexy and it's blended with humor and emotional attachment. And it showcases how more and more relationships have become and that is it's just all sex with no strings attached! That's something that most of us younger folk enjoy, still we get arguments that we all need love and relationships, yet this film proves that great sex alone can lead to attachment and the chance for love! This film even though it proves that romance can be obtained thru sex, it bucks the typical trend of Hollywood romantic comedies. It showcases plenty of fun loving erotic scenes of bed hopping and good old fashioned sex! In New York City Jamie(the hot and very sexy Mila Kunis)a young up and coming magazine executive who's just broken off a relationship hires a young hotshot from sunny California Dylan(Justin Timberlake who hams it up in this role)and this young stud is also single. It's upon his arrival to New York City the two hit it off and they agree from the start that this will only be a relationship of sex! The bed climbing eventually becomes tiresome, still it's fun and different from the norm you as the viewer will eat it up.Good supporting turns are given along the way in the form of Tommy(Woody Harrelson)a gay magazine staff office worker, and veteran Patricia Clarkson is funny and sexy as Jamie's cougar and alcoholic mother Lorna, while TV actress Jenna Elfman is a bright smile as Dylan's big sister Annie. Along the way while dealing with family and relationship problems both Jamie and Dylan see that sex can lead to attachment then that grows to feelings and then a chance for love. This proves that having fun in the process gives anyone a chance for something special.Many may take from this romantic/sex comedy that you learn as you go and that the benefits of sex are good it's a fun process. As it shows in the end it opens up a new beginning for a relationship of love and attachment. Now that's something we could all hope for and hopefully more sex and more bed hopping will lead to these kind of endings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It is harmless and good fun, but given the excellent promise of the first half hour you are left cruelly disappointed by the end.

meh :/,"15 minutes into this movie and i have no idea who these two main characters are. I assume i am supposed to take the dialogue lines of each's partner breaking up with them at face value, giving us some insight into our main characters inner problems, but i can't. It just all to superficial and neither of the ""divorced"" shows any emotional reaction. So nothing to identify here. Neither with our characters profession: Two real super successful hotshots in NY (now) which simply ain't close enough at home for a mass audience. Should we admire this Denver-Clanesque setup? But the biggesst flaw, really isn't the story or unlikeable characters, the real caveat is the pacing. There is simply is none. This movie moves along in a manner, like it were telling you ""what do i care, if you're watching""?

Pass on this one,"This felt so predictable and lacked any great acting; it felt like I'd seen a version of this movie many times before.I'm also just not a fan of Justin Timberlake as an actor; I don't think he's believable at all. Also love Shaun White but what was he thinking taking that horrific part?! His role was so odd...not funny or necessary; just weird.The characters want to avoid clichés but the whole movie was one big cliché.There was nothing overly humorous, new, or unique about this movie so doesn't stand out in terms of romantic comedy titles.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I quite liked it.,"FRIENDS WITH BENEFITSI had seen this before and back then I thought this was quite good... and it still it only quite good.This is a typical romantic comedy. It is funny up until about two thirds in and then it goes all romantic and turns into a full on chick flick.I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the story was good and everything was going so well until the end. Of course the story always ends up living happily ever after etc... but just for once, I would like to see a romantic comedy where they don't end up together. I think the only film I have seen where it is not the same old happy ending was The Break-Up.This film stars Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. I like both of these people. I think they both are very talented actors. Although, this is not their best film.The story is about a couple of people who become good friends... and when they both decide that relationships are not for them, they decide to just stay friends, but have sex. No feelings, no commitments, no awkward situations... just sex.This does make for a very funny movie. There are some great scenes in this movie that made me laugh... and as much as it pains me to say it, Justin Timberlake can be funny at times. He is a good actor... shame about his music.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Good acting, good story, funny... but predictable ending.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
'Friends with benefits' is a nice love story with a little too many clichés.,"Jaime and Dylan are two attractive people in their early-30s (at least I guess so). Successful at work but a failure when it comes to relationships. When they become friends they suggest a special relationship between them: just sex and no emotions.The story feels like every love story ever. There is a beginning, everything is going as planned, they are starting to feel more than just friendship for each other, then there's the break-up where they separate and of course there is the happily-ever-after-ending. So nothing special from this side.The movie is full of clichés. But aside from that, it shines. The characters are relatable, you can really see the attraction between them, the relationship is building up and occasionally it's really funny. I think the film is a little bit too long, it has some not-so-entertaining scenes in 'part 2'. But it also has a lot of beautiful moments like the first few scenes in New York where Jaime shows Dylan around.It is a neat little love story with a lot of great moments but also some droughts in the middle of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a ho-hum collection of uninspired romance,"Dylan (Timberlake) and Jamie (Kunis) meet when the former is on a trip to New York for a job interview. The two become friends, and after a cozy night on the bench, they decide to experiment with having a sex-only affair, i.e. to be 'friends with benefits'. At first this doesn't end well for both of them....Despite the good title, the contents of this film are disappointing. For a romantic comedy the bear essence of the plot has potential, especially for the younger crowd. However, this only holds up the first half hour, after which it falls into a highly predictable string of poorly written scenes with overly cliché dialog. The lead actors, Timberlake and Kunis, are presumably only cast for their appearance, because they don't fit their role very well in terms of acting. The spark just isn't there. The rare interesting and/or funny scenes mainly involved the supporting cast, i.e. Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins, who make this film just slightly more memorable.Kunis' mesmerizing eyes lured me to go watch this film. However, despite her stunning bodily appearance, it didn't stop me from feeling rather bored.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
They sell what sells.,"I was really expecting less, especially because I thought it would be a copy of No strings attached.

Had a good time watching it thought. Cool mom, to me one of the things that made the movie worth watching and Dad...

this is not a romcom,"Is not.. and maybe is good. Justin Timberlake is like a piece of wood.. and wood express emotions very hardly.

OK.. its maybe any interesting story here?.. Which mean.. you can watch this movie and you don't know what happen next? Sorry.. no! Wooden hero meets beautiful girl, go to bed, split up, hero talk with Yoda, they meet again.. end of story. Familiar? To much familiar for me.

"It's not who you want to spend Friday night with, it's who you want to spend all day Saturday with.","Friends With Benefits is a 2011 romantic comedy that centers around two friends who believe that they can add sex to their friendship without emotions or feelings getting in the way.This is a good movie that doesn't really do all that much that you haven't seen before. But for what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with decent comedy and charm. The two friends falling in love thinking that sex won't be an issue story is a cute premise, but overshadowed by its predictability. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have pretty good chemistry, and play off of each other quite nicely which helps keep things fresh. It's a movie that on the surface doesn't look like it has much going for it, but underneath it's a fun little rom-com that doesn't try too hard to be more than it is.It's not the best comedy ever, but I found it pretty entertaining.

"Friends with Benefits (2011) - Friends Sharing the Bed with Each Other? OK, Who Copied ""No Strings Attached""?","This present-day romantic sex comedy stars Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis as friends who don't have the feelings of a complicated and emotional relationship. So they decide to start adding sex in their friendship with no emotions and complications. They try their best not to share any emotions, until they start spending time with each other, and their feelings. Well, this sounds like a coincidental mash-up, since this movie failed to release at a perfect time, when the perfectly similar film, ""No Strings Attached"", was released months earlier. Although this film is a carbon copy, this is still a pretty cool and fun film. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis share a delightful chemistry, and they fill their characters with such charm and charisma. They round up a terrific cast ensemble including Patricia Clarkson as Mila Kunis' crazy mother, Richard Jenkins as the Alzheimer stricken father to Justin Timberlake, Emma Stone, Andy Samberg, and Shaun White all in funny cameos, and Woody Harrelson in a scene-stealing performance as Timberlake's gay business partner. There are some laughs to be had, from beginning to end, and it's pretty cool to watch Timberlake and Kunis have a chemistry in the bedroom. Director Will Gluck has a perfect idea of organizing a sexy script with some heart, a terrific cast, and some truly funny moments. ""Friends with Benefits"" is actually one of the better romantic comedies, and I think it's damn entertaining. From start to finish, this movie is funny and sexy.

Disappointing,"I was enjoying this film until the scene in the park. I was pretty surprised to hear Justin Timberlake's character in the film ask if someone who was starring at a tree was retarded. Mila Kunis was excited that maybe she found a nature lover in the park, yet Justin had to imply that the guy must be retarded. Justin Timberlake's character thought it was okay to mock the disabled by implying that people with special needs are hapless. I just don't get why Hollywood thinks it's okay to marginalize people with disabilities. People living with disabilities are individual as people without. What you call people is how you treat them.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Great and Self Aware Rom-Com,"I might be in the minority, but I found this film an example for all romantic- comedies of the future. It has an extremely self-aware script, which follows the stereotypical romantic comedy formula while endlessly mocking it simultaneously. The chemistry between Timberlake and Mila Kunis is amazing, and is enough to carry the film at its running length.The stand-out supporting performers, however, are Woody Harrelson and Patricia Clarkson. It is a hilarious film, and is one of the few romantic films which never runs out of passion or steam. Even though it bears many similarities to films like No Strings Attached, it actually delivers on its concept better, and its much more likable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Lame.... Useless waste of time.,"Watching movies about shallow premises coupled by lame dialogue and Narcissistic acting are enough to sour me early on. Why did I invest my time watching this pointless bilge. Apparently, the supposed ""Most beautiful woman in the world', Mila Kunis is what kept me somewhat intrigued. close ups of her stunning face and dark beauty is what keeps me watching. Outside of the aesthetic quality of her appearance I had to constantly get up out of my couch to do something more useful like wash dishes or clip my fingernails.This movie is lame and is just a feeble excuse to showcase the two leads and the materialistic world they live in. I don't know much about Justin Timberlake, because I never paid much attention to him outside of Hollywood tabloids forcing this drip into our living room. I also hate when they have to incorporate the obligatory Rap music into movies with White actors, as if they genuinely like this putrid form of noise.It's annoying and makes young people look shallow, self-serving and apathetic.If you want to look at Mila and her entrancing beauty, click on some thumbnails online. otherwise, save yourself 95 minutes.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

One of the main problems are the two stars.Their chemistry is fine, but their dialogue stinks. Awkward and unfunny way too often. It's interesting, because the best parts of the film are when the co-stars like Timberlake's co-worker (Woody Harrelson) and Kunis'
mom are on-screen. In fact, Harrelson is by far the best thing about Friends with Benefits. There are other things that grate - Kunis' ""knowledge"" of the city, Justin breaking into song every so often

"A funny ""re-make"" of No Strings Attached that I didn't think was as good.  I do like Portman better though. I say B","""Are you asking me out? I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York - you don't wanna complicate that."" When Dylan (Timberlake) is lured to New York for a job by Jamie (Kunis) they become friends. After a night of romantic comedy watching they begin to talk about how ""broken"" they are. After a deal is worked out they become ""Friends With Benefits"", but, predictably, that only makes things worse. The plot to this is almost the same as ""No Strings Attached"". After having seen that one, I didn't think this one was as good. Most of it probably has to do with the fact that I think Portman is hotter then Kunis though. Also No Strings felt less girlie to me, and I can't explain why. While Timberlake was pretty funny, and Woody Harrelson had some funny lines (but did tend to go over the top) the movie really seemed to drag for me. I did like the fact that the movie tried to make fun of all other romantic comedies (from dialog, to settings, to music) but I still got bored in parts. I think that, like me, when compared to ""No Strings Attached"" you will pick a favorite based on the main actors. That is because it basically the same movie.

Friends With Benenfits was an awesome movie!,I had seen No Strings Attached before I saw this one and everyone seemed to think that it was a great movie and that this one was not worth watching. I was anxious to watch this one and see if they were all correct. In my honest opinion Friends with Benefits blew No Strings Attached out of the water. I don't really have much desire to watch No Strings Attached again but I would love to see Friends With Benenfits many many more times. I enjoyed the humor in this movie. I love Woody's performance as the gay guy. He did a super job. It was also refreshing to me to see Mila and Justin's characters seem so comfortable with each other in all ways.

The best romantic comedy of this summer,"Films on such tricky subject, when two lonely hearts meet each other and decide to refuse having serious relationships and mutually agree to experiment what it's like to be just sex friends recently came out in the cinemas so we can compare and contrast . By playing main characters' feelings and intentionally getting them into this game it seems like directors try hard to show us that such experiment is bound to fail. And it is, surely, a perfect version, because everyone is alive, let us not forget that it's only a movie, but we have evident example of what happens if we try to go against nature.In spite of the original scene – New York again, and little banality of the plot, everything is given lively and comparatively new. Because the main thing is how to present and this is the key to success. And to present the movie as good as possible and give it out as something individual the creators used techniques that allow separating this comedy from variety of movies of this kind. Dilan (Justin Timberlake) moves to New York to become art director of a famous magazine. That's when Mila Kunis' character appears and becomes a guide for him (and for us, of course) in the city that never sleeps. So we can praise the director even for the opportunity to fall in love with night New York over 15 minutes. Flash mob idea deserves particular attention, because prepares us for the further watching and in some way leads us, giving the opportunity to feel what we are going to see next and how we should receive it.A couple of Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake look fresh. Undoubtedly, new faces breathed new life into this kind of movie, yet it is still possible and we are not tired of Justin's curls. Preconception of his actor career can be explained, but is unjust. Justin, even if it sounds strange, stands out against a background of all these former pop singers who decided to try themselves in something new. What's the secret? Maybe his charisma, maybe really good acting. And who knows, maybe both. Anyway, he is quite good looking. At least, he manages well in a comic genre.What exactly characterizes this movie from its previous related neighbors is easy and unstressed narration. But even this is not everlasting. Though characters make fun of this over-dramatization in the cheap romantic movies with happy endings, for classic melodramas it is an irreplaceable element, and finally the films gets its drama, gradually adding tragedy as it is supposed to be. On the other hand, it is presented not as sweet as it could be if we talk about classic romantic comedies, but with a sense of humor and satire. There are certain clichés that are necessary to be done.As a result we have an excellent summer comedy, a little vulgar, a little cynical, but all in all it is pleasant to say that creators didn't stress much on drama, but expressed the main idea without using strong morality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

At least ten times better than No Strings Attached,"This has been a magical summer for movies. A lot of movies that I was really looking forward to, have turned out to be lousy. However, I've seen a lot of movies that I expected to be awful, but ended up being really good. Thus, ""Friends With Benefits"". Romantic comedies are always awful for me. I love them, but they make me feel like crap. The reason why this is, is because most of them are dishonest, and make you feel like only in the movies, things work out in love. ""Friends With Benefits"" is refreshingly honest, kind of sad, yet hopelessly optimistic. Its dialogue is fast and quick, kind of ""Juno""-esque.Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are both coming off Oscar roles. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good in ""The Social Network"", as was Kunis in ""Black Swan"". Maybe it was a fluke that both of them were so good in those movies, but this is the kind of movie they belong in. Their characters, Dylan and Jamie, have personalities, and characteristics that mesh with each other in a really awesome way, which doesn't come very often in romantic comedies.The story, as for most romantic comedies, isn't surprising at all. It's two people who are coming out of bad relationships, who meet in a classic cute romantic comedy way, and decide that relationships don't work out, and to remain ""friends with benefits"", or friends who (constantly) have sex. As you could imagine, this doesn't work out the way they had hoped. There was a similar movie released this January, with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher called ""No Strings Attached"", which, clearly will be referenced in most, if not all reviews for ""Friends With Benefits"". I, admittedly, didn't hate that movie. But it's a piece of dreck compared to this one.It's a typical hour-and-forty-five minute romantic comedy. However, it's kind of this generation's ""When Harry Met Sally"". It's ""When Dylan Met Jamie"". The two leads are so great with each other, one the yin to the other's yang. You can tell that they would be conceivable as a real couple. They aren't the perfect, immediately compatible couple that usually headlines a movie such as this. Justin Timberlake keeps proving that he's a better actor than a lot of pop stars. He's insanely likable in this movie. Mila Kunis had a smaller, haunting kind of role in ""Black Swan"", where I thought she was above average. She's really allowed to shine in this one, bringing life to a character that could have been much less. The attitude of this movie is sometimes gritty, always quick, witty, and urban. It makes good use of the time it's given. It acknowledges the ridiculous romantic comedies that it could have been. Jamie and her friend, at one point, walk by a poster for Katherine Heigl's ""The Ugly Truth"", and says ""Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!"". A fake in-movie-movie, with Rashida Jones and Jason Segel, is meant to emphasize how ridiculous most romantic comedies are. Great stuff.Another thing this one has that ""No Strings Attached"" didn't have is a great supporting cast. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamie's mother, a hippie lush who is really damn funny. Woody Harrelson also does a good job as Dylan's unapologetically bold and hilarious gay boss. He gets kudos for not making a gay character a stereotype. Richard Jenkins plays Dylan's Alzheimer's stricken father, and Jenna Elfman plays his sister. They add to the quick and zippy feel of the movie. Cameos by Emma Stone and Andy Samberg are always welcome, too.While some probably won't like this one as much as I did, I liked all of its characters. I felt like each character was well-developed and interesting. The quick writing is what makes it better than a lot of similar movies, but when everything in it is mashed together, the whole package is very good. I look forward to watching it again.Grade: A-",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

HK Neo Reviews: Friends with Benefits,"Whatever it is that made Natalie Portman's No String Attached worked out fine, the same cannot be said about Friends with Benefits. The movie just does not cut it and the chemistry is just not there. Not to say the least, I am no admirer of Justin Timberlake's acting talent and apart from Social Network; the lad has zero acting ability and should take some acting classes. Despite being picture perfect, Mila Kunis does not add much to her role apart from being beautiful for beautiful sake. At the end of the day, Friends with Benefits does not work because it doesn't walk the talk.

Tepid story.,"It is a shame that such a wonderfully talented actress as Mila Kunis is so shabbily and tastelessly showcased in such a tepid and empty cinematic product. Hollywood can do better than that! And this is the case after her spectacular performance in The Black Swan. Showing Ms. Kunis prancing around in her undies is really sad. She is a wonderful actress and comedian, not a sex object. And the story itself is pure fluff meant to showcase the male lead, which is really ludicrous. How can Mila Kunis be so grievously miscast? Ms. Kunis is a powerful actress, who has a dominating screen presence, yet she plays second fiddle to the male lead who showcases his body. The story itself is sheer sentimentality covered by a veneer of trash-talking language meant to create an impression of being chic and cool, which is totally out of sinc with the characters themselves who are so shallow that their coolness is a sham. Toward the end of movie Ms. Kunis is finally allowed to display some of her dramatic skills, but it is too little too late as the the damage has been done and the movie comes to a quick and improbable end. The problem with showcasing a male lead in this movie is that the audience is asked to accept the premise that the male actor is more attractive than the female lead and therefore deserves more attention, but in this movie, that definitely does not work. Just like with Pretty Woman, this movie should have showcased the female lead and without making her act like a tramp. Mila Kunis is talented and beautiful; let her be the star.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More Evidence There Are No Shortcuts.,"Young urban professionals Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake become friends after Kunis (a corporate headhunter) recruits Timberlake (a high-class magazine editor) to New York City to take a job with magazine giant GQ (Gentleman's Quarterly). Their friendship blossoms as both are discontented with failed romances. Thus they decide to have a physical relationship which is meant to avoid complications and complexities of would-be deeper emotional bonds. Of course we all know this will be a recipe for all kinds of turmoil and conflict which will ultimately develop between our two leads. ""Friends With Benefits"" makes itself out to be a revolutionary addition to the romantic genre, but in the end it is just as predictable as dozens of its type. Kunis and Timberlake make for an interesting pairing, but their chemistry is more sporadic than it is sizzling. Richard Jenkins gives one of his finest performances as Timberlake's father who is experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, but his appearance (along with daughter Jenna Elfman) is too late and really becomes too much of a side-story that the audience does not necessarily need (I think I would have rather had a film where Jenkins' character was the focus). Patricia Clarkson is loopy and in the way as Kunis' 1970s-obsessed mother who throws out everything verbally except words of wisdom. She is almost like Kunis' daughter instead of the other way around. Also along for the ride is gay sports editor Woody Harrelson who comes around Timberlake with would-be hilarious one-liners and distorted views about relationships and life in general. Harrelson's character, like Clarkson's, was probably not needed at all in the final analysis. Tiring clichés, an interminable running time, weakly-drawn characters, and stupid gimmicks (the recurring flash mobs in particular) cause ""Friends With Benefits"" to collapse by its final resolution. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Have you had a friend with benefit? 8/10,"A film which should suit any age. Romance and comedy which is the perfect combination. Most people in live have attempted to have a friend with benefit, and this film tells you why its difficult to keep it. With the sexy actor Justin Timberlake and beautiful Mila Kunis, you watch two people who start of having a bit of fun, end up falling for each other. It's not all about the sex, a part of Dylan's (Timberlake) live has a secret which can relate to those who are also struggling with someone Alzheimer's.

"Loud, dirty, sexy and good.","This is the second one of it's kind I have seen this year, with this kind I mean friends- having-sex-just-for-fun-but-wanting-more kind of flicks, I think both of them are equally good, but in each their own way.In No strings attached with Natalie Portman as the leading female, it is more subtle and sweet, but this has a more becoming Mila Kunis approach, loud, dirty, sexy and good. So this has a few other view points, and is essentially the opposite of the other, except they both have the same theme and they more or less end the same way.In this the side characters are way better, especially Woody Harrelson is great, he is a very fun homosexual male, not to much in any way, but enough to make his point and a lot of good remarks. But it is also nice to see Jenna Elfman again, it's been a while and even though this doesn't give her the biggest scenes, she does very well and has a nice role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly Good. Restores Faith in Romantic Comedies. Worth Seeing,"""Friends with Benefits"" has a lightning fast, very smart script, it moves like a limousine, and it features another stunningly moving character turn by Richard Jenkins. It's good enough that it revives hope for that troubled genre, the Romantic Comedy. It's worth seeing, more than once.""Friends with Benefits"" surprised me. I don't understand why Justin Timberlake is famous – what is remarkable about him, really? – and Mila Kunis does nothing for me. We live in the age of decline of the Romantic Comedy. ""Friends with Benefits"" was not the forgettable, rote, mass- produced studio product I expected. It was actually really good.""Friends with Benefits"" began really fast, and I found myself bobbing along on the script's energy. I noticed how much I was enjoying it and I kept waiting for the film to drop the ball, to let me down, to betray itself, to fall into predictable clichéd traps. That didn't happen for quite a while, and the film's failings were slow in coming, minor, and didn't ruin the film.What ""Friends with Benefits"" does right it does very, very right. The script is amazing. There are jokes that you'd need some literacy and maturity to understand. They fly right by, no pause for the viewer to laugh, or to google the references, before the next one-liner or trenchant observation rolls down the chute. Our culture has been so dumbed down that hearing a joke that one would have to have some knowledge of history or culture or even just the front page of the newspaper to understand amazed and gratified me.The movie's strong point is that it is so fast; that's also a bit of a weak point. Legendary director Frank Capra said that ""sometimes your story has to stop and you just let your audience look at your people. You want your audience to like themthese scenes are quite important to a film. When the audience rests and they look at the people, they begin to smile."" ""Friends with Benefits"" is so frenetic, it never creates a memorable screen moment where Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) do nothing but look movie-star lovely and get under our skin.Richard Jenkins works some powerful mojo. He's a character actor, older, bland-looking and bald, but in every movie I've seen him in lately, especially so in ""Eat Pray Love,"" he seems to be visiting from a different, better movie, and I want, after the movie I'm watching is over, to watch the superior film from which Jenkins has visited. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Jenkins plays Dylan's father who is suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's. He is funny, profound, arresting and truly lovable. What is Jenkins doing? Whatever it is, more actors should do it.Jenna Elfman, Patricia Clarkson, Woody Harrelson, Nolan Gould and Masi Oka are all very, very good in supporting roles. Clarkson, as Jamie's mother, delivers a liner about Jamie's father that made me laugh out loud.On the surface, ""Friends with Benefits"" looks like too many other, lesser movies. It's not. It's a really good, worthwhile film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Don't bother with this,"Alright, just bear in mind that I admire and respect Timberlake as a singer, musician and now comedian, his acting/jokes on Saturday Night Live are actually pretty funny, so I had high expectations for this film.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Timberlake's acting in this is weak, his jokes are not funny, and his character is just boring, which makes it a bit tedious to watch.On the other hand, though she wasn't really that funny, Mila Kunis' acting seems to make up for her co-star's, as her performance is way more convincing, her character is light-hearted and spontaneous which was nice to watch .The directing and editing of this wasn't good at all. The trailer leads one to believe that this is a hilarious film, and indeed I laughed at the jokes in the trailer. But whilst watching the film, there seemed to have been long pauses, which made the jokes not as witty or even funny. The trailer's editing is indeed much better than the actual film's. However, the jokes coming from Woody Harrelson and Patricia Clarkson were worth watching, and almost compensated for the lack of humour from the central characters, but I still wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hypocritic oath,"This is a romantic comedy on the candid side that attempts to evenly round up both the female/male viewer by throwing out some honest, self-depreciating jokes about the sometimes awkward and frustrating aspects of what either side goes through when dating and attempting to secure a steady relationship. ""Friends with Benefits"" is an unchallenging film that comes across more as a spoof of other contrived rom-coms while still managing to fall into a few of the trappings and part of the formula itself the more involved it gets.This is by no means quintessential and it's hard to say if it tackles the promiscuous question any better than ""No Strings Attached"" as they don't always take themselves very seriously but are more for brisk and painless recreation instead. ""Friends (with Benefits),"" the indy flick from 2009, answered a little more about the debatable question. The main difference between the recent ""NSA,"" is it had one side who felt more attached than the other and previously they were more acquaintances than friends. All three seem like different experiences in their own little ways, but where both ""FwB"" 2011 and ""NSA"" borrowed off of ""F (wB)"" 2009 was they all start off as silly comedies and then revert back to a similar rom-com template, not to mention all boil down to emotions that everyone was trying to suppress. Now that a template is officially established, hopefully this is the last of 'em.This has a very loosely laid out plot that instead of going for layer upon layer keeps it simple by concentrating on character development, leaving ample room to evaluate emotions and coming with little recognizable patterns throughout in the meantime that looks at their on-the-fly lives in the city and charismatic friends and family members. There's the premise: they go through unserious and unreasonable dates, then meet through business--Dylan (Timberlake) is from L.A., Jamie (Kunis) is from N.Y., now he moves to N.Y.--they become close friends and, of course, they're done with the emotional side of sex, hence they should be friends with benefits. Problem solved! Not exactly. Both are still romantics at heart even though they try and hide their emotions so they don't get hurt again with Jamie being a blunt, cursing New Yorker, and Dylan avoiding talking about private issues when confronted. They try and keep it cut and dry or as a ""tennis match,"" but if it wasn't inevitable enough start to grow onto each other. They want to keep the friendship, so both date outside but confusion sets in if they should go back and further the connective bond they had.From what at first has them yelling out calculated directions of how to please one another like a business transaction, this turns into some believable chemistry between Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake with some spontaneity thrown in to give them some natural interaction. This comes with lots of undergarment shots, a few butts, as well as plenty of bedroom banter that only holds back in showing the full detail. Shaun White shows up as the token and somewhat pointless antagonist who's nice to everyone else but chides on Dylan because he had a thing with Jamie prior. Woody Harrelson plays the proud and macho gay friend Tommy who's got a thing for sports. Harrelson tries a little too hard, but still manages to keep one's undivided attention whenever he enters the screen just for what he'll say next. Patricia Clarkson--from ""Easy A""--plays Jamie's irresponsible mom Lorna who goes through more men than floss and has some pretty humorous lines despite not being the perfect role model.Everybody seems to be checked out when it comes to steady relationships, including Dylan's father (Richard Jenkins) who's going through Alzheimers but wishes the mother was still around and that he actually went after a former crush. This causes Jamie and Dylan to reevaluate what they had, despite the flaws and hangups, and the film from having rapid edits and quick quips in the beginning starts to eventually ramble on and turn a tad bit long so it can avoid falling into a cliché and sappy closer, which it nearly does so anyway. Who are they fooling? Even though some of the humor and serious subjects don't always mix at this stage, it was still somewhat mushy, easy fun that's perfect enjoyment for a date night or a relaxing nothing-to-do day. ""FwB"" doesn't necessarily answer any questions as it shows more than it tells, but when it concludes still comes with a few relating puns and jabs at what people go through just to find the right person, or who that right person actually will be outside of our preconceived notions. I guess there's hope even for the ones who want to cut to the chase and eliminate all those courtship rules.

Starts off alright but ends up being something that is not anything special,"After watching the movie ""No String Attached"" I wondered what would be different about this movie since both movies share similar premise. The dialogue goes in a direction where it tries a bit too hard to be hip. The movie starts out alright but it goes in a really cliché direction after it makes fun to cliché romantic comedies. What it does is bash on the old romantic comedies that goes in a cliché direction but it copies all the recent romantic comedies. It seemed the two main characters tries to show off how laid back and cool they are, which gets sort of annoying after a while. There is just so many today's wannabe hip cliché stuff crammed into this and it just doesn't seem all that natural. The chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis was not believable. I would have preferred Jessica Biel who didn't get the role because of Mila Kunis. Personally am not really a fan of Mila Kunis the chemistry just seemed weak. But tries to atone for it by putting a bunch of sex scenes in there. Personally I would have preferred Jessica Biel in those scenes.5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Standard Rom-Com with Charming Leads,"Friends with Benefits does not redefine the tried and tested rom-com formula. It is pretty much the same as any of the other movies from this genre. However, the lead actors Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have a mesmerizing chemistry which makes the movie really watchable. The writing is crisp and witty. The story is about two people who decide to have sex without getting in a relationship. However, they eventually develop feelings for each other without admitting it. The film separates itself from the bunch by being self-conscious as the leads repeatedly mention the fact that their story is similar to a Hollywood movie. However, some of the melodrama seems contrived when everything seemed to be going perfectly well between the two. Mila Kunis shines in this movie and is extremely likable.

Film Without Benefits,"'Friends With Benefits' provides an all-you-can-eat buffet of RomComs' usual failings - a hackneyed narrative arc, shallow characters, a feeble dilemma, formulaic 'witty' dialog, wooden acting and facile conclusion.After encountering dating setbacks with previous partners, two acquaintances decide on a friends-with-benefits arrangement. During Jamie and Dylan's subsequent couplings, instead of whispering sweet nothings into their partner's ear, they exchange love-making instructions in a contrived unromantic manner. Subplots involving parental neglect and Alzheimers are given a similarly glib treatment. Timberlake and Kunis struggle against all the artifice, but are unable to achieve anything better than low-level irritation. Needless to say, Jamie and Dylan's quick fix turns into a problem when they discover feelings for one another. This predictable development leads to a manufactured estrangement, and the tiresome pair are obliged to muddle their way to an unsatisfying climax.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity""","""Contemporarily Relevant: The Sex Buddy Disparity"" ""No Strings Attached 2""? No, it is another film about a couple of people trying to make an emotionless relationship based around sex work; Natalie Portman's ""Black Swan"" costar just happens to be in it. Director Will Gluck's (""Easy A"") ""Friends With Benefits"" is a better disparity of the sex buddy concept than the aforementioned because of its array of genuine characters starting with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Dyan (Justin Timberlake, ""The Social network"") works as an art director of an online media company (my dream job) in California and has just been dumped by his girl friend Kayla (Emma Stone, ""Easy A""). The other player, Jamie (Mila Kunis, ""Book of Eli"") is a headhunter in New York that has also been dumped by her boyfriend Quincy (Andy Samberg, ""I Love You Man""). Dyan was ""emotionally unavailable"" while Jamie was ""emotionally damaged"" making them the perfect match when Jamie meets Dylan at the airport to facilitate his job offer with a nation renowned magazine. Dylan inevitably takes the job and with one friend in New York to turn to, Dylan and Jamie become really close. As the sexual tension builds, they make fun of a cliché Jason Segel (""Bad Teacher"") and Rashida Jones (""The Social Network"") rom-com and embark on an emotion free series ofsexual escapades. The relationship becomes much more as they begin to open up to each other transforming the happy-go-lucky comedy into a dramatic (but not overly dramatic) conclusion with splendid performances by Richard Jenkins (""Hall Pass""), Patricia Clarkson (""Easy A"") and Woody Harrelson (""Zombieland"").The coolest part of the film is that everything from its lingo to the character's jobs and even the credits give the film a relevant contemporary feel. Also, while the characters are goofy, they have a lot of heart making the film's conclusion clichely fulfilling and allowing the cast to fluently connect with the audience. The chemistry between all of which makes the movie feel unscripted, making Timberlake and Kunis into a naturally perfect on screen matchup. Timberlake and Kunis must step aside, as Richard Jenkins runs away with his authentic portrayal of a man suffering from Alzheimer's that will make you laugh and cry (especially for one like me who works at an Alzheimer's and Dementia home).Everything bad about the film is self-explanatory because if you are expecting a genre defining rom-com without a predictable ending, you have been misled. While, Director Glick follows suit of ""Easy A"", making fun of the genre, in the end there really isn't much more he could do. The genre is fixed, and can be very repetitive leaving too much room for pointless moments. ""Friends With Benefits"" seems to avoid space filling jokes most of the time, but still lets moments like the unnecessary Sean White cameo overstay their welcome.Romantic Comedies have not changed much at all over the years, but if you are looking for a film that is current and has praiseworthy actors embodying genuine characters, ""Friends With Benefits"" is the fun and true solution.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pleasantly surprised at the chemistry and comedy,"Without specific spoilers I'll tell you this: the end isn't a shocker, however I was pleasantly surprised over all.A friend's girl brought this over for movie night, and I'm always interested in something new.

It made me think that the actors were somehow tricked into signing up for the movie, because no one in their right mind would volunteer for such a lousy script.

Its a kind of (movies) magic,"What a nice job director Will Gluck has done here...

And it really is a compliment because the movie is a comedy pace so predictable from the title itself, and didn't takes any damage from that. The support roles are at the same level of the leading ones. I think a challenge of this kind of stories is always empathy, and everyone does the job is this matter, and they certainly do well. This is one movie i will have in my shelf, well located beside ""Doc Hollywood"" ""Pretty Woman"" and ""My Cousin Vinny"" and it means no less than worth to watch and enjoy.

They come in Twos,"Ever noticed how the box office always seems to release films in two? Confusing cinema goers making them rack their brains trying to decide on a film!Here are a few examples to prove my point:Killers vs. Knight & Day (2010)Dante's Peak vs. Volcano (1997)The Prestige vs. the Illusionist (2006)A Bugs Life vs. Antz (1998)Deep Impact vs. Armageddon (1998)Coincidence? I think not! But from looking at those titles, there's always one that's better quality than the other. And if you're trying to decide which one is worth your time. Let me help you make that decision.Both 'No Strings Attached' & 'Friends With Benefits' are typical and predictable, definitely something for the ladies. Both portray a modern female character who are empowering and career focused & don't want a serious relationship. But we can all guess what happens at the end, women hormones and emotions take over.But if we're going to compare the pair, 'No Strings attached' takes the cake hands down. The film's script takes on a much wittier approach and gave me a few chuckles and giggles. At the same time there were scenes that got me a little choked up. It was a good mix of comedy and romance like the genre suggests.Not to mention Kutcher and Portman who were portraying these typical characters, seem to have more chemistry and didn't make my skin crawl. Even the older wiser character in both films, played by Kline (Adam's Father) had more of a distinct characteristic and was flawed and funny as oppose to the 'Friends with Benefits' counterpart played by Clarkson (Jamie's mother) who's character failed to even resonate in my memory.'Friends with Benefits' is a Justin Timberlake fans only film. Mila and Justin made a good effort, but if you're looking for a film with a typical plot that would make you laugh and cry. You'd be better off checking out Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' attempt.Even though the 'No Strings attached' tag line appears to be directly ripping off 'Friends with Benefits'.

Friends with Benefits - 2.5 Stars,"Romantic-comedies have become such a static routine in Hollywood that even the two lead characters in ""Friends with Benefits"" have memorized its blueprint. Earlier scenes present us with mild optimism when we learn that our impending couple is considerably aware of the genre's most common clichés. But their advantage leads to no benefit when they go right ahead and implement the things they were formerly trying to rebuke.By the movie's unsatisfying end, we get the feeling that the purpose of the references was to inform us that what we are watching is no different from the rest of its pack. Instead of utilizing its awareness as a stepping stone for improvement, ""Friends with Benefits"" lingers in mediocrity by idly pre-apologizing to the faults it plans to commit. What's the point?What the movie lacks in screenplay is made up for in its cast. Reader, you have no idea how refreshed I was to see a rom-com that isn't starring either Katherine Heigl or Ashton Kutcher. These two actors have spent so much time within the territory of their preferred genre that their careers have gone from complacent to comatose. Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher are to romantic comedies as Milla Jovovich and Jason Statham are to action movies. A personal note of mine that may also come in handy in your future is this: Movies starring Heigl or Kutcher must be so bad that only Heigl and Kutcher and would agree to star in them.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/friends-with-benefits-movie- review/",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fornication is NOT cool,"I was very intrigued with Mila Kunis since I saw her in ""Black Swan."" Her portrayal of the new ballet dancer that threatened Natalie Portman was spot-on and riveting. I knew I would like to see her again in other films. And so, even as romantic comedies are not exactly my cup of tea, I watched ""Friends with Benefits.""The movie started very well with Jamie (Mila Kunis) and Dylan (Justin Timberlake) breaking up with their respective SO's. That paved the way for big-time blogger Dylan to meet professional head-hunter Jamie in New York City so she can convince him to accept a job as an editor in GQ Magazine. The situation devolves from a nice smart friendship into an unconscionable purely sexual relationship. Of course, the rest of the film goes as the typical rom-com formula goes: boy meets girl, they fight and separate, then they get back together.While Mila Kunis is so attractive and bubbly in her portrayal of Jamie, I was disappointed to see her in this kind of loose character. Still, Mia Kunis is the best part of this movie. I am a fan of this girl. On the other hand, Justin Timberlake seems to be playing the same type of guy in all his films. The Justin here seems to be the same cocky, fast- talking, sleazy Justin in the Facebook movie!This film has got some remarkable supporting characters which divert our attention. Richard Jenkins as Dylan's dad with Alzheimer's was good, but seems out of place in this story. Jenna Elfman as Dylan's understanding sister was sweet. Patricia Clarkson as Jamie's hippy liberated mother was funny. Woody Harrelson as GQ's Sports Editor was hilarious in his few scenes.For me, only the snappy dialogs and the perkiness of Mila Kunis save this movie. While I know that this type of ""sex-only"" arrangement exists in these hedonistic times, I do not particularly like to see this immoral situation ""glamorized"" on screen.

Movie with no benefits,Movie is very predictable and has the same old story most of movies had. In movie there is mostly conversation between two people trying to make things go their own way without any compromising.

Paint by number,"It is very difficult to do romantic comedy in a post-romantic, post-everything era. Even without a clue about the plot, you can easily imagine each turn of the way.Start with meet-cute, which must be OTT unrealistic.

"Ehh, it was OK","Yes, I know it's a chick flick. But on a cross country flight, I had to pick something to watch on the airplane seat screen, and already saw Moneyball the first couple hours of the flight, so I gave this a try. I can't stand Justin Timberlake, and quite honestly he seems like another gay guy unsuccessfully trying to pass off as a straight guy, but Mila Kunis is still a hottie, so at least there's some eye candy. The movie is supposed to rip on romantic comedies, but quickly becomes the very thing it rips on. It gets quite predictable, and anyone in the audience could have written the ending for it. Also it's more than obvious that a few L.A. locations were trying to be passed off as New York (like the airport scenes). Overall not the worst movie ever, but pretty much forgettable.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A formula that works,"Friends With Benefits is a genre film and it isn't ashamed of it. It uses every cliché in the book and it uses them to full effect, better than any rom-com I've seen in ages. In an age where the classic rom-com is all but dead, when hipsterish films like (500) Days of Summer subvert every rule of the genre to hell and back for the sake of being edgy and subversive, Friends With Benefits is just self-aware and subversive enough to feel like it was made in 2011 and not twenty years earlier, but even if they make a snarky remark while doing it about the lack of realism in this sort of film, they still do everything you know - and hope - they will. The amazing thing is, it works. This comedy inspires true catharsis in the viewer and reminds us all why these clichés and rules were created in the first place - long before the genre turned into the bad, sticky joke that it is.A lot of the credit should go to the cast, of course; because a film like this could never work if you're not rooting for the two leads to end up together. Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake, it should be noted, are not in any way great actors. When each one is alone on the screen, they fail to impress, and when they interact with any member of the excellent supporting cast - Richard Jenkins, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and even Emma Stone - Kunis and Timberlake are always the less interesting and less magnetic half of the scene. And yet - when they're together, they have an incredible and natural chemistry, one that only the great couples of the silver screen could ever achieve, and they make even the sex scenes, that could have been awkward with other actors, feel natural and pleasant. They makes for a real and likable couple that you want to root for, even relate to, so much so that you can set aside your cynicism and forget that the scenario would have been very different with two people who, well, don't look like Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.Most of all, though, it's the screenplay that makes Friends With Benefits work against all odds. It shows real wit and understanding of the characters' age-group, and doesn't try too hard to be hip and modern that it alienates the viewers and the actors. It's radiant with love for New York City, turning it into as major a player in the story as the lead characters, giving the story a strong sense of location and reality. Most impressive of all is the dialog during the sex scenes, which is more candid, realistic and hilarious than you would ever expect from a rom-com. Where other films would stop short when these scenes and fade to black and blast up the music, Friends With Benefits doesn't really show what people having sex look like - it's still a mainstream American comedy, after all - but it does show us how they act, and it's extremely accurate, avoiding any manner of idealization or romanticization and as a result is very relatable and as a result, very funny.I'm a heterosexual male. I don't, by definition, like romantic comedies. But I liked this one. I understood where the story was going about ten minutes in, I knew exactly what the characters were going to do, but I'll be damned if I didn't really want them to do it. And I enjoyed it all the while. Friends With Benefits won't change the world, it's highly likely that I won't remember it two years from now. But if, ten years from now, it'll pop up on TV, it'll jog a pleasant memory, and I'll watch it all over again. And it'll be two hours I'm sure to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Surprisingly Entertaining! A good watch!,"*Quick Review*Personally, I don't particularly like Romantic comedies. I think they're riddled with cliches, not very funny and just an unpleasant viewing experience. I thought I was going into another cheesey comedy (which to be honest it kind of is), but I actually really enjoyed this one.I thought the cast was great, Timberlake played his role well and I thought he was overall a funny character. I had watched him in The Social Network, so I knew he was good, but I hadn't seen him in a comedy, so I was curious to see how he would play out. I thought Kunis was great and you could feel a real chemistry between her and Timberlake. They both worked well together.The plot is well worked at the start, and I really enjoyed the first hour. The last 40 minutes were ok, but I felt they were a bit of a drag and I was starting to fade in and out of the movie.Over all, I think that yes, this is a typical romantic comedy, but it is funny and it plays out well. The two main characters are both likeable and fit their roles nicely. I would definitely recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Too much music ruined it for me. I believe it would have been a relaxing movie without upbeat music at every damn 4-5 minutes. I couldn't finished it, unfortunately.","One of the things that for me (and for others, I'm sure) can really ruin a movie, it's too much music. I mean, seriously, every 4-5 minutes there is an annoying song in the background. I tried, I've thought that it will end after the very beginning, when characters just get to know each other, but nope. I couldn't stand to watch it, so I just haven't finished it, well, actually, I barely started it, cause after 20 minutes, I just gave up. I have fast forwarded, to see if there is any hope. No, still music everywhere. It's not only annoying, but it makes hard for the movie to be taken seriously. Ok, it's a romantic comedy, but still, it's bound to have some seriousness throughout. Very hard to see it like that, with eardrums being bothered all the time.I know that the comparison with No Strings Attached is unavoidable, having the same theme and being released in the same year. That one was the first that I have seen in the day where I've decided that I want to watch both movies. Comparing to this one, that one was light, a little fun here and there, and with music only when it was necessary, exactly what I have needed in a boring afternoon. Then I started Friends with Benefits. Big mistake. It's like you are watching a trailer that is never finishing. Lucky for me that I have seen it now, in 2024, at home, and not in a movie theatre. What a waste of time would that have been!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not a bad ""remake"" of When Harry Met Sally","Well, it's obviously not a remake of When Harry Met Sally, but it's impossible not to make the comparison. There was even a straight homage/reference to Nora Ephron in one scene.I haven't liked many new movies coming out of Hollywood in this millennium and have therefore not watched many lately, I'd rather been catching up on the classics I haven't seen. I watched this one without any expectations and it caught me by surprise, it had a heart which very few new movies have. The two characters were actually pretty likable and that's a key factor to this kind of movie. There's no point watching this kind of movie if you don't like the characters.I read a few reviews stating Kunis and Timberlake didn't have chemistry, but I strongly disagree. I think this couple here is a real pleasure to watch. I've previously seen Timberlake only in The Open Road - one of the only movies I have actually stopped watching in the middle - the acting was just horrible. Here the story is totally different, Timberlake makes a great performance. Kunis has made a great career, something one might not have expected after the 70s Show.The writing is nice for the most part, the dialog works. What I had a small problem with were a few dialogs that went ""under the belt"" so to say. It's a pity, since this is somewhat classy movie, even the sex scenes were done in a kind of tasty fashion. We don't need to know where someone's finger went or why it's difficult to pee at a certain occasion.The dialog and pace is at times a tad too fast, resulting in bad editing. In a few occasions there is a clear jump cut, where a characters position changes noticeably between two consecutive images.In any case, this was a bit of comeback for Hollywood in my eyes. It seems they can still create likable characters after all. Being the age where I remember When Harry Met Sally as a new movie, it's a great achievement that I could actually enjoy the ""same movie"" made for a new generation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Had potential but disappointing,"This film had such potential. Mila Kunis was adorable. Her character was clever and plucky. Spoiler alert: I loved the subplot involving the family in California (especially the father suffering Alzheimer's) . The characterization of both hero and heroine was well done. Their personal growth and the inevitable romance made this a cute romantic comedy story.However, what ruined this movie for me (and I'm no prude) was the explicit sexual dialog and scenes. It did not move the story forward. It was offensive and disgusting. What saved the movie for me was the scene with his father in the airport restaurant.

"Entertaining, even if that's almost entirely thanks to Mila Kunis","Entertaining, even if that's almost entirely thanks to Mila Kunis.'Friends with Benefits' has surprisingly more to it than I would've predicted, it's not just about sex, sex and sex. That does take up large portions of the film admittedly, but there's more heart to it - especially with Justin Timberlake's character.I like Timberlake (Dylan) as an actor, but this is one of his weaker showings in my opinion. He doesn't give a negative performance and doesn't lower the quality of the film, I just felt this wasn't one of his best.Kunis (Jamie) is terrific, as usual it seems. Her performance is very enjoyable, she portrays the personality of her character nicely. She definitely keeps things moving, even if Timberlake's role gets more depth.Woody Harrelson is amusing as Tommy, while Richard Jenkins gives the film a touching side with his role as Mr. Harper.

Crisp dialogue makes this RomCom quite enjoyable but...,"... Friends with Benefits can't run fast enough into the very clichés it wants to make fun of. It is like a producer is steering the project into the tightly packaged product zone while he had writers with more creativity than was allowed/needed.The crisp dialogue is really what makes the movie stand out IMO since I would not say that the chemistry between Milla Kunis and Justin Timberlake is more than adequate. Actually the setback of this crisp dialogue is the fast delivery and the impression of having fast delivery puppets rather than fine characters. That is a directorial issue: how to keep a fine comedic pace without letting down the characters in stand-up gig mode? I appreciated the script was somewhat original in the background but the LA sequence, which should have been the high point, is a ridiculous let down full of stock characters/situations and comedic action bogged down in the middle. From there ending is painfully dragging its feet.Not bad, has fine creative inroads, but never quite makes it above the level of a very conservatively clichéd RomCom.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
@kraynu @renukantam,"When SATC ended in 2004, I, like everyone else felt the insane need for a little more Carrie, a little more Samantha, a little more Charlotte and a little more Miranda. 2008, Michael Patrick King and the cast and crew of Sex and the City delivered a film that not only filled in the gap of four years away from our screens, they told us the story of what came next.The film itself is LONG, surprisingly long, and with this extended edition we're talking about an extra 10-15 minutes of unseen footage. The additional footage makes perfect sense for hardcore fans, these additional scenes are not only at times funny but they extend an offering of extra ""hope"" and sometimes ""explanation"" of scenes that were previously concluded.The TWO disc special edition is a perfect trade in for anyone who rushed out to purchase the film when it released in stores. On your second disc you will find an amazing conversation between show Creator Michael Patrick King and Executive producer / Star, Sarah Jessica Parker. Together they discuss everything from the process of character development - to fashion decisions with Pat Field. You will also find three additional scenes that did NOT make it into the extended cut of the film which are alternate takes on what you DID see make the final cut.Overall I rated this product ***** stars because it is a collector's DREAM to carry this film as a personal memento of appreciation, fandom and hope. Without plot give away - I will simply say this ....

Timberlake just doesn't have the skills to hold his own with someone like Kunis!,"'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another movie about friends trying to stay friends while involving sex in their relationship and hoping not to complicate things. This one features yet another talented and high caliber actress (Mila Kunis) coming off a critically praised film ('BLACK SWAN'), in a critically acclaimed performance, and is paired in a lowbrow 'f--- buddy' film with a much less talented actor (Justin Timberlake). This one is slightly better than Kunis's 'BLACK SWAN' costar's ('NO STRINGS ATTACHED'), despite lacking the presence of the great Natalie Portman. Kunis is great in the film and does have a certain amount of chemistry with the lightweight Timberlake but the movie as a whole is still very predictable and extremely light on laughs.Kunis and Timberlake play Jamie and Dylan, Jamie is an Executive Recruiter for a New York based job agency and Dylan is an art director for a company in Los Angeles. Both have had their fair share of failed relationships and are ready to give up on love all together. When Jamie tries to recruit Dylan for a GQ art directing job in New York City the two immediately hit it off. Dylan takes the job and the two quickly become best friends. One day while watching a romantic comedy together (starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones) the two come up with the idea of adding sex to their relationship without any of it's romantic entanglements. This of course leads to many complications especially when they begin falling for each other.The film is directed by Will Gluck (who also directed the critically acclaimed hit 'EASY A' in 2010, and it's star Emma Stone has a cameo in this film) and it was written by Gluck, Keith Merryman, David A. Newman and Harley Peyton. It's adequately directed and the relationship aspect of the film is believable. The problem with the film is it's just not funny. Kunis has by far the most laughs and brings a lot of energy to her performance but Timberlake almost sucks all the energy out of the film at the same time. His line delivery is pretty bad and he just doesn't make a good leading man. He's been fine is supporting comedic performances but when he has to play it straight he just doesn't have the skills to hold his own with someone like Kunis. Like I said the two do have some chemistry together but it's not enough to really make the film work.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"I Hate Most Romantic Comedies, I Think I Hate This One The Most","Pros:
1. There are some cute and heart-warming moments, like when Dylan (Justin Timberlake) sings along to Jump by Kriss Kross to make Jamie (Mila Kunis) laugh.Cons:
1. Makes fun of corny Hollywood romantic comedies, but ends up being one itself with most of the same tropes.2. The soundtrack, though it contains some great songs, is incessant. You can't go 30 seconds without a song blasting out.3. Woody Harrelson (Tommy) is absolutely wasted; he's just there to be the horny gay best friend to Dylan.4. There's forced emotional drama with the insertion of Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins) who has dementia. The character doesn't need to be there, and if removed, nothing would change. As someone who's late grandad had dementia, I don't appreciate the disease being used as a cheap prop to induce sympathy from the audience.5. Most of the jokes fall so flat, that the only way to understand they were even jokes, is to watch the characters laugh.6. The director clearly loves New York City and Los Angeles, because all throughout the movie he can't resist putting in lines of dialogue singing their praises. This film serves as a de facto advertising campaign for both cities, and it's just annoying and distracting.7. At best, Mila Kunis and Justine Timberlake deliver average performances, but they're stale and boring for most of the time. Neither of them have the charisma to be leading actors which leaves you disengaged from the film.8. As usual, the movie pins the lions share of the blame onto the man, with the female getting almost no blame.9. Shaun White can't act, and his cameos are just bizarre.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This tries hard not to be a cliché but I'm pretty sure I've seen it already,"I found this movie super annoying initially and almost shut it off. It did start to grow on me at about the half-way mark though when the storyline got more serious and family members were introduced to take the edge off. It think it also took me that long to acclimatise to the insistent, trying too hard to be funny, ongoing (& going) dialogue Mila Kunis kept spouting. And I like this girl too, but jeez.This is another predictable rom-com with a predictable storyline even though it tries not go that route, but (didn't I see this exact same plot in No Strings Attached?) In this version we follow two friends who try to add sex to their relationship without all the, well, strings. This idea fails (shocker) as Jamie and Dylan find it difficult to keep their emotions at bay.While this movie tried hard not to be cliché it failed.

Friends with Benefits follows the standard rom-com formula but with a slight twist.,"The romance is pretty much diminished by the physical act of casual sexual intercourse. There is more sex in this than films like 50 Shades of Grey and Nymphomaniac, films designed to showcase this physical act of love. Problem is, this film is so bland and formulaic that its not innovative in the slightest. You've seen it a hundred times. A couple promise to just engage in casual sex, what is known as friends with benefits, but naturally start developing feelings for each other. You can coat its core with layers of harmless fun all you want, it still remains the same. Ironically, it attempts to deconstruct the genre. There is a pivotal scene where the couple watch a rom-com and distinguish typical elements that make a 'Hollywood' film and the negative connotations it represents. Pop music at the credits, unrealistic eternal love and the endless amount of clichés. I honestly thought the film would then utilise these and flip the genre on its side...but no. Ironically, it follows the exact same formula that makes a 'Hollywood' rom-com. Is that supposed to be funny? No. If anything, it is wasted potential. It's strongest asset is the script which has various humorous moments and brings plenty of charisma to our lead characters who are played by the irresistible Mila Kunis and mediocre Justin Timberlake. The person I was watching this film with has memorised the script...by heart...indicating that it sticks with certain people. Just not me. Kunis is great, sure all I hear is Meg from Family Guy but she played the role well. Timberlake cannot act. Sorry, but I just dislike the guy. Everything he does feels forced and uncomfortable to watch, and occasionally Kunis suffers the same fate. Like watching two pieces of cardboard trying to become a work of art but actually disintegrates and biodegrades into the Earth. The supporting cast were instantly forgettable.

"The entertainment benefit is large in this fine film; however, the landscape of the romcom is changing and some will not like it","Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is a dot.com designer living in the City of Angels near his ailing father (Richard Jenkins) and his sister, Annie (Jenna Elfman) and her young son. However, he is so talented at his job that he is soon ""head-hunted"" by Jamie (Mila Kunis) to work for GQ magazine in New York. If Jamie can persuade Dylan to take the job, she will get a big bonus. For his part, Dylan has to be sold because he loves the west coast. But, Jamie does her recruiting well and convinces Dylan to make the change. Very soon, the two of them realize a growing attraction but since both have them have had past romantic difficulties, especially Jamie, they decide on the ground rules. There will be no commitments or expressions of love, in their future relationship, only a friendship with sexual benefits. Things get more complicated when Jamie's ditzy mother (Patricia Clarkson) comes back to stay with Jamie and Dylan's father's dementia gets worse. When Jamie goes along with Dylan on a holiday trip to Los Angeles, the future of their pact seems in danger of changing. Will they stay together or will they call it quits? This is an entertaining romcom with likable characters, nice scenery, great costumes, and good acting. Timberlake is especially surprising in his acting ability, my view, for music is surely his main pursuit. Kunis also does a good job while Clarkson, Jenkins, Elfman and all of the others are fine, too. Special praise should go to Woody Harrelson, who plays a gay colleague of Dylan's, as he does terrific work in a difficult role. So, that's that. However, this film is a far cry from the days of Pillow Talk and such. It has many explicit sexual scenes and travels a quite different path to a ""true love conquers all"" conclusion. In my opinion, this is so because Hollywood is changing the romcom rules to appease male viewers who are dragged to date night films they hate. So, in place of action, there's plenty of sex. Some viewers will understand this, like me, but will still have a hard time accepting it. Therefore, those fans who prefer lighter, ""cleaner"" romantic comedy will probably have to turn to Hallmark instead of Hollywood, if this film is an example of the ""future world"" of light romance. I hope its not so.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
who would have thought,"Not normally my type of movie, but what a surprise, comedy, sex, and genuine acting. Never thought Justin could pull this off but i laughed every time i wathced it. Brilliant movie.I was expecting this to be very poor with Justin in it but now think there could not have been a better person to play this part, not to mention the fact that Mila Kunis is sexy, funny and hot in this movie. I think that the shear notion of friends with benefits is something most of us has considered just shows it cannot work but the comedy that can ensue to find this out is sometimes priceless as this movie shows. I think that Justin has more than proved himself as an actor and not a singer come wanna be actor.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Chick-Flick,"This is definitely a ""chick-flick"". Watching the trailer I was thinking it was a comedy; but mark my words - it's a chick-flick.The majority of the humor in this movie only appeals to women, and the story line as well.Furthermore this is one of the most predictable movies I've seen... And it seriously insults your intelligence by spelling out every single thing going on, stuff that you would understand automatically, if you just have a shred of intelligence.As a man, I would rate this movie 3 out of 10 stars.. But I realize I was not the intended audience of this movie, and it seemed that all of the women in the theater had a great time, laughing and what not. Based on that I think this movie hits home in regards to its intended audience. 7 out of 10 stars it is.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Play on the romcom clichés,"The romcom genre is by nature a formulaic affair. Girl meets boy, chemistry, do they don't they, yes they do. Friends with Benefits tries to play on the formula in a self aware style. The film and its characters both know the disappointments of chasing the fairytale of true love. The couple initiate a friendship that the co-stars Timberlake and Kunis do with humour and a good turn of chemistry. To avoid the hardships of chasing love the story has them turn against love, thus creating the premise of the anti-romcom. This is of course a red herring. The couple fall in love despite themselves and it is an enjoyable journey to follow them.The story exposes the characters flaws that inherently cause one person to connect deeper to another. The emotion that the couple attempt to remove from the relationship in favour of just sex, wins the day. Where the film does well is turning the conventions just a notch to show something reasonably fresh in a very clichéd genre. The film even mockingly plays on these clichés through a film within a film which Kunis as the die-hard romcom fan finds herself aspiring to in her own love life.Friends with Benefits paints an amusing yarn of finding love where the characters actively chose to deny it. Gluck keeps it raunchy (see poster for example of possibly most suggestive gesture to find itself on a London bus), self aware and when needed shows the baggage the characters carry without it being over sentimental. The message seems to be that love, if you can find it with the right person, is the ultimate friends with benefits.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
genuinely likable and far better than I was expecting,"Both Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake do fine jobs and their chemistry and timing carries the movie. Their back and forth banter is delightful and both of their characters are genuinely likable. We all know where the plot is heading but somehow they manage to deliver an intelligent and fresh take on the concept. Unlike so many of these type of films and comedies, both leads feel real and are normal people. The supporting cast is great except for Woody Harrelson's character who literally can't go 2 seconds without remind everyone he's gay and/or being obnoxious to the max. Overall, this is a surprisingly strong effort with heart. Plus, Mila sexes up the screen in the most pleasant of ways even though there is no nudity.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
let's put a smile on that face!,"this is not a path-breaking movie. it's just a simple love story. it has some funny lines, a few interesting characters, and some beautiful visuals. mila kunis is ""pretty,amazing"". JT seems to be getting into his groove. of late, his performances have been really impressive. the best thing about this film is the pace at which it moves, slowly in parts, and at breakneck speed in others. it slows down in precisely those portions where you want to look at things a little more deeply, and otherwise it just zooms away when the mood lightens up. you end up with a smile on your face, in the end, and you feel the time was well spent. with all the concept-heavy movies that seem to come out of Hollywood these days, it's nice, for a change, to watch a light-hearted, romantic comedy. good thing some film-makers out there realise that a part of the audience still wants to watch some conventional stuff. highly recommended!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
me gusto...,"When discussing who would go to the cinema to see this movie everyone warned me it was a ""chick flick"". The truth is that it may be so, but came out pleasantly surprised to find that addresses issues that couples often do not treat each other and that also includes hard to deal with Alzheimer's disease, in a humorous way and that in passing leaves a very useful and true advice about not distrust our heart, and if we're wrong ... what the hell! I liked the movie, has some really funny and the performances of the supporting characters, like Lorna, Annie, Mr Harper, and especially Tommy ... every appearance that I had was great. my humble opinion.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
the actors,"I saw this film only for actors. Especially for the presence of Patricia Clarkson. After a decade, Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake are the basic motif for see this easy romance , with few ingredients in the desire to make it serious or different. Nice is the fair term. The best thing - the eulogy to New York.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""Friends With Benefits"" a worthy rom-com","(There's a couple of mild spoilers in this review, but nothing too bad).I have a theory on this one. During their time on the set of ""Black Swan"", Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman talked to each other about making identical movies. They probably even had a little contest between each other on which one would have the better movie.Portman thought she and Ashton Kutcher would be perfect together and it would be a can't-miss flick. Thus, ""No Strings Attached"" was made. Not a great movie, though better than most gave it credit for. Portman was still good. She did as good a job with that one as anyone else could've done.Kunis liked her chances with Justin Timberlake. And six months later, we got ""Friends with Benefits.""Kunis definitely won the bet.""Friends with Benefits"" outdid its predecessor in several ways and turned out to be a quite the charmer. The movie had zippier dialogue and funnier jokes (though nothing was as funny as the period mix in ""No Strings Attached""). Kunis and Timberlake demanded screen time together with a charming chemistry that produced moments of joy, sorrow, attraction, reservation, hurt and betrayal.It might be shocking to say, but Timberlake actually played the part. Seldom did I feel like it was just Timberlake reciting lines and singing (yes, he sings a little bit). He actually came across as a guy who was really trying to figure things out and learning how to handle adversity when it came his way.The premise of the movie was simple. Jamie (Kunis) is a recruiting shark who convinces Dylan (Timberlake) to move to New York and take a big job at GQ magazine. As Jamie woos Dylan, they start to open up to each other and realize they want the same thing at this particular point in their lives: sex without the emotional attachment that comes from relationships.Sound simple enough? Of course not. Sure, they both enjoy the physicality of this endeavor, but eventually, things get too close for comfort. As they threaten to cross the threshold from sex partners to being a couple, true feelings throw a curve ball into the mix, and now they're left sorting out the mess.What makes ""Friends with Benefits"" work is how the characters change their approach through the course of the story. Kunis gets hurt, and it shows. Timberlake gets bitter for a little bit, and it shows.It also helped that when trouble arose, there actually were sorrowful, emotional moments off of which they played. The bad stuff that happened in ""No Strings Attached"" just felt like the next step in the movie. In ""Friends with Benefits"", Dylan's father, Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins), had physical issues that truly left a mark on Dylan. Though a bit predictable, his father's predicament gave him a better perspective of his own situation, which, in turn, helps both him and Jamie.The rest of the supporting cast rounded the movie nicely. Woody Harrelson plays Tommy, a co-worker of Dylan's who is gay, and is convinced Dylan is gay, or least tries to convince Dylan of this. Jenna Elfman plays Dylan's sister, who thinks he and Jamie are perfect for each other and enjoys talking about her brother to Jamie (where has Elfman been, and why has she only been in two movies the last seven years? She deserves more work).The story ends in a typical cliché rom-com way (actually, there's a scene at the end of the credits, which I'm proud to say that, out of the 75 or so people who came at the same showing, I was only one who got to watch it). But even that seemed fitting for the story. Whether it was the solid delivery of the lines or just quick style by which they were delivered, ""Friends with Benefits"" just clicked.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Feel good but ends quickly,"Justin and mila action is good but their chemistry is exceptional despite e fast ending could have extending more.overall its a go od movie except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.Kunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable. overall its a good movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Take on an Old Concept.,"This movie really takes on the question of can their really be friends with benefits. Well i have always wondered this and I'm sure some of you have to. Im not going to ruin the movie for anyone so i will just keep this very simple. This movie does a pretty good job conveying this question. I have to give a Shout out to Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis they really seemed to fit the characters extremely well. Me being a huge Mila Kunis fan thought that this really fit with the personas she has had from previous movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Justin i thought also did a really good job by seeing the way he acts from his music videos and just the way he looks really seems to work well with this character. I do not recommend seeing this movie with younger kids as pretty much there are some scenes that they shouldn't see, granted its the parents choice on letting them see it or not. I feel that this movie is one of the movies that really should be taken into notice romantically. I thought though out this movie that this is worthy to be competing with movies like Hitch. Thats would probably be the closest thing i could compare this movie to. That being said i feel that this movie has a different angle on Love and this new angle that they work really seems to work well.Overall: Great Movie, Great Acting, and MOST of all GREAT THEME.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"doesn't end as well as it begins, but there are plenty of high points","NYC based ""headhunter"" Kunis is a jaded romantic who's spent the past several months trying to persuade LA based art director (as well as equally jaded romantic) Timberlake to relocate to the east coast and take a job at GQ. Though hesitant he decides to take the job and they form a genuine friendship, that is until they decide to try and have sex with no emotional attachments--which of course never works. Snappy at first, with great dialogue, solid laughs, and some clever digs at the romantic comedy genre, but a lot of the fun drains away as it starts to become more and more conventional as it nears the finale. This is made worthwhile by the work of its two leads who have great chemistry and impeccable comic timing. **½",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fast paced, very funny, great characters","Due to the overwhelming number of ""blah"" reviews, purely to balance the universe I felt compelled to review this.I just watched this movie twice in a row. I watched it early today and watched it again when my wife came home. Nearly as funny the second time. Laughed out loud a bunch of times.The dialogue is very fast and full of tiny jokes that a lot of people would easily miss, and further a handful of jokes are repeated throughout the movie. ""Hollywood sign...LA's only real landmark."" Minutes later,news caster covering the event makes the same observation. (However, most people will laugh at the joke just before this one and miss the newscaster repeating it) Dumb people are too slow to follow the dialogue, so they'll get mad and call it boring.I gave this a bunch of stars not because it's a perfect movie in every way. It's not incredibly deep. It doesn't deal with world war II victims or some serious mind bending bull crap, but it ridiculously excels at what it does.Just because something has clichés isn't bad. There is nothing new under the sun folks. All you negatives out there that are so hard to please and so overly stimulated you're bored to death - just slit your wrists already.ps. A review is not a synopsis, you would-be reviewers!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

it's a movie worth spending your money and time on,"Touching, Funny and warm.Justin Timberlake stars as Dylan; the arts director for GQ magazine in NYC alongside Mila Kunis who plays Jamie a successful headhunter. Dylan meets Jamie when he flies over from LA for his job interview with GQ magazine and is her client. Jamie becomes a friend to Dylan in NYC since he has no friends in this town as yet apart from Tommy who is his gay colleague who Dylan keeps a distance with for obvious reasons. Dylan and Jamie who are both on the rebound after failed relationships are currently off the market and living it up single like George Clooney (Or so they think). FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS finally is a rom-com for both male and the female audience. Fast flowing and hilarious it's a very well- orchestrated directorial by Will Gluck.The success behind FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS is a great combination of acting talent, script and the directorial. Dylan and Tommy (Woddy Harreison) keep the whole life in the movie all cheerful at all times. I have watched Justin Timberlake in many movies before however this is by far one his best performances. The scene on the Hollywood sign is hilarious and very brilliantly done by both Justin and Mila. (You have got to watch this). Since the performance in BLACK SWAN to see Mila Kunis on screen is quite welcome. The 28 year old Ukrainian beauty is as stunning as always and very convincing. During the latter moments when her character moves into realization she brings out Jamie convincingly and connects with the viewers. Even so drawing a few tears if you're very sensitive. Especially to a female audience! Jenna Elfman who is hilarious in the sitcom ACCIDENTLLY ON PURPOSE plays a mellow Annie, who is Dylan's sister. Richard Jenkins as always has clarity. If you have seen him in VISITOR you will know exactly what I am refereeing to. However this time round he is a mix between being serious and funny and he does not seem to enjoy wearing his pants much!A very modern soundtrack compliments this worth watching movie. Most directors fail to infiltrate mass numbers of viewers today since they mess up on the soundtracks. Musical scores and soundtracks are an extension to the greatness and the success of a movie. As much as the visual senses are tingled by lively colors and amazing scenic beauties of the skyline in NY and LA, the auditory senses need some sensation too. Will Gluck's choices in the auditory aspects are smart selections. The soundtrack can be called very commercial and less original, however, the more the people know it the more they will enjoy it. Would I be right in saying that?A movie not be missed, it's not too heavy to grasp, a very basic story of emotion. It may be called a low calorie movie! Well balanced in its humor and lighter moments. Although it is not for the whole family (due to nudity) it's a movie worth spending your money and time on.Title: Friends with Benefits Directed by: Will Gluck Starring: Justin Timberlake, Mila Kunis, Jenna Elfman, Richard Jenkins, Bryan Greenberg & Woody Harreison Rated: Rating: 07/10 Minutes!!!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Decent movie, but it SETS SOME REALLY BAD EXAMPLES to Americans","I thought this was the perfect example of Zionist-Controlled Hollywood setting bad examples for Americans. I saw a movie the other day called ""That's What She Said"" which did the same thing, set absolute Horrible examples for Americans. If you don't know what i'm talking about then please keep your mouth shut until you at least study up on this and aren't so ignorant. This is done intentionally. I love my TV series and movies but nonetheless, i get sick when i see this happening, knowing it's the Zionists in Hollywood trying to flush our country down the toilet. Of course, that does not make them bad movies, this movie was pretty good and I give it a 6. If you like Timberlake, you should try watching ""In Time"". Great movie!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
