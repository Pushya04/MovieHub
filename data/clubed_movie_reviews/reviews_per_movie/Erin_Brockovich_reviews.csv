A commanding performance from Roberts,"I've never been a big fan of Julia Roberts as an actress and so I approached this movie with trepidation but I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. Not only that, but Julia Roberts was excellent.  I don't think I've ever seen a Roberts movie where she had this commanding a screen presence.  Her physical presence may have helped in that regard but so did her acting. But man, she really looked good in this movie. Oh, and Albert Finney displayed some pretty solid acting skills as well even though he didn't look good. Overall, I'd say that most people who watch this movie will probably find themselves cheering for Erin and will be very satisfied with the film. I was.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Robert's best display by far.,"I must admit i wasnt too keen on watching Erin Brokovich for a couple of reasons.One is that i am not too keen Julia Roberts or more to the point the type of film she stars in I.E Pretty Woman the other reason is that i presumed that this film was mainly for women. I was wrong. This is film would appeal to everybody. It has charm, humour and a very good story and the acting from all quarters is top notch. Julia Roberts also looks superb, she has the best legs in Hollywood !. I'm not sure how true to life her character is but i would love to see if the real Erin Brokovich is as up front and speaks her mind as much as the one in the film. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts is Fiercely Dynamic in the Smart and Savvy Erin Brockovich!,"Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich opens with a car accident. The vehicle driven by Erin, an unemployed, twice-divorced mother of three, is broadsided by a speeding car at an intersection. She takes her case to a rumpled, cowed lawyer Ed Masry, who agrees to represent her on a contingency basis. However, in court, Erin's surly manner and blasphemous vocabulary do not endear her to the jury, which finds itself in the defendant's favor, as Erin goes home empty-handed. Still without work and needing to pay her bills, Erin, who has no demonstrable skills, but a passion, an uncommon quantity of common sense, and a defiant way of talking, finagles her way into a position as a file clerk under her former attorney.It is in this capacity that she uncovers, entirely by accident, a paper trail leading to the town of Hinkley, CA, where an endless stream of residents have been diagnosed with various medical conditions including cancer, disintegrating spinal cords and brain damage. It turns out that the community of Hinkley has been poisoned by hexavalent chromium, leaching into the drinking water from the Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) plant. The case is especially odious because PG&E knew exactly what it was doing but lied about what kind of chromium it was using. Erin gains the trust of the community to mount legal action and strong-arms Ed to put together a case that would win the largest direct claim settlement in American history, even as her personal life is threatened by her devotion to the case.Steven Soderbergh tests Erin's limits of likability numerous times throughout the movie. An early scene is designed to show what a short fuse Erin has when she explodes in a torrent of profanity in the courtroom. Erin, the film makes clear early on, is no sentimental crusader. Rather, she is a tough, hard-nosed cookie who dresses like a hoochie and who would use anything from here heavily coiffured hair to her cleavage or also her baby to get what she needs. In short, Erin is adrift in a hard world. But what makes this potentially despicable character so affable is Julia Roberts' vulnerable and fiercely dynamic performance. As the eponymous character, she is undoubtedly the heart and soul of the film. As a foil for Erin, Albert Finney draws out a complex, engaging performance that is as warm as it is funny. Their scenes together crackle with chemistry and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction.Soderbergh infuses the proceedings with a vibrant, almost peppy sense of style that would not have been half as compelling had a less edgy director helmed it. It would have been easy for him to have allowed Erin Brockovich to descend into manipulative melodrama, but he resists that path of least resistance, instead giving us a film that is smart, savvy, funny, and, at times, poignant.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truth IS Stranger Than Fiction,"If I didn't know it was based on a ""true"" story I might have dismissed this movie as ""unrealistic"", particularly in the first half hour or so when it started off like another Julia Roberts comedy. At the beginning the film appears to focus primarily on her wardrobe, her foul language, and the developing romance with the ""boy next door"", whom she initially dislikes. As it turns out, the actual story, according to the bonus features on the DVD was even more melodramatic than the film's. The real Erin actually got sick to the point of hospitalization from the chromium in Hinkley. The director wisely decided to cut out this part of the story, to avoid making her too much of a martyr. Another aspect while not totally ignored (she does mention at least once that she's a ""slow reader"") but underplayed is Erin's dyslexia. This makes her accomplishments all the more amazing! Personally, I think this fact could have been emphasized more, as no doubt it was a big factor behind her ""attitude"" problems - her combativeness toward people with more education than herself, her struggles in finding a job, perhaps even in her efforts to accentuate her physical attractiveness through her outrageous clothing. All in all I found it an enjoyable and enlightening story - the triumph of a unique individual whose determination, empathy, and sense of moral duty ultimately outweigh her abrasiveness and lack of social graces. And largely why she triumphs is her partnership with an intelligent and decent lawyer in Ed Masry. What a refreshing departure from the usual Hollywood stereotype! On many occasions, he effectively counters Erin's prejudices with rational explanations how and why the legal system works the way it does, and why lawyers behave the way they do. With her passion and his reason, they make a great team. Now if only the movie hadn't fallen into the old Hollywood trap of giving its leading lady more outfits than is realistic for someone of her economic status. The point that Erin dressed provocatively and this caused problems with her co-workers could have easily been made with just 3 or 4 costumes. Other than that, it was a good movie - great performances and a wonderful story.",,Anonymous,Biography
A rare perfect ten--this movie has everything.,"Maybe this movie is not the right choice for action fans, but that is the only restriction of my otherwise fullest recommendation for this movie. It has everything, ranging from real-life documentary through love story via comedy to tragedy. And it is so lovingly done, and played so well. And it also has a wonderful soundtrack. To all the non-English Europeans: Get the DVD or original VHS, because the dubbed translated versions aren't quite like the original in terms of atmosphere created.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I don't like Julia Roberts, and even I liked this movie.","First, I should explain that I have one of the lowest opinions of Julia Roberts imaginable. I regard her as little more than a Barbie doll who pretends to be the world's biggest genius, and whose movies appear to have been written by ten monkeys working with ten typewriters for ten days/years.So how then, you may ask, could I like ""Erin Brockovich""? Well, for starters, Julia Roberts does more than focus on beauty in this movie. As a twice-divorced single mother who helps prosecute a corporation that had polluted a town's water supply, Roberts is a lot bitchier in this role than in most of her other roles. Occasionally blurting out lines that sound like they came from George Carlin, Erin is one bad-ass mother. The movie is also helped by good support from Albert Finney as Erin's boss Ed Masry.So, in conclusion, even though I generally consider Julia Roberts pretty worthless, I do agree that her Oscar win for this movie was well deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
When feel-good becomes Oscar-worthy feel-good,"The only thing bigger than Julia Roberts' chest in ""Erin Brockovich"" is the heart this film has. While it is a drama, it would be more apt to describe the plot as a struggle, because it's all about fighting for what you believe in and overcoming the odds and all opposing forces. Nothing bad actually happens in this movie, at all, but it's the complications, the setbacks the moral struggles along the way that make it shine.""Erin Brockovich"" stars Julia Roberts in the title role in a film based on the true story of a twice-married mother of three who is desperate to find a way to make a living and provide for her family. After a failed attempt at suing for damages after a car accident, Brockovich turns to her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), for a job doing anything she can at his law firm. Reluctantly he accepts and soon Brockovich finds herself uncovering a potentially huge case.Roberts had to have been a no-questions-asked best actress winner after this performance. As Brockovich she is incredible playing multiple roles as the loving mother, the driven working-woman, the troubled lover, everything. The mood swings are effortless for her. Perhaps the best element of her performance is that she comes across as glaringly flawed, even if she is quite likable. Her lines are killer and delivered with command. Though some of her rants are over the top, they're really clever nonetheless.Finney's character is much the same way. He is really enjoyable to watch and gives a great performance even though his character never gets truly dramatic.This is just a great screenplay by Susannah Grant. It's almost completely devoid of melodrama and yet it tackles so many real life issues. Brockovich's struggle to balance her work with her family brings up an issue that can connect with anyone, although the feminist tones of the film obviously won't connect as strongly with men. Director Steven Soderbergh feels very distant from the film. Every so often a shot or sequence will be artistic, but he allows the story to tell itself for the most part.""Erin Brockovich"" is better than the average feel-good story. When there's little melodrama and great acting, a feel-good story becomes a great movie. Sports films based on true stories are feel-good stories, but they don't get nominated for best picture. While it may all seem too good to be true and the positive seems to trump the negative more times than it ought to, the film still feels very real and one that no one should miss.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Norma Rae"" for 2000","Julia Roberts deserves her accolades for the performance in this.  Has she been better?  Probably.  But not as DRAMATIC.  And that's what counts for awards.  As a rule.  This bit of work holds its own with brother Eric in ""Star 80.""  Albert Finney has been better (best guilty pleasure performance? ""Wolfen."").  And I must give credit to Aaron Eckhart (unrecognizable from ""In the Company of Men"") as the house-biker who takes care of Erin's kids while she saves Hinkley, CA (standing in for The World).  Oh, and, of course, nod to ""C.S.I."" to Marg Helgenberger who was quite good.  Soderbergh has just been nominated for two DGA best directing noms for this film and ""Traffic.""  Overkill.

Julia Roberts' best movie,"This movie may have changed my opinion of Julia Roberts.  I have never like her acting, and the media's portrayal of her as some sort of beauty queen in the 80's (and she has never been a very attractive woman) only made it worse.  But she did an excellent job in this story, seemingly portraying the real Erin Brockovich with perfection.Great story, maybe a little hard to believe though if you didn't know it was true.  But everything was very well done.  All the characters were good. One bad thing is that they seem to have cut some scenes out to speed it up? Some of the scene transitions were downright bizarre and there was no logic behind.  But other than that, no real complaints.One thing I'd like to point out to people before they watch this is that Erin Brockovich is not a very likable person.  She's profane, crude, obnoxious, rude, and treats everyone around her, especially those who are better educated, like garbage.  She always had trouble finding and keeping a job and she always blamed it on her lack of education and experience.  That wasn't it.  It was her attitude.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great story, with great casting too. Great directing, acting, production.","It doesn't take long to realise that this is a great movie. Everything looks so real, and so it should seeing that it is a true(ish) story, but all the minor roles have great actors too. There are lots of instances where little mannerisms make it real. My guess is that Erin wrote most of the dialogue?Besides the real Brockavich, the real Ed Masry comes on the DVD bonus, and shows how good the casting of Albert Finney, and his acting, are and how much he contributed to the successful outcome of EB's efforts. Ed is so tolerant of Erin's apparent disregard for the norms of a legal practice, it is a bit hard to accept that he is for real! But he must have been. Also on the DVD is Erin (the real one) saying how surreal is the 30-second scene where she is the waitress, and then Julia saying that it is about ""inhabiting the concept, not imitating"". So true, and that is what makes really great actors, ie, JR.The story of corporate carelessness and a small-town lady who found out that the water was contaminated and decided to do something about it in spite of heavy lawyers who do whatever the client says, might give others the incentive to do their own action? 'hope so.Although this is a huge legal battle, there is very little of that shown - good idea, courtroom stuff can be so boring and irrelevant.

I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?

"a definite winner, uplift, social conscience, and knockout acting","Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich is exactly the uplift picture you've always hoped for. strong acting, moving script, important issues, legitimate procedurals and best of all it is scrupulously faithful to its true story. Struggling outspoken single mom, Erin (the Oscar winning performance by Julie Roberts proving irrevocably that she is more than just tits and teeth), gets on with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney in a justifiably nominated supporting role)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history. it is not a simple magic act either. Erin's got her character flaws (many of which are visited on supportive biker boyfriend George, played by Aaron Eckhart) and the lawsuit is immensely complicated, though Screenwriter Susannah Grant's nominated script keeps it all in focus and understandable. It's the kind of story we can all learn a lot from. Erin works her tail off,  polishes her own too harsh rough edges and ultimately wins a richly deserved reward (just the film itself was so amply rewarded.)It's a story that inspires americans to believe in the system and fight against corporate injustice on their own personal level. It's the kind of thing that shows each and every person can make a big difference. everybody should be proud of soderbergh for realizing what a huge hero Erin Brockovich is and for bringing her struggles and triumphs to the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
No-frills David & Goliath story told in straightforward fashion...,"There's nothing dynamic or exciting about ""Erin Brockovich"" save for Julia Roberts' fiery, Oscar-winning lead performance. She plays the real-life single mother of three who gets a job in a law firm and proceeds to take on a huge corporation responsible for contaminating water in a Southern California city. The residents of that town aren't given any real shadings--we meet most of them on the fly--and Erin's co-workers and boss are a typical office bunch. Director Steven Soderbergh is offered no opportunities here to get flashy, but he does solid work up to the tag (which is silly). Roberts, on the other hand, gets to act all over the place, and it's nice to see her doing well in a role that requires more than just her movie star smile and figure.

How the common person can take on the mighty and win.,"After all of the hype surrounding this film I was prepared to be disappointed. I was not!

She fights their corner for them and eventually secures them a huge court settlement.

One of the best films of Julia Roberts,"This film is very slightly based on a real case of environmental pollution, where a small community processed a factory because of the pollution and the diseases that it caused. Erin Brockovich (whom Julia Roberts brought to life) is a single, unemployed mother who comes across this process by chance, while working (almost by favor) in a law firm. Julia Roberts has had, in this film, one of the most remarkable works of her career to date, along with ""Notting Hill"". She is a talented actress, who filled with spirit and personality a character who needed a point of irreverence and temper. At her side was Albert Finney in the role of Ed Masry, the law firm's chief partner, who accepts (reluctantly and suspiciously) Erin's help in resolving what promises to be the most important legal case of his career. The film does not hesitate to portray the polluting firm in the worst possible way, in a not inconsiderate and certainly premeditated criticism of the large US corporations, that rarely put environmental and health concerns at the top of their priorities. In this sense, the film, which never abandons the comic and entertainment side, takes a strongly interventionist stance, seeking to alert consciences and draw the attention to the situation portrayed, and some analogous situations that still continue to persist. The film also gives some importance to the so-called ""anonymous heroes"", which Erin symbolizes in a way, and that often make the difference when all other people choose to ignore the problem or let the authorities figure it all out. The cinematography emphasizes the warm and vibrant tones, which reinforces the sensation of heat passed by the filming locations and the garish prints of Erin's clothes, clothes that help the character to clearly assumes her popular and very humble condition.This movie is far from a thriller or a police movie. It's an entertainment film that has been made for the families, but with a huge desire to alert consciences to environmental and health concerns, which it always approaches in a light but determined way.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Erin Brockovich: When Self-Preservation Leads to Passion,"What happens when you mix a struggling, single mother of three, an accident, and a lawyer together? Well, you get Erin Brockovich. A film written by Susannah Grant and directed by Steven Soderbergh, this is an Oscar-winning biographical drama that is based on a portion of the life of Erin Brockovich, a woman that has dealt with unemployment, poverty, and just plain bad luck. Erin lives in Hinkley, California, a small town located between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, Nevada. That is where she and her three children live on the fringes of poverty in a small house located in a suburban neighborhood. To exacerbate an already unfortunate situation, one day, after Erin leaves an unsuccessful job interview, she gets into an accident, suffering damages to herself as well as her car. To add to her frustrations, her appointed lawyer, Ed Masry, is unsuccessful in winning her settlement case. After a heated confrontation with Mr. Masry in his office, Erin comes out of there with a job as a legal clerk for Mr. Masry. Her employment under Mr. Masry eventually leads her on a unwitting path to fight for justice against PG&E, an electric/utility giant. In the film, Brockovich is tasked by Mr. Masry to look into a case where the plaintiffs were suing PG&E for damages due to groundwater contamination caused by dumping waste-water which contaminated neighboring water supplies. As the film progresses, more and more victims of PG&E's contamination come forward and join Brockovich to fight against the giant. Although this film is a biographical drama, I would also suggest to Mr. Soderbergh that this is one of the best documentaries I've seen. You may ask: ""What are you talking about? This isn't a documentary! This isn't even close to a documentary."" Well, I'll have to stop you there. Although the film is captured in a dramatic way, the focus of the movie is not the drama, rather, the events. The film detailed the conditions that not only the protagonist, Brockovich was faced with, but those affected by PG&E, as well. Erin Brockovich was able to create a more powerful message that not only addressed environmental awareness but also corporate greed. One thing I liked about the film was that it wasn't littered with special effects or over-the-top dramatic music. Films that are considered documentaries nowadays are usually chalk-full of propagandic editing and loaded questions. This is especially prevalent in environmental documentaries. This type of documentary usually leads viewers to one conclusion: that corporations are bad, and the environment is dying. Overflowing with dramatic music and cut-offs, those kinds of films, to me, should be considered dramas, not Erin Brockovich. Erin Brockovich is able to make viewers aware of those issues, and more. Grant and Soderbergh immerse the viewer into the movie by giving a context for which many viewers can connect to or sympathize with: a single mom that has nothing but a few dollars, 3 mouths to feed, and a wild personality. She is split into many directions, and her personality is what gets her into as well as out of sticky situations. By introducing us to Erin, a mother, a foundation for connections are established with the viewer. They also introduce realistic conflict into the movie. In addition to her struggles for employment, Soderbergh includes a romantic relationship that the real Brockovich had with a neighbor, named George. Even after she eventually pulls her and her family out of near destitution, she is faced with the task of balancing her passion for her work with time spent with her family and George. Chasing her work would mean putting everything else on the sidelines. Spending time with family would mean that precious time would be lost in the fight against PG&E. Even as she works to repair her relationship with George and her kids, Erin has created a connection to those that were affected by the groundwater contamination. The issue then is where to focus her humanity. Should she sacrifice her family's happiness, potentially ruining her relationship with her kids for good, so that she is able to attempt to save or at least ameliorate the hundreds of lives that have been affected by PG&E? By introducing these aspects, Soderbergh gives a more realistic view of our society as humans, rather than the clips of starving African children you see in every other documentary. I think the addition of these elements keep the viewer more glued to their screens compared to typical documentaries, which try way too hard to grab your attention. Erin Brockovich, aside from the comparisons, is an excellent standalone film. Its unique story line/situation makes the film memorable. Its inclusion of the real Erin Brockovich in the beginning gives the viewer an impression of what the real deal was like, and what the dress, mannerisms, and vulgar language amalgamate into. His seemingly accurate portrayal of Brockovich greatly contributed to the film's intensity as a biography. Soderbergh's film, to me, is a 5-star (10/10) movie. It's incorporation of realness is what clinches the 5th star. Erin's situation was a very unique and rare occurrence. Her strife to survive in life led to successes and failures. Her fortunate chance to work in Ed Masry's office established a previously unknown passion about something that may have never crossed her mind: the environment. It is through random luck that history is made. History is not a set prophecy. Story lines are constantly being created, however, many go unacknowledged. Erin Brockovich created that story, and Soderbergh acknowledged it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Food for thought- what's in your water?,"I don't know how accurate this film is to the real lawsuit, but it was played out very well, that you could understand the reason behind the lawsuit with the need of any prior knowledge. Julia Roberts did a fantastic job in portraying Erin Brockovich, which was quite different from her usual comedy romance style of acting. However, I felt there were two much emphasis on her sexual attractiveness and being a single mother with 3 kids and without a job, she seemed to have quite an unrealistic amount of wardrobe. Julia Roberts, although having a talent in talking the neighbors into signing for the lawsuit, she seemed ungrateful and rude to other people like George (Aaron Eckhart), who selflessly took care of her kids day and night. I don't know if Erin's ungratefulness was based on true story, but it seemed unnecessary and out of place. Also Erin Brockovich is dyslexic in real life which allowed her to remember phone numbers by memory, but in the movie it wasn't quite rooted except the occasional ""slow-reader"" reference, which adds to the confusion. Albert Finney (Ed Masry) did a great job as well all throughout the movie.Overall, I find this movie very well-done and the acting stellar.

goes down easy,"Julia Roberts is like the vanilla ice cream of movies.  Everyone pretty much likes her more or less, and for a dessert, she'll do in a pinch.And I don't mean that literally.Of course, vanilla ice cream isn't really all that memorable, and, I'll admit, there are a few memorable Roberts moments.  But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts: she is the same in every movie.There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way.  If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots.  But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore.  Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.Don't get me wrong.  It's entertaining.  But it's formulaic.  A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot.  The story: Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm.  Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car.  This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man.  Hip hip hooray!I didn't ruin the movie for you.  It's not a surprise.  This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on.  Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality.  Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre.With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges. Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib. Erin serves it up piping hot.And she won't take none of your lip, neither.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable,"Out of work, out of hope, trashy, twice divorced single mother Erin fails to get another job due to her lack of experience. On her way home she is hit by another car. She goes to lawyer Ed Masry who spectacularly fails to win her any damages. Erin demands he gives her a job and he begrudgingly does. Doing some of his pro-bono work, Erin uncovers evidence that suggests that manufacturing firm PG&E had poisoned the local water supply and lie to residents about the content. As she looks deeper she finds a legacy of illness and a small bit of research turns into a mammoth case.I don't know how much of this drama is factual and how much of it is changed to add to dramatic effect but regardless the story is involving, funny and moving. At the time there was a rash of 'environmental damage' legal films of which this is one of the more polished and classy. The film focuses as much on Erin as it does on the case and at times it risked failing as a legal drama/thriller. However it still grips as the facts pretty much speak for themselves  the film adds to this by creating a real sense of PG&E as a monster without scruples or concern for the residents. As a result the events feel more powerful and involving. It feels slow at times, but if you're into it then it feels patient rather than slow and deliberate rather than laboured.The biggest reason that the focus on Erin works is because Roberts really does very well giving her Erin a down to earth, trashy feel that could have been hammy or unbelievable (she is a multimillion pound actress after all), but it wasn't. Instead it was realistic and quite warm  where she could have been annoying. The grumpy Finney is also good value and seems natural in the role. Eckhart is almost too good to be true but gives a likable performance and is a winning non-distraction.The film benefits from the style that Soderbergh brings to it. It glides with the grace that he brought to Ocean's 11 and has the rich colouring that parts of Traffic had. His direction really adds to the film and makes the sum feel a little greater that the parts put together.Overall this may not be the legal thriller that you hoped for and it may move a great deal slower that I thought a Hollywood film would, but it is worth it. The film is patient and worth baring with and Roberts is actually pretty good in the lead! Enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Prepare The Oscars For Roberts, Finney","A tenacious file clerk for a small law firm, curious about some information included in the file of a pro bono case, purses it and ultimately becomes a major player in a huge lawsuit involving hundreds of people in `Erin Brockovich,' a movie based on actual events, directed by Steven Soderbergh.

Millions of dollars, as well as justice for those who have been harmed is at stake, but it's a case of David versus Goliath, and Masry has reservations as to whether or not he is up to the task; the meager resources of his firm will only go so far, while the utility could tie them up in court for years and not feel a thing.  Masry, however, has something else to consider:  Erin Brockovich, who has latched on to this case harder than a pit bull on a mailman's trousers. 	Julia Roberts gives one of the best performances of her career in this film, as the sassy, brazen Brockovich, who tells it like it is and won't take `no' for an answer.  She captures ever grain of realism in bringing Erin's story to life; this woman who was down on her luck, but refused to give in to circumstances that overwhelmingly stacked the odds against her. She perfectly conveys the sense of frustration felt by this single mother of three who, unemployed, and with no help or prospects in sight, simply would not quit on her own life or let her children down.  It's a gritty, charismatic performance with a depth that aptly demonstrates what kind of person Brockovich really is; not a portrait of a superwoman or a story made up of overblown, feigned heroics, but of a self-assured, very real person with too much pride and integrity to turn away from the truth and people in need.  Albert Finney is also outstanding as Masry, the honest, hard working lawyer who finds his horizons somewhat expanded by Erin's zeal.  He's something of a decent, regular guy with a good marriage, small but successful practice and diabetes.  And Finney brings him to life with a performance that should get him an Oscar nomination at the very least.  It's tough taking the part of an average Joe and making him memorable, and it's a credit to Finney's ability as an actor that he succeeds so well in doing so. 	The solid supporting cast includes Aaron Eckhart, exemplary in his role of George, the man in Erin's life; Marg Helgenberger (Donna Jensen); Cherry Jones (Pamela Duncan); Peter Coyote (Kurt Potter); and Conchata Ferrell (Brenda).  One of the best movies of the year, `Erin Brockovich' is a well made, absorbing and entertaining drama, well directed and superbly acted, especially by Roberts and Finney; it's theme of the underdog fighting for justice has a universal appeal that will get the adrenaline pumping and engage you emotionally.  It's a great story, with Julia Roberts at her very best.  This is one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everything she does is real,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Julia Roberts stars as an unrelentingly tactless, thoroughly tasteless, charm-school dropout twice divorced, the mother of three who dresses like a Las Vegas whore. We love her. She is a woman who's been disappointed a time or two and generally expects the worst, and when she doesn't get it, she's surprised. She is her own worst enemy with a foul mouth and a skanky style and a chip on her shoulder. She is also very smart and incredibly strong and knows right from wrong (and that's the chip on her other shoulder). We love her.Stir in Richard Gere or Tom Cruise (no, he's too short)... How about...no, no, NO. Give her someone near her equal. How about a real actor twice her age? How about Albert Finney (whom I first saw in the delightful Tom Jones (1963))? Together they play it like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy without the romance. Not only does it work, it's a triumph. Finney really is brilliant. His timing is exquisite as is his ability to round his character. Did you catch the shot of him with the one eye comically magnified through his glasses? For love interest give her a bandana-wearing biker whom she turns into a house husband to take care of her kids while she takes on Pacific Gas and Electric (market cap = $28-billion). For the first time in her life she is doing something important. For the first time in her life people respect her. There's something wonderful about this because even without an education people can see, and she can know, that she's their equal and maybe a bit more.Aaron Eckhart, lately seen as the sociopathic Chad in the startlingly original In the Company of Men (1997) plays the biker house husband with fidelity and a kind of sappy warmth. She neglects him and her kids for her obsession. Susannah Grant, who penned the very clever script must have gotten a good laugh with this unusual household, the poor, stay at home neglected husband, the always on the road wife. Incidentally, don't miss the scene where he first kisses her. It was so real all I could think was this guy is kissing Julia Roberts! She is so powerfully expressive that everything she does is real. That's her gift.A significant part of the success of Erin Brockovich of course is in the compelling (and substantially true) story of David versus Goliath (""and all his relatives,"" as Finney quips), of good versus evil, of the ""little guy"" versus the corporate behemoth. I won't be giving away anything by telling you that there's a happy ending. But this is also a triumph for Director Steven Soderbergh who can now add a box office success to critical acclaim. I haven't seen any of his latest movies, (I'm looking forward to seeing Traffic), but I recall with pleasure the very interesting Sex, Lies, & Videotape from 1989. I am also looking forward to the Academy Awards presentations because I suspect the Academy is going to reward both Julia Roberts and Soderbergh by making Erin Brockovich the Best Picture of the year 2000.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts steals the spotlight and earns it,"The story of Erin Brockovich is significantly intriguing as much as it is thought-provoking, even if it doesn't make a landmark in America's history. Director Steven Soderbergh gives a lively treatment to the inspirational story with a confident direction and an intelligent screenplay, even when the film begins to feel like a two-hour episode of a television series. Soderbergh's brilliant taste of filmmaking comes to life in a 1993 story of a Californian woman taking on one of the biggest class action lawsuits to ever take place in America, and the result is a true cinematic work of art with just small pinch of shortcoming in the mix. The movie pits Julia Roberts in the role of Erin Brockovich, an unlikable and unemployed single mother of three kids who is involved in a car collision while passing through an intersection. She receives aid from lawyer Ed Masry (played by Albert Finney) to assist her in court, but her profane and disrespectful behavior result in her losing the case. Still stuck on the unemployment lines, Erin successfully convinces Masry to hire her as a file clerk at the law firm. There, she comes across a case involving contamination on the water supply of Hinkley, California done by the Pacific Gas & Electricity Company. With a growing number of Hinkley residents getting ill from the contaminated water, Erin enlists the help of the reluctant Masry to assist her in a case against the multi-billion dollar company.This biographical drama doesn't rise into the rank of the most memorable biopics Hollywood has to offer, nor is it particularly groundbreaking at the least. But what matters most is that it's smart, it's clever, and it features Julia Roberts in a role that definitely defines her career compared to some of the romantic comedies she's endured in the past. Though the rude and surly attitude render of her character make her hard to care for at first, she eventually overcomes her cruel demeanor when she sets out to make a difference for those who are in need of help. Roberts embraces the role with sheer competency and grace (and profanity), it is significantly difficult to point out another role by her that impresses me more. Albert Finney also brings some acting gold in the mix, and his chemistry with co-star Julia Roberts comes on-screen and works quite effectively. Then there is Aaron Eckhart who has plays a motorcycle junkie who moves in next door and after his help with the children, eventually comes her boyfriend but faces a strain in their relationship when her constant work on the case dissolves her time at home. For the charismatic actor he is, he does pretty decent in his role, and does nothing to disappoint the slightest. The cast make admirable appearances on screen in this true story-based film written by Steven Soderbergh that captures true emotion without the temptation of manipulating it with overly sentimental tone, and makes an honest sense of the events that took place leading the title character into a major court case Erin had a very high chance of losing in trial. It was an important case where justice that meant not money, but the lives of the people affected by the wrongdoing of a filthy rich utility company. With people getting ill and some dying, Erin knew something had to be done.Erin Brockovich is an endearing biographical drama that leaves a landmark on both Julia Roberts and director Steven Soderbergh's career. It is a fascinating movie with a just a few flaws that are overshadowed with greatness and therefore difficult to point out. When taking about Julia Roberts, this film is the role she is likely remembered for.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Loved It,"Julia Roberts plays a fierce female lead who doesn't fit into the establishment's mold of what strong women look like.Erin Brockovich had neither a degree or a steady work history, but her good sense and determination broke a multi-million corporate cover up of polluting. In doing so, she impacted many lives and got some comfort for those afflicted by the poisoning of ground waters.Roberts handles the character with verve. The entire movie is fun, but it doesn't talk down. The topic is serious, but it never strays into the maudlin.A really good reminder of why Julia Roberts reigned the box office for a long while.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
well made under-dog story,"Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is a struggling unemployed single mother of three. She can't even win a petty lawsuit against a doctor for a car accident. So she browbeats her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to give her a job. When she starts poking into a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. It turns into much more of a case of toxic waste dumping and one of the biggest class action lawsuits in American history.Julia Roberts delivers a big performance in a traditional under-dog movie. This is definitely well-made by master director Steven Soderbergh. Nothing is left on the table, and it helps to have great actors all around like the great Albert Finney.The only small problem I had. There is a holier than thou attitude that Erin Brockovich hasn't earned yet in the movie. After all she brings frivolous lawsuits, she needs to show more of her struggles. I think there was a story where she had to steal medicine for her kids. That would be a great insight into her struggles to start the movie with. That would buy credit for all the stuff that follows.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie I've seen in a long time.,"I get a real kick out of reading other peoples reviews for movies, i find it disturbing that they always label an actor on previous movies and dont seperate them when they see something worth an oscar like this one. I thought the acting was great, the movie felt real. The plot was so convincing to the veiwer. A little comedy mixed with raw emotion was the clencher to make this movie oscar worthy. After seeing this film I found myself telling others about it and recomending it to everyone. I give this film two thumbs up!",,Anonymous,Biography
A Pretty Woman Takes Down A Big Utility,"In all the years that Frank Capra gave his populist films, none of his heroes were women. Back then it was the traditional roles with the men doing the heavy lifting and the women in support as wives and mothers so the men could slay the dragons.Frank Capra might never have given us a populist heroine, but I think he would have loved Erin Brockovich as much as I did. Although Albert Finney is the lawyer who took on the power Pacific Gas&Electric for the residents of Hinkley, California, the legwork (and what a pair of legs) was done by Julia Roberts.The true story of former beauty queen Erin Brockovich is one of the best roles for a female player in the past ten years and Julia Roberts was so right for the part. Beauty is a start for this part, but Ms. Roberts is also a single mother raising three kids who literally browbeats her way into a job with a law firm headed by Albert Finney that lost a case where she was a plaintiff.People all her life, and probably the men she was involved with never took her seriously because of her beauty. As Roberts got deeper and deeper into the case involving toxic chromium poisoning from a plant in Hinkley, she felt a lot more self worth and very much empowered due to the good work she was involved in. As she explains to current boyfriend Aaron Eckhardt in my favorite scene in the film, when she goes to Hinkley on any her firm's business, it's not a beauty queen that the people there are seeing, but a savior of sorts.Roberts puts her heart and soul in both her work and as mother. Some of her best scenes are her domestic ones with her three kids. She's not without weaknesses, she does have a tendency to snap judgments and she's not the most diplomatic of people at times. But a good heart and a good work ethic cover a multitude of sins.Unlike so many Oscar winning films, Erin Brockovich got a March release in 2000 not a release late in the year to keep the film fresh in Academy voters minds. Obviously no one thought of this film as Oscar caliber. Yet word of mouth spread about the film and it got several nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Albert Finney and others. And it was a winner for Julia Roberts for Best Actress of 2000.Erin Brockovich was one of my favorite films for the new century and I think it will please every one who sees it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie,I feel like this movie is underrated. I had never heard of it until recently and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I also love a movie that's done well that was based on real events.

Goliath Beware,"A prime example of the David & Goliath theme that has long been a Hollywood mainstay. After Meryl Streep picked up an Oscar for dressing down as Karen Silkwood Julia Roberts followed suit with her vibrant portrayal of a potty-mouthed, blue-collar floozie in big hair and short skirts with two former husbands behind her and three kids to take care of (the adorable pair of moppets who plays Roberts' daughter steals every scene she shares with her).Miss Brockovich however is a much tougher cookie than the role that made her name in 'Pretty Lady', making a highly proficient Girl Friday to Albert Finney (whose eyebrows alone makes Gabby Hayes look like Garbo) and she brings a sense of humour to the part that goes far beyond mere Oscar bait.As in 'Contagion' the storyline concerning carcinogenic drinking water alas still resonates today.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very good biopic! 7,5!","I saw this movie without high expectations. I thought it would be more boring and slow. I saw many more movies directed by Steven Soderbergh. I liked most of them, some more than others. ""Side effects"", ""Traffic"", ""Oceans's eleven"" and ""Out of sight"" may be the ones I liked the most from them. ""Solaris"", ""Contagion"" and ""Magic Mike"", for example, are normal while ""Lies, sex and videotapes"" is bad in my opinion. Finally, ""Erin Brockovich"" surprised me and I really enjoyed it. It is based on real events. It is biographic. The story is about a young mother who begins to work as a legal assistant. I did not know anything about the real character, but Julia Roberts portrays the best performance in her career, or at least, one of the best ones. Aaron Eckhart plays the part of his new boyfriend (very correct, as well). The other secondary actors did a more than decent job. Performances are clearly a strong point in this movie. The pace is adequate, as well, taking into account it is a realistic biographic courtroom drama. The lentgh is the proper one, so we can say the director has done a very good job. There are also some good dialogues and funny situations because, although the movie is a drama, it contains some humour. The movie is not excellent, but it is very correct in every aspect. The story is moving and contains some social criticism which is so visible and great (I like movies to have messages like this). So, those who like biopics and dramas will surely enjoy this film, and Julia's fans, of course. 7,5.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia triumphant,"Classic David vs. Goliath tale with Julia Roberts' star power at full blast. This story brings to life a battle-hardened mom that stumbles onto a massive corporate scandal, and its lead actor plays the hell out of her. There's talent all over (Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart) and it might seem unfair to make this all about her, but . . . There's far more on display here than the megawatt smile. This is a character that's so easy to root for, and anytime Erin walks into a conference room, it's spine-tingling. She's a hell-raiser in the sweetest sense.For me, this is a noteworthy movie in nearly every respect. It's well-written, feel-good and I loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly powerful.,"A pretty effective film, done in the same format as much of this subject matter, it reminded me of Spotlight, All the Presidents Men and The China Syndrome. It's a fairly well acted film, though at times the comedy felt a bit forced and put on, overall though the acting was fine, it's more how the characters are written as falling into cliches a bit, the tough talking fiery single mother, the cynical weary lawyer, the cold awkward Harvard law graduate, the biker character though was nice in that he's quite a thoughtful character torn between traditional ideas about masculinity and how much he enjoys being a step father to her children. The main character is one of those rough diamond types who's heart is in the right place but who's short temper and colour language often land her in hot water. The music is quite good, lots of piano. American loves a story about a big faceless negligent corporation being taken on by the little guy, the film is intended as a big of crowd pleaser, though it does also intelligently dive into the cost of working this case has on our main character's personal life, missing her baby's first words and so on. The film also does a nice job and explaining the legal complexities too of the US justice system and why it's not always as simple as it appears and things rarely come to trial. The film is nicely shot, well acted and edited, it's also easy to follow and you never feel confuse or lost. Overall very good.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hardly a True-Life Story,"One should head the warning that the movie is *based* on true-life events. ""Erin Brockovich"" is simply a ""lawsuits are really your friend"" feel-good Hollywood fluff movie that has little basis in fact. In real-life, an attorney that was retained by Hinkley residents to sue Brockovich and Masry after they took the money and ran, was quoted as saying ""I read the script; the only true part was Erin Brockovich's name.""Julia Robert's performance was decent, but hardly Oscar material. I've seen her in far better performances, and it seems that the basis of her presence here is to simply use foul language and show off her cleavage. If it's foul language you want, rent ""South Park: The Movie"", which is funny and much more entertaining then ""Erin Brockovich"". Albert Finney was good as the in-over-his-head Lawyer trying to do what is right for the residents of Hinkley, but he was much much better in ""Traffic"".I highly recommend that anybody who watches ""Erin Brockovich"" (and especially if you get up and cheer at the end) takes the time to do cursory research on the real-life Hinkley case. In real-life, the motivation of the three law firms was neither truth nor compassion, but rather 40 percent of the winnings. Their ""take"" from the settlement was $133 million plus an amazing $10 million more in expenses. Brockovich's bonus alone was $2 million.""Give me a break!"" moaned one resident after seeing the film. ""They depicted the lawyers as so concerned about the residents,"" she said. ""But does she [Brockovich] really care?""To understand why the Masry-Brockovich team won, it's important to know that the case was a settlement not subject to appeal, that PG&E (the movie ""Bad Guys"") was suffering terrible publicity, and that as a utility it could simply pass losses on to utility customers. But when these same three firms, including the Masry-Brockovich team, tried the same ploy in the court system against a company with no guaranteed income, the case collapsed like a rotten pumpkin.Far from being ""environmental crusaders"" as the media now routinely calls them, the real-life Masry and Brockovich have never crusaded for anything but money.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Two great characters, one fine film","Erin Brokovich is all about two characters: the title character, played by Julia Roberts, and Ed Masry, played by Albert Finney. Brokovich is a bold and flashy woman; given all the buzz, everyone reading this has surely already heard about her wardrobe. Masry is a talented but world-weary lawyer in a small law firm.Roberts and Finney are both in fine form here, making the characters sympathetic and believable. The supporting cast is not as strong - none of the other characters in the film seem entirely filled-out - but that's a minor quibble.There is a bit of a tone of moral righteousness here. After all, it is the story of a nobody going up against Big Business, not to mention the obstacles facing a single mother in the working world. But it's not overdone, and the film succeeds in getting you to root for the underdog, an always popular pastime.",,Anonymous,Biography

Erin Brockovich,"Julia Roberts is at her best here as the eponymously feisty woman who is struggling to keep her three kids fed and watered whilst holding down a decent job. An accident sends her the way of attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney) who makes some damages promises that don't prove forthcoming - so she decides that she is going to work for him - whether he likes it or not! Admin ensues and during some routine filing she starts to notice a prevalence of medical records contained in property transaction documentation. A little further investigation and a few conversations with some local people soon suggests to her, and her still sceptical boss, that a large corporate enterprise has been systematically poisoning the water supply and misleading the residents about some pretty ghastly illnesses that had befallen them. Needless to say, the lawyers for big business and the system itself lobs quite a few obstacles in their path, but as this true story unravels we receive an entertainingly focussed and well written objective lesson in tenacity and dedication. There's an increasingly effective chemistry here between Roberts and Finney, and with Aaron Eckhart providing the babysitting services - and allowing us all to come up for air now and again, this turns out to be a compelling drama, peppered with some lovely dark humour, that still works well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bland.,"This is the type of movie that puts me off Steven Soderbergh. I started to find interest in the guy earlier this year when Side Effects surprised me but it's half-assed efforts like this that just make me feel like his hearts not in it. Which is a real travesty on my part because the guy does his cinematography and editing as well as directing. Erin Brockovich is a bland slow film. It works on a simple and boring juxtaposition of a sexy young Mom doing legal work she's not trained to do. It's satisfying as she's driven by a need for justice but it's not as interesting as it thinks it is. Roberts is okay, good for her but not awards worthy. It feels like Oscar bait really, hitting all the checklist, but in mild quantities. There's just not enough meat on this film. Soderbergh keeps giving a little and thinks its enough. Perhaps I should rewatch Traffic, I know that's a complex film.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good all around flick. Entertaining. Enjoyable.,"""Erin Brockovich"", with Julia Roberts in the title role, is a not-too-serious and entertaining film based on a true story.

Trash,"This film is simply trash, much like the woman it is about.  ERIN BROCKOVICH is a horrible movie.  Whoever thought that a woman with a bad taste in clothing, a vulgar mouth that spews obsceneties every time it opens, and continuous self-absorption could be the basis for a quality movie?  This movie tries to illustrate Erin Brockovich as a kind person with a good heart and will stop at nothing to help people and to make things right.  What a load of SH**!  Steven Soderbergh tries to fool us into believing that Brockovich is a good-natured woman trying to help the disease-striken residents within the area of PG&E.  Any wise viewer would look past this and see the truth, which is that Erin Brockovich is nothing but a bitch with a dirty mouth, a fraud, a dumbass, and not to mention a bad mother, which is well displayed when she leaves her children with a man she doesn't even know (George, who she treats like crap, even when they're together).  Another thing I couldn't stand about Erin was her selfishness and ungreatful, rude attitude that she displayed for her boss.  It seemed that every half hour she was asking for a raise, didn't seem to care when Masery was facing financial problems as a result of the lawsuit, and showed no respect for him at any point in the movie.  I guess she thought that she was the only one working her ass off in this whole thing.And another thing that really annoyed me was that this movie was praised by so many people!  The movie had no good taste much like the title character. How this movie was praised by the Oscars is the worst of all things about this movie.1.)Best Picture.  PLEASE!  This movie was probably one of the worst of the year!  It had no place to be in the running as the best of the year.  Its spot could've easily been taken by Almost Famous.2.)Best Screenplay.  Susannah Grant may have had a remote deserving for an Oscar nomination if her screenplay was true to the facts, which would've illustrated that Erin Brockowitch truly is a money-hungary fraud who dresses like a wench.3.)Best Director.  Soderbergh is a great director.  But it was nothing out of the ordinary here.  He did deserve a nomination for TRAFFIC,which he won. But the Academy shouldn't have squandered yet another nomination on something that was not worth it. 4.- Best Supporting Actor.  This was the only deserving nomination for this movie.  Albert Finney brings us the only likeable main character in this movie, and serves as the only bright spot in the film, except for maybe Marg Helgenburger.  He made the movie somewhat watchable with his strong, compelling performance. 5.- And now, last and certainly the least, BEST FU**ING ACTRESS!  Julia Roberts did a bad/OK job here.  Her performance might have been credible if she didn't accept all of these accolades.  All she did in the movie was flash her boobs, most of which were just a push-up bra, lash out at just about everyone in the movie for no good reason, and put in a sob, sympathetic facial expression, or a few tears in just to soften people up (didn't work on me Julia!).  The fact that she thought so much of her performance as to actually accept a nomination and then the award itself just shows how greedy she is.  Her nomination was a complete waste, and she couldn't hold a candle to any of those in the running.  Her nomination should've easily gone to one more deserving, such as Bjork for DANCER IN THE DARK.  The academy truly proved that it was out to boost egos and careers instead of rewarding for individual achievement.  The fact that every major awards organization (the oscars, golden globes, sag awards) and several critics associations gave their best actress honor to Roberts for her effortless performance instead of the true best actress of 2000, Ellen Burstyn, shows just how scandalous Hollywood is.  Roberts won the awards because she's the most bankable star in the business.  If these organizations did what they claimed, they would've awarded Ellen Burstyn for her heartbreaking performance in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.  Burstyn reaches out to audiences and rips their hearts out of their chests with her performance, which is unarguably the best in years, if ever, from an actress.  Not to mention the fact that Burstyn went through hell for her part, and still few gave her the recognition she deserves because they felt Julia should've won everything because she's younger, prettier(well, not really), and more people like her movies (yeah, sure: remember, Burstyn was the lead in THE EXORCIST [one of the most influential, scariest, and most talked about movies of all time in which she gave one of her best performances], not to mention her great performances in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE [for which the academy awarded her], and SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR just to name a few.)Overall, I give this an imdb rating of 1/10.  If I could give it a zero, I would.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
dazzling performance by Julia Roberts,"In its story, `Erin Brockovich' breaks little new ground.  Essentially, it joins the ranks of earlier films such as `Silkwood,' `The Insider,' `A Civil Action,' `The Rainmaker,' among others, each of which tells the tale of a common `David' (be it in the form of a whistleblowing employee or compassionate, righteous lawyer) who, against all odds, mounts a seemingly quixotic crusade against a corporate Goliath.  All the above five films expose the shoddy and often malevolent business practices of companies that have resulted in major health care crises for both their own employees as well as the residents who live near the companies' facilities.  In the case of  `Erin Brockovich,' the villain is the PG&E electrical plant located in the desert community of Hinckley, near Barstow, California.  It seems that the residents of this small town have been experiencing a mind-bogglingly high number of serious illnesses and miscarriages that PG&E has assured them are not in any way related to the activities at their site.  The company has even brought in medical professionals and toxicologists to assuage the residents' growing fears.  Almost by chance, Erin Brockovich stumbles onto this information and takes up the challenge of fighting for the rights of these victims and exposing PG&E's gross malfeasance in the process.Looking at its bare-boned plotting, one must concede that there really isn't much that is new here.  However, thanks to a pair of utterly smashing performances by Julia Roberts and Albert Finney and a beautifully well-rounded portrait of a real-life heroine, this Steven Soderbergh film emerges as a true crowd-pleasing triumph.  This may, in fact, be not only Roberts' best performance, but her finest role as well.  Erin is not a conventional do-gooder heroine.  First of all, she is often abrasive and off-putting in her demeanor.  Dressed more like a fashion devotee of Roberts' `Pretty Woman' call girl character than a serious legal executive, Erin often launches into unrestrained, obscenity-laced tirades at her boss, her loving boyfriend, even the corporate lawyer bigwigs sent to help her when the case she is making comes close to completion.  Yet, it is just this no-nonsense directness that earns her the confidence of the people she is trying so desperately to help.  A twice-divorced mother of three, she is as passionate in the defense of her own children as she is in the defense of her case.  Yet, she is a woman made up of any number of internal contradictions.  Much as she loves her children, she has made a shambles of her life in recent years.  Rootless and lacking the skills necessary to procure a well-paying job, she practically has to beg to get hired in the office of a lawyer who has failed to win her a settlement in a traffic accident case.  Staunchly individualistic, she refuses to tone down her rhetoric or her temper  or to adopt the more `professional' attire of the business world  even if it might mean that she would be taken more seriously by those around her.  She assumes that no man would be willing to consider having a serious relationship with her because of her children and marital track record, yet, when a man enters her life doing just that, her insecurities and her intense commitment to the cause for which she is fighting begin to drive him away  and her children as well.  Most fascinatingly, perhaps, we are led to wonder whether it is really the suffering people who motivate her obsessive commitment or rather, as she herself admits, the personal recognition she receives now when she walks into a room and people clamor desperately to know what she thinks on an issue.  All credit to Susannah Grant for writing a character so full of believable paradoxes.  Obnoxious as Erin is at times, her innate vitality, wisdom and warm-hearted compassion consistently shine forth.  Grant, by making her such a three-dimensional figure, mitigates much of the incredibility that lies at the root of this story, true though it may be.And, given this juicy role, Roberts is nothing short of a revelation.  She conveys each conflicting mood and character trait perfectly.  Never before has this actress brought such a breezy assurance to her every action and statement.  She literally holds this rich film together, forcing us to focus intently on the storm of emotions taking place deep inside this complex woman.  This is definitely Oscar-caliber work.  Equally brilliant is Albert Finney as Ed Masry, the lawyer for whom Erin works, a jovial, easygoing man who watches with a bemused appreciation as Erin hurls colorful invective at him, rages against the system and dresses down with withering sarcasm not only the legal representatives from PG&E but the seasoned lawyers Masry himself has hired to help bring home the case.  One of Erin's most endearing traits is that she is an equal opportunity harridan  a fact that wins Masry over every bit as much as it does us.If `Erin Brockovich' has a weakness, it comes in the form of Erin's romantic relationship with the unemployed motorcycle rider next door.  He seems simply too good to be true, and, although we know that it is necessary to fill in this particular part of Erin's life to make her portrait a well-rounded and complete one, it is still the least interesting and believable part of the tale.  We feel we are being too often distracted from the meaty center of the story.Still, this is a minor quibble about a film that works so beautifully on so many levels.  As Erin Brockovich, Julia Roberts has finally found the role uniquely suited to her enormous talents and she blazes forth more brightly than she has ever done before.  I, for one, will be roundly rooting for her come Oscar night.",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia scores in the best role of her career,"""Erin Brockovich"" is an emotional, funny drama based on a true story about a single, twice-divorced, single mother of 3 (Julia Roberts) who, after landing a job at a small legal firm, helps residents of a small town hurt by water pollution to win over $300 million in a lawsuit.  The film is excellent. Julia Roberts turns in one of the best performances I've seen ever. ""Erin  Brockovich"" is a winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful,"Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich in one of the the most touching and inspiring movies made about a small law firm bringing a huge, multi-million dollar company down. If you watch behind the scenes on the DVD, there is an interview with the real Erin Brockovich. In this interview you can really see that Julia has done a fabulous job portraying her, and although this movie is about a very serious law case, there is a touch of humor that makes the movie even more enjoyable. This movie may follow others that are great but it is so different in its own way. I don't know how to explain it so i will just call it the 'X-factor'. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves Julia Roberts and/or Albert Finney as their performances are stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Soderbergh makes something ordinary quite human.,"On paper, there was no reason for me to love this. A film with Julia Roberts in the title role, playing a loud and brass woman who takes on a court case, filled to the brim with standard moments of the underdog being beaten but refusing to give up and ultimately attaining victory. Somehow with everything going against it, the curveball of Steven Soderbergh in the director's chair got me to really appreciate something I was destined to loathe. Soderbergh is constantly challenging himself as a director and someone with his independent upbringing and sleak, digital style taking on such a plain-Jane underdog Oscar-fare story is probably the most diverse move in his career at this point. He brings a genuine humanity to it that doesn't exist in films like this, treating even the smallest throw-away characters the same way that the title character herself treated them, as if they mattered.I've never seen a Julia Roberts performance that I've liked, but in this one she was charming, witty and an all-around joy to watch. I don't think she sold the emotional moments as well as she should have, but any moment with her standing up to the fat cats that she takes on is a real crowd-pleaser. The film shines brightest anytime she shares the screen with Albert Finney, the two of them having a love/hate working chemistry that does nothing but delight. Whether they're butting heads or reveling in each other's company, these two are a real treat to see together. Finney takes a stock character and turns him into someone flawed and genuinely human. Which is what Soderbergh does with this film as a whole, taking something relatively standard and somehow adding an authenticity to it that makes it work.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Conventional Little Guy vs. Big Corporation Drama Plus Julia's Smile,"""Erin Brockovich"" is no ""Norma Rae"" -- including the tell-off-the-guy scene is no where as effective as Sally Field's challenge by the sink.The first third or so of the movie is Julia movie star bright and snappy and captures us. (All of the other women in the movie are really bland so as not to challenge Julia's flash.)In, the second third she doesn't smile and the movie fades.The last third is a legal drama that's a little guy triumph over nasty corporation.One can't even tell that the director is the same Steven Soderbergh whose two most recent movies ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"" had brilliant directorial control that stylistically added to the basic story. This shows none of that, just a straightforward feel-good story.(originally written 3/19/2000)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich,"Erin Brockovich is a modern-day David vs. Goliath story with a few notable exceptions. The villainous behemoth in this version is a faceless corporate conglomerate. The hero is a sassy, brassy, less-than-classy female with a prominently featured chassis. In the basic elements of the story line, this is a story we have heard before. The crusader vs. the corporation is a dominant theme in The China Syndrome, A Civil Action, and this year's Oscar nominee The Insider. The version where the ""good guy"" is a female working-class hero is the basic theme of Norma Rae and Silkwood. Like these latter films, Erin Brockovich is based on a real character and a real-life incident.Erin Brockovich is a twice-divorced mother with kids who finagles her way into a job working for the lawyer who lost her case in a civil trial. Erin is feisty, determined, independent, and mouthy. These very traits that get her into trouble with co-workers, friends, and family members are the traits that prove to be her greatest assets as a secretary turned paralegal. What makes the character sympathetic is her caring. She does not always show it well, but beneath the tough exterior is a woman with a heart of gold who cares deeply about her kids and is passionately committed to the families affected by corporate neglect.Julia Roberts is well-suited for the ""brassy broad with a heart-of-gold"" role. Consider her past performances in Pretty Woman (hooker with a heart of gold), Notting Hill (superstar with a heart of gold), and My Best Friend's Wedding (scheming, conniving, two-faced backstabber with a heart of gold). How could she miss?What distinguishes this film from films like Norma Rae or Silkwood however, is the witty script by screenwriter Susannah Grant. Grant was the screenwriter for Pocahantas, Ever After, and 28 Days. What these films have in common is strong-willed independent female characters. Here the synthesis of Brockovich's character, Grant's writing, and Julia Roberts' persona all work together like a charm. The best way to turn an old formula into a good film is through distinctive characters. The characters and their relationships are the real heart of this film.As a result, the film is much lighter in tone than Norma Rae or Silkwood. There are moments of high drama, but the film really shines in its humor and wit. Albert Finney is delightful as Ed Masry, Erin's boss. Julia Roberts turns in what may prove to be the best performance of her career as a working-class mom who refuses to stay down for the count. Director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight, The Limey) handles the material well and the pacing of the film is nearly perfect.Corporate neglect will become an increasingly important topic as evidenced by events in Seattle last year. By some estimates, there may be as many as 100,000 deaths per year (four times the homicide rate) as a result of ""corporate crime."" Erin Brockovich manages to raise the issue in a context that is neither preachy nor smug. But in the end this is not an issue film, but a character study, and what a character she is! Both thumbs up for Erin Brockovich.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts is very good about picking her projects.,"This is a very captivating story about a woman who finds her mission in life. ""Erin Brockovich,"" Julia Roberts (Sleeping with the Enemy)  begins to unveil a coverup of high water pollution levels that are affecting the lives of almost an entire community. The people she contacted all had several severe illnesses from cesium in ground water. PG&E had been discharging chromium 6 into water in holding ponds that they knew were leaking. The story has mystery and everybody loves movies where the little guy wins. This is one of those stories like Norma Rae and Silkwood. Julia Roberts is great as she goes around in those crazy ""trampy"" outfits that only a few people like. Attorney  ""Ed Masry""  Albert Finney (The Entertainer, Loophole) has to put up with a lot of curse words (which I really dislike) and a few punches on the verbal abuse side by Erin. But it all ends well, and they since this is based in a true story it makes the movie all more special. I have said in other comments that Julia is very good about picking her projects.Favorite Quote: Ed: ""What makes you think that you can just walk in there and find what we need.""

"Unoriginal, uninteresting","For some reason, we are asked to be impressed by the fact that 'Erin' was based on a true story.  I wasn't.  Nothing about the Roberts character was the slightest bit engaging, the great Albert Finney was wasted, the story was totally predictable, and Travolta's 'Class Action' did the same story better.  Basically, I didn't care one way or the other whether the goodies won or lost the case, or whether Erin would or wouldn't find true love with the bikie.  Everybody in the film, including the principals, was a caricature.  I saw it through to the end only because I thought my wife was interested. She wasn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Story about a remarkable woman played by a superb actress...,"The film ERIN BROCKOVICH is based on a single mother who with the help of a small law firm fights against a huge company for polluting the water resources in it's surrounding area for which people living over there were falling sick and were dying.The film has a strong script and has been edited perfectly. Steven Soderbergh has done a fantastic job in directing this film. The background score is also worth mentioning.But above all the person who has taken this film to a different league is none other than JULIA ROBERTS. In this film she has not only given an outstanding performance but expanded the boundary of what is possible. She really deserves the Oscar and the golden globe that she has won for her performance in this film. Hats off to her.

Perfect T.V.

I mean, I don't consider it to be an Oscar winner like it did! Sure, watching Julia Roberts wearing the shortest and sexiest mini skirts she found was a great idea but not enough for carrying the whole film.I'm a lawyer and many will agree with me that setting a case like the one shown in this movie isn't as easy as it appears to be. You need to have knowledge about law and culture! As a normal person pun intended it's not as easy to win such a millionaire dispute against powerful lawyers.But anyways, I know it's cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
This was the real Best Picture,"Now that I have gone through the awful wake of the oscars, and wake up realizing that no it was not a dream, I can now give my opinion of this movie.  Erin Brockovich was out of the five movies nominated, the best picture period!  It had all of the intangibles needed for a quality picture; Good lead acting, good story, good supporting actors, and finally a quality Director.  This movie was about the ""Little guy"" or ""girl"" in this case taking down the big fish.  Not only was it a feel good movie, but it was based on a true story and if you can pull off making this type of movie and make an audience think after seeing it, then it did the job.  At least Julia Roberts got an Oscar :)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to recommend...,"I think Steven Soderbergh has grown to be a very great director, one of the best living Americans in the business. I loved Out of Sight, and The Limey was really great, too. Traffic was also quite good. Now, only a couple of nights after seeing Traffic in the theater, I got to watch Erin Brockovich. Unfortunately, it was not great. I didn't really expect all that much while watching. I had heard from numerous people that Soderbergh did it just so he could make movies that he preferred to make. I don't think that that attitude is bad. If a good director has to sell out a little in order to make a great film, I say go ahead.Now Erin Brockovich isn't anywhere near a complete failure. There's a lot to like about the film. Its main problem is its extremely formulaic story (I thought Traffic had a formulaic story, too, but not on this level). Also, the fact that the action becomes repetitive is no help. At first, Brockovich's shtick (i.e., someone p***es her off (when it shouldn't, usually), so she becomes so angry at them that they eventually back off; this happens again and again and again in the film) is entertaining, albeit, not very believable (I did not feel too sorry when she is fired), but after the fifth time, the act becomes frustrating. This is especially true with the final scene, where Brockovich gets paid for a job well done. Tell me that you didn't see the joke coming from the second Albert Finney enters the room.So let us talk about acting. First, Aaron Eckhart's gentle Harley dude: I like Eckhart in Neal LaBute's films, In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors, but I don't know if he works here. Maybe it's not him in particular, but the script. His character is kind of boring. He's not well developed, and he is never interesting. In fact, I think Brockovich's whole domestic situation gets kind of boring as the narrative moves more towards the lawsuit (it begins quite compellingly). The scenes with Eckhart and the Brockovich children are almost all very cliche. None ring true, at least for me. The meet-cute between Brockovich and George (Eckhart) is quite irritating.Albert Finney: he is quite good in a pretty poorly written role. His character is not complex, but Finney manages to bring energy into the role. I liked him, and if this film is considered for some Oscars, which I doubt it will receive (except for maybe Roberts' role), Finney probably deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.Now for Julia Roberts. To speak the truth, I think Pretty Woman is the only other movie I've ever seen her in. I try to avoid her movies. She is so unbelievably beautiful that it is difficult to take her acting seriously at times. And herein lies the difficulty of my rating her performance. I could never take my eyes off of her (and it was not her breasts at all, as others have claimed that they were a great distraction, but rather her face, her lips, her eyes especially). I think Roberts did a pretty good job in the quieter moments of the film. The best scene of the film is when George tells Erin about her youngest child's first words, spoken while she was working. There, I can see that Roberts can act. Also, when she is lying to her children about having eaten near the beginning of the film. She's quite good there, too. And there are plenty of very good scenes where Brockovich forms relationships with her clients, and this becomes quite touching. The problem elsewhere is that Brockovich is written over the top. First off, she is written as if she were a Saint, or at least a Pope, since she seems to be infallible. We as the audience are lead to identify with her at every point, even when she is obviously being rude or cruel for no reason, or just when she behaves stupidly. This is being too kind to Erin Brockovich as a real person, and thus it becomes difficult to take her character or the film seriously. When she would flip out, I would begin to hate her. Her attitude ceases being funny very quickly and just becomes tiring. But I say, although my own heart is with Bjork (Dancer in the Dark), just give Roberts the Best Actress Oscar. Then she will have won one, and she won't have to do serious movies anymore. This film was, after all, produced basically to get Julia Roberts and Oscar.Soderbergh does three things worth note in this Hollywood: he uses plenty of jump cuts, by which an American audience would normally be disturbed. They are mild, and perhaps they serve to teach the regular moviegoing population about their purpose. Also, it is filmed entirely with a handheld camera. This is good for the same reason that jump cuts are good. And, most thankfully, the musical score is very underplayed, which is rare in dramas nowadays. There is a very good scene near the end when Brockovich tells a sick woman how much money she has won in the lawsuit. Usually, this scene would have been overwhelmed with musical score. But here, there is no music. That is wonderful. It is not missed at all. The only thing we have to suffer through is a terrible Cheryl Crow pop song attached to the end credits, almost certainly shoved in by execs.This film I give a 6/10. Decent, though it could have been more. It did not offend my sensibilities for the most part.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Real woman. A real story. A real triumph!,"What more can I say about Erin Brockovich, it was superb. In real life she is a truly remarkable woman and on-screen, Roberts really made me believe that she was Brockovich in a way.In my opinion, this is Julia Roberts' best role. Roles in such movies as Pretty Woman, Notting Hill and Runaway Bride don't match this one.Erin Brockovich brought out the true talent which movie lovers know Roberts has. She acted it perfectly. Being stubborn, hard-working, aggressive emotional and caring, traits I'm sure the real Brockovich has.The story of this movie concentrates on  Erin Brockovich, who has 3 kids, divorced twice and a $17,000 debt after she loses her court case after a car accident. So Erin  looks and applies for a heaps of jobs, until she goes back to the lawyer who was representing her in court and begs for a job. After she is finally given a go, Erin searches into a small towns health crisis and brings a billion dollar company to its knees.The case that made Brockovich so famous was about  a processing plant called PG+E  which contaminated the water of a small town called Hinkley. The water supply was contaminated with Hexavalent Chromium, which can cause many terrible health problems, including Headaches, Nose Bleeds, cancers (of numerous kinds),  liver, heart and reproductive failure, organ deterioration and in bad cases death. So Brockovich, with no legal experience took on the case for the people of Hinkley and helped them win. In a way it was David taking on Goliath. I also loved the relationship between Erin and her boss Ed Masry. They treated each other with low regard, but in the end respected each other for who they were. Ed was played by Albert Finney and was well done.One part of the film I can understand people not liking is the relationship between Erin and bikie boyfriend George. It was destined  never to work as Erin was focusing more on her work for the case and not him. Maybe he was an unwanted character, but then again I saw George to be a kind man who helped Erin in her greatest time of need. Then we also see that Erin puts her kids needs behind to help others. Erin loved her kids, but her sense of justice meant her family life had to suffer.There are some memorable quotes in Erin Brockovich, here are a few of my favorites:`How bout this for a number. 6, is the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of son, 2 is the number of times I have been divorced and 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.'`That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In f.....g ugly shoes.'`They're called boobs, Ed.'`Seeing as how I have no brains or legal expertise, I just went out there and performed sexual favors. Six hundred and thirty-four blow jobs in five days... I'm really quite tired.'`Not personal? That's my work in there. My Sweat, my time away from my kids..... if that's not personal, I don't know what is.'For those who have the facilities to watch DVDs, Erin Brockovich should be at the top of your list, with an impressive amount of special features including a report with Erin Brockovich herself (by the way look out for the real Brockovich in the movie) and half an hour of deleted scenes, which were interesting to see.All in all,  I hated the case and the pain those people had to endure, but I loved the way this true story was bought to the bigscreen. The courage of a single mother who felt so passionately about people who she had no ties with and wanted to see them have a new chance in life is truly inspirational.Rating: 5 Stars or 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Steven Soderbergh's Other Film From 2000,"""Erin Brockovich"" will likely be remembered as director Steven Soderbergh's other film from the year 2000 (""Traffic"") and of course for Julia Roberts' Oscar-winning performance. The film is not on par with ""Traffic"", but is still a great picture that may have been the second best film from the year. The titled character is an unconventional legal assistant whose greatest attributes are common sense and the ability to interact with anyone and everyone, no matter the situation. After mercifully receiving a job from small-time attorney Albert Finney (Oscar-nominated), Brockovich learns that the powerful Pacific Gas & Electric Company is dumping hexavalent chromium in an isolated area. This is causing many residents to become sick with strange types of cancers and other illnesses. What follows is one of the largest lawsuits in United States legal history. ""Erin Brockovich"" works because of dynamite performances by Roberts and Finney. This is easily the best work of Roberts' career and might be Finney's best performance as well. The screenplay is not as strong as it should be, but Soderbergh's direction more than makes up for the script. Overall an overwhelming success. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts best movie,"If you have not seen this movie, I assume that you live under a rock. This is the mostly factual story of Erin Brockovich. She is a struggling single mom of three kids. The story starts out with her getting into an accident and hiring a lawyer. Ultimately she loses her case because of her surly attitude and foul mouth. Unable to find work and flat broke from her accident, Erin begins to pester her lawyer Ed Massery until he agrees to hire her in a minimalistic role in his small firm. When Erin is given a seemingly simple task on a real estate case she stumbles upon one of the biggest cases of industrial poisoning and the ensuing cover-up. As they dig further and further the depth of PG&E's negligence becomes massive.This is a great movie on so many levels. Ms. Roberts shines in this role as never before and the supporting cast is equally as amazing.

This is a great movie and everyone should watch it at least once.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is one of those films that makes up for its total lack of originality with some fairly respectable acting and a few good cleavage shots.,"What was up with the low cut shirts, anyway? Was there some specific reason why Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) had her push-up bra showing above the top of her low cut shirt in every single scene she was in? In my opinion, if they are going to do something like that in a film, they better have a real good reason for it, and in this particular film, they didn't.Julia Roberts plays Erin Brockovich in the true story about a woman who took interest in a particular case she came across at the law office where she worked and ended up as the initiating force behind a tremendous lawsuit. She delivered a fairly good performance, but her personality was badly manipulated for the film. Do you really think that she was able to memorize some 650 different phone numbers, names, afflictions, relatives, etc? I don't think so. Fred freakin' Tate wouldn't even be able to do that. Besides that, her excessively loud streams of profanity grew tiring very quickly.This is an entertaining film to watch about the corruptions of a huge corporation being thrown back in its face, but the story doesn't have much strength. Despite its good intentions, it gives the illusion that financial gain is the answer if you and your entire family have become gravely ill. In the movie, the settlement to the lawsuit is seen as victory, and no more attention is paid to the sicknesses of the families. Besides that, I find it hard to believe that so many people in the same small town could have gotten that sick for so many years and no one would have even noticed. You'd think there would be some sort of pattern showing up at the local hospitals at least.Overall, Erin Brockovich is an entertaining enough movie. It doesn't break any new ground or tell anything original, but this is a type of film that is always entertaining to watch. If you're into legal thrillers, watch The Rainmaker. If you like The Rainmaker, watch The Firm. If you like The Firm, watch A Civil Action. And if you like A Civil Action and you just need more more more, watch Erin Brockovich, and watch for the real Erin Brockovich as a waitress early in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Enjoyed this just as much in my re-watch as I did years ago, a brilliant movie","I hadn't seen this in several years and I'd forgotten what a great movie it is. Of course its Julie Roberts who steals every scene and really makes this film shine. I'm not generally a fan of hers but she owns this role; outspoken, spirited, trashy doesn't have a filter, but you cheer her on because she's also hard working, loves her family is genuinely concerned about the clients and is relatable.I liked everything about this fact based drama. Albert Finney is awesome, sparring with Erin and how many of us fell for Aaron Eckhart here? Sigh. Almost unrecognizable as the nice guy biker boyfriend/babysitter.Roberts plays an outspoken, somewhat trashy single mother in her Oscar winning role, who after browbeating her lawyer into giving her a job almost singlehandedly brings down a California power company accused of contaminating a towns water supply -to the tune of 333 million dollar settlement.This is just a brilliant movie, funny, frustrating (scary regarding the big cooperation) filled with great characters and I just love seeing the little guy win for a change. 2/3/15",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""You Go Girl""","Erin Brockovich - single mom, sexy, unscrupulous - the classic 90s hero (let's face it, this movie is definitely in the 90s genre of feminist films).  What is this film really about?  On the surface, it's about a courageous woman who stands up to a large corporation in defense of some three hundred clients who she cares for very much.  How touching.  But what is it really about?  This conventional film was trying to show that justice can and should be brought about in unconventional ways.  Nothing wrong with that, right?  Of course not.  That's what heroism is about - doing that which is extraordinary to achieve good ends.  But what exactly was the extraordinary thing that she did?  Was it the fact that she used her body as an object?  Or was it that she sacrificed precious time with her already-neglected children?  Or was it her rude and often dehumanizing way of interacting with other people?

Success story.,"In real life ,the main character was arguably an admirable woman;in the movie,the character is given a treatment which is by no means convincing.First of all,Julia Roberts overplays :the rest of the cast is completely wasted,and serves as a foil to her;look at paunchy aging Finney:he has become his own caricature;Peter Coyote's part is scarcely more than a walk-on and what can we say about his female counterpart,a sexually repressed(?) earnest educated woman?Roberts' long-haired partner barely dares to say a word as well.The intentions are very dubious ;sometimes,it seems that Roberts is not at all some Florence Nightingale,but rather a go-getter who wants to do her walk of life:the last scene ,focussing on money ,is sheer bad taste .We're supposed to find her likable because she's always swearing like a trouper.But her swagger is in direct contrast to that:wherever and whenever she moves, pursuing cockroaches or meeting chic people,she seems to go out of a beauty parlor.Directing is undistinguished,recalling made-for-TV quality.Word to the wise:(if there's any of us left)try ""Silkwood "" instead:Meryl Streep is a much better thespian than Roberts,and the woman she plays did not fight for money but for dear life,because,unlike Erin,she was a victim from the start.",,Anonymous,Biography

Albert Finney is brilliant,"Okay, this film is Julia Roberts. There's no way of getting away from that. It might be a little different from her earlier films, and the role is perhaps a little more serious (a *lot* more serious than e.g. ""Pretty Woman"") than what she usually does, but it is still very much a Julia Roberts vehicle. She has got time to shine in this one. I'm not saying that that is a bad thing, because in this film it is not. Roberts is very charming and actually convincing as Erin Brockovich. The story lacks any depth, but it is still told in a satisfactory way by Steven Soderbergh. It's not his best film, but it's certainly very entertaining if about twenty minutes too long. I have to say, though, as much as I like Julia Roberts in this film, that Albert Finney was truly magnificent as her boss -- truly a great performance. (6/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Polluting water,"The film is really interesting and touching a situation created by a company without considering the problems it may bring about with its wrong productive process. When a company does what this one did, it is causing a high social cost sometimes with irreversible effects on man health and the environment. Water was contaminated by hexavalent chromium and already affected several people living closely to the factory, my question here is: how long would it take to decontaminate that water? what are the expenses necessary to solve these problems? We live today but the world of tomorrow belongs to our grandsons and granddaughters, are we to leave egoistically a polluted environment to them? The film obviously focused more on the work carried out by an intelligent woman, probably nice one because Julia Roberts was very beautiful playing this role in the film, whose name is Erin Brockovich. The insurance company where Erin works or worked should be feeling happy to have a worker like her. She was able to seriously open this case and demand the company for its deeds.My congratulations to the director Steven Soderbergh for including an important issue for today and tomorrow, i.e. pollution, in this film, and also to Julia Roberts and Albert Finney for their excellent acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly good,"Another film i managed to watch at long last. I was pleasantly surprised with this film, starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney.

I have a friend who knows Erin Brockovich and Julia did not do her much justice and over played her character in some ways. She did  not do everything herself as the movie would have you believe.

Julia at the top of her game,"ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) ***1/2 Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart, Marg Helgenberger, Peter Coyote, Cherry Jones, Tracy Walter.'Norma Rae' meets 'A Civil Action' by way of 'Pretty Woman' easily could have been the pitch for this based on a true story account of a feisty former Miss Wichita runner up/twice divorced mother of three (Roberts is superb as the eponymous character in arguably her finest acting to date) who struggles to make ends meet in a rural California town and after vehemently lobbying for a job as a legal clerk (with no prior experience) she unwittingly discovers a paper trail of immense proportions involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and its murky dealings with water contamination. The linear storytelling is excellent thanks largely to a smart straight ahead screenplay by Susannah Grant, a great ensemble cast including the gruff yet lovable Finney who gives a memorable performance as small-time lawyer Edward Masry whose paternal love for his plucky /sexy/tacky do-gooder is only exemplified as the case progresses to (seemingly) impossible odds in a modern day David Vs. Goliath lawsuit involving hundreds of infected people against a malevolent corporation.

Entertaining if not substantial . . .,"It took the talent of Steven Soderbergh to pull off a successful legal drama in Hollywood.  Coppola failed with The Rainmaker and Steven Zaillian failed miserably with A Civil Action.  Erin Brockovich takes a similar plot outline and wins because it doesn't bore the audience with anti-climatic court room scenes.  Erin Brockovich pulls on all the right strings, manipulating the audience at will.  The audience is more than willing to go along for the ride as the cliches are hidden under great direction and inspired acting and the somewhat made for TV plot is given expert treatment from Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich will give Soderbergh the box office respect he deserved from Out of Sight and may land Julia her second Oscar nod.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Erin the savior.,"Director Steve Soderbergh is now three for three on directing both excellent and critical acclaim films, three years in a row!  First was his very witty and super hip 1998 hit, OUT OF SIGHT with George Clooney, and Jennifer Lopez (before she wanted to sing full-time).  Then last year was the stylish and dark THE LIMEY with Terrance Stamp in a role that was at least Oscar worthy of a nomination.  Now there is his newest film, a film that isn't as stylish or as hip as the previous two, but it's still a darn great movie. Soderbergh's newest film is ERIN BROCKOVICH, which is based on a true story.  The real life story has the title character (Julia Roberts) who is a single mother of three, who is looking for a job.  Erin will lie during her interview or anything, just so she can take care of her children.  Erin then goes to her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who eariler represented her in a car accident case, and begs for a job. Ed decides to give Erin a job and wants her to investigate a pro-bono case on a small California town called Hinkley who filed a lawsuit against the Pacific Gas & Electric company for contaminating the town's water supply and are aware of it.  It's so sad that the town's people are getting tumors, degenerative organs, and other freak symptoms; and the company tells the town citizens that everything is all right and the chemicals that they put in the water are suppose to ""help"" the town. Well, Erin decides to investigate this problem, and becomes friends with many of the residents of Hinkley, including Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) who is suffering from breast cancer, due to the posioning of the water. Meanwhile, Erin stirkes up a romantic relationship with a biker who just moved in next door named George, (Aaron Eckhart).  While Erin is looking for the truth with what is going on in Hinkley, George becomes the caretaker of the children, and isn't quite happy about it.  And also, Erin has problems of her own when Ed Masry hires a couple of high priced attorneys, Kurt Potter (Peter Coyote) and Theresa Dallevale (Veanne Cox) to take over the case of the lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric. Before you begin to shout, ""this sounds like A CIVIL ACTION or SILKWOOK,"" well it isn't.  This is more of a movie that focuses in depth of one woman's crusade to reveal the truth, and go up against powerful attorneys, and a powerful company.  ERIN shows what a hard working mother has to go through to raise a family single handed and try to do well in her job.  In one touching scene, Erin is in tears as her boyfriend tells her over her cell phone that her youngest child started to say her first words. But Erin missed it, since she's devoting her time with her work on Hinkley. I was very impressed with Julia Roberts performance in ERIN BROCKOVICH. She isn't much of that ""cute girl next door"" role that she is known for like in RUNAWAY BRIDE or PRETTY WOMAN.  Instead, she's vulgar, loud, and pushy, but also caring, committed, and heartfelt.  This film proves that Juila Roberts is a actress who is willing to take any role that she is given, and I think she should do more great serious acting roles like this one. People and critcs who also see Roberts wearing short and skin-tight clothes, only see this film skin deep. I was also enjoying the performance of Albert Finney, who I was very glad to see in a major film role.  Finney plays Ed very well, at times a boorish old man, at other times, a man who like Erin can be caring and have a heart.  Finney is also funny at times with his facial reactions to Erin's smart aleck remarks on his legal decisions and his own comments to Erin's comments.  It's hard to believe that this is the same man who played TOM JONES thirty-seven years ago. ERIN is a very well done film, in it's own way.  While SILKWOOD focused on revealing the truth, A CIVIL ACTION focused on the legal sense, ERIN focuses on what it takes to get the truth out in the open.  The pacing of the film is fast paced and entertaining (even for a film that is 131 mins.), the acting is great, and the story is very inspiring.  With such films as this one, and THE INSIDER, one wonders on how these big and powerful companies can get away with this illegal activity without being revealed.  Until then, the truth is out there, and it's on the local cinema.  ****1/2 (out of five)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is definetly a Hollywood picture and good causes are usually received well these days both by the public and the Oscars.  I recommend this as a good Hollywood movie, and Roberts does a good job with what she has but I've seen her better. She probably won the Oscar for her career, but oh well why not.

"Unique heroine, uplifting tale","Erin Brockovich. Starring Julia Roberts. Co-starring Julia Roberts's cleavage. OK that's a bit of a stretch. But not by much. And it begins to tell you something about the woman Roberts plays. Erin Brockovich is not the bashful type. Loud, profane and quick to flaunt her, uh, assets. Erin's quite a package. And Roberts brings that package to the screen wonderfully. The excellent performance of the film's star helps gloss over some of the film's failings. There's a great story to work with here but you get the sense that story could have been told a little better. But Roberts keeps the film moving along best she can, whenever it threatens to veer well off course she's there to pull it together. The end result is a film which is perhaps not outstanding but certainly enjoyable and well worth seeing.So who is Erin Brockovich anyway? She's an unemployed single mother facing a desperate struggle to make ends meet. She talks her way into a job as a file clerk in a law office. Her boisterous personality and skimpy attire do not make her very popular amongst her female co-workers. And she continues to exasperate her boss, lawyer Ed Masry, who has no idea what to do with her. What he'd probably like to do is get rid of her. But when Erin starts digging into a real estate case which oddly has a slew of medical records tied to it things change. It becomes pretty clear that a massive cover-up has taken place, a huge utility company hiding the fact they have contaminated a town's water supply. Ed realizes Erin has hit on something. And now the two of them are going to form a very unlikely team. Erin hurtling forward at the speed of light and Ed trying to rein her in. Together they can hope to accomplish something quite remarkable, winning justice for a town full of innocent people whose lives have been destroyed.This film belongs to Julia Roberts all the way. She's on the screen for virtually every second of the film's running time. But in Albert Finney, who plays Ed Masry, Roberts has a very worthy foil. Erin Brockovich is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, full of determination to do what is right and win justice. Ed Masry is older, wearier, worn-down and inclined to do what is easiest. The actors playing the roles, Roberts and Finney, bring the contrast between the characters to life beautifully. It is in their interplay that the film has most of its best moments.There are times the movie struggles to move its story along. It sometimes gets bogged down in legal procedure. It brings in characters it doesn't make the best use of, most notably George, a biker played by Aaron Eckhart. Erin and George have a romantic relationship of sorts but the movie never spends enough time with the couple for us to really care how that part of the story plays itself out. The movie also glosses over some key parts of the real-life story, including Erin's own illnesses she suffered with during her investigation into the maladies of the townspeople. That was a chance for some dramatic tension which went begging. And there are some aspects of the case which are never made sufficiently clear. For instance there's one woman in the town who Erin works on tirelessly to get her to sign on to the lawsuit against the utility company. This woman is apparently the key to the whole thing. Why is she so important? The movie never begins to tell us. This is by no means the most dramatic of legal thrillers. There are no great twists and turns, no shadowy villains lurking in the corners. But what the movie might lack in dramatic zest it makes up for in heart. Roberts and Finney give tremendous performances and they carry the film along to a satisfying end. Maybe Erin Brockovich, the movie, falls somewhat short of greatness. But Erin Brockovich, the woman, did great things and she makes for a great movie character. And in this case that's enough to make this movie a success.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the most over-rated films of the year,"Like Dancer in the Dark (and unlike good over-rated films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Almost Famous which had over-rating it's biggest flaw), this film has over-rating not at it's biggest flaw, but in a midst of them.  Steven Soderbergh made gold with Traffic, but Erin Brockovich is the lowest of his fodder, and while it is OK, it might've been better (or possibly not).Julia Roberts plays a mid western hick with 3 kids and no husband or job, and gets a job working with lawyers all the while distracting guys with a boost in her shirt that would make Tyra Banks feel intimidatied (for only one reason).  She then begins to get smart and start to help her firm in a case.  Often quite unbelievable, even if there are actually a few convincing moments, however the story seems like Rosewood or Civil Action (the second one was much better) and probably most over-rated of all is Roberts.

Norma Rae in a WonderBra,"Julia Roberts is winsome and not at all cloying in this *Silkwood* meets *Love Canal* meets *Marie* meets *Pretty Woman* extravaganza. In fact, I'd almost admit I'm beginning to like her, now that I've gotten past all the years of oppressive hype. But it's not her fault. She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in  beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial  playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that  for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel. Finney is excellent as her boss, and the handsome Latham is wasted as the boyfriend when the love story just kind of fizzles out. Many say it's the best work Roberts has done. I wouldn't know.

"Great lady, great story, great actress","This is a fine movie based on the true story of a remarkable woman.  She's not a crusader.  In fact, at the opening of the story she can't even get a job.  Through an accident, in which her car was hit by one that ran a red light, she goes after justice.  Her own legal problems get her involved with a law firm run by Albert Finney, a great foil for this aggressive and independent lady.  In his office, she stumbles upon evidence of a massive injustice committed by a utility company, and works alone to uncover the enormity of the crime.  She discovers that in the town near the company's plant, people have grown sick  in some cases fatally  through the utility's criminal disposal of a carcinogen, contaminating their water.  She learns the legal processes by which the sufferers can be compensated.  By sheer willpower and persistence, she collects the affidavits needed to launch a class-action lawsuit.  A `David and Goliath' parallel is pointed out in the dialog.  As she learns, we learn.  If this sounds academic, it emphatically is not.  Erin, as splendidly played by Julia Roberts, is a dynamic personality, and the film is a detective story with suspense, excitement and humor.  In fact, after tossing off a wisecrack about having used `sexual favors' (she didn't) to amass the hundreds of signatures needed, Julia delivers one of the funniest lines in the last five years of movies.  Erin herself  now Erin Brockovich-Ellis, a popular name  appears briefly in the movie as a waitress.  She also speaks as herself in one of the worthwhile DVD extras.  Don't expect to find the Julia of that insipid um-er-um `Nothing Hill.'  Her Erin is a wholly different woman, a heroine even greater than her own story.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Plenty of eye candy, but not enough meat.","I went to see this movie because of all the buzz about Julia Robert's Oscar worthy performance. After it was over, I believe Albert Finney was better. Not that Julia's bad, but we've seen this character before, Sally Field in Norma Rae and Meryl Streep in Silkwood, come to mind. The only difference is the southern accent that Julia Roberts smartly declined to use. Even the plots are similar; White trash woman, ignores her kids and her man because of her cause against the big mean Corporation. I do think that Julia is by far the most attractive of the bunch however. Out of the 50+ costume changes she makes in this movie (with only $74 in the bank I might add) all but two of them have her breasts popping out at all angles. I think the makers of the film made a conscious decision to have Julia parade around in sexy outfits to keep our mind off of the boring plot-line. There was never a doubt in my mind how the movie would turn out, and the fact that it was based on a true story didn't make any difference from the re-treads coming out of Hollywood for a while now (look for the real Erin Brokovich doing a cameo as a waitress in a restaurant. She's no Julia!). Erin Brokovich's cause was to bring suit against a power company for contaminating a community with chemicals it uses in its plant. The problem is the movie attempts to show you almost every victim of the contamination until the audience gets jaded and numb and it loses its impact. The movie would have been better if it had focused on one family or victim, like the child who is suffering from cancer. I wanted to feel for the victims, but it's hard to give emotion to 600+ people in a two hour movie. The sub-plots were weak as well, although the character of George, the Harley riding, lover/baby-sitter/maid was refreshing. I gave this movie a rating of 6 because of the performances and in spite of the story. I think by year's end there will be performances by actresses more deserving of the Oscar than Julia, but she should get a special award for most frequent use of the ""F-Word"" by an actress.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Caring too much,"My favourite film about a corporate lawsuit is Atom Egoyan's 'The Sweet Hereafter', which features a shifty, self-hating lawyer and a tragedy where it's very unclear whether anyone is to blame, and even if they are, whether anything is to gain by holding them to account. Stephen Soderbergh's 'Erin Brockovich' is a rather different story, in which Erin (played by Julia Roberts) brings a multi-million dollar corporation to its knees through a simple combination of loving her kids, wearing short skirts, swearing a lot and above all else, by caring too much. The latter is really her trump card - whenever there's a dispute about any point in the case, the corporate lawyers are always wrong and Erin is right because she cares. The film is based on a true story, and maybe this is actually how it happened, but it certainly doesn't provide any moral ambiguity to interest the viewer. In true American style, the happy ending is that all the good characters make several million dollars.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"One Big Heap of Fake, But an Awfully Entertaining One","What's up with Steven Soderbergh? How can the same director make an intelligent and complex, and decidedly non-mainstream film, like ""Traffic"" and this high-gloss, populist version of ""Norma Rae"" in the same year? He makes ""Sex, Lies & Videotape,"" then he makes ""Ocean's Twelve,"" and then he turns around and makes ""Bubble."" I don't get it. Is he attempting to stretch his versatility as a director, or is he just wildly inconsistent?""Erin Brockovich"" is outrageously ridiculous, and doesn't maintain even the barest grip on reality. It exists solely as an opportunity for Julia Roberts' devoted fans to see her tear up the screen and give anyone standing within 20 feet of her on screen a what-for, but it doesn't really ask her to act. Roberts is further indication that someone's star power is in inverse proportion to his/her talent (see Halle Berry, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston). Roberts would be nothing as an actress (as evidenced by her recent panned Broadway debut) without the fakery of cinema. She needs good lighting, clever editing, expert hair dressers to tame that lion's mane of her's. She's at her best when a director clears everyone else out of her way and lets the camera linger on her in close-up, which is what Soderbergh does here. Compare her's to the feisty performance delivered by Sally Field in ""Norma Rae"" to see just how unconvincing Roberts is.But, and this is a big ""but,"" all of that aside, ""Erin Brockovich"" is enormously entertaining, as these liberal fight-against-the-system movies always are. The film is helped tremendously by Albert Finney, who matches Roberts every step of the way and has a boatload of chemistry with the leading lady. If it weren't for his presence, the Julia Roberts love-fest would become overbearing.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I would be laughing one moment, and then the next instant I'd be teary eyed.It's been a long time since I've watched a movie that brought pure entertainment to the audience.  What a story!! I wonder what the PG&E people thought when they watched this, I'm sure some have.This is one movie you don't want to screw up with casting, because it portrayed people who were suffering things one could only imagine.  And indeed, me and my friends indeed felt their pain and suffering.  A movie that takes on various levels of consumption and alleviation.  Well done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Underdog with ample cleavage,"Erin Brockovich offers a classic tale of the little guy (in this case, gal) going up against the system. What makes this story somewhat more appealing than the usual fairytale is that it is based loosely on a true story about a real woman. The script is linear, with much slapstick-type humor and nearly non-stop footage of Julia Roberts´ barely clothed body.Everyone likes the underdog to win. It gives us hope that the human spirit can prevail even against overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable forces. There is some attempt at romantic comedy here and there, but mostly the failure of Erin´s relationship reveals why she is twice divorced despite being gorgeous and sassy.This movie is okay. Nothing to rave about, and nothing I will ever watch again, but it had its moments. And the little guy (gal) won. The End.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Helpless sheep,"Simply, this is the kind of movie that keeps people helpless.  When I saw it, everyone applauded, and my blood boiled.  There is no St. Julia gonna sweep down and save your asses.  It's a fantasy (yes, I know it's based on a true story--repeat...it's only [and always] a movie).  It's a fantasy in which the diseased lie around  without any effect on their own situation--where the working class is powerless, waiting for the tits of salvation to come and save them.

Much ado,"This film itself wasn't bad. Of course, being based on a true story helps. However, as I watched this film, I found myself wondering why Julia Roberts got an Oscar for best actress. To me, she essentially plays the one-dimensional characters she's perfected in chick flicks like Runaway Bride, Pretty Woman and Notting Hill. If there's a more overrated actress out there than Ms. Roberts, I'd love to see them. Her winning an award has led me to conclude the academy awards are nothing more than a popularity contest. The fact that she has an Oscar while actors like Gary Oldman have not even a nomination is, to me, farcical.",,Anonymous,Biography

Julia busts out...,"She calls it like she sees it and uses her physical attributes to provoke confrontation.  Julia Roberts IS Erin Brockovich, the high school educated, single mother of three, who uncovers a great injustice, and goes up against a billion-dollar, corporation to win the largest settlement in a direct-action law suit in U.S. history.She is an unconventional heroine;   speaks her mind, swears like a truck driver, dresses like a tart, is passionate, sexy, warm, funny and irrepressible.  There hasn't been this much cleavage since ""Show Girls"" and there's anti-freeze running through your veins if she doesn't completely win you over.Erin Brockovich is in the same category as ""Silkwood""  though not as heavy. Julia Roberts is no Meryl Streep, but hey, she's very good, quite funny, and smartass one-liners are her forte.This is a Danny DeVito, Jersey Films production, Steven Soderburg director = GREAT JOB!!, Albert Finney = Fantastically subtle, perfect, Aaron Eckhart = SUPER as the hunky, biker boyfriend, Cherry Jones = intense, Peter Coyote = great, Erin Brockovich = look for her in a cameo as the blonde waitress in the first 5 mins of the movie",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, but not great","There's really nothing wrong with this movie. It's well-scripted, well-captured, well-acted (especially by Julia Roberts, but I'm sure I'm not the first to say so), well-staged, and well-decorated. There's a level of realism here not seen in a lot of movies, and I suppose that's something that gives the movie credit. But the truth is there's not much here.Julia Roberts is marvelously natural, and Albert Finney complements her well, though, truth be told, he only has one scene where his acting can really show off. There are touching moments between Brockovich and her kids and between Brockovich and George, her main squeeze during the movie. Marg Helgenberger gives a nice turn as a depressingly disparate victim of the company that Brockovich is attacking. But it all adds up do a genuinely moving but formulaic film that seems to add nothing new to the genre but one more movie.A lot of people seem to lift the movie up because of how brave its main character is and what she stands for. It's a worthy cause, to be sure, but is it cause to label Erin Brockovich as a great movie? I don't think so. It's good, I enjoyed it, but it's nothing special.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Witty, funny, heart-breaking, and sassy.","It should be stated at the outset that I am a rabid Steven Soderbergh fan, so my opinion may be slightly biased. But this film still really did it for me. I know, you're thinking ""Do we need another little-guy-takes-on-the-corperate-giant movie?"" No, of course not. But this film manages to make it interesting again. The human drama, which is of course the centerpiece for any such story, and seemed so forced in films such as A Civil Action, came across as achingly real. And the performances. Ah, Steven, no one call pull a performance out of an actor like you. Having never been a Julia Roberts fan, I was blown away by her in this film. She was... REAL. I was able to forget that it was the ""Pretty Woman"" on the screen. In fact, the whole film was real. The broke single mom lives in a dump of a trailer which is not nicer than my apartment, as I see so often in movies. The woman dying of cancer is emaciated and hard to look at, not Cameron Diaz with a shaved head.Anyway, enough rambling. Great movie, fun to see with a crowd, lots of laughs and lots of heart tugs.

Except, perhaps, in the whole relationship between Erin and her boyfriend, in which he's the one taking care of the kids all the time.I imagine that very quickly this movie will become known only for Julia Roberts' cleavage.  It could be close to being a good movie, but the Erin character is a little too perfect, too cliched in her ""I'm the poor, uneducated woman trying to take care of three kids and fight the evil power company.""

Care until it hurts,"Think about the person in your life who's a thorn in your side, that annoying person who knows exactly where your buttons are and when to push them; that person who, no matter how hard you try to refute their words, you have to admit `you're right' on a regular basis.  This person isn't perfect--they too have their weaknesses, their flaws, but whenever you try to throw these flaws in their face, they come up with something even more incriminating about you to throw back.  You hate this person and love them dearly at the same time, because without them, you'd probably be in a gutter somewhere. That person you are thinking of is your 'Erin Brockovich.'  If you see the highly entertaining new Steven Soderbergh film named for her, you'll see my point.Hollywood does love the underdog.  When we're introduced to our heroine, played to perfection by Julia Roberts, she has no money, no job, and no marketable skills with which to get one.  Here we see the frustration anyone encounters when looking for a job: `If only they would just give me a chance, I'd show them...'  Personality goes a long way, but isn't enough to land a job, even an entry-level one.  Personality's something Erin's got a bit too much of, unfortunately.  Her life so far has been one long disappointment and frustration and desperation has its way of creeping to the surface.One of the amazing things about Erin is that even when she's hanging onto the thinnest of threads, she never backs down.  For instance, she finally lands a job from her lawyer, Ed Masry (played by the brilliantly-cast Albert Finney), who takes pity on her because he lost her neck injury lawsuit.  Her wardrobe is limited to bright-colored, revealing tops and short skirts.  Ed starts to give her the standard `workplace attire' speech after she's been there a while.  She plainly refuses to change her wardrobe, citing `I think I look good' in her defense.  The way she says it leaves no room for argument, no room to question.  Suddenly, her wardrobe makes all the sense in the world!Then comes the PG&E lawsuit.  After Erin reveals her findings to one family who have all become sick in one form or another, many other families begin to come forward.  Masry now has a very large civil case on his hands, and continually denies he has the resources to handle it.  Erin, of course, believes otherwise.  The case will require a ton of research, thousands of signatures, costly expert witnesses.  All Ed sees is money piling up that may never be repaid.  Erin sees people who have been wronged and lied to. She makes her argument and, again, it makes all the sense in the world.""Erin Brockovich"" is about the power of giving a damn.  Erin cares so much it hurts.  She knows each face, age, disease, phone number, and address of the people she's fighting for.  The film tells you that this kind of compassion is something that no law school can ever teach.  She's smart, she cares, and she's willing to fight.  That's all she needs.It's good to see that life under the guidance of a big studio hasn't cramped Mr. Soderbergh's style, at least not too much.  Handheld camera is used almost exclusively, which makes you feel like it's really happening, like you're right there watching it.  This is a simple story and he tells it straight, rarely dipping into his usual bag of tricks.  For my money, Mr. Soderbergh is the best, most vital director working in Hollywood right now. I'm glad he was hired to make ""Brockovich,"" but have to admit I'd like to see him return to the less conventional style of his other recent work, ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey,"" two of the best films of the nineties.Grade: B",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I am not saying a good movie HAS to stick with you for the rest of your life, but I should have been able to tell you something about what happened, I just saw it three days ago.   I guess this is my way of saying its rather unmemorable. I am glad it got made, mostly on Julia's name, I'd imagine.And speaking of memorable - there is not a chance in hell I think anyone deserves Oscars for their work in this.  An Oscar winning movie should make an lasting impression, and as good as this movie was, it does not belong with other heavy-duty past Oscar winners.Ellen Burstyn deserves the Oscar Julia will win.  Sorry about that but if you saw Burstyn in ""Requiem for a Dream"", there is no way you'd disagree.  I can think fifteen actresses that could have done ""Erin"" just as well as Julia, if not better. Janet McTeer, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett, etc etc etc. are all capable but not BIG BOX OFFICE.I enjoyed Eckhardt very much and Julia owes him a thanks.

Dubious real-life situation lends itself poorly to the big screen,"Let's say for a moment that Pacific Gas and Electric actually poisoned a community's water supply to ""enhance shareholder value."" Is there really anything inspirational about a film that chronicles such an event? I would join the chorus of just persons demanding that each victim receive a large monetary sum in addition to effective medical treatment, but not jump for joy at a film exploiting the tragedy. Especially when the star of the film is...Julia Roberts??? Her grossly irritating performance was enough to roil even Ms. Brockovich herself, and I can see why. Yet plenty of cinemagoers appreciate that level of acting, and if you're among them, then this will certainly tickle your fancy. Keep in mind, however, that numerous independent reports have refuted Ms. Brockovich's claims of environmental toxicity as total bogus. Yet she received a larger multimillion dollar settlement from PG&E than did a number of the supposedly afflicted litigants. There is no shortage of corporate villains in the USA who deserve to be chastised, but it seems this film furthered the blame of the wrong people.",,Anonymous,Biography

Everything about her, as a middle-aged, twice-divorced mother of three who fears her life may be slowly going down the drain, is beautifully performed for the screen.An excellent cast and wonderful--if obscenity-laced--screenplay make up for a storyline which is not too entirely original (small lawyer firm vs. big business).

I liked the movie so much that I would give 12 or 13 out of ten if I could. There is not much romance in the movie like Notting Hill or Pretty Woman, but the plot, the mother role which Julia played to a perfection makes this movie impressive for me though I'm a fan of romance movies.

"Showcase for Roberts, but not much else.","This movie struck me as primarily a vehicle to put Julia Roberts on display - and that is not without its positive aspects. But did I ever once believe that I was not seeing Julia Roberts play Erin Brockovich? No. This was too much a showpiece for Roberts, rather than a movie that could seriously involve us in a drama with tremendous potential. I think it might have been more affecting to have the real Erin Brockovich play the part.I like Albert Finney, but he seemed less than convincing in this. In a scene where he is standing on a stage before a large audience trying to convince them to sign on to a deal that was probably in their best interests, but that many did not take to, he was not convincing to me. After his speech, Roberts told him, ""You were good."" But he wasn't.Many scenes were clearly enhanced for dramatic and humorous effect and I never felt that we were seeing a true story unfold. Compare this with ""Silkwood,"" a movie with a similar theme. There the focus was on the story and not on the star power of its protagonist. Or compare it to the recent ""Pollock,"" where you felt you were seeing the real thing played very straight.Having said all this, I have to admit that this movie did go down pretty smoothly while I was watching it.

"""...quite possibly Julia Roberts' best performance to date...""","Erin BrokovichJulia Roberts rose to fame in 1990's ""Pretty Woman,"" a forgettable yet - somehow - cherished romantic comedy that never lets her - or us - forget how ugly she is and was.However, ""Erin Brokovich"" is easily Ms. Roberts' best performance - by far.The story is based on real incidents. It follows Erin Brokovich (Roberts): a single mom with ""thirteen dollars in savings."" She finally lands a job working for a lawyer, Ed (Albert Finney) who keeps her in his building only because he owes her for something.And then, one day, Brokovich discovers something horrifying: Local citizens are deformed and have died because a corporation has been poisoning water. So, Brokovich investigates and takes the evil organization to court, pretty much.The film, directed by up-and-coming Steven Soderbergh, whose work on ""Traffic"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" was amazing, is not really a great movie, but it is a definite must-see. Women will love it because it is a girl-power movie, and guys will enjoy it because it's not too sentimental. I'm also guessing they'll like it because of what Julia Roberts wears throughout the film - tight-fitted clothing.Roberts does try hard to give her best performance - and pulls it off well. She may seem a bit desperate - using the F-word about twenty-something times - but she catches the audience's attention and breaks away from just playing Julia Roberts. I think this is the only role I've seen Roberts in - other than ""Conspiracy Theory"" - where she plays someone other than herself. It's interesting, really.Albert Finney is great as Ed. I love the end of the film, because the smirk on his face is just so...Albert Finney! Throughout the film he keeps his strong screen persona while entertaining the audience. He is a calm, choice-actor. He doesn't go for the easy way out. He stretches for different roles. I rarely see an actor do this, and the only other leading actor who I can think of that regularly takes co-star roles is Gene Hackman - he takes roles that he likes for the challenge. He doesn't take the easy way out.Steven Soderbergh rose to fame with this film, and it's no wonder why. The orange tint of the film provides a gritty and realistic feel - not your average girl-power film. One thing I like about Soderbergh's film is that most of the time you can expect something: The orange tint and a heck of a good movie.While ""Erin Brokovich"" is in no way a GREAT movie, it is good, and quite possibly Julia Roberts' best performance to date.4/5 stars -John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Biography

Her best role, she is awesome, sexy, powerful - a total powerhouse performance for her in this film.Roberts plays Erin Brockovich, a fiesty yet nice person who is desperate for a job so she can feed her 3 lovely children. When she finds one, she see's that the water safety in her small town is not good and there begins the marvellous story that is ""Erin Brockovich""My no. 10 movie. My rating : Obviously 10/10.Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The unlikely heroine,"The movie Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is based on a real story and gives the audience a heroine version of David and Goliath. Never portrayed as a martyr, Erin, a twice-divorced mother of 3, continues to fight for a job so she can provide for her family. Even though Erin is constantly viewed as unqualified and undereducated, we see a woman who uses her street smarts, quick wit, and sarcasm to level the playing field and be the unlikely heroine.Injured in a car accident, Erin hires attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who arrogantly reassures her that she would be victorious. But when the judge didn't agree, Erin went to Ed looking for a job. As Erin senses his hesitation, she asks him not to make her beg, and hesitantly Ed hires her as a file clerk.As Erin eagerly learns the ropes, she tries to understand why medical documents are in with real estate sales. With permission from Ed, Erin goes out into the field. As she speaks to residents and finds conflicting documentation at the County water plant she seeks out a toxicologist at UCLA. It is then that she starts to uncover Pacific Gas and Electric's (PG&E) dark secrets.Erin overcame judgmental attorneys daily, but it was watching her reaction to her boyfriend George (Aaron Eckhart) that had me rooting for her from the couch. As he blamed her job for his loneliness and taking her time away from her children, George proves he is just like the other men in her life. They all leave when they don't get what they want. Erin sees that the personality traits that have held her back for so long is what makes her the voice for the residents of Hinkley.The cinematography gives the audience multiple points of view, but it is the subjective point of view that allows the audience to connect emotionally with the residents of Hinkley. As Erin talks to Annabelle Daniels, a 10-year-old girl who is fighting a brain tumor, the camera zooms in for a close-up that shows the suffering and fear that the Daniels family is going through. The use of natural lighting was another effect that added to the realistic setting throughout the movie. As Erin and George drive out to give Donna Jenson the news from the settlement we can see the colors and glow from the sunset as it not only warmed their faces but also the land around them. The sun gave a natural warmth as it radiated off the sand and sparse greenage. The audience gets to see both sides of Erin the compassion and empathy that she has for the families of Hinkley and the brutally honest unfiltered side she uses when she feels that she isn't being respected by co-workers and other attorneys. The natural lighting that was used created a visually soft side of Erin in direct contrast to the tone of the character; as if putting a spotlight on the unlikely heroine.The character Erin Brockovich is similar to Vivian Ward (Pretty Women), also played by Roberts. Both women were judged by the outside world but used their street smarts, wit, and sarcasm to win over the hearts of the viewers and the other characters in the movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Great,Can't rave about this film enough. Julia Roberts was born to play this role. The movie was a bit slow in places however I agree that the subject matter isn't the most captivating from a story telling perspective. Well Done.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood"", it ain't ...","In 1974, in ""A Woman Under the Influence"", Gena Rowlands gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Ellen Burstyn, a struggling mother in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"".In 2000, in ""Requiem For a Dream"", Ellen Burstyn gave one of the most extraordinary female performances ever as a woman alienated by her desire to please everyone, yet lost the Oscar to Julia Roberts, a struggling mother in ""Erin Brokovich"".Hollywood must have a thing for struggling mothers, I guess. But Julia Roberts' acting didn't convince me on that particular area, call it the anger from knowing that her performance beat up Ellen Busrtyn's heart-breaking performance, I call it the 'boobs' effect. Once we got that Erin Brokovich was a free-spirited single mother who loved to dress with tight skirts and deep décolleté highlighting her beautiful assets, could that be made a little bit less distracting, for plot's sake?The film had the premise: an uneducated woman crusading against a California power lawsuit accused of poisoning water's supply and ultimately triumphing, far from the tragic heroine figure sacrificing herself, she gets the largest settlement ever paid in a direct action and her life financially improves (I hope her wardrobe tastes did too, from what I saw, it did, sexy outfits, but expensive ones).Anyway, that kind of 'David vs. Goliath' story is pure gold for Hollywood, and Steven Soderbergh was right to believe in it, even 'Erin Brokovich' sounded more cinematic than any fictional name. But since the story is already phenomenal, why make Erin such a 'remarkable' woman from the very start? Why not allow Julia Roberts' undeniable charisma to disappear within her character?I supposes Soderbergh tried to show some three-dimensionality and even succeeded by questioning whether Erin was motivated by justice or by the selfish desire to be the one (and only one) who pulled the giant on his knees, to prove herself capable. But damn, I couldn't get my eyes of Roberts' breasts all through the film, using Peter Griffin's vocabulary, as far as breasts (and legs, too) were concerned, ""the film insisted upon itself"", so much it even diminished the merit of Julia Roberts who's precisely supposed to play that kind of woman, at one point, I wondered whether it was Erin or 'Pretty Woman' I was watching.Burstyn diluted herself in Sara Goldfarb's personality; Roberts relied too much on that superficial facade, as if she (or writers) thought we would only 'love' that she could outsmart smarter people unless we get the total opposite feeling from the beginning. I know this film is supposed to make you feel good for the victims of one of the most disgraceful injustices ever, well, I felt good for them, but that was the predictable emotional pay-off, everything that happened before was handled like 'obligatory plot devices', each time, in an over-the-top way.Starting with the heroine: the struggling mother, the ultimate female 'underdog' figure, she lives alone with three children and doesn't trust men, because they all treated her like crap, and women in her office aren't any kinder. Maybe we're supposed to empathize with Erin, while we know every single woman who appears with these outskirts would not be watched with trustful eyes. But that's okay, she has the right to be the way she is, no matter how hypocritical it is to flash her (beautiful) body so eagerly and then wanting to be judged for smarts.The irony here is that her clothes do make a point sometimes. For instance, when she goes to the water company and tries to flirt with the guy behind the counter to get some incriminating files, it makes sense, but she's always dressed like that, so, the point is lost. Let's get back to the clichés' department, at one point, Erin falls in love with George, a tough biker, but the guy doesn't provide anything to the film apart from being a plot-filler. Just compare Aaron Eckhart's role with Sam Elliot in ""Mask"" and you get the idea, the screenplay turned realistic stuff into pure fictionalized drama.That's not even the worst, George pushes her to abandon the case when she's threatened. Maybe that's what happened in real life, but the way it was handled in the film was painfully unrealistic. Couldn't Erin tell George what her fight was about? I would have believed such a considerate man would respect Erin's efforts and even try to help her but no! He was selfishly complaining about the time she spent outside, and naturally, when he left, I don't know who couldn't see that coming.The same unrealistic stuff happens again with Ed Masri, her employer played by Albert Finney. He fires Erin after three unjustified days off. He could have asked for explanations, or she could at least tell him, it would have cleared the misunderstanding. No, that was too convenient and we had to wait for five or ten minutes again. And I can go on and on, when the case is given to a bigger lawyer's office, one of the new assignees try to get in touch the plaintiffs, we know, it's a matter of time before Erin gets back on the road again.The material wasn't revolutionary, and the film is relatively honest in the way it handles the case, no surprise witness, no spectacular revelation, no physical threats apart from the phone call. But the writing, directing and acting should have learned one thing or two from the 'New Hollywood' era. Something like ""Norma Rae"" or ""Silkwood"" for instance, but there's a quality in Sally Field and Meryl Streep that lacks in the 2000's Julia Roberts, and this is not a critic, Roberts is superb, but for once, she's victim of her superbness.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A movie that will make you laugh, while bringing a tear to your eye","Erin Brockovich is a movie that contains the lot. From the acting right through to the plot this movie is a definite must see flick. Julia Roberts is at an all-time best in this a-class movie. All of the co-stars are magnificent. They all put in a top class performance and made the movie worth seeing.Even though this is based on a true story it is really a well-thought out and planned movie. The basic storyline is about Erin Brockovich, a jobless, mother of three who has been divorced twice. She hardly has a hundred dollars in her bank account and the only thing holding her from suicide are her kids.But one day when she is hit be a reckless driver and takes him to court she loses. Annoyed at her lawyer she decides to force him into giving her a minimum wage job. He accepts and whilst she is doing her job she comes across a case which she wants to investigate upon. She is given permission and goes ahead.From there onwards it is Roberts and Finney taking over the show in this heart stopping, laughable and sad tale of family, love, work and sex.

That mighty Soderbergh feeling.,"A sensible female detective film that is solidly based on plausibility (well, slightly, I'm sure most abandoned mothers would agree).  Plot perfunctory but fun, acting, especially Julia Roberts, a surprising joy. Main reason the film is a must, of course, is Steven Soderbergh, catching up on Tim Burton as America's greatest director, here enjoying flexing his considerable creative muscles in a populist woman's picture - his 'cubist' editing; his sense of the wide American outdoors and minutae of domestic life (in a hilariously Hollywood version of the working class); his sardonic visual jokery (those skyscraper shots); his continued interest in parents and children (see THE LIMEY, THE GREEN ROOM); his refusal to patronise his heroine.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a waste,"What a waste of Miss Roberts excellent acting talents, the story is great but I found that all Julia had to do was show cleavage and swear, and for this she received an Oscar. Maybe more actresses should swear and show cleavage and they will receive Oscars. I love Julia as an actress is one of the very best but in this movie I think she really bombs. Lets look at the inconsistencies 1) Is her character a smoker or not,(not that I am a fan of smoking in movies) she smokes once at the beginning of the movie then never again.(Why) 2) Also the Character claims the reason she wears sexy clothing is because she finds it most comfortable but when she gets home after work she changes into sweats. Is this to maker herself less comfortable. 3) Anybody that would talk to and swear at her boss the way she did would usually be fired on the spot.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent performances push film over the top.,"Although the film could have been cut down a little, the excellent performances, especially Albert Finney's, made this movie a winner. I saw the film during a sneak preview and it had the audience riveted. In fact, it applauded when the movie finished, something I haven't witnessed since I was a little kid and that was standard behavior. At times the movie had parts of ""A Civil Action"" and ""Silkwood,"" but Julia Roberts and Finney, along with the others, gave this film its own flavor. It's too bad it was released when it was, because I fear the performances will long be forgotten when Oscar nominations come around next year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Paying attention to detail can pay off,"Erin Brockovich is a movie based on a true story. Julia Roberts played the part of Erin really well. Erin is the single mother struggling to make ends meet. She's been divorced two times and has three kids. She is in desperate need of a job before she goes bankrupt. She walks into this attorney's office and basically begs for a job. Despite her style of dress and outspoken personality, she gets a job as a file clerk. While performing her job, she stumbles upon some paperwork that seem odd to her and so begins her quest for her investigating work to find out why people are getting sick and why the Gas and Electric Company are paying for their medical bills. Although she is not trained in legal work or has any kind of degree. Erin is very street smart and people actually trust her. She goes on against the biggest company in California and almost brings down the company with the biggest lawsuit in the history of California. The little train that could.The theme of the story is determination. Erin, an uneducated single mother of three. Who needed to go above and beyond in her job in order to retain it so she could pay her bills, was not going to let anyone intimidate her and call her stupid. The more people made fun of her or her work, the more determined she felt. She also had a sense of compassion for the ""little"" people who had been lied to. These people were dying early, kids were having chronic illness all the meanwhile they were being told that there was nothing wrong with the water they were drinking. She felt the need to help represent these people.Julia Robert's role as Erin Brockivich was outstanding. I loved the part where they met with Hinkley's attorney's for PG&E and the main attorney was about to drink the water and Erin tells her that they had brought that specially for them from Hinsley's well and she puts it down and would not have a drink. This tell you that they knew that the chromium was poisonous to people but they were trying to sweep it under the rug. Overall, the movie has a great plot to it. Julia Roberts, witty, trashy, bite me attitude combined with a sense of responsibility to the people of Hinsley and her children make this a movie to remember and makes you want to go out there and make something of yourself and not just push some papers around but really make a difference. It doesn't matter if you have a degree or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Of Boobs and Barbs,"""What makes you think you can just walk in there [public utility records office] and find anything we need?"" inquires attorney Ed Masry.  Replies Erin Brockovich: ""They're called boobs, Ed.""So it goes in this dramatic enactment of an allegedly true-life-based story. Just where facts leave off, however, and creative writing begins, may be another matter.Is it possible that an entire community near a large utility company can be duped by that company into believing that the widespread health challenges being faced by that community are in no way related to the company's toxic waste?  Even when that company is paying the medical expenses of certain community residents?Is there something we don't know about civic awareness in this informed era that such a situation could exist with nary a citizen even remotely beginning to suspect there's something amiss?No matter: in steps Eric Brockovitch armed, not only with persuasive physical endowments and sharp tongue, but also a quick mind and wit, to help bring this shocking situation to light and down this insidious company. Since Julia Roberts portrays Erin, the role is written to utilize Robert's uniquely hip, no-nonsense persona.  She makes a striking presence and commands attention and empathy with her skillful portrayal.After spending half the film recovering from the astonishment of the paunchy, aged appearance of once-handsome Albert Finney, we found his attorney Ed Masry to be an effective partner of research assistant Erin. Aaron Eckhart--as romantic interest, blue collar hippie, George--is almost unrecognizable from his starched white-collar, ""Chad,"" of ""In the Company of Men"" (which skyrocketed this enormously versatile actor to fame).The DVD-formatted version offers mini-interviews with both the film's director and Erin Brockovitch herself, lending credibility to the story's legal assertions. However, it's clear this film is not a documentary, and only through committed personal research can one uncover the true facts regarding this fascinating and significant class-action litigation of a multi-billion dollar utility company.It's a story which affects us all.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Erin Crock-o-spit,"There are truly bad movies. Some of them are at least enjoyable, in a Mystery Science Theatre sort of way. But then there are bad movies that try to pass themselves off as good, in which even the flaws turn out to be flat-out annoying more than entertaining.""Erin Brockovich"" is of the second type. In fact, it's the worst of the second type of bad films to be released in 2000. Here's a brief summary of some of the reasons why:Six hundred innocent lives are at stake. The audience is supposed to care. It doesn't. That's the first sign a movie like this is in trouble.Julia Roberts is a good actress, but she comes off as over-acting because of the banal dialogue. No, sorry, ""dialogue"" implies interaction. All we have here is Julia Roberts dishing out lines that basically say, ""look Ma, I'm acting!"" and show off her talent to memorize tedium.PG&E is portrayed as an evil, evil corporation. That's not the part I have a problem with. I have a problem with the fact that its representatives are portrayed as drones that serve as nothing more than voices for the evil, evil corporation. Faithful representatives, to be sure, but this was done better with stormtroopers and Star Wars.Long and boring. This is a dramatized by-the-textbook retelling. ""Gettysburg"" and ""Anna and the King"" also suffered from this, but at least they were visually interesting. Visually (and musically), ""Brockovich"" plays like a Seinfeld episode without the humor. Or the character design.It's just so COLD. And the characters are all flat. (That's right, I called Erin Brockovich flat.) ""Tough biker who likes kids and is a sensitive guy on the inside"" is NOT character development - and everyone else was worse.I gave this an IMDB rating of 2/10.

The dialog is witty, snappy, and creative.  It was a very credible movie. Just when I was losing all faith in Hollywood, Julia Roberts pulls out the best performance of her career and brings me back into the mix. I loved this movie.  Go see it. Sit back and enjoy true to life dialog and a great true story. Albert Finney is top notch in his supporting role as well. He fit the role perfectly and his facial expressions make the whole story work.  It is isn't often that the kids are realistic, and these kids must have moved in with Julia for a while because they were so cozy together.

Julia Roberts at Her Best!,"Erin Brockovich is a ""shoot straight from the hip"" drama mixed with plenty of laughs and warm feelings.

It is definitely Oscar worthy, as is the supporting role of Albert Finney as Brockovich's boss.

Good Girl !,"Let me remind you first that the story and the characters are all true. Erin Brockovich exists and did reveal PG & E' scandal. I'll add that, according to witnesses, the real Erin also used to work dressed in very... revealing clothes ! That is for those who would think that Julia Roberts's incredible uplift cleavage is shown here for no other reason than arousing and holding the viewer's interest... Steven Soderbergh is remembered having won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1989, at the age of 26 years old and for his very first film: ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"". The hardest was just starting for him: he had now to prove that he deserved it... He had to be seen as a talented director (""Kafka"" or ""The Limey""), never hesitating to experiment new film genre. With ""Erin Brockovich"", he fits into the current trend of US ""campaigner films"". Are 60's and 70's best hours of US political cinema back to the screen ? Let's wait and see a little more before answering (hopefully) ""yes""... In the meantime, I have no choice but to call ""Erin Brockovich"" a real success. Of course, the story alone (true, then) couldn't be enough. It needed an appropriate direction to make the most of it. Soderbergh's one is precise, sober, fluent and well-paced, all rolled into one. He has succeeded in turning a story with no action strictly speaking, at least in hollywoodian sense of the word (no car chase, no guns, no various violence, etc.), into a... sustained action film the viewer never gets bored with. As in front of a film noir or a thriller. The director's work's best parts can be found in the rythm he gave to his film (and who says rythm does not obligatory means high speed...), in an excellent editing, with no particular effects, without any trick. I would even venture to say that Soderbergh tried to make his direction as invisible as glass, in the same way than George Orwell tried to do with his prose. And let's give thanks to Soderbergh for having spared us the recurrent sequences in US cinema: the ""trial ones"" ! A powerful story, an adequate direction and, of course, great acting. The whole film rests with pretty Julia Roberts. Of course she didn't wait for this film to show her real talents or acting. Hollywood's most expensive star ($20 millions for this film...) had already seduced wild world viewers with various comedies, such as Pretty Woman, Everybody says ""I love you"", My Best Friend's Wedding or Notting Hill. More seldom she had been seen in good drama, Mary Reilly being almost an exception... In the role of Erin, Julia Roberts glows with her dynamism, her obstinacy and, naturally (well, she's Julia Roberts, after all !) her stunning smile. The clothes she wears (tiny-mini-skirts and high-heeled shoes that make her legs looking endless but also lead to a funny walk, all in addition to her cleavage), the way she talks (more vulgar than glamour) could have done a disservice to her. But, by making her more ""human"" and closer to the ""ordinary people"" she defends, by exposing an outward appearance in contrast to the character's pyschology, the  result is quite the reverse. At her side, great Albert Finney is perfect and Aaron Eckard brings humanity to his role... A worth seeing film !",,Anonymous,Biography
"Movie is good, Actress is wrong","While the movie starts of I really got pissed that I had to watch another Julia Roberts flick again. Last year I saw Runaway Bride and Notting Hill and they were BAD, mostly because of her and after seeing Erin Brockovich I still mean that she is Hollywood's most overrated actresses around. But, it's not all wrong with this picture. At the end it gave me a good feeling, but it still looked a lot like A Civil Action. Albert Finney plays his best role so far (while he never does anything bad). A simple twist of his mouth and the whole cinema start laughing, with Julia, that never happens. Now who is the best actor of them two?Besides Julia the movie has a lot to make it worth watching. It has drama, comedy, thriller, enough to make everybody pleased.

There should be more people like Erin, willing to take on the big guys. An excellent movie, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I still wonder why it won so many awards,"The story behind this movie is one that just had to be filmed. This is the kind of true story that appeals to so many people that there is absolutely no-one who would dare NOT to make movie out of it. So there were two options, either it would be filmed with a rather big budget, getting a chance in the cinema's, either it would end up as a cheap TV-drama. The makers chose the first option and that's a good thing...Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother. She's desperate to find a new job, but every interview ends up in disappointment because she doesn't have the right qualifications. And to make things worse for her, she also loses a lawsuit against a rich doctor who hit her in a car accident. She has no alternative left but to go to her lawyer and to 'ask' him for a job (threatening is a better word for it). She gets a job and while no-one takes her seriously, because of her trashy clothes and her lack of manners, she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Soon she discovers that the company is trying quietly to buy contaminated and polluted land in a residential area. But as she digs deeper, she finds enough evidence so the law company can sue the million-dollar corporation.Normally I would say that the underdog is a likable figure and most of the time that is true, but not in this case. A woman that swears as much as the Erin Brockovich in this movie and who doesn't mind to be so aggressive to so many people, really isn't very lovable. At least not in my opinion. OK, she may have had a hard time, but that still isn't a good reason to act the way she does. (I really hope the real one isn't like that, because you can't buy style and class and this is really about as low as you can get).About the acting I can be rather brief. Julia Robert's performance was decent, but certainly wasn't good enough to win an Oscar with it. Sure, it's the perfect role to seduce the Academy with, but all she really did was showing a lot of cleavage and talking dirty (which sometimes was really funny, but not always). All the other actors and especially Albert Finney, as the lawyer and head of the company, were OK. I don't really have any remarks on their performances. They weren't spectacular, but did what they had to do.All in all this isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't worth all the awards that it received. This rather thin and, if I didn't know better, unbelievable story is pure TV-material. A bigger budget wasn't enough to make me forget about that. In the end this movie is worth a watch, but it certainly isn't as great as some people want you to believe. I give it a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Great Movie, Plain and Simple....","When I first heard about the movie ""Erin Brockovich,"" I was worried that it was going to be something straight from Lifetime.  I was expecting to see a sappy, cheesy, ""based on a true story"" movie about a single mother fighting the world one-on-one doing everything she can to feed her children.  Now that I've seen the movie, however, I know that I was wrong.  Julia Roberts portrays Erin excellently, and her performance makes this movie shine. Sure, it's not much more than a ""feel good"" movie, but hey...what's wrong with that?  It has a good plot, good characters, and an all-around good feeling to it.  It's well worth the price of admission, and I'm really glad that I saw this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie beat my lukewarm expectations.,"I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan (not that I dislike her but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch her) and after reading Roger Ebert's review my expectations were not very high.  But I found the movie funny, and Roberts' performance energizing.  While Roger found Roberts' dress distracting, I thought it part of a running joke.  Anyway, it's a nice, feel-good date movie, especially if your female date is in a bad mood.  It will cheer her up.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable and Heartwarming - too many people criticise unfairly,"Having read a number of reviews submitted by various users, i was a rather depressed by all the negativity expressed.  I think I'll balance things a little.  I found the film really moving, Albert Finneys performance was excellent, as was was Julia Roberts' and Eckhart's.  If people were dissapointed by the eventual predictability of Julia's character I hasten to point out that the whole point of the film, actually a true story, is that she is very much just a down to earth, normal, no frills, single mom. Except for the fact that she was Miss Wichita years back.  As such it is a really effective and moving story about the underdogs fight against corporate America, about normality, common sense and caring winning through. A lovely change from the regular fare of hyped up splashy movies. Definitely recommended for the family, and a must see for my Mum!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Utter maudlin tripe,"This is an absolutely dreadful film that will appeal only to those who think on the surface, or possibly think not at all, which of course includes the majority of the American population.   Horribly miscast, the script is infantile, the character interactions are puerile.  The love scenes will make you want to look away, something I never thought I'd say about Julia Roberts in underwear.  If you have any poetry in your soul at all you will understand what I mean. Finney's fake yankee accent doesn't help either, either.As for the substance of the film ... If you are an idiot or have a double-digit IQ no doubt you will believe the sensitive biker love-interest character who likes children. If you are an idiot you will believe the sensitive lawyer who is just looking for a way out of his guilt ... If you are an idiot you will probably like this film. Toots got her Oscar for this garbage, but if she has any sense of decency she will melt it down into a plastic spoon and chuck it into the river Tiber, or the closest puddle.Total rubbish ... avoid like the plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great example of Hollywood style entertainment.A,"A very entertaining Hollywood version of a true-life story and shows the good side of our legal system.  Julia Roberts lights up the screen, as usual, with a fun and energetic performance, nicely balanced by Albert Finney.  If you saw the trailers and weren't sure, don't worry.  They didn't show you all the good stuff.  It's all at least as funny in context and there's LOTS more.  Relatively frequent f-words, but they fit the context and especially the character.  Over two hours, but not too long.  Enjoyed it even more than I expected. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
fabulously entertaining,"I hope this film was not released too early in the year to be forgotten come Oscar time! Nicely written, well directed and beautifully photographed. The score is quite subtle in that it is used only when completely necessary and then is never overbearing. Julia Robert's portrayal is definetely her best to date. Her supporting cast especially Albert Finney and Marg Helgenberger come very close to stealing the show. Excellent (mainstream) job Steven Soderberg!!

Enjoyable movie!,I really enjoyed the movie. The cursing however was at a maximum so I would not recommend it for young viewers. Julia Roberts as usual is fantastic. The character is so bold that it makes me wish I were that bold sometimes. I loved the boyfriend! What a great guy! The actor that played him is superb!! I have to go back and look at his name and then look for him in other movies because that man knows how to act. I definitely recommend the movie to almost anyone (except children). What she does is important and she does it in a very gutsy way. Enjoy!,,Anonymous,Biography
A fabulous movie; loved every minute of it!,"Erin Brockovich is a tremendous, triumphant movie, falling just outside the boundaries of ""chick flick."" I was emotionally involved from beginning to end, BECAUSE it's a true story. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were sublime as Erin and Ed, as was Aaron Eckhart as George.  Marg Helgenberger was amazing as Donna Jensen, the first litigant in the case against PG&E.The families involved were real. Their experiences were real. Erin's sexy, dogged determination was real.  This wasn't the first movie of its kind, and I'm sure it won't the be last.  But the story's message is a very important one. The huge corporation involved is Pacific Gas and Electric. This is an enormous utilities company that serves a large part of California. There are STILL cases pending against them. I think it's a wakeup call to people that the big guys can be wrong, and must be held accountable for it, and that the little ones CAN do something about it.The interwoven love story was very well written, and accurately drove home Erin's conflict between doing right by the families affected by the contamination, and doing right by her own family.I highly recommend this movie; whether you're a Julia fan or not.*Not to mention the fact that now is probably a good time to buy stock in the company that makes the Wonderbra!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sort of good,"This film really takes the best out of Julia Roberts: normally an awfully bad actress, she is, in the role of this bitchy, tackily-dressed proud mother-of-three, almost (but not quite) sort of good. The film is also a revelation in that it is the only Julia Roberts film with a somewhat sensible plot: amidst the wan (""Pretty woman""), banal (""Notting Hill"") and thoroughly idiotic (""Sleeping with the enemy"") movies in which we are used to see her, ""Erin Brockovich"" shines like a beacon. Still, there is far too much single-mother act, and far too much shrew-act in this movie for it to be thoroughly enjoyable, or even original. Some details are cute, though, like the abominable bad taste with which the protagonist is systematically dressed; the plot is mildly interesting, but its development is far too legal-oriented (a very common fault in Hollywood movies) while it could be a bit more centered on the human and ecological aspects of having an entire town poisoned by chromium VI. Altogether, this is an educational movie, which people with too much trust in corporate America should see, and which is certainly more interesting than the latest serially produced action movie. But don't expect a classic or anything like that: this is strictly a watch-once film.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Director Steven Soderbergh triumphs again!,"When I first heard that Steven Soderbergh (my new favorite director after ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"") was directing a Julia Roberts movie, I was worried. Would this be a big sell-out Hollywood picture? I was worried for no reason. Soderbergh comes through once again, and in a very big way. Like he did for George Clooney in ""Out of Sight"", Soderbergh also does for Julia Roberts: making a famed actor step out of their famous persona and instead become a very detailed character. Julia Roberts pulls in a great performance in this movie, for any reason but the fact that you don't get a constant reminder that you are watching ""Julia Roberts"". Erin Brockovich comes alive in a startling way and makes a fine counterpoint to the typical Julia Roberts role: she is brashy, trashy, strong but still utterly likeable. While many of the stylistic editing techniques that Soderbergh has used (most eloquently in ""The Limey"")have been toned down for this crowd-pleasing picture, they are still there. Fans of his previous movies will be pleased, and I daresay that Julia Roberts fans will be as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great, just great. Mrs. Roberts is outstanding.","Much will be made of Julia Roberts's wardrobe in Erin Brockovich--a brash parade of daring hemlines and Wonderbra confidence. Roberts is unabashedly sexy in the title role of this fact-based comedy-drama, but she and director Steven Soderbergh are far too intelligent to rely solely on high heels and cleavage. Susannah Grant's brassy screenplay fuels this winning combination of star, director, and material, firing on all pistons with maximum efficiency. With Ed Lachman, his noted cinematographer from The Limey, Soderbergh tackles this A-list project with the fervor of an independent, combining a no-frills look with kinetic panache and the same brisk editorial style he used in the justly celebrated Out of Sight. Broke and desperate, the twice-divorced single mom Erin bosses her way into a clerical job with attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who's indebted to Erin after failing to win her traffic-injury case. Erin is soon focused on suspicious connections between a mighty power company, its abuse of toxic chromium, and the poisoned water supply of Hinkley, California, where locals have suffered a legacy of death and disease. Matching the dramatic potency of Norma Rae and Silkwood, Erin Brockovich filters cold facts through warm humanity, especially in Erin's rapport with dying victims and her relationship with George (superbly played by Aaron Eckhart), a Harley-riding neighbor who offers more devotion than Erin's ever known. Surely some of these details have been embellished for dramatic effect, but the factual basis of Erin Brockovich adds a boost of satisfaction, proving that greed, neglect, and corporate arrogance are no match against a passionate crusader. (Trivia note: The real Erin Brockovich appears briefly as a diner waitress.)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts Best Role to Date,"This by far is the best role julia roberts has gotten, and she is great. So is the rest of the supporting cast. Especially Albert Finney.

Foul language,"Why to movie makers insist on putting foul language in movies? If they cut out all the foul language this movie would lose nothing. It seems to me that it is a cheap ploy to cover the movie maker's weakness in portraying a an artistically strong character.From my experience, quality movies don't need such foul swearing.Having said that, this movie is OK. The plot is a bit soft and somewhat predictable, but some of the colourful characters in it do provide some entertainment. They have risked the whole movie credibility on Julia Roberts' character, which is a big ask. She does OK, but it's hardly a riveting performance.A somewhat American-style movie that will likely appeal to US viewers.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Glorified hack work.,"If you were to believe the critics that raved about this movie, you'd think it's a masterpiece.  When in fact, only about the first half hour of it is worth seeing.  Julia Roberts delivers a fine performance at the beginning and then proceeds to become more insufferable and self-righteous as the movie progresses. How many times can the camera cut to a close up of her listening raptly and reacting almost tearfully every time someone else shows up with cancer? It's repetitive, boring and needless and it makes you hate her guts instead of liking her. Aaron Eckhart, the darling, is stuck once more in a thankless role but we should be grateful to Mr. Soderbergh for casting him. A good actor and adorable to the bone.  Everything else is totally fake in this film.  And the critics who must be tired of seeing so much s**t, think this is better than average Hollywood crap. It isn't.

Excellent,"Part of the fun of going to see a movie in a theatre that is full of people is the amount of response from the people around you. I don't need to be told when to laugh, but sometimes it's still enjoyable. With the excellent film ""Erin Brockovich"", it was fun. Julia Roberts stars as the sharp-tongued Erin B. who won't flinch at screaming ""Bite me, crispy cream"" to an uptight secretary, or ""Fuck you!"" to her boss. She says what's on her mind, and that's precisely why she gets as far as she does. People respect her. Especially those dying or who have dying children due to poisoned water in Hinkly, which is a town that is right beside PG&E, a huge plant. Erin is working for a small law firm and finds the case intriguing, and decides to study up on it. She gets further and further invovled, and spends months and months on the case, while also supporting her three children and trying to pay attention to a devoted boyfriend. Two stiff, cold briefcase-carrying, suit-wearing lawyers are brought in without any consent of Erin's, and she wastes no time speaking her mind. After one of the stiff, corporate lawyers calmly says to her, ""I'm sorry, I must have gotten off on the wrong foot.."" Erin retorts, ""That's all you got, lady! Two wrong feet and some ugly shoes."" She has the upper hand in the entire case because she possesses what the others lack, the human touch. She relates to the dying victims and reassures them she is trying her hardest and most sincere. Julia Roberts shines as Erin Brockovich, and it shows she sincerely believed in the film, the script, and the story, and wanted to get the real deal across about the real town that had a real, severe cancer problem as well as many other diseases creeping into people's homes due to the plant. Wonderful script by Susannah Grant, who above all should be commended, as well as terrific acting by all, especially Julia herself. Excellent film. Smart. Sassy. See it.",,Anonymous,Biography

Strong Roberts in dramatic true story,"After losing a court trial Erin Brockovich (Roberts) forcefully secures a post at a law firm in the hope of raising money for her child and doing something substantial in her life.When the credits rolled and text appeared declared what happened next I had up to this point forgotten this in fact is a true story, which when looking back is a remarkable story.Opening with the Pretty Woman actress conversing with a stereotypical boss type at an interview her presence is felt strongly and we know we are in for a strong drama.As if to compact the genre into full flow we have a shocking car crash which ultimately leads to an unhappy Erin and the introduction of the law firm is set in motion with a staggering no holds barred meeting.The plot continues to move forward with its main star, coasting through some powerful real life motions such as being a single parent, struggling with finance and having difficulty getting work. The realism it portrays is strong and can be associated with any viewer and the fact that this is based on a woman's personal experience may have people shedding a tear or two, which is helped along by a bravado Julia Roberts.The actress at present in 2000 was in a run of a conventional romantic roles. My best friend's wedding, Notting Hill and Runaway bride had all appeared on the star's CV in recent years and here she branches out into a harder dramatic role that enables us viewers to truly see her full potential, which in turn was noticed by Hollywood who won her an Academy Award for her portrayal. I confess to never being high on her fan list but here we do see charisma and a no holds barred approach to truth telling and appetite for enthusiasm. One scene near the end where she is sitting with her boss and two lawyers is brilliant when she challenges her rival to name people and numbers, moment of the film.The supporting collection of actors lend subtle support to the main star. Aaron Eckhart is brilliant if underused as George the biker whilst Albert Finney is a revelation as a man who knows too much.Steven Soderbergh, beaten at the Oscars by his other work in Traffic, supplies the necessary dramatic styling of a plot not too high up on action and containing enough dramatic controversy and suspense to see us through. The scenes in the record offices are a bit stretched whilst seeing George with the kid is a bit of an overstep. However he more than makes up with it in the slightly humorous town's meeting and office sessions.This film, though smart in its casting and directing has a certain lackadaisical approach to story telling. Though based obviously on a true story there is a lack of pacing a stretching of scenes, a feeling of repetitiveness that you can never shake off. Whilst the ending intends to be a feel good motive you don't ultimately feel rewarded at the arrival and to the point in which it got their.And yet this is a good picture.

For such a down-to-earth story, the audience reaction was truly amazing.Although this film is remarkably similar in theme to ""A Civil Action"" and very easily could have fallen victim to the fact that similar stories have been told dozens of times, Erin Brockovich shines.The entire cast was superb, and Susannah Grant's script was sharp and tight. Soderbergh always seems to bring the very best out of those he's working with.  Although I don't hear a lot about him, I think he is one of the most talented directors around today.

"over rated, but still good","Julia Roberts got a reported $20 million for this movie, which is based on a true story.  In it she plays the title character, a single mother who goes to work at a law firm and ends up finding evidence that a big gas company polluted a small town's drinking water.  To tell you the truth I was expecting a bit more from this movie, considering it's large box office intake and the popularity of it's star.  This is by no means to say that Erin Brockovich is a bad movie, in fact it's a pretty good one, but I'm still not sure it was worthy of all the acclaim it got.  My main problem  was there were no moments that were really defining or dramatic and although at the end the evil corporation has to fork out almost $400 million (the largest ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit), that would mean nothing to a $28 billion company.  There's not much courtroom drama, in fact there's hardly any, director Steven Sodenberg chose to focus on Robert's character and the people she affected.  The one thing that really impressed me about this movie was Julia Robert's performance.  We are so used to seeing her play the same innocent characters in all of her films, that it started to seem like that was all she could do. With this role she proves she actually can act, and does it quite well. She is thourally convincing as Brockovich and is the main reason this movie works (she's also the reason why it made so much).

Excellent feelgood movie,"Erin Brockovich essentially combines two movies. The first being about a single mother of three struggling to support her kids in a materialistic country.  The second being about said single mother transcending stereotypes by discovering and investigating a cover up by a large utility about the damage that their plant has caused local residents. The great achievement that director Steven Soderbergh makes is to combine these two elements seemlessly. Julia Roberts is in superb form in the titular role and her co-star, veteran Albert Finney, turns in an excellent performance. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as Erin's main squeeze, George and Marg Helgenberger as Donna Jensen, the woman whose Real Estate claim starts the whole thing off. The screenplay by Susannah Grant provides Roberts with lots of snappy one-liners, which I'm not quite sure the real Erin Brockovich said. But hey! It makes for more fun in the movie.

The Best Performance I've Seen From Julia Roberts,"I have to right off confess that I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts. As an actress I think she's OK but not much more than that, and I personally don't think she's the raving beauty that a lot of people think she is. That, of course, is merely a matter of personal taste on my part, but perhaps it makes my assessment of her work in ""Erin Brockovich"" even more interesting. I really liked her in this! I have no argument at all with her Oscar for this role! I thought that she really got into the part of Erin and seemed to nail it - and I'm impressed by the fact that the real Erin Brockovich was involved with this film and even played a small role in it as a waitress - thus suggesting that she, too, felt that the portrayal of her was fair. In fact, on her website, the real Erin says that the movie is 98% true, with some dramatic licence taken in the other 2%. That was important for me to know, because, while Erin is the hero in this, it's not an altogether flattering portrayal of her, especially in the movie's early stages. Somewhat trashy I would say. Uneducated (which is actually not accurate), unemployed, foul-mouthed and living as a single mom to her three kids in a bug-infested home, her prospects don't appear very promising. But after being involved in a car accident, she hired lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney, who was also quite good in his role) to sue the other driver. Masry loses the case but apparently out of guilt hires her on at his law firm. Erin becomes involved in a case against a large corporation accused of causing serious health problems to residents around its plant by polluting the water with chemicals, and the movie follows the development of that case.Yes. I liked Roberts, and I liked Erin Brockovich - both the movie and the person as portrayed. This is a classic ""underdog overcomes"" story. Erin obviously grows in confidence and ability as the movie progresses, and as she has to fight for recognition and respect from the families involved in the lawsuit, her fellow employees at the law firm and the various lawyers she has to deal with. At the same time, we see her struggle with the cost involved with all this - an increasingly distant relationship with her children because she's away a lot due to the case, and her inability to maintain a relationship with her neighbour George (Aaron Eckhardt) - who loves her but is increasingly resentful that she seems to view him as little more than easy child care. Good character development, well portrayed by Julia Roberts.The legal drama (although very much front and centre) is not the engine that pushes this movie forward. That's very much the portrayal of Erin the person. But the portrayal of the drama does point out the challenges involved in taking on a large corporation that has both lots of money and lots of lawyers. As you learn the stories of the affected families, you develop a sympathy for them. And yet, in some ways, the legal aspects of the film slow this down a bit. I mean, it's a true story. We pretty much know how it turns out. That takes some of the drama away from it. It does have a nice, heartwarming ending though as Erin reveals the terms of the settlement to one of the more pitiable of the plaintiffs.This is a good movie, and definitely one of Julia Roberts' best - and this from someone, as I said, who's not generally overly smitten with Julia Roberts.

Very good!!,"Erin Brockovich is an average woman on her own with three little children. She has absolutely no education and starts working at an insurance company I believe it was.

The law firm which helps them is no good in Erin's eyes, and she continues talking to the people herself.

If you like movies and you are more than fourteen, regardless  the `based on actual events', you will have the feeling of having watched this film two hundred times before, it is the same old story, absolutely predictable, a bad drag of `trial, lawsuit, lawyer, investigacion,', very very already seen and boring. Furtthermore the fact of choosing Julia Roberts for the role is a huge mistake, I don´t believe her at all and I hate the `science fiction' way she acts in a very `realistic?' movie.

Ok I guess,"Based on a true story, Erin Brokovich is a single young mother who is trying to find a job and raise her 3 kids.  After getting in a car accident and loosing in court, she litteraly FORCES her lawyer (Albert Finney) to hire her at her firm to do some clerical work.  Erin discovers some old case about some former client wanting to get more money for her house that the nearby watertreatment wants to buy.  In probing deeper she discovers, more than meets the eye and that it appears the company was responsible for contaminating groundwater thus poisioning everyone in the community.  So it turns out Erin with no legal experience and working in a VERY small firm, sets out for a courtroom battle david VS goliath story.Hollywood loves these movies.  It seems this role was perfectly tailored for Roberts.  Finney is good a her boss too.  The movie is somewhat interesting but I didn't feel the need to route for the good guy, or get seriously pumped or motivated by the film.  I didn't find it that humourous either considering that Erin is portrayed as someone with a very short fuse and acid-tongue.  The only scene I got a good laugh out of was when the legal team from the chemical corporation was coming in to the small private firm.  In some quick thinking to show that the small firm wasn't going to be bullyed, they get half of the clerical staff to dress up like lawyers and walk in the meeting room as a combined show of force.  The movie was at least entertaining and OKRating 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

True Stories Are Dull,"""Based on a true story"" is a phrase that almost always guarantees a bad movie. Straight from the off there is going to be a problem. If the scriptwriter strays from the truth people will say ""That's not what happened"" - and also, let's face it, if the script ain't gonna stay with the truth then it ain't a ""True Story"". But if the scriptwriter does stay with the truth then the story is likely to be dull because life is mostly dull. That's why we have fiction. Fiction takes the essence of something vital and important and tells it in a gripping manner that reveals all the issues in a provocative and memorable way.Erin Brockovich is a brash woman - offensive, unpleasant, thoughtless and aggressive. Some people like her. Having the very likable Julia Roberts play her goes some way to softening her. Watching a movie about this unpleasant woman who made herself and her firm a lot of money by suing a power company is not my idea of high art nor pleasant entertainment. She won a big court case - big deal. That doesn't make her interesting. Not does it make her a hero.I didn't like this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts rules!,"Nineteen members of the Film Society of Greater Kansas City's Film Discussion Group ranked ""Erin Brockovich"" number two of the four films discussed this year. The median score was 3.2 (out of 4.0) and the mean was 3.01. Surprisingly, the range of scores fluctuated wildly. Two members rated the film below a 2.0, and two others gave it a perfect 4.0.Much of the discussion concerned the accuracy of the film when compared to the real-life events that spawned it. Also, one member circulated articles from the Wall Street Journal that debunk the claims by the real Erin Brockovich that Chromium 6 caused great harm to the people of the town of Hinkley, Calif.Most of the group enjoyed the chemistry between the two lead performers (Julia Roberts and Albert Finney), appreciated the David and Goliath plot line, and found interesting the enigmatic nature of a woman who dresses like a slut but demonstrates competency as a legal investigator. Other modern themes about the nature of women in the workplace, and role reversal in child-care made the film stand above other courtroom dramas.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent true-life story,"""Erin Brockovich"" was a surprise to me. It surprised me of how much this movie pulled me into the story right from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the end. But most importantly, it features a powerful, knockout performance by Julia Roberts in the title role. Oscar voters if you are reading this take note immediately: Roberts deserves to be nominated for Best Actress and deserves to win. This is probably the best work she's ever done. Roberts dominates this film by appearing in almost every scene. Erin Brockovich is a tough-as-nails mother of three who goes to work for a law firm run by an attorney (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) who represented her in a case at the beginning of the movie. She eventually stumbles upon a monumental law case against a giant corporation (PG&E). Erin decides to take on this company at any cost. She also gets plenty of help from her boss, and the two begin a memorable fight that ends up bringing a small town to its feet and a huge corporation to its knees. ""Erin Brockovich"" not only has a great performance by Roberts, but an excellent supporting performance by Finney as her boss, who early on hilariously tells his new employee about rethinking her wardrobe (love those outfits she wears). He should get an Oscar nomination too. Oscar nominations should also go to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant for bringing this movie to life and telling a compelling story (Soderbergh will definitely get a Best Director nomination but he'll probably be nominated for his current movie ""Traffic"", which is also generating Oscar talk). There are a couple of moments in ""Erin Brockovich"" that I could have done without, and if the movie had been about 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been a great movie. Nevertheless, it comes close, and Roberts splendid acting here is the driving force behind the success of this movie. If she doesn't take home the Best Actress Oscar come this March and the award ends up going to someone else, I'm going to be very upset. SHE DESERVES IT!!!!! As for the rest of ""Erin Brockovich"", right from its smashing opening to its hilarious conclusion, it's a pretty darn good movie.***1/2 (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Death by wholesomeness,"Steven Soderbergh's Erin Brockovich takes full advantage of Julia Roberts's considerable talent and appeal delivering a genuinely heartwarming, hilariously funny and considerably intelligent tale of the real-life legal case and woman spearheading the crusade. The film never feels the need to chastise you for a lack of legal or medical knowledge, instead taking time to carefully feed you the necessary information in a relaxed manner, never stopping for a grandstanding speech or an awkward moment. All the while it simultaneously guides you through Erin's emotional toll and strain in one of Roberts' finest roles; with a flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy, all ricochetting off Albert Finney's wonderfully jaded and equally dry performance as the beleaguered career attorney who knows too much about the loopholes of his profession to have much faith left in it. Between Soderbergh's direction, witty writing and incredible performances - seriously, Aaron Eckhart and the kids damn near killed me through sheer wholesomeness alone - Erin Brockovich remains a supremely engaging film with an unshakable authenticity and incredible knockabout effort.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A little more boring than I expected,"2 1/2 Stars (out of 4):This film was greeted with a lot of acclaim and it was even nominated for an oscar, but I personally found it a little slow and boring. Julia Roberts' role as Erin Brockovitch, a poor but assertive single mom, earned her an oscar and I don't disagree that Roberts did a really good job. Based on a true story, Roberts plays the character with unusually dark notes in her crusade to win a lawsuit for a town who's suffered the side effects of pollution. However, Julia's frustration and anger at everyone else in the world for all her stress, got too repetitive for me. The element that kept the movie from not boring me out completely, aside from Erin Brockovitch's aggressiveness, was her relationship with eventual boss Ed (Albert Finney). Initially,  Ed is a lawyer who fails Brockovitch and enraged at being screwed over she forces him to give her a job there, so she can earn the money he owes. He reluctantly agrees, partly because of a thin layer of compassion under his inhumane lawyer mentality, and the working relationship between the two is very interesting and warm. In short, as a star vehicle for Julia Roberts to do something serious, yes, this works, but as a movie itself, only partially.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I guess no one is immune to selling out.,"The time has come for Steven Soderbergh to sell out. I'll always think of The Limey as his last film before selling his soul to Hollywood. It's hard to believe that the director of sex, lies, and videotape made this. Soderbergh used to be one of the godfathers of independent filmmaking (before there was Tarantino, there was Soderbergh). The name Soderbergh meant quality cinema. I thought Out Of Sight was a little too mainstream, but I saw what he was doing: trying to take an action film, and give it the kind of gritty feel that The French Connection or Serpico used to have. Most directors don't make them like that anymore (pardon the cliche). Following that, he perfected the gritty action drama with The Limey. These movies prove that he is above directing a knockoff of A Civil Action built around Julia Roberts. What's next? Jim Jarmusch directing the third Mission: Impossible? (If you're reading this Mr. Jarmusch, I know you wouldn't do that really. I'm just illustrating how ridiculous this seems to me. I think you're a brilliant artist.)",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Three cheers for Julia!,"After countless fluffy roles in a number of alternately respectable or forgettable pictures, Julia Roberts has finally been given another substantive character to play, and a true-life one to boot; like the woman she portrays, once she sinks her teeth into something she never lets go. Roberts is a natural to play Brockovich, an effervescent though uncouth woman prone to low-cut tops and high-cut skirts in equal proportion. Struggling to raise three children after her second divorce, Erin's relentless job search is interrupted by a debilitating fender bender. Feeling slighted by her not entirely fruitful attorney (Albert Finney), she transforms his guilt into a full-time clerical position at his law firm. Forming the crux of the storyline is her discovery in a series of real estate case files some hundreds of illnesses plaguing the citizens of Hinkley, a small desert community north of Los Angeles. During her subsequent investigation, Erin's innate empathy and kinship for fellow blue-collar families inspires her to uncover a conspiracy by a multi-billion dollar public utility to dispel its liability for the community's failing health. What could have played as yet another weepy disease-of-the-week telefilm is invigorated by Roberts, Susannah Grant's snappy script and the on-target direction by Steven Soderbergh. Rarely bogged down by lulls of requisite exposition, ""Erin Brockovich"" is briskly carried aloft on the shoulders of no-holds-barred Roberts, who gleefully understands her character's motivation and relentlessly pursues her course, even at the risk of increasingly neglecting her children and current beau. Too-long missing from American cinema, this entry in the ""triumph of the little guy"" oeuvre is too irresistible to dislike and too satisfying to dismiss.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I think I liked the Limey better because it was more interesting looking and had Terence Stamp - sorry but Julia is no Terence.You really can't go wrong with a script based on a true story - at least not if the story is interesting.  Erin Brockovich is everything A Civil Action wanted to be.The absolutely terrifying thing about this film is at some point I thought just how many times do we have to hear these stories about big companies killing off the little people in the world.

"A very compelling story, well casted and with superb acting.","Very entertaining movie, which held my attention throughout. Julia Roberts and Albert Finney were just outstanding in the lead roles. Only criticisms are two: The ""R"" rating for language was much deserved. The movie could have been just as effective if the language was curbed. The firey personality of Erin could have been displayed just as well, and the movie could have been more available to younger audiences, which would be beneficial. It was disappointing to me to see someone of the stature and appeal of Julia Roberts using such crude language and probably 95% of the foul talk was in her script. The only other negative feature was the tiresome politically correct themes that seem to always appear in Hollywood productions, of the bad capitalist corporations, and the strong capable female and weak dependent males.

It's been so long since we've seen Roberts in a role that was more than just fluff.  This role signals a return to more serious fare.  And not only did Roberts bring the role to life, she did it clad in the most hideous of 80's fashions.  This movie isn't just about cleavage -- the clothing is representative of the time period.

Excellent with a capital E!,"Now this IS a film that contains Julia Robert's best performance. Anyway, I can even go as far as saying that it certainly beats the one she displayed in Stepmom.Robert's portrays a single, unemployed mother of three children who just lost a court case and is now finding it impossible to pay all her bills and expenses. Naturally, she desperately tries to find every job possible in the local newspaper...with no luck of course. So, her only alternative is to try and force her lawyer, Ed, to give her any job available at his firm.Curiosity finally got the better of Julia, as she goes scurrying around the firm and finds herself glued to an interesting case which involves countless number of people who have suffered from diseases caused by water produced by their distributor. Then the plot thickens, with Julia smelling something illegal going on in the water distributor and ultimately, finds a new case for her new boss (Ed).I must admit that the setting of an outback America was a bit of a huge letdown for me. I'm the sort of person who's used to a nice, urban avenue filled with typically large American houses or big, meteropolise areas chocked with skyscrapers (i.e New York). However, overall, I was very pleased with the film and this is a must see for all Julia Robert's fans.",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia's performance saves the movie.,"We've seen it before, many times. Poor and defenseless, albeit decent people, against rich and powerful entities. The movie is extremely predictable. Every motion is lead by another predictable action. Like when she met the biker. We know what is coming after wards. So the producers probably wanted to make it different from others. They dressed the heroine like a hooker with a foul mouth. We see a lot of Julia Robert's skin throughout the picture. And that's were the film diverts. It's hard to forget that we're seeing Julia Roberts instead the real Erin Brockovich. Even her children are not likable characters. She outshines them all. There's also a lack of suspense.

It's closer in spirit to ""All the President's Men"" than to the movie it's bound to be compared with, ""Silkwood.""  This one isn't in ""President""'s rarefied league, but it puts ""Silkwood"" in the shade, and Julia trumps Meryl handily by being not only fully up to the emotional demands of the part, but by being hilariously funny as well--and physically a dream.

You cannot escape that Soderbergh probably did this to finance ""Traffic"", but it's an above-average multiplex effort.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie worth watching,"When Erin Brockovich first came out in theaters, it was not one of my first choices. So, I did not go see it. When it came out on video my Mom wanted to rent it. She really wanted to see it. She liked it so much she bought it. She persauded me to watch it one day. I did and did not regret it. Julia Roberts was great as law firm research assistant Erin Brockovich. Albert Finney did well as her boss Ed Masry. Also, the movie was well written. If you have time watch this movie. It is a lot fun and entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Roberts kicks butt!!!,"I saw this movie at a preview the night before it's official opening (of March 17, 2000) and I thought it was great. I don't think I've seen Julia play a gutsy part so well. It may be too early to predict but she may get an Oscar nomination at next year's Oscar ceremonies. Playing the part of Erin Brockovich upstages ""Pretty Woman""'s Vivian and ""Steel Magnolias""'s Shelby to the third degree. The story never faltered for a moment and the supporting players seemed to know how to project their characters to keep it from looking like Julia was the only one on the set who knew how to play a part. It's going to be a while but this is one film I look forward to purchasing once it's available on video.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Again, Julia Roberts shows her greatness...","Wow, what a movie! I was dying to see it, but was prevented from doing so until it came out of video.  Of course, during the movies that actually mean something to me, there are always phone calls, people asking ""Hey, what happened?"" upon return from their twelfth snack run to the kitchen, dogs barking at passers by...  Somehow, I managed to watch the movie through all these interruptions, and come out of it with that rare feeling that this was a GREAT movie.  It was warm, gritty, real and beautiful.  Julia Roberts played the low income single mother to the point where you forget she's Julia Roberts.  Erin is mouthy, ballsy, brash and fun.  It's a story of dedication and a person standing against great odds... it's inspiring, yet not mushy about it, and the many people in the movie are all to be commended for their real-ness.  It's a SUPER movie, and from someone who really dislikes ""tear-jerker-ish"" kind of movies, that means something. It ranks up there with The Green Mile, and the Shawshank Redemption - fresh ideas, reminding us that we have not run out of stories - just the ability to put quality over $quantity$.

Julia Roberts At Her Best,"AFI 100 Cheers. AFI 100 Heroes/Villains.""Erin Brockovich"" is a pleasant movie and one of the best projects from director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh is a talented filmmaker who is able to direct movies from a wide range of genres. There are the ""Ocean's"" movies of course, which have a glamorous style of their own in terms of editing and prove to be fun and easy to watch. There are also strange, morbid and overly dark films such as ""Unsane"" which has a strange gimmick of being shot entirely on iPhone cameras. But somewhere in the middle, there is ""Brockovich,"" a movie from the start of the millennium starring a talented cast including Aaron Eckhart, Albert Finney, and, who can forget in her Oscar-winning role, Julia Roberts.This is such a solid character-driven movie, and almost every scene is fun to watch thanks to Julia Roberts. Act one is really interesting because you would not think to connect a traffic collision to the idea of a character getting a job, but that is exactly what happens. The titular character, Erin, is shown in a job interview at the start of the movie, and she has the right personality for the interview but lacks the experience. We feel for her as we learn she has three kids, she has been divorced twice, and she is basically broke. Once she gets in a traffic collision, she has trouble contacting the lawyer assigned to her case, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), so she figures if the people at the law firm cannot do their job, she will show up and do it for them. And we see that bold persistence in Erin throughout the duration of the film.Erin is the type of human we should all aspire to be because her persistence and loyalty allows her to have a better work ethic even than her superiors. She does investigating on her own when she is given permission (barely) by Ed Masry, but this involves her doing her work away from the firm for a period of time, and she gets fired since everybody assumes she just left the job to ""have fun."" After all, most of the women working at that law firm have expressed their disliking of her due to the way that Erin dresses. But that is the thing about Erin - she could care less that she dresses in a revealing manner. It even helps her get information on the case she is working on. Masry asks Erin how she was able to obtain so much information that would help their case. Her response? ""They're called boobs, Ed.""In terms of filmmaking, ""Erin Brockovich"" is nothing that is going to be remembered for its visuals or editing. It plays out like a typical movie - there are no iconic shots, there is no spectacular editing style, and the strongest aspects of the film are clearly its story and the performance by Julia Roberts. It is such a joy to watch Roberts in this performance and it definitely makes the movie feel more like a comedy than a serious drama. Audiences can probably look at it either way though since it is, above all, an inspiring flick.Julia Roberts has never been better and she completely sells the movie.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Erin Brockovich-Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover ****,"Other than ""Pretty Woman,"" this was certainly the best Julia Roberts role ever and her Oscar was well-deserved.Roberts immediately comes on screen as a bimbo with a brain who has had 2 failed marriages and is really down on her luck as she struggles to raise 3 children.Fate has it that she meets up with an automobile accident and a lawyer, superbly played by Albert Finney, who she gets to hire her.Loud, common and ready to use her beauty as another Stella Dallas, Erin (Julia) soon shows her mettle by uncovering a major scandal involving the use of chromium as toxic waste with the result that plenty of people were ill from using the contaminated water nearby.Hardworking and caring, this undertaking changes Erin drastically. While she was a caring person with a foul mouth, she becomes much more mature as she works to have the gas and electric company found responsible for what has been occurring.The picture brings out that hard work with a purpose and the ability to persevere will always pay off.Besides a terrific supporting performance by Finney, Aaron Eckhardt is wonderful as her motor-cycle boyfriend who loves her and her children, but finds it increasing difficult to play second fiddle to a job that's rapidly consuming her.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A movie where you meet a women of some mettle!,"When someone asks you to name a Julia Roberts movie, it is certainly not Erin Brockovich, you would go for rather you would advise for pretty woman. And by all means, this movie can be cremated(I'm a Hindu and so is she) for Roberts' performance but the question arises of why 8 then? Well, you might have heard that some books are to be chewed and some to be digested... Likewise, this one has to be digested! Why? The Story! A single handed mom with a weakness for troublesome romantic relations (to speak of the neighbor biker) who has the best of convictions and a passion to fight for justice. But, this movie is akin to what is reading between the lines in a book.Yes, the movie contains a deeper meaning and our understanding of progress, which is not always right for the best of both worlds. For what maybe progress for the developed may turn out to be a warrant to death for the developing. The so portrayed neighbourhood is a victim to the company's chemicals for decades while little knowing about it. And when they come to terms with the chemicals, the situation is grim and the result: every thinkable cancer. Apply the analogy to countries and you will identify what I was referring to earlier. Erin is hence no short of a messiah to represent as many as 634 plaintiffs and grant them justice. Someone for being what many would called on the lines of a beauty queen, man she has brains. So, this one was an inspirational story to me. And can only be justified with an 8!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great story,"My major problem with this very good and accurate film is that I am not a fan of Julia Robert's except for her hair. I didn't think she deserved the Oscar.That out of the way, the film tells the story of Brockovich, a single mom with no job. She couldn't even win a lawsuit involving a car accident.Feeling her lawyer failed her, she demands that he hire her. She's not considered an asset to the firm. At all.Erin happens on a real estate case and discovers that Pacific Gas & Electric is buying contaminated land. The company is dumping hexavalent chromium and poisoning residents.Before anyone knows it, the law firm is involved in a huge class action lawsuit.I don't know how many times we have to see these true stories of despicable companies hurting innocent people. It makes you wonder how many are out there getting away with it.Brockovich herself states the film was 98-99 percent accurate, a sobering thought. The film shows Brockovich working through and surviving her own rotten luck, and her courage to push through in life and with the victims involved in the suit.The film has charm and a lot of humor. Albert Finney is, as usual, wonderful.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best movies I've seen in a long time!!,"I caught a sneak preview of this film on Saturday, and I must say I was completely riveted the entire way through!  This is a very compelling (and true) story of a woman who decided to quit letting things happen *to* her, and started to just make things happen for herself.  Raising three children on her own, having less than $100 in the bank, no job, and just having been in a serious car accident, she basically bullies her way into a position at a law firm to work for the lawyer who had been representing her in the law suit she had just lost for said car accident.Julia Roberts' portrayal of Erin is spirited, real, courageous, and best of all entertaining as all heck to watch!  The entire theater cheered her on as she would let fly with a lethal dose of in-your-face reality and truth.  If you've ever felt like you were at the end of your rope in life, this woman reminds you of it, and then makes your jaw drop as she pulls herself out of a huge pit in her life.  On top of it all, she finds that it is when she dedicates herself to helping others better their own lives that her life becomes far better than she could have ever dreamed.  An object lesson and something to think on far after you leave the theater.Erin Brockovich is my new hero!",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia's A Force Majeure,"I had to really think really hard before I wrote this review, because of the type of film this is and loosely based on the real Erin Brokovitch, a hard-to-believe yet true story of a foul-mouthed ex-beauty queen, given to wearing skin-tight skirts and revealing blouses. I like Julia as an actress and it's not the first time Julia Roberts has marched through like a force of nature in her films. I can't take her for granted as to let you know the movie ""Erin Brokovitch"" has given her some of the best dialog. Julia Roberts really has fire in her eyes as she grabs this eponymous role, injecting the character with great energy and drive she can muster. Her acting performance makes her a true star.

A noble boring movie !!!,"I was undecided about this movie, but the high score on IMDB worked to take me to the cinema. Well, after more than two hours of nothing (except Julia's petty clothes !!), I wonder if just because this movie deals with noble things: cancer, children, the victory of the small against the big, etc, a score of nearly 8 is justified ? More than one time I was to abandon the cinema, but I resisted till the end hoping for something to happen. No way !! Sometimes the job of a movie maker is to transpose a real fact into a movie without adding anything. But if the reality is such a boring list of events .. think for a moment to the people that spends two hours of their time on a cinema chair. They aren't in the story, though a very noble one that touches everyone heart !! The  only ""live"" moments are the ... naked part of Julia's body!! and some nice sentences that waked up the audience and got some laughs.

"For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Please, don't ask me to give it up.","The film is based on a real case and is about real people so to that ends it is obviously simple in structure, and nagging away as you watch it is the fact that the ending is never in doubt, it ""is"" all too predictable. However, what made Erin Brockovich the success it was is that the title character is not only interesting but also, importantly, intriguing. A foul mouthed hard bitten, twice divorced mother of three has to fight her corner just to get an honest days pay. It's a fabulous story backed up by a simply incredible performance from Julia Roberts. Here Roberts has let her hair down, puts on a push up bra and a short skirt, she is clearly enjoying the freedom of the role, and the results are real effective.I have no doubt that working alongside Albert Finney helped Roberts no ends, but it is her show all the way, and she alone masks over what really is an ordinary film, there is nothing we haven't seen before here, it's just a more modern take on the good versus evil corporate company scenario. It's steadily directed by Steven Soderbergh, emotional scenes are not overstretched to treacle point, and all in all it's good solid story telling. Repeat viewings prove to dilute the uplift factor of the finale, but Roberts' performance certainly holds firm for evermore.8/10 for the film, 10/10 for Roberts' ballsy show.

What will next 4 films to get Best Picture nominations next year?,"The first nominees for next year's Oscars in the Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director, Best Original or Adapted Screenplay and Best Costume Design categories have already been secured with the arrival of ""Erin Brockovich"". Julia Roberts is spectacular in the title role of a hard working single mother who stumbles on one of the biggest corporate wrongs in U.S. history. She would've stole every scene if it wasn't for her co-star Albert Finney who matches her for every point/counterpoint. He plays her reluctant and somewhat befuddled employer who finally joins her fight. Although her box office says otherwise I've always thought Roberts was way overrated as a movie star. Now I'm a believer. She is smart, sassy, foul-mouthed, fiery, sensitive, funny and, of course, very sexy. It is one of best performances I've ever seen by an actress in a lead role and for some reason it reminds me of Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy from ""Bull Durham"" in that both outstanding roles combined real intelligence with real sex appeal. (Of course Annie Savoy is purely fictional whereas Erin Brockovich is not.) I sense that her character may appeal more to men than women (her costume designer obviously had a lot fun working on this film). The reviews I've read have been excellent, but this movie exceeds them largely because the rest of the actors are great as well. Finney's work is more nuanced than Roberts' because it has to be and he provides the perfect foil for her volcanic emotions. Aaron Eckhardt deserves mention too as Roberts' good guy biker boyfriend. These performances are made possible by a superb script from Susannah Grant. Her fact-based tale of a small (hick) town poisoned by a giant utility has ""Rocky""-like satisfactions in it and they feel all earned. The fascinating tale is matched by dialogue that is often fast and furious and very funny and it is in a story that really tugs at your heart strings. Director Steven Soderbergh equals the effort that he put forth with the vastly underrated ""Out Of Sight"". This is an ""adult"" movie in the very best sense of that term. ""Erin Brockovich"" is definitely a big Hollywood movie with all he fun and rewards that come with it. It also proves that smart entertainment can deal with big issues and make time fly. It is the first Best Picture nominee for next year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not an exceptional film,"The idea that this film is exceptional or that Julia Roberts' performance is exceptional is just another Hollywood snow job. A very surfacey look at the story of the woman in the movie's title. To separate his work from appearing like that of, say, Penny Marshall, Soderbergh seems to insert long, boring parts into his movie so that people will see him as an auteur. ""Ain't he deep?!"" You can load a movie up with all the film school smoke you want, but I've watched enough Nick at Nite to spot bad '70's TV when I see it and let me tell you, kiddies, in Erin Brockovich I see it! Also, a very lousy job of balancing the love part of the story with the big bad corporate part. If Julia Roberts wins the Oscar for this I hope she forgoes thanking her agent, her eighth grade drama teacher and God and actually thanks the one thing that got her nominated for this role to begin with...her push-up bra.

"Commitment, hard work and passion against all odds","Yeah yeah, my review's title is a nice summary about this movie. I wasn't completely sure before i watched it but, then it surprised me a lot, it was a great surprise and i am happy that i watched it.First of all i have to remark the fabulous performance that Julia Roberts gave us in this movie....This Erin Brockovich had a stubborn personality and was really hot-blooded, she was committed to her job and she didn't quit even in the most difficult situations, and Julia had to be to the height of the character, a really complex one, and she really could handle the character and made it hers, i actually believed Julia could have been Erin. She wasn't a lawyer, luckily, she wasn't in that business of deceitment and betrayal, she was pure and always spoke with the truth, and she cared about her customers, not as people who gave you their many but as people that have a story behind them, she cared about the emotional context, in other words, she treated them as they deserved for the only fact that they are people, not for the money they can or can't give you, and that's great of Erin, that's the most important.Of course this is an actual case, and i have to say that finally justice rules, this movie should encourage everybody else to see that it isn't impossible to fight against something that is believed to be more powerful than us.Here it is really good portrayed the situation of justice in the world, the most powerful people gets the better part just because they have good lawyers , and in some cases good legions of lawyers. That can disencourage people, because what is a single person to do against a huge organization?? And besides, judges aren't correct with their decisions, this case was a happy exception to that luckily. Let's pray for all the cases to have an ending like this................I am forgetting about the guy who played Erin's employer, he did a remarkable job too, and helped a lot to the character of Roberts...he was, the typical lawyer but Erin's goodwill helped to change him.........Resuming, i love this movie as a nearly perfect portrayal of our decadent legal system, and the message of hope it gives us when you see it isn't impossible to win saying the truth.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A perfect movie,"First I was rather suspicious of this movie : poor single mother wins out against big corporation so I was expecting some 'Ally Mcbeal'-style court case flick to do with discrimination or harassment stuff and in the end plaintive gets awarded a zillion dollars.But its much more serious : a whole community gets almost deliberately poisoned by high toxic waste from nearby chemical plant.  Inhabitants start to get the most terrible infections, parts of their organs rotting away, cancer, etc....and eventually a painful death.Based on a true story this is simply a perfect movie : it's Hollywood at its best. Everything is 'right on the money' : story, acting, direction, photography,... : there isn't a false note in the whole movie.  They even do not botch up the ending, a rarity in recent Hollywood flicks.Roberts has her best part ever: she is just brilliant as the supersexy loudmouthed and abrasive but with a heart of gold single mother.  Greatly balanced by that old UK pro Albert Finney as the somehow tired looking smalltime lawyer they make up a great team against the bigtime corporate lawyers.Soderbergh direction doesn't miss a beat, as he could go for the full 'get out your handkerchieves' style; EB is directed  in a solid, no-nonsense almost docu-style way, without falling into the trap of constant high melodrama.Even the music was great.What can I say : this is one of those rare pictures that is just 100 % sheer perfection.A straight 10/10 of course.PS : if you would have to put with constant foul-mouthed language by someone who looks like Julia Roberts, would you really mind ?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Roberts poorly cast, but does her best with T.V. material","I must have missed something here.  I saw this movie when it was called ""A Civil Action."" But wait, let's add a new twist, let's use somebody's t.v. movie of the week true story, alter some facts therein, and make it the next Julia Roberts movie vehicle.  I don't understand movie reviews that say ""Julia has done it again.  She has played against type and succeeded."" Wait one hot minute here.  If I'm not mistaken, she really has only played Julia Roberts in every movie.  Sure she squints her face, makes a goofy chuckle, walks as if she's prettier than she actually is, and sheds a tear for good measure.  I've seen this in every movie she's been in.  Possibly she could have won a lifetime achievement award, but at such a young age?  The Oscar should stand for an individual performance, not for slack in the rope that needed to be tightened for past efforts.  I think roles like Sigourney Weaver's in Aliens, for which she was nominated and lost far exceed the range of drama than in this picture.  Erin seemed beaten down by her own life.  But that alone is not deserving of a reward.  The character seemed like a bitch to be honest.  Let's see, no manners, an awful attire, a foul mouth, an ignorant mother-who leaves their kids with a biker she just met-no matter how desperate?, and money driven.  There are many people in tough situations who don't have the best of resources.  Maybe if the movie centered on why SHE merits such an opportunity to rise above the mess instead of manipulating those around her by promising things she cannot/will not produce, it might have been compelling.  If it wasn't for the money won at the end, the movie would not have been made.  And that is the saddest truth we learn from it.  It is not compelling to watch someone who gets $20 million a movie console someone trying to get money because they got cancer from a corporate giant.  The paradox is too evident.  The film has a moment where they argue about the necessity for a trial, because it will make the bad guys admit what they did was wrong in court.  But we never actually see this.  Only a settlement was actually reached.  This kills any moral drive the movie has.  So what is the movie trying to focus on?  The trial, her life, the outcome, the money.  Who knows?  Julia is a fine actress, I have enjoyed her since Mystic Pizza, thru Flatliners, and Pretty Woman.  It's great that she does entertaining funny ""date movies."" But she did not deserve the Academy Award.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
very inspiring and definitely feminist,"It is a very entertaining and - unlike what many people think - very believable movie.  I was surprised to see very little mention of the feminist implications of the movie.  Erin's genuine compassion can only be felt so intensely by the people she interacts with because she is a woman. Of-course the fact that she is not a perfect career woman, in terms of professional attitude and wardrobe style etc...  adds another element of reality as she is not THE perfect woman - yet she succeeds in a lovely way and with such support from us: people watching the movie! This movie, in addition to the very good performance of the cast and the main idea of the plot, also points out a very interesting point: a woman with a great setback of lack of a qualified expressing C.V. can make some significant changes given her innate sympathy, compassion and emotional intelligence. Very inspiring. i don't know about the majority of people who watched the movie, but it seemed VERY believable to me.",,Anonymous,Biography
I would never have expected this to be a good movie,"I remember thinking, from the first time I saw the trailer for this movie in theaters, that there would be no way that it could ever be a movie worth watching.  For one thing, I've never been that impressed by Julia Roberts. In addition, the trailer made her look like she'd be playing a stereotype - a one-dimensional talk-to-my-hand-while-you-look-at-my-breasts type of character.  But, most importantly, I was certain that there was no way, under the constant and unalterable laws that hold our universe together, that I would ever be able to sit through a film that associates itself with that accursed ""Everyday is a winding road"" song.I guess I can't always be right.I went to see Erin Brockovich because several people whose opinions I value promised me that it was actually good.  Even then, I was skeptical, but I found this to be an extraordinary film.  Far from being one-dimensional, Erin is an interesting, funny, and intelligent character and one of the best written female characters to appear in a movie in a long time.  And, I must admit, Julia Roberts really sells the performance well.  Depending on what else Hollywood has to offer this year, both Roberts and her movie may be looking at an Oscar nomination.  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie! Excellent and well done work. Great to see how a true story character like Erin Brockovich can be made famous by the beautiful Julia Roberts.,"Julia Roberts can I say Julia Roberts again now talk about a performance to remember and Julia I'm sure glad you won a best actress Oscar for this work. Roberts is tremendous and sexy as ever as Erin Brockovich a research assistant who sees how a large company has kept hidden toxic secrets that caused a community increase of cancer and sickness. Julia Roberts is as sexy as ever with this role now the real Erin Brockovich is missing something any guess? Try Julia Roberts with the bust. I always wondered did Julia Roberts wear colored bras, and yes she does in nearly every scene of Brockovich you see many of the bra straps are exposed from the sleazy and short clothing she wears. I remember red, blue, black, black mixed with other colors, now how sexy. You find more out of this film than just the sexy Julia Roberts it gives a strong message to fight for what you believe in and never give up hope or spirit always fight against the odds and win.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Roberts best,"I was waiting for this huge social lecture;I like these type of films, but hate the lectures.  Instead, I found a entertaining, yet realistically acted film.  It was enjoyable to watch how mistakes happen, intentionally, or people just not caring, and lawyers (for a change not being the bad guy) give people the opportunity for amends.  Regrettably money will never be a true payment for justice, but the people at least were able to move.  I wonder how many of these man made disasters happen?  In Canada, we seem too have cover ups where I read the paper, and nothing ever get resolved with many issues.  I wonder if they get settled out of court.  A movie is like a few pictures of a very complex event.  I found this movie, it may have been dramatized, gave me a better understanding of the events.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Julia Roberts' best performance ever? Sorry, NO!","Many people have said this film contains Julia Roberts' best screen performance ever and I must say I do not agree with that. I do not agree, because it kind of insinuates Julia has been doing crap out there on the big screen for years and that definitely is not true. What is true though is that Julia Roberts is an actress that brings really every character to the screen and the viewer as realistic possible and therefore she is always believable. The only difference with this film however is, that this is not a lighthearted comedy like Notting Hill, but a real life drama that calls for artistic acting instead of just an 'easy' romantic / comedy performance. That is also the reason I feel that this movie might actually get Roberts an Oscar nomination for best actress, because characters like this fall better with the critics than the characters she played in Notting Hill, My best Friend's Wedding or The Runaway Bride, for the critics seem to think that being able to be believable is not as much of an achievement, but rather having depth and strength and character is. That Oscar nomination I mentioned, could it be endangered though by the amounts of profanity in this picture? I hope not and I do not believe so, for if the critics would also react on profanity, where would Pulp Fiction have gotten? That profanity is one thing I liked too, I mean never have I seen such an adorable 'b..ch' on the screen. I mean you just have to love Brokovich (Roberts), for she is so true and right out and says whatever she wants, whenever she wants to whoever is in the room in her, it wouldn't matter if it were the Pope or the President of the USA. Oscar nomination, that's all I'm talking about, well will she win it? NO! And why not? Because she is too big a star, look at Carrey and Willis. Well what about Hanks you say. Well Hanks is a different story, he is known to star in films that require acting and he got famous with those acting roles, like in Philadelphia, Forrest Gump and so on. Plus his comedy's never were as 'kitschy' as Roberts'. But as long as Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet are not out there, to get the Oscar Roberts' has a good chance. On and on I go about Roberts' great performance (again), but what about the other great performance I saw, coming from Albert Finney, who plays Roberts' boss. He was great too, but you know it was not all his achievement, just as Roberts' greatness was not all her achievement. The two just were unbeatable as a screen 'couple' and if there were prices for best on screen duo's they'd win them all, but since there is no such award I know (almost) for sure that Finney will win the Oscar. A few other Oscars the film will get or be nominated for are Best screenplay, Best Director and Best film (first one is a winner, the others are losers). But you know that's only how I think it will be and my opinion is not a good one to believe, since I thought Shakespeare in Love sucked big time and it got so many awards. But I am pretty optimistic, for I have not seen such a good 'artistic' movie this whole year. I mean it may not be fast paced or so, but it holds your attention and it is not too dramatic despite the fact that it is based on a true event which took place not even so many years ago and that is what I really liked also about this film. You really have to see this if you like these kinds of movies, whether you like Roberts or not, for her part is unlike anything she has ever played before cause I have never seen her yell and curse like this before. If this one can't convince you of Julia Roberts' acting quality nothing can!8 out of 10Note: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time.

Pretty good authentic law drama,"OK, so Julia Roberts is not the best actress, and, admittedly, this probably doesn't contain the best acting she has pulled off in her career, but I think she does good enough in this movie. She plays a nearly totally independent woman who fights for a cause, that she feels is right, which costs her a lot of time away from her three kids. The plot is pretty good, and it develops at a good pace, keeping you interested in it for the duration of the film. The actors do okay jobs in portraying their respective characters, though I found a few of the minor characters to be played by fairly inexperienced actors, who didn't perform terribly well. The child-actors performed pretty good, though. The characters are well-written, but since it's based on a true story, I don't know how much of it had to be made up. The humor in the movie is quite well-placed and often very funny. The character that Julia plays is a symbol of independent women everywhere; she's intelligent, she has female intuition and she knows how to use her attractiveness to get what she wants. Granted, a part of the movie concentrates a lot on Julia's curves, or, more specifically, her breasts. Personally I think that as long as it's in context, which it pretty much always is here, it doesn't really matter; also, if the real Erin acted like that, shouldn't the movie have the fake one acting like that too? Overall, a pretty good authentic drama. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys dramas, independent women and authentic movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Decent acting and story but hardly deserving of the Oscar,"I thought the acting was fairly decent by Julia Roberts and her costar Albert Finney, but I do feel that the Oscar was undeserved. It seemed like this year's Oscars were more of a popularity contest than accolades for true accomplishment. Ellen Burstyn was no doubt robbed of her Best Leading Actress Oscar for Requiem for a Dream. The other 2 actresses who I felt won premature, undeserved Oscars were Gwyneth Paltrow in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love and Helen Hunt in 1997 for As Good as It Gets. Don't get me wrong: all decent performances but all in all pretty ordinary. Who was most deserving of the Best Actress Academy Award in the past decade? Without a doubt, Jessica Lange for 1994's Blue Sky, followed closely by Susan Sarandon in 1995 for Dead Man Walking and Kathy Bates in 1990 for Misery. Don't want to get off the subject, but might as well point out how I felt about Best Actor. Russell Crowe---Best Actor? I thought I'd puke. Kevin Spacey, Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump, and Anthony Hopkins---all undeserving. Most deserving??? That would be the brilliant Nicolas Cage for 1995's Leaving Las Vegas, followed closely by Al Pacino for 1992's Scent of a Woman, Roberto Benigni for 1998's Life is Beautiful [which I feel sour that it didn't win Best Picture], and Geoffrey Rush for 1996's Shine.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Erin Brockovich,"As much as I try, and as much as I appreciate the movies she's in and the roles she takes on, I am simply not a fan of Julia Roberts'. Steven Soderbergh's 2002 feature Erin Brockovich was another good role for the star Roberts, but just one I couldn't sink my teeth into. Along with Roberts, Albert Finney also stars as the unlikely duo that brings down a multi-million dollar water corporation. The story of a single mother of three who will stop at nothing to provide for her kids and the vulnerable people she encounters is one that has settled into the hearts of audiences years after its release.Single mother, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is unemployed and desperate for a job. When she unsuccessfully pursues an insurance claim in which she was hit, she stumbles upon the notion that she could start working at the legal office that was chosen to represent her. Thankfully for Erin, she encounters Ed Masry, an overworked kind-hearted lawyer that gives Erin a chance to work for his law office. Ostracized from the office for her revealing wardrobe, Erin must learn the ropes of the law office herself, having no legal background or experience. Throughout her research, Erin stumbles upon many inconsistencies in retail deeds and health records. Once she is granted permission from Ed to further investigate the inconsistencies, Erin uncovers that powerful California water company, PG&E have been dumping toxic chemicals into the ground water sources in Hinkley California. When more and more residents are diagnosed with illnesses corresponding with the effects of the chemical being dumped into the water source, Erin brings the issues to Ed's attention and the two voraciously go after the water company, resulting in the largest class-action lawsuits in American history, at the time.Nothing too innovative happens throughout the film, Erin Brockovich, and it doesn't have to, the story is compelling enough to drive the issue for the audience. I wish I could have seen this movie before the water crisis in Flint, Michigan; I think I have been desensitized to the thought that financial gain could encourage a corporation to poison a water supply. Regardless, this film portrays a nice David v. Goliath where we get to see an endearing couple of Davids beat the monster.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hooray for Hollywood!,"Why can't we get more films like this, a strong story, based on actual events, excellent performances and dialogue which sounds like it is based on how real people talk to each other?I don't know how accurate this particular story about corporate deceit and environmental pollution is but, given the track record of big corporations, it should be a rich vein for film makers to mine. 'Erin Brockovich' is very good, a shocking story of  land pollution and resultant death and disease in a community. A story, however, which would not have been told were it not for the efforts of one woman to get behind the obfuscation and at the truth. It's a juicy role and Julia Roberts grabs it for all she is worth, she is superb, full of anger and determination to use the opportunity to make something of her life. This is the strength of her performance, she convinces in showing us a woman in challenging circumstances, on her own with no job and kids to feed who is actually a bold and intelligent woman rather than a victim. There is a real hunger about how she works her socks off to put the case together while trying to balance her other responsibilities.There are good performances all round and some of the dialogue really crackles, seeing some corporate lawyers put in their place is particularly satisfying. A film well worth seeing and one that is more subtle than it might at first appear.",,Anonymous,Biography

(yawn),"What was this?  Nominated for best picture, best screenplay, Julia Roberts won the academy for her portrayal of Brockovich?  I don't think so.  See, this is where the wonderful world of entertainment and myself have a little differ of opinion when it comes to good movies.  THIS was not one of them.I will never understand why celebrities are paid these big bucks just because they can memorize some lines.  You throw in some movie previews that you think the public should see in order to waste seven, eight dollars, and suddenly, you have a money making picture all because you had the brains to hire one of the biggest (and overrated) actors in the show business.Why did everybody, and when I say 'everybody' I mean the academy awards association, think that this picture was deserving to be nominated for an oscar?  I suppose I should have seen this one coming considering that they gave the lousy 'American Beauty' the gold statue the year before.I think that I am about the only person who doesn't like Roberts.  I don't like the roles she picks, her acting ability isn't exactly golden, and I hate how everyone thinks that she is the number one actress around nowadays. Will somebody explain to me why she was exactly nominated for the best actress award?  You got her running around like a hooker for two+ hours.  I thought that we had already covered the whole hooker thing in 'Pretty Woman.'  She goes prancing around the town in heels that she can barely stand up in.  And the thing that made this story look bad was that no matter how tight the money was and whenever times got tough, we never see Brockovich wear the same outfit twice.  Here she is looking all over for a job and complaining that she's got three kids to feed but just how poor was she if her wonderful wardrobe of mini skirts and tank tops never came to a repeat?  There went the movie.I can't really comment on the rest of the cast because there wasn't any! Yeah, sure Masry was a good size part but scene after scene I had to put up with looking at Roberts' face.Brockovich's snappy come backs and rude one liners began to run dry during the first twenty minutes of the film.  I'll admit that some evoked a slight laughter from me but not a whole lot.  I got a little tired of hearing f___ this and f___ that, but what can you do?I'm just wondering that if another actress had portrayed Erin Brockovich, would this movie have gotten the same amount of publicity?  The story line, even though it was based on a true story, was very bland.  All you have here is a non-educated mother of three who is trying to support her family when she comes along a case of water contamination and decides to bring it to the surface.  She wins, the water drinkers get a pay off, she gets a pay off and we're all really happy.  The movie ended too quick and then I was forced to listen to that dumb song by Sheryl Crow.Just some last comments:  The problem the movie crew had here was that they tried to make a movie out of something that didn't need to be made.  There wasn't enough information given about the case and it more or less focussed on Roberts playing a half dressed lawyer-type.  The lack of music was another thing that annoyed me.  How could they possibly make a soundtrack? And somebody want to tell me what they spent their $51 million budget on? The most creative thing that this movie had was the real E.B. in a cameo named 'Julia.'  Oh, how do they come up with these things!?  Final words: This movie was given too much credit all because it had the overrated Julia Roberts in the lead/only role.  Critics never know what they're talking about and I should never listen to the academy again.  Don't watch this!",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Julia's performance as Erin illustrates the frustration and hardships of an individual who feels trapped and devalued by society due to lack of skills and opportunity.

"Rather an enthralling film covering a woman on the brink, effectively covering her aiding the victimised and then coping with her own life.","Erin Brokovich is the remarkable true story of a beauty pageant contestant turned legal expert whom very gradually uncovered levels of corruption within a California based power company. One of the many joys of the film lies in how director Steven Soderbergh takes what should be the ultimate tale of a character or person well out of their depth and integrates them into their new surroundings so much so, that it turns out they are both infinitely more qualified and more able in dealing with the situation than some of their contemporaries. The film has all the charge and dramatic punch of a scuzzy, hard boiled revenge film as it covers an enraged lead on a mission in which no one will get in their way; its Conservitive core isn't heavy handed and the film's documentation of a tale dominated by themes of female empowerment is, pleasingly, never for a second interested in the objectification of its lead, despite the field from whence they herald and despite their more usual attire. One of the key exchanges highlighting the lead's newfound sense of identity within the world of law and investigation sees her speak to some of the victims of a power company's leak of some toxins into the local water supply, an event which happened some years ago. The child of the family can speak to our lead, they can speak to her in a way that they couldn't when a suit-clad, official, law degree wielding individual would come round to visit. The fish is most certainly out of the water but finding life easier and more digestible up on dry land, it seems.It is Julia Roberts playing American jobber turned beauty pageant competitor Erin Brockovich, the divorced single mother of three children striving to get by after a car accident and the loss of a consequential lawsuit leaves her with seventy-five dollars left. One of the very first instances we have of Brockovich engaging in official office-talk in a strictly business-like fashion is when dialogue with a doctor plays out, his background out of a nearby window occupied by tall, domineering buildings with a lone empty alcohol bottle occupying the space immediately behind Erin as suggestions of dishevelment draw in. While Brockovich herself was never an alcoholic, subtle props placed to reflect a respective situation work well; this early defeat aiding in getting across a sense of magnitude later on when we realise how far she's gone in taking on the nature of situations such as these and the officials at the core of these predicaments.Erin is supported by her lawyer Ed Masry (Finney), a man whom grants her a job at his small law firm when an outburst in court following the aforementioned car accident and consequent injury sees that particular claim fall through. From the bottom working upwards, the film is a joyous and deeply captivating tale of a woman on a road she had no real idea existed, ploughing onwards towards a hopeful victory. The sense that Brockovich is out of her depth or isn't immediately of the law firm ilk is effectively dealt with early on. Whilst working at the offices, Erin doesn't go to lunch with the other girls because ""she's not like the other girls""; her attire and informal mannerisms as she scoots around the office, verbally badgering Masry on occasion puts her in stark contrast to the other woman of the office whom spend most of their time passively occupying a space behind a desk and possessing a thoroughly different overall stature.Oral and visual confirmations of her respective situation as a person there are behind us by the time the tale has taken centre stage, an uncovering of some menial files which launches Erin into her quest the catalyst. The film is a superb documentation of this case involving injustices to a number of people in a small Californian town named Hinkley, as an electrical company and a water supply occupy the forefront of the case. The film very cleverly has a child take centre stage when Erin visits one of the victimised families, and that sense of the corporation being of an even nastier ilk than to how we may have previously felt, is slyly hit home by the film when it transpires an infant has been severely wronged by these people. On another strand, Erin's private life creeps into proceedings as neighbouring Hell's Angel biker George (Eckhart) becomes somewhat of a love interest, while her children become disenchanted by their mother's full time work; George being another character whom, like the loose, extroverted and former beauty pageant contest entering Erin, is granted a deconstruction of sorts and documented as anything but what prior conceptions we may have of them. It turns out he's good with her children, a kind man and is apologetic during their first encounter when he revs a motorcycle on his driveway too loudly, too late on.Indeed, the film pokes fun at how it could've used both Brockovich's demeanour and appearance. Allowing the fact this highly attractive woman, whom in usually on show in a vast range of cheap outfits, is at the centre of this really fascinating and humbling story, but only once uses her sexuality or 'to-be-looked-at-ness' as an example of principal involvement. The amusing sequence briefly hands Erin a seductive characteristic when she manages to con her way past a young male desk clerk and into an archival room doubling up as a mine of gold for the prosecution. As the clerk watches The Wheel of Fortune on a television, Erin spins the proverbial whilst somewhat illegally accessing the files she'll need. The film is refreshing and immense fun; Roberts, through her character, capturing a real sense desperation mixed with dedication blended with eccentricity as she soars on integrating with all around her, in what is an unremittingly engaging text based on true tale.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it. ""","Erin Brockovich is one of those films that without it's star, it wouldn't nearly be as good.

Sure the character and Robert's portrayal can be a bit over dramatic at times, but Roberts presence is felt every time she graces the screen.Julia Roberts is widely known as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and probably the most popular female of the last 30 years. But she's no slum acting wise. She garnered her Oscar win for this role, and rightfully so. She has some all-time great scenes, and I mean all-time great scenes. She is great at giving us dramatic moments with a bit of comedy mixed in. Her numbers moment with Aaron Eckhart was hilarious and her 'presents' speech to the lawyers was just as entertaining. Albert Finney had great chemistry with Roberts and gave just as great of a performance, but that's typical for Finney.With as much as the film focuses on Brockovich's devotion to giving her children the best possible life, I didn't particularly find the relationship fulfilling. I don't blame Eckhart for leaving for awhile either, sure she helped hundreds of people but her family was in need of a mother and she wasn't there for them. Whether or not that was put in the movie for dramatic purposes or not, who knows. There are quite a few really emotional moments that may or may not evoke tears.

When my girlfriend wanted to go see the sneak preview I thought it was worth watching for the movie it was showing with.To my surprise I enjoyed this movie very much, and especially with the surprise of not knowing what the ending would be. This movie was all Julia Roberts and she carried this movie from beginning till the end. I was hoping to know a little more about her and her family and her new biker boyfriend. If there were no children and she was a hooker off the street that wanted to get a real job then this would have the same plot. Then they could have her getting back in touch with her family that she ran away from and it would be just as interesting. This apparently was a true story so they had to stick to a basic plot. I'm sure the real Erin B. had more problems being respected and given the access to records and in the courtroom, but this was not shown. I am sure that would not make a good movie. I am also sure she was given more grief by her outfits, but that would not make a good movie if we can't see Julia in a push up bra for the whole movie. I enjoyed that acting and the non-traditional filming methods which made us feel more involved in the movie. I would be interested in knowing if the real Erin wrote a book on her rise to glory and I would be interested in comparing that to the movie. I hope this review doesn't stop anyone from seeing this movie. Please go and see it today... I was in a sold out theater of about 300",,Anonymous,Biography
Erin the Heroine,"Erin Brockovich [2000] with Julia Roberts in one of her most stellar roles.Erin the HeroineErin shows two main things: a. the persistence of a way of being in the world; b. how surface characteristics quickly change as the structure of the person's external world changes. Erin grew up as a small town beauty queen feeling like she was 'somebody', confident, spontaneous, in command, and had a birthright to win in games of one-up-man-ship. After two failed marriages, she realizes the cultural stereotype of marriage is stacked against women. She won't have any more of it. Now, after repeatedly being devastated by the ravages of a male dominant society, alone and penniless with children to support, she is up against that wall of bias against women again.In the middle of her current gloomy circumstances, she decides that this time she is going to go at it like a she-bear with cubs. Like competitive men who take a no holds barred approach to life, her inner resolve is saying, ""Everybody better look out, here comes the old, bold, Erin"". She finally scraps her way into a penny ante, food on the table, job.In her new, menial job in a small law firm, her implicit, strong, trust in her fortitude, intelligence, and judgment causes her mind to pause during the perusal of some legal gibberish. She notes an odd and incongruous conjunction in the information. With her revived naturally spontaneous and assertive self, she seeks validation of her suspicions of a cover-up conspiracy by visiting the actual defendants sited in the report. However, she finds the victims hostile to outsiders and oddly beholden and loyal to their corporate patrons. Rallying another side to her earlier resourcefulness and maturity she confronts the diffident victims with compassion, empathy, and humble eye-to-eye persuasiveness. This opens all the doors to the hearts of these fearful employees in this closed, ravaged, and emotionally depleted corporately sustained community. Her approach turns out to be a knockout combination of punches and she gains their confidence in her.Soon, her own life circumstances begin changing. As a male admirer enters her life, she holds him at bay while she thoroughly tests him. She hesitates because she does not want a repeat performance of her former relationships with men. When he proves to be genuinely supportive and kind, she finally, but gingerly, allows him into her life. He is truly helpful and patient, especially with her children. She feels the gods must be promoting a happy serendipity since this is just what she needs to give her the backup necessary for her to unleash her enormous but dormant combination of talents.As she succeeds with what has become a huge lawsuit over lethal damage caused by the pollution the corporation had been successfully covering up, the head of the small law firm calls in big legal guns to take over the case. In a conflict of her two most dominant traits, not to be bested by anyone and a level-headed maturity, the latter wins out. In a verbal contest with one of the legal experts brought to help insure their victory, she clearly demonstrates that she is not a woman to be discounted, regardless of the fact that the experts' credentials outclass her. She concedes that the experts should be allowed their role in the case, but she is remains the incumbent. Like a bull dog with its teeth sunk in a bone she will not relinquish her hold on 'her' case to the 'interlopers'. She proves to be as formidable as a gladiator when it comes to being a mental and verbal combatant, whether she is an expert in legalese or not.Erin's force-of-nature demeanor crashes through the legal establishment's protocol and causes enough dislodging of their composure to interrupt the judicial monotony. Her unconventional, countervailing mode-of-procedure forces the court to weigh the case on its inherent merit and overrides usual imbalance of powers favoring top-dollar law firms and rich corporations that typically holds-court!The injection of Erin the she-bear into the intransigent legal culture became the catalyst that cracked the defense and won the day for all of the exploited underdogs she so heartily and gallantly championed and for Erin, herself, as well. The citizens she victoriously fought for feel their esteem rise along with their 'Erin the hero'.Women of the world, take heart. When a fortuitous crack opens in the masculine wall within structure of the world, be ready with your marching boots to charge through it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
JULIA ROBERTS AND CAST ARE DEAD-ON PERFECT,Julia Roberts turns in a performance that comes straight from the gut and seems to relish every moment that she gets to live in Erin's story.  Albert Finney is brilliant as an attorney that you can almost genuinely like and Aaron Eckhart does wonders with what easily could have been a throw away role.  There is tremendous ensemble acting in this company and every actor adds to the creation of a very compelling and engaging movie.  This is the perfect film for anyone who loves to see the underdog take a big bite out of corporate America.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Amazing true story. Feel good, funny and inspirational. Julia Roberts' Oscar winning portrait of a single mom who takes on a corrupt multinational.","Amazing true story about a corrupt multinational that has been poisoning the drinking water of Americans. Julia Roberts is an uneducated single mom, who by accident gets a job at a law firm and despite having had no law experience whatsoever, she single handedly is the driving force behind taking on this huge, corrupt multinational to court. Not simply based on a true story, it is literally a TRUE story!What a terrific movie about female empowerment. But guys could love this story too, because it is funny, feel good and inspirational. And yes, Julia Roberts looks stunning with her low cut dresses, because she plays a character who is wary of how she should suppose to dress in a uptight law firm, therefore she just dresses as if she went to a bachelor party, because she likes the way she looks. Who could blame her...Seen this flick many times now and this is really becoming better the more often I watch it. The fact that the same jokes are still incredibly funny after repeated viewing, says a lot about the terrific true to life dialogues. It isnt a comedy though, the jokes simply rise out of ordinary daily conflicts.I am not a particularly huge Julia Roberts fan, but her acting is truly superb. Julia Roberts got her well deserved Oscar for best actress. BUT the supporting actors are terrific as well. Albert Finney in particular is hilarious in his role of Julia Roberts' boss, who just cant keep up with the energy and crazy ideas she has.Ultimately director Steven Soderbergh is to be thanked for creating this precious gem.

Mass Production Chewing Gum for the Eyes,"I know that people are desperate for entertaining cinema which is slightly more stretching then Mission Impossible 2, but this isn't it.Julia Roberts struggles very beautifully, whilst always appearing exactly like a multi-millionairess pretending to be poor and her performance has all the depths of a puddle. In her scenes with Albert Finney she looks like a cardboard cut-out.As for the story itself - we SHOULD be asking why no-one faced criminal charges, since all sueing a company does is pass the costs on to the consumer :-) And by the way, it's not an act of heroism to be an ambulance chasing lawyer - they have an interest too.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superbly executed,"Well, at first Julia Roberts' character annoyed me.  She was completely devoid of tact.  An early scene in the movie in which Ms. Brockovich goes through a trial quickly reveals most of this negative side and although you understand that she's not in a very good position in her life, you don't have an overwhelming amount of sympathy for her, which is good.  The rest of the film reveals that, despite her flaws, she's quite a humanist and will fight brutally to get what she believes is justice; not only that, but her flaws make her a very interesting and entertaining character.Unlike more complex law dramas, this film doesn't really get into what the true meaning of ""justice"" really is or any of that philosophical stuff, but then again it doesn't need to.  The story is pretty straightforward, and it's told in a very elegant way.  There are a few holes, such as why it seems as though Ms. Brockovich doesn't reveal to her family that she's *helping* people (as opposed to merely working 24/7) until near the end of the film, as well as a few other odd breaks in communication, but nothing major.Another thing that sort of annoyed me was the way that Ms. Brockovich is portrayed as the ""genius"" behind the whole case and basically does all the work while everyone else putzes around.  But hey, what can one expect from a Hollywood melodrama.For me, the most interesting things about the film are definitely the characters portrayed by Roberts, Eckhart, and Finney.  They're all very human, and reveal some interesting things about a person's appearance (including their manner of speaking) versus what they're really like, beyond a merely superficial level.  In particular, I like how the movie makes a point of implying how much of an illusion cuss words are, how little they tell us about a person who uses them, and the way that someone who never uses them at all and speaks in the most eloquent manner can be hundreds of times more cruel and immoral than someone who uses them dozens of times in a single sentence.",,Anonymous,Biography
Thought Provoking,"I went to see this movie because of Julia Roberts.  I think she is a very gifted actress and a ""pretty woman"" also.  I had not heard of this case so this movie brought a lot of things to light, like how rich companies feel they can break the laws and harm people and get away with it to save them money as if they can't afford to fix the problem.  Wouldn't it be easier and cheaper to fix the contamination than to pay out these huge monetary awards? Anyway, I thought this movie was well written and acted.  I loved the bits of dry humor to make this movie ""not so serious"".  This movie reminded me a little bit about Karen Silkwood and also about the movie Civil Action.  I rate this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Do they teach beauty queens to apologize? Because you suck at it!,"Sure everyone talks about this film as probably the best of Julia Robert's stellar career (We'll forget Hook and Mary Reilly ). She won an Oscar and an armload of other awards in her role as a mom struggling to overcome her trailer park background and put food in the mouths of her babes. It was a superior strong woman role and she was a real pleasure to watch, as she always is.Traffic and Sex, Lies and Videope director Steven Soderbergh put together another beauty of a show for our enjoyment. He also has an armload of awards.But, the real star of this film is Ed Masry played brilliantly by Albert Finney (Amazing Grace, Murder on the Orient Express, The Dresser, Tom Jones, Under the Volcano).

Hollywood Filmmaking at its Best!,"I never review a film unless it's only fit for a sewer contribution or it's a truly outstanding example of acting, directing, production or all three plus more. In the case of Erin Brockovitch, it truly is the latter. It's well acted, produced and directed. The storyline is one of the finest Hollywood has taken and created into film with a professional time-served cast to carry it from beginning to end. What swearing there is has justification and fits well without it being out and loud in every other line. What's more, Erin's fight to pursue a career with running a family can be identified by many single parents everywhere. What isn't there to like about this film? American films I've seen since come nowhere near this! Riddled with sex, violence and swearing, implying every Police Officer is either corrupt or gun-happy or that every white person is a racist hyena, whilst all other races are victims doesn't make for quality films - Erin Brockovitch, although made in 2000, still shines as an example of what Hollywood can hit the world with, without pandering to violence and gunfire.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Soderbergh...the Cukor of the Aughts?,"You can't quite always be sure. Is Steven Soderbergh giving us the most radical upending of a female movie star since Godard's TOUT VA BIEN? Or is he just a poor lackey locked under the jail, forced to photograph scenes in which Big Star Julia tells off rich snooty lawyers in glamourous closeups? Whichever--I guess he's both--he's the guy who took what could have been a routine chick-flick script and made it into a nineties ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.Soderbergh--fast becoming one of our finest directors--is all about the fringes. He's all about the perfect telling throwaway set decoration, the little improv'd moment a kid has that falls away at the end of a scene, the handheld moment that just goes soft a little bit. And it's the fringes that put this movie over, not the rah-rah script by Susannah Grant. (In one scene, Erin Brockovich demonstrates that she has the phone numbers of six hundred plaintiffs committed to memory. ""You want their diseases, too, Theresa?"" Grant sometimes thinks she's doing a rewrite on SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.) It's the Little People that Julia runs into--like Tracey Walter, as a guy who isn't what he seems. It's about the way the DP, the great Ed Lachman, makes everything feel so offhand, so yeah-whatever, and yet so very beautiful.The producers--Danny DeVito and company--had a smart idea. It takes a Soderbergh to put a movie like this over the top--somebody who'll pull it down into the niceties of lived life, not a Joel Schumacher slickster who'd polish it up to the level of a Grisham movie. And the big payoff is that Julia Roberts gives a performance that's equally movie-star-like and conscientious about keeping it real. She is great at what she does. It's great to see growth in an overpaid movie star. From here on out, the sky's the limit--as, I hope, it shall be for that most modest yet most ingenious and fiendishly inventive of talents, Steven Soderbergh.",,Anonymous,Biography

Roberts steals the show,"Julia Roberts' feisty performance spearheads this fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable film about Erin Brockovich, an uneducated single mother of obvious resource who cracked her way into a job in a law firm and then cracked a big corporate liability case. The picture is engaging both because of the depiction of Brockovich's persona and for the case itself, which is told engrossingly by Steven Soderbergh from Susannah Grant's script. The biographical elements of the film place themselves neatly in the biopic tradition, complete with relations that start off abrasively but end (bitter)sweetly. Roberts and Eckhart don't look that persuasive as lovers, but then again, that may have been the point. And although the Roberts/Finney relation telegraphs its warmth and compassion long in advance, it does the trick. Roberts became the first actress ever to win both an Academy Award, BAFTA, Critics' Choice Movie Award, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review, and Screen Actors Guild Award for one and the same performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Julia Roberts was incredibly good !!!,"I saw this movie on its' opening weekend and I LOVED it!! This is such a great movie. First of all: JULIA ROBERTS I always thought she is a very talented woman but in this movie she was her best. She topped all of her previous performances. And why is that? Because she FINALLY had the chance to play in a movie that has such a wonderful script that she can show how good she really is.And, oh my God, she is *GOOD* Some people might have been worried if such a big Hollywood star could actually play a single Mom who is divorced twice and has 3 kids and just 16 $ on the bank. Those people were so wrong! She succeeded in this role so much that you not once had the feeling there is a Hollywood star playing the part. The whole time, Julia WAS Erin Brockovich. If this performance won't get her at least an Oscar nomination, there must be something seriously wrong in Hollywood. The rest of the cast was just as great, especially Aaron Eckhart as the biker neighbor and Albert Finney as the boss of the law form. As this movie has a very serious topic, I was expecting a 2.5 hours drama. And yes,this movie was in part very dramatic. But also so funny, I laughed my butt off!! The time seemed so short to me and I consider seeing this movie in the theater again. Another thing I appreciated about this movie very much was that there were no endless courtscenes. This is an intelligent, funny,well-done movie. Julia Roberts was just so amazing. Because of all these facts, I give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"liked the movie, didn't like the person","I thought the movie was very good. I also admired the work and dedication of the real-life Erin Brockovich. What I didn't like was the scene where the other attorneys are asking about information that should be in the files. The female attorney says to Erin, ""That's okay, you probably just didn't know what questions to ask."" Erin proceeds to shred her by revealing that Erin has all of the correct information...in her head. Instead of writing the information in the files, which is what 999,999,999 people out of 1,000,000,000 would do, Ms Erin Brockovich MEMORIZES the information. I guess this is supposed to show how dedicated Erin is to her clients and how much smarter she is than snooty people who went to college. I guess we, the little people, were supposed to be cheering during this scene. When the lady attorney tries to apologize, ""Look, maybe we got off on the wrong foot..."", Erin cuts her off with ""That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet and f***ing ugly shoes."" At that point, I stopped liking Erin Brockovich, the person. That attorney didn't deserve that. Her boss called her out for her behavior but I never got the sense that she learned to care about anyone else's feelings.

"""Strong Independent Female Character""","Julia Roberts as Erin is annoying, loud and a disrespectful mother to everyone who is ""strong"" looking after her kids. She shouts like a B at her job saying the F bomb every second 2 seconds.

She yells at men, treats them like dirty henchmen and expects them to do what she wants. I swear she can't say one sentence without shouting and being a B.The dialogue is terrible and written by someone who has anger management issues. But Julia Roberts acting here is very well here don't get me wrong I have nothing against the actresses and actors. I have a problem with her character. This is not how you write a strong female character trying to take down corrupt compony.

Roberts & Finney superbly lead this true-life drama - 84%,"If you were to ask my Better Half what her favourite type of movie is, she'd probably say ""true-life movies"" but personally, I have a very real problem with movies of this type. Most are made for TV and decidedly crummy, for starters, but seeing as they are also as predictable as your average Nativity play, there is no attraction in watching it in the first place unless endless stories of how odds are overcome are your thing. You'd think, therefore, that ""Erin Brockovich"" is not what I would consider a good movie and you'd be right. But like that other great ""true-life"" movie, ""Alive"", this is one film which has rock-solid performances from the leads and an almost documentary feel to it. But after being paid $20 million for her appearance, I'd expect nothing less from Julia Roberts.Roberts plays our erstwhile heroine who has reached the bottom of the barrel. Struggling with her three kids and no man to help her, she even fails to win suitable compensation after being involved in a car crash. Desperate but determined, she forces herself into the employ of her lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but with her foul language and slutty clothes, she can't help but make the wrong impression. But after stumbling across what appears to be an administrative mistake, Erin's curiosity gets the better of her and she soon uncovers a huge hushed-up industrial accident by Pacific Gas & Electric which polluted the water supply of a nearby town to such a degree that it causes a variety of life-threatening conditions in the townsfolk. Enraged, Erin and Ed decide to take on the corporate giants with the help of the townspeople but sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always the easiest thing.There can be few who'd argue that Roberts didn't deserve her Oscar - watching the extras on the DVD, you can see what a great job she did of portraying Ms Brockovich. But the actor who impressed me the most is Finney, giving the sort of performance that has me scratching my head wondering why Hollywood isn't using him more often. He is faultless and together with Roberts, they dominate the picture with the ease of two professionals at the top of their game. By contrast, Aaron Eckhart (who's no amateur either) looks flat and almost uninterested in proceedings as Erin's biker boyfriend George. And however well publicised the story has been, you still can't quite believe that it all actually happened. It did feel slightly sugar-coated at the end as I felt it didn't reflect the true outcome of the case (a quick look at the trivia section of IMDb or Wikipedia will explain all) and I also would have liked some feedback from PG&E themselves but the story won't allow it, instead permitting the sort of one-way information traffic normally the preserve of Michael Moore.But all things considered, this is still a fine example of a true-life movie that doesn't suck. It can be easy to dismiss stuff like this as lazy movie-making that only geared towards making Oprah talk about it but that's doing ""Erin Brockovich"" an injustice. Brilliantly performed with enough good lines to keep most viewers interested, it's another reminder that even the loneliest individual can make the biggest impact on the lives of so many. Roberts may take the plaudits but Finney is every inch as good and if you're looking for a film with two fantastic leads then either this or ""Training Day"" are pretty much as good as you're going to get.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Julia Roberts at her best.,"Erin Brockovich: Trying to raise three kids after two failed marriages with no job skills under a mountain of debt, while recovering from a car accident, would be enough to kill the spirit of most people. Not Erin Brockovich.  Gutsy, determined, and gifted with amazing people skills she manages to bully her way into a job at a law firm.   One day while doing some routine filing Erin comes across some information that seems out of place.  Her search to uncover its meaning leads her on a quest with monumental consequences.Based on a true story, it would have been easy to make a poor-woman-fights-against-system-and-everything-turns-out-wonderful-movie. Thankfully they didn't. Well paced and written, a great deal of time is devoted to character development. I was especially impressed that they did not try to make the main character warm and fuzzy.Not since Mystic Pizza has Julia Roberts been given the chance to show that she can act - typecast as the vanilla cute, spunky heroine she has been coasting through her roles for years.  As Brockovich, Roberts is self-assured, dresses like a Frederick's of Hollywood model, throws around four letter words like a sailor, and has a temper worse than a pit bull. Most importantly, she is believable -Roberts slips so perfectly into the character that you almost forget it is her (maybe now she'll get the respect and the roles, that she deserves) some more serious offers.  Albert Finney, who plays her grizzled, cranky boss, is the perfect foil and together they are unstoppable.A careful blend of humor and drama Brockovich is worth full price.",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts is Fantastic,"Entertaining, compelling, and fantastically acted, Erin Brockovich provides a rich sense of truth and justice- while also making it highly enjoyable. Julia Roberts stars as the titular character, and provides one hell of a performance. Not only is it groundbreaking, emotional, and rich with character and emotion, but it also feels genuine and real and Roberts, within every scene, never makes her role seem too small and/or too big. Albert Finney also provides a rather good performance, as well as some decent performances from the rest of the cast. Soderbergh's directing style may feel like a bit much at times, but for the most part, his harsh view on the truth surprisingly works in the film, and provides great clarity for both the viewer and the characters involved on screen. The film is written wonderfully, and it may not be the prettiest film to look at, but it does a good job at telling its stories without relying too harshly on camera work. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, but mostly, it's an entertaining journey of perseverance that demands to be seen. In the end, Erin Brockovich is a very good film that seeks the truth without shoving it too much down our throats. It's message is clear, and not weary, like many other films of its kind- not to mention it's well written and provides a fabulous performance from Roberts, that is much deserving of her Oscar win.

Good Roberts performance in important film,"Julia Roberts delivers a terrific performance in Erin Brockovich, a film based on the true story of the title character, a down-on-her-luck single mom who, as a legal researcher, found documents which led to the largest legal settlement in history.Brockovich, with her plunging necklines, her determined quest to become something more of herself, and her cursing at everyone, is quite a character, and Roberts is probably the only actress that could take this salty woman and make her so likable.

This film is a perfect example, and there is one very good reason to feel that way: it's based on a true story. I know that some parts have been hollywood-ized (they're fairly obvious, I think), but the main thing is that this in-your-face and highly irritating woman actually came trough in a big way - she helped people in a way that most of us really can't, or won't, and she couldn't have done it if it weren't for that attitude.This film is funny, irritating, tragic and almost toxically ironic (yeah, I know, that joke was kinda lame in this context).

The fact I've got it on DVD shows it was released when i was building my DVD collection. Having said that it's not a bad film and is certainly Julia Roberts finest moment to date. When we first meet Erin she's struggling to make ends meet and hoping to make some money from a compensation claim. Once that goes astray she gets a job from her solicitor Ed Masry (Albert Finney) because he screwed up. People like Erin because she is normal and she becomes embroiled in a case against a multinational company.,5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fine entertaining drama with humor, romance and poignancy","Julia Roberts lights up the screen in this basically serious drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. Roberts is a single mother,""Erin Brockovich"", struggling to raise three children of two failed marriages. She finally gets a job working for attorney Ed Masry, winningly portrayed by Albert Finney, and gets involved in a case involving a Love Canal-type suit with many plaintiffs and a Goliath-like defendant (Pacific Gas & Electric). The utility company is allegedly guilty of polluting the water in the plaintiffs' town causing a variety of diseases and tragedy and, of course, trying to cover it up.Soderbergh has directed this piece with a fine combination of humor, romance and poignancy. The film is peppered with salty dialogue, an able supporting cast (Aaron Eckhart, Conchita Farrell, & Marge Helgenberger) and a satisfying ending. The filmmakers have succeeded in creating a movie that is both entertaining, enlightening and even has a social message.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Great Movie, Very inspirational","I have always been a Julia Roberts Fan, but this movie in particular inspired me to no end. Erin Brockovich is one of the toughest, most determined women I have know. My daughter and I were going through some rough times when a couple of years ago. Every time we thought we were at our lowest, we would pop in this DVD. She always got our feet back on the ground, and we realized life wasn't so bad. Because of this movie I have gone back to school and am studying to become a paralegal. If she can do this, with all the obstacles she had going against her, then I told my self I can as well. Thank you Erin for allowing this story. I am sure I will never obtain what you have, but it will be a profession that I can be proud of.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Julia Robert's over-the-top portrayal of the real Erin Brockovich, which could land the actress her 3rd Oscar nomination","The pretty woman's portrayal in this true story about a woman who discovers that an industrial plant is secretly polluting the residences' groundwater in Hinkley is nothing short of spectacular. Boasting with sex appeal, a million dollar smile, and an enhancing bra, Roberts delivers a performance that shows off her ubiquitous talent, which could earn the runaway bride her third Oscar nomination. ""Brockovich,"" helmed by acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh (""Out of Sight""), benefits as well from being based on a true story that doesn't wander off into an oblivious fog, a very difficult and controversial subject to handle (see ""The Hurricane"" and ""The Insider""). Although Roberts' role may be the film's selling point, the fact that she is portraying a real woman with a profound livelihood deserves a little more attention than her wide grin. Erin is a torn woman, one who has been stretched to the brink of exhaustion as evidenced by her struggling attempt to keep food on the table for her three kids while fumbling through job ads. We can relate to people like Erin, and it's because of her willingness and ability to project a rather intimidating image that she is able to get what she wants and not take 'no' for an answer. She's a true inspirational hero, a woman who crosses the boundaries for a people suffering from the suit-driven executives of a billion-dollar corporation. Julia Roberts, tell Benjamin Bratt you may have to cancel dinner; you just might have a date with a stud named Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Did I miss something?,"I gotta be honest although I think this film was a nice film, it wasn't spectacular, it wasn't all that great, but it was nice. I say that because I saw it on Cable-TV and not in the movie houses. I would not have PAID to see it in the movie house frankly, it was on the level of many nice films I saw on the Lifetime Cable Networks Made for TV movies. That about sums it up for me.I liked the idea of a low income working single female almost living in a trailer park sticking it to the big corporation, but I've seen it before, over and over, on movies of the week...**yawn**. Julia Roberts' performance was...fine. Nothing to write home to mom about, and even more, why in the things of all that is Holy did she win an Oscar for this? Was the Academy saying this is the best she can do? I doubt that. Anyone could have done this film, Big whoop. A nice film, but nothing more than that.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Satisfying Cinematic Story,"Erin Brockovich is a terrific film depicting the true life story of a single mother turned law clerk's battle to gain respect and a better life for her children while toppling a power company's clandestine efforts to cover up the poisoning of a small California town.Julia Roberts portrays Erin Brockovich with incredible, realistic conviction, and this role proves to be her finest one yet.  Roberts is a master now, capable of pulling off diverse roles, and making characters her own in the mold of Meryl Streep.  She deserves an Oscar nod for this, and it can only lead to bigger and better parts.  Albert Finney is in top form as Brockovich's boss, attorney Ed Masry, who attempts to groom the rough, tightly wound (and clothed) Erin, as well as gamble everything he has built to bring about restitution for his long suffering clients.Erin Brockovich is a fully satisfying movie-going experience, and do not be put off by critics who call it formulaic or ""made for t.v.""  Why?  Because all films are formulaic and more people watch television than go to church! See it because it is a great movie and you will have a good time.Highly recommended!",,Anonymous,Biography

Julia Roberts lights up the screen like none other in this, portraying such a ""in your face"" character with explosive dialogues and yet giving her such empathy to give justice to the people affected.

Roberts at her best,"The minute Julia stepped out disappointed from her first jobinterview I knew she was going to be sublime. I should have known. Soderbergh is an complete director not only involved with the technical details of filming, the best shots etc... but he gets the best out of his actors. There's no doubt about Julia Roberts her talent, she has grown so much but with big stars I think it is important to get a performance that makes you sometimes forget that your looking at a star. Personally I believe in underacting. Soderbergh does the same for Michael Douglas in Traffic I think. This could have been a very mediocre film, the subject alone screams movie of the week but it isn't. Soderbergh combines the best Hollywood techniques with  his own vision and insight and incredible talent. He knows what he's doing. Normally after making a critically acclaimed movie, young directors fall for Big Hollywoodprojects and find they can't handle it, probably the pressure of studio's , producers (hey I read Premiere), but Soderbergh stayed underground letting his talent grow while making films like 'kafka' and the sublime 'King of the hill', only recently he emerged into the spotlight with Out of Sight, a film as smoothly filmed as Jennifer Lopez's skin. His talent and films is why I go the movies.",,Anonymous,Biography
Erin Rock-ovich!,"It was my father who recommended me to see this film when it premiered on the television. I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn't disappointed at all!Julia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a 'maid/lover' of Erin .What I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character's traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that's why probably it wasn't possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.The story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The ""It's called b00bs"" line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn't make it completely unenlightening.Overall, I'm going to give this an eight. Don't forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It was a very good film, even with Julia Roberts",While I'm not a fan of Julia Roberts I'll have to say she does a good job in this movie.The last movie I liked her in was Conspiracy Theory.

Julia truly shines as ERIN BROCKOVICH!,"I first saw this film with my ex-boyfriend when it came out. He didn't like it very much, but I thought it was absolutely wonderful! In my opinion, Erin (Julia Roberts) acted a little obscene, offensive, and vulgar at times, but I thought she was a very sweet and caring woman at heart. The only things I couldn't understand about Erin were why she dressed so revealingly and used so much foul language. George (Aaron Eckhart) was a funny guy at times, too. I especially liked Ed (Albert Finney). The reason I liked him was because of his business attitude. The one person I couldn't stand was Theresa Dallavale (Veanne Cox). This was because I thought she was such a snob! Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Julia Roberts totally deserved her Oscar for her performance in this.

The most important film and role for Julia Roberts,"I saw this movie at the urging of my sister, who was so impressed that she saw it twice. I was a little skeptical but I'm glad I saw it. Ms. Roberts literally puts her heart and soul in this film (I'm sure she was exhausted when the film wrapped) and I'm sure she will win the Golden Globe and garner an Oscar nod. Albert Finney and Aaron Eckart and the rest of the cast shine. The script and direction is sharp, dramatic with hints of dark humor, and the only complaint I really have is that the film ran a bit too long. One of the best movies of 2000!",,Anonymous,Biography
Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance,"Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that utility giant PG&E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in `The Limey'.  His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says ""DIRTY"") who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.Albert Finney also gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific chemistry.Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his rebellious culture. However, I put more of the responsibility for this on the director than the actor.This is an excellent story that is well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity, I recommend it highly",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Um......Embarassingly Awful,"This movie annoys more that I thought it was possible for a film to annoy. The director takes a rather interesting story, twists it all out of reality, and throws together a mind numbing insulting script that's barely beyond a high school level education. The main cast members are just so cutsie/smarmy getting off their one liners in utterly absurd scenes that stretch credibility to the bursting point. I understand that American made movies kind of need to dumb things down for their audiences, and the makers of this atrocity certainly took that idea and ran with it. Contrived nonsense is oozing from every part of this movie. You will get so disgusted with her stares and her lousy personality. She's not a nice person and just used people to her own ends. A rather despicable sort, really. And she carries herself like she's so superior. What a load of manure! Even her kids are annoying little snots. If you're going to name a movie after a person, try not to make that person an incredibly aggravating sack of swearing promiscuity. Julia was exceptional and so REAL in Pretty Woman because she was sincere and likeable. Here she's just a vacuous piece of fluff with apparently good intentions but it doesn't hold up. Her character gets to be so annoying it really grates. She ends up so full of herself, thinking she's the best and one and only person that can save the world and treats everyone around her like dog scat. Not even close. Sure, it looks pretty and the synopsis and trailer are geared to pull at heart and wallet, but the end product is pure misery to endure. Albrert is all right in his role but over the top to a high degree. Anyway, nothing worked for me. The whole heart of gold biker neighbor thing was nauseating to the extreme. I try this film out every once in a while and the last time it was a real struggle to make it to the end. It's aging like moldy cheese. A few touching moments do not a successful movie make. Sure, watch it. You should just to see how a performance of this low, pandering level can earn such accolades. It's an education if nothing else. The only performance of any merit in this movie is by Tracey Walter in a minimal but pivotal role. Doesn't make up for the film failing on every other conceibable level though. A movie made by simple minded industry hacks to cater to a public willing to lap up the most inane drivel available. Throroughly unbelievable story, which is insane considering it's based on actual events. Looserly based. As loosely as it could possibly be based. Expect nothing special. It deteriorates rapidly into the typical Hollywood drivel, with characters saying and doing things that defy all reason. It elevated film making to new heights of stupidity, and is a testament to the sheer brainlessness of American cinema.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow,"After watching Julia Roberts in ""Notting Hill"" and ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", where the secondary characters were the only thing actually worth anything, I was not expecting much from yet another film starring this overpaid actress. Boy, I was wrong.  She deserves every penny of her salary.  With this movie, Roberts strikes gold and, unless several magic movies shows up along the year, she'll probably land her first Oscar nomination.  The same goes for Albert Finney (not his first, but another one). But, just as with ""Shakespeare in Love"", a chick flick that guys could enjoy, the script is the real star of this movie.  A perfectly crafted hollywood product, but with enough surprises, heart and great dialogue to reach out to today's hypercritical audiences. In the hands of the director Steven Soderbergh, who is showing more and more talent with each film he makes (Out of Sight, The Limey, etc), the film never looses its entertainment value. Does it mean that it's a perfect movie?  No.  Things that did not quite work all the time are Erin Brockovich's personal life and romantic relationship (some scenes are extremely touching, others don't ring true), and some of the lawyers that are comic stereotypes. But it is the focus that this movie places on personal conflicts and people themselves that rises this product way and above a similar themed movie like ""A Civil Action"". Erin Brockovich has all the strength of a Norma Rae of the 21st century.",,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Movie - Based on a true story,"I remember watching this movie back in 2000 being ten years old and understandably I didn't appreciate it for its technical brilliance at the time but still simply loving every moment of every scene. I watch this movie now and fall deeply in love with every line that comes out characters mouths.Julia Roberts has her ups in and downs but her acting in this movie has given new meaning to the term respect. Roberts portrays a single mother who through desperation works her hardest to put food on the table for her children and not for one second did I doubt her acting. This coming from a guy who looks at most top end actors and see's the actor not the character.Albert Finney, this wonderful man once again proves why it is he has constantly been praised with his Oscar nominations. This man puts the Act in actor. Finney plays the small time private lawyer who is responsible for giving Roberts character the job. Given that Finneys character was neither in dept nor well written (but not in a bad way) Al makes the character shine and brings the viewers into the story with his constant facial expressions and his expansive hilarity, all in all Finney plays his part perfectly as the supporting character.Aaron Eckhart plays the ""house husband"" nanny who looks after the kids for most of the movie. He doesn't have a major role but plays his part well and was nicely suited for the task. He also brings a nice side story to the major plot.All in all this is a very well written adaptation of the life of Erin Brockovich. The characters are lovable and progress nicely throughout the film. This movie will keep you entertained and have you laughing your ass off one minute and have your lunging for your hanky the next.Do not miss the Beauty that is, Erin Brockovich.I don't even know what I was running for - I guess I just felt like it. ~J.D.

John Grisham with an attitude,"In general, legal films are either grand courtroom dramas or films about how the system has failed someone, or how it has been construed to bypass justice (which, I guess, is the same thing). ""Erin Brockovich"" is neither. Instead, it's about a woman who uses her personality to accomplish what many people with legal degrees cannot, and in the process, dealing a record-breaking blow to a company who cut corners and left many people very sick.Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is in a deep rut. A former beauty queen, she is nearly penniless after two failed marriages that left her with three kids, and she's unemployed. After she demands a job from an attorney named Ed Masry (Albert Finney), she uncovers a huge corporate crime almost by accident, and it turns out to be a lot bigger than she or Ed ever expected.Julia Roberts is the perfect choice to play the title character. Roberts has made a career out of playing sunny and extroverted characters, and that quality suits her well. Erin doesn't know anything about the legal system, but she has amazing people skills, and ultimately that's what really makes the case work. The people of Hinckley don't trust the lawyers, but they trust Erin. For lack of a better analogy, she's the Moses guiding the people to the promised land.However, Roberts has more range than she is often allowed to show. Working on the case takes a heavy toll on Erin's family life, and we see her pain from being away from her family. Some of these scenes are heartbreaking.The supporting cast members are great as well. Albert Finney is great as Ed Masry. He's got the brains, and knows he's in over his head, but he knows that attempting to fight with Erin about taking the case is utterly pointless. They may not like each other at times, but the two make a good team. Aaron Eckhart is also good as George, Erin's boyfriend. He's the voice of reason for Erin. However, while he loves Erin, he's not going to be a doormat. There's one performance that has been overlooked, but is nonetheless effective: Scotty Leavenworth is great as Matthew, Erin's son. It is through him that we see the effect that the case has on her family, and Leavenworth perfectly illustrates that. There's no sense of artifice in his performance.""Erin Brockovich"" is filled with bit performances, and all are excellent. Hinckley's inhabitants are extremely sympathetic, and we only want the best for them. PG&E, the evil corporation, is represented by some of the nastiest people ever. They wouldn't bat an eye to the plight of Hinckly's population if they hadn't sued. They thing that the plaintiffs are worthless, and that because they are poor, they don't matter. The viewer's hatred for the greedy corporation is instantaneous. However, the film is all Roberts.2000 was a great year for Steven Sodebergh. He came out with two hit movies (""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"") that took the Oscars by storm. Both earned Best Picture and Best Director nominations (he won for the latter film). His skill as a director is clearly evident (he hasn't done work this good before or since). The cinematography is desert-like: bright and grainy. Hinckley is not a happy place, but the people are nice.Although ""Erin Brockovich"" deals with some heavy material and contains some powerful moments, that should lead one to think that this is a depressing movie. On the contrary, there are many amusing moments, and two scenes that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Sodebergh finds the right balance between drama and comedy (although calling the film a comedy is not necessarily truthful).There are a few flaws, but overall, ""Erin Brockovich"" is a wonderful film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just a note . . .,"I certainly understand the appeal of this film, but I find elements of it, well, puzzling.It might be unfair to comment on a now-common Hollywood convention, but does it really make sense to have a novice (e.g. a woman like the character Erin Brokovich) come into a job and be rewarded not only for telling her employer how to do his job properly but also to show repeated disrespect to her co-workers?Early in the film, Brokovich disappears from her boring job for a couple of weeks to do investigative work, which she finds more diverting, and which means that the ""unimportant"" people in the office have to take up the slack. She is then shocked when she finds out she has been fired and yells incessantly until she gets her job back.Her boss, played by Albert Finney, has been an attorney for years and has made a living fighting uphill battles on contingency, but he seems unable to deal with people or build a case or even conduct a meeting without the help of ignorant-yet-spunky Erin Brokovich.Yes, it's a Hollywood film and certain shortcuts have to be made, but . . .",,Anonymous,Biography

The truth will set you free!,"The 4 of us loved this movie and give it ""8 thumbs up!!""  We were still talking about it the following day.  It's a very uplifting movie, despite the tragedies (there are triumphs as well!) in the film.  There was a lot of humorous moments and the whole theater was laughing throughout the film.I personally like Julia Roberts and I would probably go see her in anything. This movie is probably going to be one of my favorites.  My husband and I are very justice issues-oriented people.  We like to see the little man win. I grew up in the Sacramento Valley where PG&E serviced us as our electric company, and I was horrified to learn that they would do such a thing to a small community.  We could have been one of the families hurt by this company's negligence!  I had taped the Oprah Winfrey segment that featured Julia Roberts, the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry.  My husband and I watched it when we got home from the movie.  Erin and Ed Masry both said the movie was pretty true to the real story.I like how quirky life is, and how destiny works -- Erin, a single mom with 3 small children to raise, finds herself victim of a car accident that changes her life completely.  She goes to Ed Masry to represent her in a lawsuit, they lose the case and she is without anything -- no job, no money, wrecked car and desperate.  Indignant that Ed told her she would win no problem, she goes back and demands a job from him.  As you will find in the movie, Erin Brockovich is a hard woman to say ""no"" to.  I don't think anyone would have a chance if they tried.  Julia Roberts portrayed her character extremely well -- with heart, intense passion and conviction.It's a wonderful story about someone who doesn't let fear get in the way of ""doing the right thing."" As far as the clothing -- you have to remember that Erin Brockovich was Miss Wichita (? I think she said) and her whole sense of who she was prior to going to work for Ed Masry revolved around her appearance.  Those clothes were very much the 80s, and she was comfortable enough with her body and sexuality to wear them.  The real Erin is a beautiful woman.  According to the real Erin, her skirts were even shorter than the ones Julia Roberts wore in the movie!Go see it.  It might make you think twice about doing nothing next time you see someone being victimized.  Besides, like one of the other comments about this movie said -- you want to just see what is going to come out of her mouth next!  This movie made me want to meet the real Erin.  I love people who have no fear, and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe is right.  This is a gutsy movie about a gutsy woman!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Roberts and Finney shine in inspiring true story,"Erin Brockovich, directed by Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies and videotape) is an inspiring true story. Julia Roberts stars as Erin Brockovich, a twice divorced mother of 3. She takes a job at a law office and is intrigued by a certain case. Her further investigation finds evidence of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company letting hexavalent chromium, a poisonous substance, into the local water supply in Hinkley, CA. Many residents of the town are getting sick and Julia convinces her boss (Albert Finney) to take on the case. All of their time and money is devoted to helping the people. It is reminiscent of A Civil Action,  starring John Travolta, another true story about big companies poisoning the water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts.Roberts is wonderful in this role. Her chemistry with Finney, who adores her even though they drive each other crazy, is terrific. Aaron Eckhart is good as George, the biker who lives next door and takes care of Erin's kids while she's out of town working the case. Roberts, not a large-breasted woman, provides a great advertisement for the Wonderbra in her low-cut outfits. Overall, a very entertaining and inspiring film with nothing objectionable, aside from Roberts' frequent use of the F-word.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something for everyone,"Erin Brockovich was directed by Steven Soderbergh and starred Julia Roberts. Julia won the Oscar for best actress because she was so good in the movie.

"YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SHOUT ""OSCAR!"" BUT ITS WORTH A LOOK","The Nutshell: A feisty young woman, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), arrives at the law offices of Ed Masry (Albert Finney) through the forces of Fate. A twice divorced mother of three with no employable skills, she badgers, cajoles and pleads with Masry to give her a job. He reluctantly hires her as a file clerk. After finding medical records in real estate files, she becomes a de facto investigator to uncover a large utility company's cover-up concerning the contamination of a small town's water supply. As the stakes get higher, the uneducated and untrained Erin must use her considerable wits and genuine empathy to the affected townsfolk to stay not only ahead, but in the game.As is apparent from the description, ERIN BROCKOVICH is film treading on the ground of earlier films. NORMA RAE has given us the gutsy, blue collar woman fighting the big corporation and THE VERDICT has shown us out-of-their-league lawyers having to face very daunting legal challenges. With the Harley-Davidson riding next door neighbor who volunteers (!) to watch her three kids, there's even a shade of MASK's sweet bikers thrown in to boot. When a film has so much past cinema history to compete in the audiences memory against, it has two choices: the minefield or paint-by-numbers. A writer and director could try to approach the story and film in a new way. They can avoid all the clichés and expectations, and go for something wholly original. But like in a minefield, one misstep and the film implodes from the twin anticipations from both the general audience and the cineastes lead to expect something more.Or, they can capitulate to the idea that there are few new options in presenting real-life stories and make sure they keep the those audience pleasing moment coming at a steady rate. Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant go the later, and hence, paint-by-numbers route. This is the Soderbergh who gave us OUT OF SIGHT more than the one responsible for THE LIMEY. There is nothing wholly original here in either the film's story line or how it's presented. In fact, BROCKOVICH is such a studio star vehicle he doesn't employ the non-linear editing of those last two films that was becoming his forte.Considering his last films and that his announced future projects are a remake of the piffle OCEAN'S 11 and a film version of the BBC TV show ""Traffic"" (about a drug enforcement chief finding out his daughter is a drug mule), Soderbergh seems to be following a one for the studio/one for himself approach to filmmaking. Too bad BROCKOVICH seems to be the studio pic he is doing before starting TRAFFIC. Allowed to work with a more realistic version of Erin (for comparison, pay close attention to the waitress early-on: it's the real Erin Brockovich doing a cameo) and not having to deal with the considerations that go hand in hand with working with someone of Robert's stature it would have been interesting see how different (and very possibly better) this could have been.This is a showy part and Roberts sinks her teeth into it. Roberts here will remind those who remember it of her breakthrough part in MYSTIC PIZZA - a film that had the bad luck of being a movie aimed at women before ""chick flicks"" became trendy recently. Definitely worth a rental. She is caustic, forceful and unpretentious. The only problem is Roberts brings so much baggage with her that she never makes the character seem unique. The part suffers from us never being surprised by a larger-than-life character because, well, it's Julia Roberts. It's a wonder why New Jersey Films didn't opt to try this as a low budget film showcasing an actress not as well known. Janet McTeer, who did a similar no-collar turn in TUMBLEWEEDS that prompted several critics to call hers THE performance of 1999, actually looks like the real Erin.Beginning what will hopefully be the start of a interesting late middle-aged phase of his career, Finney consistently infuses his character with the quirks and a real human tics that are just as consistently missing from Roberts performance. Those who were unlucky enough to catch the pointless and boring SIMPATICO (was there ever a more egregious waste of a good title?) will be excused from thinking his turn as the race horse voucher in that turgid film was a warm-up for Masry. As a man who has worked hard and been careful to arrive where he is in life, he had a helluva lot more to lose than Brockovich who is acting out of necessity. Instead of sounding shrill and selfish, Finney manages a nice balancing act between grounding him enough to be solid and letting him let Erin befuddle him. Its a shame that if anyone remembers the film next winter when the next awards season starts, it will be for the wrong performance.Universal left nothing to chance marketing BROCKOVICH, unfortunately for regular movie attendees. Every great zinger and most of the ""You tell'em, girl!"" moments are squandered in the trailers. For those who plunk down their $8.50 to discover what made Erin and her story worth telling find that the awfully nice folk in the Universal marketing department  have made sure there is nothing new to discover. It's not hard to like BROCKOVICH. It moves deftly between the expanding professional life of its title character and the repercussions it is having on her home life. It makes a lot of smart choices in what to play up and what events can be skimmed over. As long as its treated as the feel good, unchallenging mainstream studio star vehicle it was fashioned to be,  liking the film will come easy. Just don't expect anything deeper. As either a safe-bet outing at the multiplex or a rental half a year from now, ERIN BROCKOVICH is worth a look. But just remember Olympia Dukakis' retort to Cher in MOONSTRUCK - ""Playing it safe is the dumbest thing a woman like you can do.""",,Anonymous,Biography

Every single second she is on screen she is electric, with so much energy, power, confidence and magnetism. It really was such a joy to watch and an absolute tour de force. Even if the story were dull it would be worth watching this film for Roberts alone.However the story is far from dull. In a way this is one of those films that doesn't need anything flashy, because the story speaks for itself. It's got such a great mix of feel good moments, drama, comedy, and emotional beats, which combine to make this a very engaging and gripping story. Everything about it fits together perfectly. The dialogue is so well thought out, the direction, the pacing, all of it top notch.Aside from Roberts, there's a great supporting cast, with a brilliant performance from Albert Finney and a solid on screen partnership between Roberts and Aaron Eckhart.I can't really sing this film's praises enough.

An entertaining film about a remarkable woman,"""This film is based on a true story"". So goes the prologue to the film version of the life of Erin Brokovich.  The word ""based"" gives the writer a great degree of latitude and it is probably the imaginative embellishments that add so much to the entertainment value of these remarkable events.The theme of the little guys up against the billion dollar companies is not new, but following the story gives one a feeling of tremendous satisfaction when honesty and perseverance wins through.  Such is the case with Erin Brokovich.  What a woman!  As portrayed in this film Erin Brokovich ( Julia Roberts) has a great figure amply displayed to the other employees and clients and commonly referred to as her secret weapon.  Julia Roberts gives a whirlwind performance as a single mother punctuating every outburst with repeated expletives.I do doubt the probability of a mother with three very young children allowing a biker with a Harley Davidson to watch over her children during her working day.  And what private  or government authority would allow a stranger to spend hours looking through confidential documents  held in their filing system.  But it makes a great story and the odd characters that pop up in various parts of the film give little gem performances.Serious aspects of the film involve a court case about compensation for the horrible deaths of people exposed to contaminated water in their daily lives.  We get a chemistry lesson too about the various forms of chromium and their relative biological toxicities.But when the film is over and the credits roll it's Julia Roberts as the central character we remember. A truly great performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Soderberg's American Pastoral,"Steven Soderberg's extremely satisfying film about an unlikely crusader pitted against a mammoth corporation that has lied to its neighbors about their well-being may seem like a Julia Roberts showcase but Soderberg manages to use Roberts as one of many colors in his pastoral of an America where justice can be served. Not that Roberts is ignored or wasted: unlike 1999's manipulative ""Notting Hill"" she is forced to shed her star quotient in order to let her beauty serve the film's main character. As a put-upon former beauty queen desperate to find meaning in her life while trying to impart social values on her children, Roberts' feisty, no-nonsense determination becomes such an admirable quality that it actually makes her more beautiful than she's ever seemed; the film's last shot frames her in such a devastating way that you can't help but be swept away by such a complete characterization. Susannah Grant's sarcastic but perceptive screenplay gives Roberts the lines needed to make her be absolutely inspiring. Ace cinematographer Ed Lachman beautifully evokes an arid California that comes alive with color as events begin to happen. Soderberg's companion piece ""The Limey"" may be more succinct and filled with more depth but this masterpiece is just as thrilling and even more moving.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Erin Brockovich is an exceptional character-driven film with a compelling story,"I recently rewatched Erin Brockovich (2000) on Netflix. The storyline revolves around a single mother of three struggling to find a job and support her family. When she meets a biker who offers to help with her kids and a lawyer who gives her a chance as an office clerk, she seizes both opportunities to transform her personal and professional life. However, her involvement in a significant court case brings challenges and puts people's lives at stake.Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Traffic), the film stars Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman), Albert Finney (Big Fish), Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight), and Conchata Ferrell (Edward Scissorhands).Erin Brockovich is a remarkable character-driven piece that skillfully portrays different lifestyles, perceptions, and the struggle of individuals against corporations. The characters are endearing and easy to root for, with Julia Roberts delivering a captivating performance, arguably one of her best. The writing is outstanding, effectively conveying the complexities of the characters and their circumstances. The dialogue is raw and authentic, enhancing the film's realism. The plot unfolds seamlessly, evoking a range of emotions from sadness to compelling realism. It's a nice touch that the real Erin Brockovich makes a cameo appearance as well.In conclusion, Erin Brockovich is an exceptional character-driven film with a compelling story. I would give it a perfect score of 10/10 and highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Decent flick but not Oscar-worthy Roberts,"I won't bash this film entirely because it does have some redeeming qualities. I truly enjoyed watching Albert Finney again. His befuddled reaction to the bulldozer known as Erin is priceless. I really enjoyed watching him at work. His subtle performance is the main reason to watch this flick. I'm now ready to go see his work in ""Traffic.""As for Julia Roberts, it was a one-note performance of indignance and ""the world owes me"" rhetoric. I got rather tired of her ""hands on her hips"" tirades after a while. We all make our own decisions and Brokovich made hers. If I had been her biker boyfriend, I would have said ""see ya"" a long time ago. Getting respect from your peers is wonderful but if your kids don't respect you, who cares?I don't deny the fact Roberts is a good actress. But she's done much better in other roles, even ""Pretty Woman."" I felt the same way about Helen Hunt's oscar in ""As Good As It Gets"". Decent acting but worthy of accolades? Hardly.This film also drags in many spots. It would have made a great HBO movie but that's about it.",,Anonymous,Biography

"While the beginning is a little unsteady, this is mostly an unforgettably captivating drama","This was a very successful film based on a true story, and the lead actress, Julia Roberts, even won an Oscar for her performance here. I remember being shown over half of this biopic in my high school career studies class, since it was relevant to the subject, but do not recall seeing it all the way to the end. That was seven years ago, and three years after this ""Erin Brockovich"" film was released, so it has been out for ten years in total and I finally sat down to watch it from start to finish this month. Even though it took years for this to happen, and I don't think I was expecting to be able to give it a rating higher than 7/10, this 2000 drama certainly didn't fail to grab me. I guess my expectations were slightly surpassed, since I'm giving it an 8.Erin Brockovich is a single mother who has been married and divorced twice and is now desperately searching for employment, but is having no luck, lacking the experience required for the jobs she applies for. After a failed lawsuit against a doctor who crashed into her car on the road and left her injured, she convinces her lawyer, Ed Masry, to give her a job at his law firm to make up for the loss of the case. She gets to work for Masry as a clerk in his office, but her revealing attire and aggressive demeanor lead to conflict in the workplace. After getting this job, it isn't long before she begins to investigate a real estate case involving the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in Hinkley, California. She soon discovers that the company is responsible for the contamination of the water in this town! The hexavalent chromium that they dump is going into the town's water system, leading to serious health problems for the townspeople, and PG&E has been lying about it! This leads Brockovich and her law firm into a challenging fight against a multi-billion dollar corporation to try and bring them to justice!I'm can't remember exactly what my thoughts were as I watched this film seven years ago, but when I started watching it this month, it didn't look so great at the beginning with the job interview, but it quickly improves, perhaps starting with the part where the lawsuit fails. For the rest of the film, it's very intriguing for the most part as we watch the protagonist attempting to put an end to PG&E's crime against the people of Hinkley, and the problems she faces with her kids, her boyfriend George, her boss, and others. The film can be somewhat moving at times with scenes involving seriously ill Hinkley residents. Julia Roberts does a decent job playing the protagonist, even if her performance is not amazing, and I don't know exactly what the real Erin Brockovich is like, but the movie version of her is a short-tempered and often rude individual who also proves that she is caring and clever. Albert Finney also stands out as Ed Masry. He's an English actor and does a great American accent here. Not everything about this film is perfect, there is some fairly weak dialogue and maybe some unconvincing parts, but apart from that, I can't complain much when it comes to the film's quality.Since this is a movie based on a true story (there's even a cameo appearance from the real Erin Brockovich-Ellis as a waitress named Julia), it doesn't surprise me that there has been controversy over how accurate it is, and some people have trashed the film for its inaccuracies, some of which I have read about. I really don't have much to say about this, but at the beginning, it does say it's BASED ON a true story, it doesn't say it IS a true story. Even if this biopic is very inaccurate, it's still a very effective and memorable film. With all the language, it's not family-friendly, and all the swearing, a lot of it coming from Julia Roberts in the lead role, is apparently the reason for the film's R rating. There are also adults who can't stand constant profanity in movies, and if you're one of them, ""Erin Brockovich"" is not for you, either. However, if you're old enough to watch this film AND you can take the language, you could find it to be a very satisfying drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not bad for a Julia Roberts movie,"As you can tell, I am not the world's biggest Julia Roberts fan. I don't hate her guts, or anything, but I generally don't see movies she's in unless they got very good reviews.When I first saw trailers for this movie, I was like, oh please. Not only was it a Julia Roberts Vehicle, but there was the extra insult of having it be a big novelty that she played a sorta white-trashy, tough-talking, skanky dressing character. Oh, what a departure! Then I read lots of great reviews from reviewers I trusted, and thought again.I don't think she gives an Oscar-worthy performance, but she did just fine in the role. Erin Brokovich is a single mother who may not have the best social skills, or fashion sense, but her heart is in the right place and she refuses to tolerate injustice when she sees it. Plus, I know how it feels to be in such a b*tchy mood that you can't help wanting to use the f-word in every sentence. She has mouths to feed at home, so she gets a job at a small law firm, and stumbles upon a situation where a large corporation has made a huge mistake, and is being weaselly trying to get out of it.The fact that this movie is based on a true story and the main character based on a real life person really helps. Part of what turned me off in the first place was the fact that I thought the filmmakers made Julia Robert's character dress really trampy just to get attention. Now, I do think they over-do it in parts-no intelligent woman walks around in public with 90% of their bra exposed. Dressing sexy is one thing, but in real life, women know better than to wear a top that is so hideously mismatched with a bra that you like like you were dressed by a blind person.Also, the main character is not perfect- though her cursing is entertaining, she goes too far in some cases. We all have felt like using 4 -letter words to some of the people we word with to their face, but adults don't do this on a regular basis-or if they do, they are looking for a new job very quickly. Aaron Eckhardt is great in the role of the supportive, yet put-upon biker boyfirend. So nice to see him play a character that is likeable!A great movie, very entertaining, and actually makes you think that sometimes in life, hard work is rewarded and people get what they deserve-very satisfying.",,Anonymous,Biography
What a fascinating legal drama,"Erin Brockovich (2000) is a biographical legal drama directed by Steven Soderbergh and this was one of the most interesting and fascinating biopics I've seen in a while.Positives for Erin Brockovich (2000):
Now I'm not all that into legal drama, but the main thing that makes this one stand out from the other one is that this story is being told as an underdog story and I tend to enjoy these type of stories. The movie spends a lot of time showing Erin as someone struggling with her home life and this court case to help the audience connect to her more on a human level. It helps that Julia Roberts does a fantastic job as Erin Brockovich in a performance that won her the award for Best Actress which was well deserved. I also really enjoyed Albert Finney as Edward L. Masry and Aaron Eckhart as George, who looks hilarious with a mustache. The movie is a slow burn that takes its time to develop the characters while also keeping the audience invested with enough stuff in the movie. And finally, the movie does a great job at being serious and funny while making sure that neither tone overshadows the other.Negatives for Erin Brockovich (2000):
This is one of those movies I can see myself watching one time only.Overall, Erin Brockovich (2000) is a great legal drama that gets the job and it does it in spectacular fashion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Feel good movie with a powerful message,"This is a wonderful movie and a great performance by Julia Roberts. Clearly the true story of Erin Brokovich has been given a good dose of the Hollywood treatment here, but I don't know why other people have felt the need to complain about this  it's a mainstream movie with a story and a message that has universal appeal, so why wouldn't you want to sprinkle some of that Hollywood stardust and get as many people into the theaters as possible?All in all, I think the movie might be clichéd in parts but it is funny and heartwarming and it has a great message. It's always inspiring to see that one person really can make a difference, against all of the odds. Even though we know how it's going to end, we still root for Erin and for Albert Finney  who was also brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Jiggling Justice,"Erin Brockovich is a modern day David and Goliath movie, starring Julia Roberts, her cleavage, and 101 streetwalker outfits.  After Erin's bumbling small time lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), loses her personal injury lawsuit, she is back to her cockroaches, macaroni and cheese, and the unemployment lines.  Erin manipulates the lawyer into a job at his law practice.  The foulmouthed mother of three proves that a major corporation, Pacific Gas and Electric, is poisoning the small town of Hinkley's water supply.  After a lot of hard work, no family life, and insulting everyone in her path, she wins the victims 330 million dollars and herself a hefty two million dollar bonus. It was very similar to A Civil Action, also based on a true story, starring John Travolta.  Travolta portrayed a tort lawyer representing eight families whose children died from leukemia after two large corporations dumped chemicals into the water supply in Woburn, Massachusetts. Erin Brockovich is a movie that does not rely on special effects, violence, or car chases to hold our interest.  The movie is not as much about the courtroom battle with PG&E as it is with the battles that Erin was facing in everyday life, a single uneducated working class mother raising three kids on her own in a very uncooperative world.  It is a movie that inspires Americans to believe in the system again.  Erin Brockovich teaches us, that we can all make a difference in this world.  All we have to do is try.",,Anonymous,Biography
Moving and funny,How close to reality this film actually is I do not know but taken by its own merits this is a very good film. A moving story superbly acted and well made.

"An exaggerated, but fun, legal biopic about Erin Brockovich","It's an exaggerated legal biopic about environmentalist Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) set in the 1990s in Los Angeles and Hinckley, California. Erin is an unemployed twice-divorced single mom with three kids (Scotty Leavenworth, Gemmenne de la Peña, Emily/Julie Marks//Ashley/Brittany Pimental) on the edge of poverty. A former beauty queen, Erin has a volatile personality and mouth. After an auto accident, she seeks legal help from lawyer Ed Masry (Albert Finney) but loses. She eventually talks her way into a job at Masry's law office.Erin becomes curious about a routine real estate file in Hinkley that includes many medical records related to Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) and her family. This leads to the discovery that the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) had allowed toxic chromium to seep into surrounding groundwater, resulting in medical damage to many local residents.The story follows Erin's home life with boyfriend George (Aaron Eckhart), her work at the office interacting with Ed, and her research of the case in Hickley while working to gather clients for a legal suit against PG&E.""Erin Brockovich"" is in the same category as 1979's ""Norma Rae"" with Sally Field or one of John Grisham's novels-made-into-movies. It tells the story through an exaggerated focus on one character in the event. Julia Roberts won an Academy Award for her work, which was excellent. The direction over-focused on Erin's overt sexuality. Roberts and Finney had great chemistry, but I suspect the script short-shrifted Ed Masry's character. Nonetheless, ""Erin Brockovich"" moves right along and tells a delightful underdog legal story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A great film from Soderbergh, long but it pays off","Soderbergh's Oscar acclaimed story which is based on facts about a woman (Roberts) who lands a job at a law firm and helps work and eventually win a case that is the biggest that any firm of that kind has seen in history. The direction is perfect, great story telling with the camera, both the visuals and sequence of events is perfect. I had some problems with the acting, especially Aaron Eckhart whom i didn't like much playing the boyfriend. However i was very pleased with Albert Finney's performance, my favorite of the flick, he stole his scenes. Only other performan ce I had other than Eckhart's performance was the poor score by Thomas Newman, whose scores I usually love (Three Kings, American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Mad City, etc...) Also Julia Roberts is at her very best here. The screenplay is written well, although a bit long at times, its pretty great, probably one of the best film of this sort (dealing with an important court case), although i still prefer The Insider. The film was indeed great though, a must-see for any film fan. 9/10 #134 on my list of all time favorite films",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I love bunt cake,"Never been a Julia Roberts fan until this movie. She looks great in this movie. She sure has won me over. Who want's coffee and a piece of bunt cake? Erin's hand goes up right now and Ed says they have to go. Erin quickly straightens him out and he says ""I love bunt cake"". This movie is better the second time you watch it because it does'nt drag and is fun from start to finish. Didn't care too much for George. Kind of hard to believe a biker would be such a great family man and would want to be a baby sitter. Don't think he would have volunteered if the lady would have not been a beauty queen. It's always fun to watch an intelligent women lead a man around by the the nose. Seen it many times and enjoy it every time. Fun to see David beat Goliath. It was also fun at the end to see Ed finally shut Erin's mouth. It was really neat to see the real Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry in the diner scene. As for Julia Roberts being a great actress, in the scene where Pete Jensen is throwing rocks at P G&E in the middle of the night we then focus on Erin in the house with Donna. Donna sobbing asks Erin to go get them. Erin is looking at Donna and couldn't say a word lest she would start weeping.

Slightly above average movie,"Having seen the previews, I admit I was expecting something pretty interesting. A classic good vs. evil, David vs. Goliath-themed movie based on a true story. It had the potential to be a pretty entertaining movie. That is why I guess I was a little disappointed.True, there were those classic one-liners and most of the times likable Julia Roberts was there. However, I felt that aside from Julia Roberts' character Erin, all the other characters seem to be cast aside, and honestly, extremely wimpy and instantly dislikable. And, even Julia, at times, was getting pretty irritating with her mood swings and self-pity fits. The head lawyer, Ed Masry, seems like a very unlikely person to have been a lawyer, being the big softie that he is in the movie. The movie was also a little long, with many long stretches where essentially, nothing happens, or it is a repetition of other events.Having gotten that out of my system, there were of course some redeeming qualities in the movie. Julia Roberts' character is strong, fun and likable most of the times. Her lines when she is telling off her boss or enemies are very funny and quite enjoyable! The essential feel-good feeling the audience gets of having won against the big bad corporation was definitely felt in the crowd and that is a definite plus. Finally, having maybe expected a little too much from the movie, I was mildly disappointed, but this is nevertheless a pretty decent movie and I do recommend it, though it is, in my humble opinion, definitely not Oscar material.",,Anonymous,Biography

living a nightmare to living a dream,"Erin Brokovich is a movie based on a true story centered on Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) about how she was living her life as a nightmare to how she was living in a dream that she thought would never happen. Erin was driving her car and got hit by another car and took the man to court. No one in the court house believed her story because they thought she got hit on purpose to get money because she was a single mother that was hurting for money. She went to a law office to get a lawyer who was Ed Masry (Albert Finney). Ed took Erin to court and ended up not winning the case. Erin still was a jobless single mother with three children that could barely afford to pay for her bills and to put food on the table.At this point of her life she was living in her nightmare. She was very determined as the film went along to find a job as of which she did. She demanded that her Ed gave her a job at his law office which he ended up doing. She started at the law office as his ""secretary"" filing his papers away and just doing the normal office job. She really didn't know what she was doing and she really wasn't liked in the law office just because of her attitude. Erin was the best looking lady in the office and offended many of the other women in the office because of her clothing. Erin really didn't get any help from anyone else in the office. While Erin was working full time, her next door neighbor watched her children while she was at work. The next door neighbor ended up moving away and a ""Harley man"" who Erin got a bad vibe from ended up moving into the house next to her. They really didn't get along too well but then became really close as he watched her children while she was at work and pretty much became boyfriend and girlfriend.When Erin was filing papers at work she came upon a lawsuit for the PG&E water plant. Erin got very involve in this case and spent lots of her own time on it. When Erin knew that PG&E was wrong of what they were doing she had to do something about it. Erin did a lot of prospecting around the town where all of these people were sick. She spent a lot of time with mainly this one family. Ed and Erin ended up going to court with PG&E and ended up winning the case. Ed and Erin won millions of dollars with the case and help out the family to pay for their medical bills. Ed ended up giving Erin a huge bonus of 2 million dollars and Erin could not believe it. At this point of the movie this is where Erin began to live her life like it was a dream. She probably would have never thought that she would have ever had this kind of money.Film elements that contributed to the movie were dialogue and motif. The film element dialogue contributes to the theme through characterization. Dialogue is important to the theme of the movie because it shows how Erin was characterized throughout the movie. Dialogue shows what type of character Erin was in the movie by explaining her attitude and her willing to work for what she needed to do to better herself and her family. Motif contributes to the theme of the movie because it has a recurring element that has symbolic significance which would consist of Erin throughout the entire film. Erin would be the recurring element of the film that has a huge symbolic significance in the film.The film showed how Erin was a go for it woman. She was at rock bottom of her life and worked so hard to get to the part of her life to where she thought she was living in a dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Entertaining -- Great funny one-liners,"I probably wouldn't have gone to see this movie if I hadn't gotten an e-mail (along with all 22,000 other PG&E employees) from Gordon Smith, our beloved (ha!) CEO. I couldn't believe what I was reading. PG&E should have just passed on commenting on this movie...after all, the settlement's a done deal. But Smith had to remind us (as if we don't have a brain in our collective heads) that it 'primarily a vehicle for entertainment'. He goes on to make some extremely lame statements about how PG&E didn't move ""as quickly as it should have to rectify the problem"" but acted in good faith...yada yada yada. Jeez, cut your losses Gordie! Don't make it worse with such lame excuses!That e-mail piqued my interest in the movie. Although rather formulaic and featuring a few too many cardboard characters and scenes, EB is a very enjoyable movie. There are some hilarious one-liners, particularly toward the end of the movie. Unlike some others, I didn't feel the movie was overlong or slowly paced. However, I would have liked to have seen more on the legal issues and less on how poor EB is struggling to keep her personal life together. As it was, the movie completely skips the entire settlement process. In one scene, Roberts and Finney are collectly signatures from plaintiffs to pursue a settlement and in the next, she's telling a woman that the court has awarded her family $5 million.All in all though, definitely worth seeing.Oh, and for those of you who want to flame me for working for the big bad oppressive evil corporate empire, save your breath. PG&E is a massive corporation and I work very far from Hinkley (which, ironically, isn't even in the PG&E service area, though Kettleman Hills is). I currently work in the Vegetation Management Dept. (tree trimming and fire prevention mostly) but used to work in Energy Efficiency (trying to conserve energy and save people money). So I don't think of myself as a captalist running dog lackey, or even as a bad guy...but then, neither did Hitler. All I can say is that I probably enjoyed seeing them stick to PG&E more than you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE DECADE!!!,"When I first heard about this movie and how everybody thought Julia Roberts was great and it had a good plot, I didn't really want to see it.  I don't know why but most movies that are up for the Oscars I don't care for.  But this movie was absolutely awesome!!! Julia Roberts played her role very well.  Albert Finney (the first time I've seen him in a movie) also done very well.  The plot (a true story) was about a woman with 3 children, not much money, and no job.  She finally gets a job with her lawyer (Albert Finney) and stumbles over a real-estate case with a family.  She's confused about how there are medical files with the case and asks her boss if she can research it more.  She soon discovers a whole town as been contaminated with poisonous water from a gas and electric plant not too far away.

"Julia Roberts, put a shirt on!","I am sick of it! I cannot stand her (or anyone's) cleavage constantly in my face for two damn hours without adequate compensation and the dull movie that was ERIN BROCKOVICH certainly didn't compensate.This woman is manipulative, stubborn and worse, a fraud. She tries to fraudulently claim money from a car accident, which leads her to stubbornly DEMAND a job from the law firm which represented her. Not only does her lawyer Ed Masry get jack-all from the Erin Brockovich vs. Jaguar Driving Surgeon, he now has to employ and pay HER money.If Julia Roberts' portrayal of Erin Brockovich is anything like the real character, I can only pity Ms Brockovich. Whoever thinks that men are so singular as a fash of the 'boobs' can do anything is sickly delluded. This woman is portrayed to be a dedicated mother but when she's dressed as a tart with bad language when there's the slightest chance she won't be getting what she wants: that's not the greatest nor most endearing role model. Admit it, Julia Roberts' Erin Brockovich is a bitch! Pure and simple. I for one can't see what originally attracted George to her seeing how badly she treated him.

It's a shame the filmmakers were not completely honest,"""Erin Brockovich"" certainly earns its keep as an entertaining - if somewhat vulgar - retelling of a David vs. Goliath legal story.  I'm sure everybody's familiar enough with the plot that I'll skip the summary.My problem with this film is that it lacks the appropriate epilogue.  The Environmental Protection Agency issued a report on Chromium 6 that completely and unequivocally debunks the notion that the chemical was responsible for ANY of those illnesses in Hinkley.  Chromium 6 has certainly been linked to 2 types of cancer - but *zero* of the Hinkley plaintiffs suffered from these types of cancer.  Unfortunately, the report was issued after the $333 million settlement between the citizens and PG&E.So what this movie basically exhibits is a greedy bunch of ersatz victims, led by Erin ""The world crapped on my doorstep"" Brockovich, who succeeds in putting $130 million into the coffers of a law firm, $2 million into her own pockets, and an average of only $300,000 in the pockets of the supposed victims.  All of this under faulty scientific and medical conclusions.PG&E and their operating activities were not at all to blame for whatever ailments afflicted the citizens of Hinkley, CA.  But what does that matter? PG&E has billions of dollars and the citizens were poor and sick.But, in this viewer's opinion, each and every one of those people are only modern day thieves - particularly Brockovich and Masry.""Erin Brockovich"" succeeds only in celebrating a modern day culture where people deflect the responsibility for their own lives to other parties (particularly ones with deep pockets).  It's a plague of our society that this film not only displays, but champions.2 out of 10 for sheer dishonesty.",,Anonymous,Biography
***** Easily Julia's Best Ever,"One of the best films of the year is this excellent biography of the true-life woman who brought about the biggest personal lawsuit case in American legal history. Julia Roberts gives the absolute best performance of anybody's career as Brockovich, a single mother who gets a job working for lawyer Albert Finney and stumbles across records of a case pertaining to nearby town residents who might have been poisoned by an oil corporation's faulty dumping methods.

Captivating,"This story was truly inspiring. I see the real Erin Brokovich hosting a show on Lifetime about women like herself these days. Anywho, the movie was a tad bit too long, but was a good film in itself. I liked the personal aspects of her family going sour as her aspirations and goals move up. That's often very true when a woman is trying to make something of herself with a family in tow. The story was just amazing. I thought Roberts was good, but all she did was cuss a lot, which doesn't take great acting because we all want to sometime. I think the character just allowed Roberts to speak what she would probably say if she wasn't who she was, if that makes any sense. Finney was marvelous and an engaging character who's scared to take on such a big challenge, but rises to the occasion. He kept it very real to me by not all of a sudden becoming all into the case. He took his time warming up to the idea that it could go somewhere. The cut and paste effect was a little lost on me and slowed down the already lengthy movie, but it was altogether good. A great message about not letting people take advantage of you and that there are some who are willing to fight for others. The fact that it's true makes the movie much stronger in its presentation.",,Anonymous,Biography

Just a couple of days before watching this film, i watched Notting Hill, and now i can honestly say im a hardened Julia Roberts fan. But more importantly is the film itself, playing a woman who came from such a disfuncional existance, to becoming such a well respected woman has to be something to admire, her sheer determination and guts to stand up to anyone who questioned what she thought was right is how she became successfull in her own beliefs, and none of this was done for self gratification, but for the rights of the people, and to give her daughter the life she didn't have, good on her",,Anonymous,Biography
Soderberg hits another homerun,"Made at the time Julia Roberts was the top acress on the planet Erin Brockovich is a reminder of the actress's immense charisma and talent. It helps that the director is the supremely talented Steven Soderberg. Erin Brockovich was a unique legal thriller in that, during an era when overplotted and contrived stories like those of John Grisham defined the genre, it wasn't littered with throw-away plot devices designed exclusively to generate tension. With only a minor exception, Erin is not followed by shadowy figures. She does not become the target of violence and terroristic threats. With a performance that shows off both her comic and dramatic aptitude, Roberts brings the title character to life with a zest and intensity that may surprise viewers who have pigeonholed her into the romantic comedy mold. Albert Finney is excellent here. Their scenes together crackle with electricity, and it's a joy to see this kind of male/female interaction where there is absolutely no hint of sexual attraction.",,Anonymous,Biography

If you empathize with in-your-face abrasive characters with mega chips on their shoulders, then Julia Roberts' character is going to come over as 'ballsy' and 'brassy' to you.If you find that kind of attitude just too 80's to be at all endearing anymore, then her character is just going to come over as plain rude, hostile and largely detached from anyone else's feelings except other people who've had a hard hard time.Whilst the story may be true, it was profoundly dull, played out with little sense of suspense or tension building, and quite frankly is better suited to a 1 hour documentary than a 2 and a half hour snore of a cinematic effort.",,Anonymous,Biography
True Fairy Tale from Toxic Tort Country,"Lightweight legal drama with a feel-good ending enlivened by a sparkling script and good chemistry between the leads. I say legal drama, though the courtroom scenes are brief, because it is largely an account of the real Ms Brockovich's legwork (in more than one sense) that brought about the largest toxic tort settlement to date. The victims were the unlucky inhabitants of a small Mojave desert town, Hinkley, California, many of whom were seriously affected by the release into their environment of a poisonous industrial chemical, hexavalent chromium. The villain was Pacific Gas and Electric, the power utility. Erin Brockovich, a single mother with three young children who had bullied Ed Masry, the aging accident lawyer who had just lost her road accident compensation case, into giving her a paralegal job, found a file relating to a Hinkley land purchase by P G &E, which had some unusual features, and started digging. She rounded up over 600 claimants, stacks of evidence (including the proverbial smoking gun), and achieved a remarkable reasonably prompt result - $333 million in damages from a $28 billion dollar corporation.The fictional account of this engaging story naturally goes out of its way to tug on the heartstrings so we get lots of Ms B's private life  financial worries, job-hunting blues, childcare problems and the ups and downs of her relationship with George, a sweet-natured biker. The real interest in the story is in two things. One, her remarkable people skills ranging from flashing her ample cleavage to get co-operation from a records clerk to establishing real empathy with the abused victims of P G &E, a skill few lawyers possess. (Like a lot of good lawyers she does possess an excellent memory.) The second is her relationship with Ed, the old crash and bash man, who she irritates into winning the case of his life, long after it seemed forensic glory had passed him by. Ed is not driven by lust (he's a bit old for that) but is shamed into action, and after a while he realizes that Erin has got what it takes, even though he treats her shabbily on occasion.Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed are a curious combination. It was odd to cast Finney, an English actor with a strong regional accent, as a Southern Californian ambulance-chaser with maybe a middle eastern background. Julia Roberts makes the transition from romantic comedy heroine to a more character-driven role with ease and she and Finney bounce off each other very satisfactorily without Finney seeming to want to lay a hand on her, despite her provocative dress sense. Stephen Soderbergh, who dealt with kinky Southern sex in `Sex, Lies and Videotape', has made a pretty orthodox piece here, but it is well done and many of the minor characters are well filled out. Aaron Eckhart is very appealing, if a little too good to be true, as George. One of the real judges in the case repeats his role on film and Erin herself appears briefly as a waitress in a fast food outlet who has no trouble remembering complicated orders.Poor old P G & E. really get it in the neck. Although they are exposed as having attempted early on to defeat the Hinkley inhabitants' legal rights by a tactical confession of their sins, the subsequent conduct of the matter by their representatives indicates a very stupid bunch indeed  not even smart enough to be called evil (compare `Silkwood'). Unlike John Travolta in `Class Action' who had Robert Duvall as his Big Corporate nemesis, Erin and Ed lacked a worthy opponent. This rather reduces the dramatic tension, but the real-life Erin and Ed obviously know they are on to a good thing  they are now doing their best to drive up power bills even further by suing P G&E over another toxic tort elsewhere in California.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of Julia's best,"""Erin Brockovich""is one of the smartest movies I have seen in a long time.In the tradition of ""A Civil Action,""Erin Brockovich"" delves into the case of a town inflicted with various diseases due to toxons coming from a PG & E plant.Julia Roberts plays the title role who snares the case after getting hired as a file clerk to an attorney, Ed, played by Albert Finney. Rounding out the cast is Aaron Eckhart, who portrays George, Erin's supportive boyfriend.""Erin Brockovich"" embodies what directors should look for in making a good movie because this is one smart movie. ""Erin Brockovich"" has solidified Julia Roberts as a true star because her performance as Erin is one that only Julia could pull off. Julia brings her feisty attitude to a role that brought spunk to the character.""Erin Brockovich"" matched the feistiness and fiery attitude of Julia Roberts with the brilliant dialogue and direction of Steven Soderbergh, plot as well as perfect casting to make an outstanding and heart-warming film.""Erin Brockovich"" is a plain and simple feel good movie that touched me in ways that I cant even describe. After watching ""Erin Brockovich,"" I wish I could do the same thing for others. I praise the real Erin Brockovich for what she has done for the town of Hinkley and what she and Ed continue to do, which is fight the good fight. Furthermore, the portrayals by Roberts and Finney did well in conveying the true effect Erin and Ed had in the town.I would recommend everyone watch this film.",,Anonymous,Biography
chemical cinema,"I think that what made the success of this film was a combination of two elements:-an engaging story (at least for the 'masses'), one where an 'underdog' defeats higher powers, out of dedication, lots of courage, lots of humanity, and ignoring threats and personal private life to achieve them. Oh, and that story is real;-the fact that some 'stars' of the system of stars were in this, and one of them (Roberts) took it as a personal project, something she specifically chose to do;Starting with these two premises, anything could be done and the film would sell. In this ride, we have Soderbergh, who is a great director. But he doesn't show. The directing is mechanical. In fact every aspect of the film is mechanical, lighting, editing, narrative dynamics. Last week i went to see his new, personal, and very good ""Che"". Maybe that was partially paid for or supported by money raised here. If that's true, this film was worth it. Julia Roberts is OK here, but the part is born, cut, and tailored to her. Her range is small and here she is at the perfect center of it. I think it's intelligent of her to choose what she can do.The bottom line is that this is a film about lives that transcend the ordinary curse, and make interesting things, but itself is one in a million. It's ordinary, it goes with the flow, and it will be forgotten. In fact it is practically now, despite the awards and the success in its moment.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Biography
A very good TV film,"ERIN BROCKOVICH- no introduction needed here, I guess, the enormous publicity campaign has done its job. As most stories which are based 'on a true story', this one deals with a poor woman, who stays herself and is able to do good work and become very rich at the same time. Julia Roberts is finally starring in a film, where the story isn't about being a love-interest or chasing one. And surprisingly she is well cast and doing a good job. She is emotional and aggressive when she ought to be, with the right amount of it, not overdoing, or lacking conviction. Also Albert Finney as the lawyer is at his best. The only thing in this film that raises question marks is Erin Broccoli's boyfriend; what is he doing there, and why does he stick around (he is her housekeeper and nanny)? And perhaps this film is a bit longish to some taste. There is not much what can be said about the film, it has everything one expects from it, a bit of laughter, a few tears, a happy ending. Not anything in particular that makes it a 'must see' on the big screen. It is a very good TV film. ** 1/2 out of five",,Anonymous,Biography
So very very dull ...,"After watching A Civil Action a few years ago I said to myself, ""ok, no more films about water contamination.""  Of course I watched the Oscars and after seeing all of the attention given to Miss Roberts I figured why not give E. Brockovich a try.  I'm sure this story would have made a nice 30 minute documentary on PBS, however, this did NOT make for an entertaining movie. Sure Julia was abrasive and carried her torch relentlessly, however this movie was simply dull.  There were no unexpected twists of plot, no unforgettable scenes, and the few moments of levity were forced in a cut and paste sort of way.  I'll spare everyone a plot summary because how much can one say about another tired, overdone story that centers around the common man standing up against the mighty corporate giant.  At least The Rainmaker had some excitement and didn't plod along in a boring, linear fashion like E. Brockovich did.  Frankly I don't know why Julia won an award for this role.  Personally I found her much more believable in The Pelican Brief. In short, don't waste your time with this one - it's awful.",,Anonymous,Biography
"a feel-good film, but far from the truth","How could we not love a film where the good people get compensated(including the lawyers), and the evil corporation pays. Even better, it's based on a true story!I really hate it when movies state that, because the audience usually sees the words ""TRUE STORY"" in bold and ignores the words ""BASED ON"".The truth is, only lies and fictions have to be based on the truth; truth is never ""based"" on the truth. In the case of this film, the words ""based on a true story"" really just allow the writer to use the names of the firm and the people.Here's an article on the real story: http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2000/04/14/sharp/Viewing the film as a fiction, however, it does have many pluses: the open-ended love relationship between Erin and George, the imperfections in Erin's life and personalities, and several subtle but effectively touching moments.So to those who think of this film as a documentary - get real.",,Anonymous,Biography
dulldulldull,"what a shame that such an important story about the triumph of ordinary people over the international commercial behemoth was reduced to such a tawdry, trite and cliche- ridden piece of nonsense. While Albert Finney showed glimpses of his quality, the rest was a wooden ensemble rendering the kiss of death to what sounds like a great story.This is a classic example of commercial overhype. No character development; a paper cut out strong woman, gentle man scenario. the creepy voice down the phone that goes nowhere; the jealous office minions. Please, film goers should not be insulted by such schlock.",,Anonymous,Biography
"An interesting true story about a down-and-out lady who cracks a big case, good Julia Roberts vehicle.","Erin Brockovitch is a real person, who quite by ""accident"" (car) ends up retaining a lawyer who apparently does her no good. When she can't find a job to pay her bills, and care for her 3 children by two different former husbands, she goes back to the lawyer and refuses to leave until he gives her a job. Simply because she is very smart, and very inquisitive, she and her firm end up representing 600+ families in a hexavalent chromium pollution case.(A detail that seemed sloppy editing or filming - we see early in the film that her ""accident"" is caused by the other car running a red light and broadsiding her. When she is testifying in court she says she was pulling out and he rounded a corner out of nowhere. The description did not fit what we saw.)Anyway, Julia Roberts does her usual superior job as Erin, and Albert Finney as the lawyer. The real Erin even has a small part, playing the waitress in an early scene. It is a good story, and a well-done film, but ultimately all I can rate it is a very strong 7 of 10. No where near the impact of recent films like ""Music of the Heart"" or ""The Insider"", both based on true stories. Maybe because Erin was treated all the way through as a very ""over the top"" character with a dirty vocabulary, and that got tiresome.I saw the DVD version of this movie. To me, the most interesting extra was the interview which included the real Erin and the real lawyer. Also some interesting facts on the location and shooting. Most of the extras were deleted scenes, which trimmed the running time from 3 hours 15 minutes to about one hour shorter. The DVD image is sharp and colors fine, the sound track is fine too, but nothing outstanding.",,Anonymous,Biography
Cute people and cancer too,"A solid, entertaining portrayal of a woman (who has absolutely nothing going for her except for heart and stubborn determination) fighting against incredible odds.  Erin Brockovich has every reason to give up the fight against a corporate giant who has successfully gotten away with polluting a small community's water for years.  But she will not give up.My only real problem with the movie is that it's a little too cute.  Albert Finney is cute, the biker boyfriend who loves little kids is cute, of course Julia Roberts is cute - even the streams of obscenities coming out of Julia Roberts mouth are cute.  You can't help but feel good after this movie, but the main characters are just so lovable you almost expect McDonald's to be handing out plush toys and Erin Brockovich happy meals.  Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie a lot.  But the characters and situations are a little bit too perfect to be believable.",,Anonymous,Biography
Steven Soderbergh is faced with a huge problem here,"Steven Soderbergh is faced with a huge problem here; on the one hand he has to cater for all the Julia Roberts fans and deliver a star-vehicle, on the other hand he has to deal with a serious problem, in this case mass contamination and a shady conspiracy.

Erin Brocko-bitch,"This made a 100 million bucks??  A film about a pushy, arrogant, trash-mouthed, slut dressing mega-bitch?  I've heard of ""the bad guy you love to hate"", but NO WAY could I do that here.  I wouldn't use the line ""I was rooting for the bad guys"" (not after what they put the town through) but I wasn't rooting for the heroine either.  More so for the victims, the standout being Marg Helgenberger, the main plaintiff in the story.  She's one of many homeowners battling a power company that has knowingly contaminated their water.  I also sympathized with Finney, having to deal with ""I need, I want"" Brockovich, and his performance was the one I more related to.  But Roberts is unbearable, and tries to come off SOOO superior to others.  The speech on her porch to the conveniently placed guy next door just came off totally unbelievable.  And her showing up of an attorney by reciting memorized phone numbers, addresses, names and ailments is great for her...BUT WHAT ABOUT OTHERS ON THE CASE WHO NEED ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION??????  What do you expect them to call you every time they need it??  NOOOOO!!!  Common courtesy, Brockovich!  Give them the damn info! That was the most infuriating scene I had watched in years from any movie. You wanna-be badass.  Say this for the film, it only stalls here and there, until it runs on fumes to its conclusion that we know is coming because of the ""based on a true story"" element.  But a totally unlikable lead character will kill any film in my opinion and that's what you get here.  Best Actress?  How 'bout Best Attitude.",,Anonymous,Biography
Every Day is a Winding Road,"Erin Brockovich ,undoubtedly ,is one of the most amusing movies of Steven Soderbergh which I have ever seen.  Although it is still a Soderbergh movie with his familiar qualities.  And for those viewers who are not used to his slow-beating style of narration, it can be a little boring.  But if you put trust in his fame and glory as a new director who really has something to say, you may begin to feel more comfortable with his style.Although I'm not one of the Soderbergh's fanatics, I admit that he has done a well job specially when considering the genre of the movie which is potentially a boring one.  Success of the movie in keeping the audience entertained is not only the result of directing but also that of screenplay which is a well-developed one.Julia Roberts is astonishing. This time she comes out of the foolish girl personality of her romantic movies. Although The scene where she's discussing about her salary with Finney is full of nostalgia and takes us back to 'Pretty Woman' and her dealing with Richard Gere, here, we can see a mature woman in her. Lines of a mother's pain are quite visible in her face. In spite of some critics' anger, I believe she was well deserved of the Oscar that she received as the Best Leading Role actress.The interesting thing is that the movie is not totally dependent on Roberts, since one man named Albert Finney makes one of the best supporting role performances ever.  He is very experienced and it's obviously visible that Soderbergh should have been quite satisfied. Finney has the role completely under his control.  Even if you are not much into Julia Roberts, Albert Finney's performance in Erin Brockovich is a must-see.  Aaron Eckhart is also fitted in his role and adds to the flavor.Thomas Newman's rythmic theme is quite suitable for the atmosphere of the movie and remains in your ear at least for a couple of days and who knows maybe more!!Erin Brockovich has 3 believable performances from the actors I've mentioned above. It has 1 learned director, 1 fine screenplay and 1 wise original score. And from the numbers I'm gonna give to this movie....  The number is 7 out of 10",,Anonymous,Biography
A multi-faceted picture,"I never paid attention to the Oscars when Julia Roberts was giventhis one, so I don't remember anything about it (except herbeautiful black and white dress) But her performance in this moviewas good. It wasn't just some romantic comedy, but the characterswere real and had depth. The people who don't think Juliadeserved the Oscar because all she did was ""wear sleazy clothingand swear"" were really missing a lot of the characters otherattributes. The sleazy clothing and swearing were just a cover upfor her character. So no one got too close and hurt her again.  Andthe sleazy clothing was what SHE liked and she didn't care if noone else liked it. Erin Brockovich was tough and smart. The storyis very compelling and I did notice there were a few ""inconsistencies"" in the plot. I also think Albert Finney should havewon for Best Supporting Actor, but so what? It was a still a greatperformance anyway. The story, while I know a few details havebeen altered , is compelling and scary and good.",,Anonymous,Biography
