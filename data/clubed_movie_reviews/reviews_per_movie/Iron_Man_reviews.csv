Still one of the best MCU-movies,"In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it's still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn't made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it's easier to have your protagonist change but let's compare for a second: 
Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn't stretched too long and therefore doesn't get boring. You can't underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.During my re-watch I also noticed how 'down to earth' this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It's set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don't improve a movie. So the movie doesn't feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you've spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven't seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Marvel superhero film done with class,"When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't waste your life, Stark","With a B-list superhero, a risky lead actor, a genre that hasn't really done much other than say Nolan's Batman, this movie had a lot to prove. Wow, did it ever. It proved that superhero movies can be realistic, emotional, funny and have highly entertaining action. This is the movie to launch the MCU, and started the shared universe that DC comics and other franchises are following.Let's start with the number one reason why this movie is so good: Robert Downey Jr. I am so glad that Jon Favreau kept pressing the studio to make sure RDJ had this role because he completely nails it. He effortlessly portrays the cool, sarcastic, alcoholic, playboy that I don't even think he's acting. He's clearly not perfect as he is the guy we think is awesome but don't necessarily want to be. This role is basically synonymous with RDJ now because you can't think of Tony Stark without immediately thinking of RDJ. Iron Man wasn't a househeld name before but thanks to RDJ's performance, it is now.The action in this movie is incredible as you get to see him fly around, take on terrorist cells and fight the main villain. What I even found to more intriguing is Stark's entire time building his suit, both in the Afghan cave and in his garage because it is amazing to see his genius at work, while still being snarky and basically a tool.The writing and humor is also very good in this movie. I read that a lot of the lines, especially RDJ's were improv, which is able to keep this movie very fresh, not Rotten Tomatoes style, but it helps a lot by breaking the molds of superhero movies.A couple complaints in this film is the pacing and the final villain. The pacing starts off very well, not really rushing into him being Iron Man, establishing his character very well before his abilities. Then the final battle comes around and it's basically just an evil version of his character, which sort of works with the problem of his technology getting into wrong hands, but the fact that it's just fighting a mirror is kind of boring. The final battle comes around pretty quick and it resolved fairly quick as if they are trying to wrap it up really quickly. I did like Bridges' Obadiah Stane with his intimidating yet charming persona but in the end he was just a reverse of Iron Man, not that interesting.+ Robert Downey Jr + Fresh, new start for superhero movies + Writing and pacing (mostly) + Action and Humor - Final VillainFinal Score: 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is where it all began. Queue AC/DC.,"MCU 2021 MarathonMCU #1:Iron Man was my favorite Marvel hero. As a teen I collected 1-150 with the main series. I doodled the Iron Man helmet during class at high school when bored.So it was a huge surprise when this came out in 2008 and it was so freaking GOOD! Jon Favreau, the guy that had done Elf and Zathura (the Zumanji sequel) had just started a cinematic revolution? What!?!? (And Favreau is doing it again with The Mandalorian).Robert Downey Jr. was made for the part of Tony Stark. The origin story was modernized and handled well. They included most of the early Iron Man suits from the comics. They took the time showing the more modern invention of the suit and the challenges of making it work (e.g. maneuvering with the repulsors).I finally understood what Spiderman's fans felt like when Sam Raimi's Spiderman series became a massive pop culture sensation years earlier. Fantastic!There are issues. Pacing mostly. Jeff Bridges is too much the stereotypical villain with an over-the-top fight scene at the end.This was the beginning of the MCU world building effort which was more ""slight-of-hand"" in the earlier movies -- Stark's OCD making itself evident, that Shield guy at the party, and Samuel Jackson pinging Stark about Avengers in the end credits.It began and ended with Iron Man. That makes me happy.""I am Iron Man""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
RDJ is Iron Man,"Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Delivers Intelligence & Great Acting with its Fun,"Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2008, quite possibly the number one film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Well Done,"So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.Much against the hype, I thought this movie would have been torrid trash acting mingled with cheesy fight scenes. I mean Robert Downey Jr as an action superhero? But I am glad to admit that I misjudged the movie completely. Downey played a very good Tony Stark, in generally every way. From his jokes to his obnoxious lifestyle he looked and walked the part very well. His banter with his right hand assistant Ms. Pepper Potts isn't mind numbing and actually found myself laughing aloud at some of the wit.The movie itself moved at a very good pace. Mixing action, comedy and some drama to just about the right proportions. As with most superhero movies, its rather predictable, but in all the right ways you'd want a superhero movie to be. The animation used was almost seamless, and of course the Iron Man costume was kicking major ass.My only gripe with the movie was the fact that several characters were thrown into the mix with little behind them other than 2D character attributes. Leslie Bibb's character, Christine Everhart, is pretty useless other than the two or three lines she has. Hardly worth a hardbody like Leslie Bibb to play. Several other characters didn't feel fleshed out at all. Raza (Faran Tahir), Obediah Stone (Jeff Bridges) , and even Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) feel hollow in the fact that they have little justification for many of their actions.So All in all, I'd give this movie an 8.3. Fun for the whole family, great pacing, and a Superhero movie to give the next Batman movie a run for its money.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie of a hero's origin.,"Great movie, which serves as a perfect introduction to Tony Stark's character. The antagonist was a bit boring, but except for that, I loved the movie!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best pre-Avengers effort,"It seems strange to think that this was considered a big gamble back in 2008, when Marvel Studios finally began putting into place the ensemble of superhero films that would lead to the fantastically entertaining The Avengers. They hired a relatively rookie director in Jon Favreau who, up to this point, had made the shoddy Made (2001), Will Ferrell vehicle Elf (2003) and kiddie-flick Zathura (2005), and cast Robert Downey Jr., an actor that was still trying to piece together his career after years of drug and alcohol abuse. After all, Iron Man is basically a story about a rich genius who fights crime in a flying metal suit, and had it not being given the necessary thought and care, this could have been a disaster. Thankfully, it's anything but, thanks to Downey Jr.'s infectious performance, a razor-sharp screenplay by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, and Favreau's confident direction.Weapons manufacturer and playboy Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) travels to Afghanistan with his good friend Lt. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard) to show off his new weapon of mass destruction, the Jericho. He is ambushed and taken hostage by a terrorist group that call themselves the Ten Rings, who seriously wound Stark, causing shrapnel to lodge dangerously close to his heart. An electromagnet is developed by fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub) to keep the shrapnel away from his heart, and the two are forced to build the Jericho from parts of Stark's stolen weapons. He instead builds a prototype metal suit, which he uses to all but destroy the terrorist group and escape back to America. After calling a press conference where he announces that Stark Industries will cease war profiteering, Stark builds his Iron Man suit with the help of his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Seeing stocks falling and the potential collapse of the company, Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) wants the technology for himself.The main problem that faces most superhero origin films is having to combine the protagonist's development into the hero of the title with a villain capable of giving the hero a genuine threat to face, as well as blending them together to form one cohesive storyline. Marvel in particular have had trouble with their super-villains, with only Thor's multi-dimensional Loki, played with a thespian quality by Tom Hiddleston, proving successful. Iron Man suffers here too, only it seems almost irrelevant. Obadiah Stane does eventually don a gigantic metal suit for a big showdown at the climax, but Stane's menace comes from his corporate greed, offering only slight hints at what goes on in the big, bald dome of his, while coming across as a trusted friend to Stark.It is Stark's personal development that takes centre stage, and it's a true joy to watch it. At first, he is cocky, smarmy, and filthy-rich, and after he gets a wake-up call, he is still cocky, smarmy and filthy- rich. Only now he understands the devastation his weapons program is inflicting of thousands of innocents, who up until now, Stark has casually viewed through the safety of his television. In the wrong hands, Stark could have been a disaster, apparently caring little for the ramifications of his actions, buying priceless works of art he'll never see just because he can. Downey Jr. injects the same energy he's been putting into his characters throughout his entire career - fast- talking and wise-cracking, almost comically narcissistic. But Downey Jr. is best at giving his characters an underlying sense of damage beneath the cocky exterior, perhaps a reflection on his long-standing problems in real-life, and this helps give Stark an undeniable depth, and therefore making him effortlessly fascinating to watch.Iron Man is most entertaining when showing Stark at work - bashing various parts together, interacting with his robots and his house computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and testing his newly acquired powers. His first flying trial has him hovering uncomfortably and struggling for complete control, destroying his hoard of expensive super cars in the process. It's a funny, exciting scene, rounded off with ""yeah, I can fly"". It's rare for a superhero film to be so successful in portraying the development of its character, whether having to experience a mutation, an experiment gone wrong, or facing childhood fears, this proves that simply building a metal super-suit is far more entertaining. This is still Marvel's best pre-Avengers effort, including it's vastly inferior sequel, and Tony Stark was the best to watch amongst the massive ensemble when the giant ego's finally came together. But that's all down to the care given to this film, which is quite simply a massive hoot.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, very impressive !!!!","WOW WOW WOW.This is the movie I have been waiting for for a very long time. I am an avid Ironman reader. I have collected the comics all my life (from #1 in 1968 to the latest in 2008)...40 years of Ironman. Since I was a kid, I used to say to my friends that they should make an Ironman movie, but everyone laughed and said that the special effects would look ridiculous...mind you, that was back in like in the early 1980's. But, now we are in the age of CGI, and what an age it is. Just for you Ironman fans, to see him come to life with such spectacular graphics is reason enough to spend your hard-earned $10. The plot is also pretty well thought out, and the acting is just fine. What better pick could you have for Tony Stark than Robert Downey Jr.? (just wait for the sequels when they can delve into his alcoholism...Mr. Downey has been there and beyond...that's probably why they chose him for the role...fore-thought)The rest of the cast is right on par, as well. The pace is brisk, and the whole thing works as a great addition to the Marvel Universe in the Cinema!! Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A well re-mastered legend,"Since Marvel Comics and CGI started their mystical marriage in the late 1990s, we've had superheroes galore. Hulks, Surfers, Spidermen, not to mention constantly renewed Batmans and Supermans. So what does Iron Man have to offer that's different? A flawed character that becomes honourable is the answer, triumphing in the battle of Good over Evil in spite of being a bit of a prat.Add to that some of the best features of Robocop, Batman Begins and Terminator II, and you have one of the more satisfying comic-books-turned-blockbuster that we've seen for a while.Billionaire and genius Tony Stark  with a personality vaguely based on Howard Hughes  is a weapons inventor that gets captured by bad guys in Afghanistan. Forced to work for them, he has other plans. Stark, nicely played by Robert Downey Jr, fashions a hi-tech suit of armour - before going on to save the world in usual exemplary fashion.This long build-up  to explain how he becomes Iron Man  is arguably the best part of the film. Ingenious special effects give Stark's futuristic Malibu mansion a sci-fi rather than fantasy feel. And the subtle build-up makes us more forgiving as the story slips slowly into comic-book reality.There are, of course, compromises. It has to appeal to kids as well as adults, so there is none of the gutsiness of Terminator I (or similar adult-orientated sci-fi). And in spite of the heavy moral-political issues at stake, Iron Man stays politically bland  this being the only way to get D.O.D. approval and hence associated goodies like fighter jets and military hardware.One of the most interesting ideas for me in the film was the idea of 'zero accountability'. This takes the form of having all the wealth, brains and playboy attributes that fiction writers can imagine, but could also be a symbol for U.S. military might, for instance. Stark's first premise, of power being the ultimate deterrent (and hence a peace-keeping force) is undermined when the enemy gets hold of the same weapons and starts killing indiscriminately. Theologians might also muse how power itself has no moral authority. Good guys have to grudgingly beseech permission from whoever wields the biggest thunderbolt.Iron Man, essentially a symbol of power, abounds in biblical references, even if these come more from the comic book creators than any learning on the part of filmmakers. Jericho, the name given to Stark's finest military weapon, was the city that had to be destroyed, 'as an outward display of faith.' Which makes for great symbolism. Until you consider that modern-day Jericho is in the West Bank of the Palestinian territories, and then Stark's 'rockets' start to look a lot more loaded.Iron Man's technology has a special feature to avoid targeting civilians. Now this is one military development I would love to see.The second half of the movie is pure action, but with a well-delivered script and sufficient plot-twists to keep you engaged. Out-of-reach love-interest materialises as Gwyneth Paltrow, who I found very agreeable to watch, and the excellent supporting cast also includes Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. This is a film that tries to please everyone and largely succeeds. It's a two-hour thrill-ride that offers a new action-hero for our CGI-sated palates.On a personal note, my big disappointment was the title track  or rather lack of it. Having heard one of the most famous heavy metal riffs of all time in the trailer, I couldn't wait to see Iron Man flying through the skies to the sound of Black Sabbath's rock anthem. Sadly, the riff is all you get (probably cos the words seem to be based on an altogether different story). But if you sit through the closing credits hoping for more, you do at least get a very important extra scene. So you've been warned: don't leave the cinema beforehand!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

It's well-written and has a great cast.What impressed me the most was the CGI!

Great movie from an unknown hero.,"Lets face it. Iron Man is not the most famous of comic superheroes. In fact, up until now I had only head about it briefly. I also found out that it was from Marvel and since I love Spiderman so much I decided I would go and check it out. Wow! This movie is awesome!. Acting is great and I am so happy to see Gwyneth Paltrow back in the movie business after a while. Robert Downey junior was also really good as the sleazy millionaire turned superhero. The villain was great (i forget his name) and Terrence Howard was great as well. The action and visual effects were really good and the movies talk on terrorism is very intriguing.

The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.Acting was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far.

Don't waste itIron Man,"There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out backstory. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liason, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the backstory and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Heavy boots of lead, fills his victims full of dread, running as fast as they can, Iron man lives again!","Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.Tony Stark, rich, handsome, incredibly wealthy, has it all. He also creates war weapons, when he goes to Afghanastan to introduce a new missile, he is captured and told to create the missile for the terrorists. But Tony has other plans, he creates a metal suit and escapes, he goes back home and announces that he wants to retire and close down Stark industries due to the violence he saw. But when he learns that the weapons of his are in the wrong hands, he realizes that maybe he could re-create a metal suit and become Iron Man, the incredible machine to save man kind.Iron Man is a sure fire hit that I'm sure you won't want to miss. It has everything you could want for a comic book film: action, humor, a great cast, romance, and ultimate effects that just get you excited. Even the soundtrack gets you pumped up and ready to root for Iron Man. The only complaint, as much as the action was cool, I wish it wasn't the war on terrorism they used, I know it's part of the story, but it hits so close, that it may seem inappropriate. The climax, a little cliff hanger, but I'm already smelling a sequel for next year probably. But Iron Man is a fun movie that all ages could enjoy, Iron Man is the new Spider Man for 2008!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Considering I am not much of a fan of superhero movies, this one is a success","I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won't even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let's first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow's character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn't particularly like was Jeff Bridge's character--it just wasn't interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey's great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it's simply an amazing film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not super enough...,"Iron Man is the first feature to be made entirely by Marvel  a gamble which has paid off to the tune of over $350 million worldwide so far. For a non-sequel from a fledgling company that is impressive and bodes well for Marvel's reboot of The Incredible Hulk  due in June. Comic book films are big money spinners now but the success of a new series is predicated on the entertainment value of the central character  and in this way Hulk and Tony Stark have similar problems. They just aren't super enough...Iron Man starts with an unnecessary flashback structure, presumably to ensure some loud action in the first minute or two. Tony Stark (played with now-familiar post-rehab gusto by Robert Downey Jnr.) is the embodiment of the capitalistic, jingoistic American ideal. He has become absurdly rich designing weapons and, more significantly, has no moral qualms whatsoever about the negative effects of his work. Stark is not a nice man. Except he is. This potentially realistic and complex dualistic behaviour is lost in the film's failure to choose sides, leading us to the first of many problems; what are we, the audience, supposed to think of Tony Stark? He is presented as bright and brilliant; a charming man of the people but also as a womaniser and a warlord. This initial confusion is nothing compared to what happens later on. After a brush with death and a subsequent escape (which is accomplished in an ultra-violent fashion) he holds a hippie press conference and vows to stop making weapons for good.This turnaround is simply too fast and, as presented by Downey Jnr. with his usual twinkly-eyed glazed look, has none of the power or angst we have come to expect from comic book origin stories. His parents are not murdered before his eyes, nor is his home world destroyed. He comes across as a petulant child who is bored with his old toys. Instead of using his money to work for peace or help starving children he creates a powered battle suit and flies around the world blowing things up. Exactly how this is 'protecting the people he put in harm's way' is slightly beyond me. And the hypocrisy of the double standard is appalling  it is only when Stark realises that (Shock! Horror!) his weapons might be used against American troops that he begins to examine his conscience.Don't get the wrong idea, there is nothing particularly obnoxious about Iron Man. The performances are light and breezy and the script is a cut about the blockbuster norm; littered as it is with a particularly dry sense of humour. The central performance from Robert Downey Jnr. is the film's saving grace but also its' Achilles heel. His presence is enjoyable on the one hand but, in my opinion, also detracts from the credibility of the whole endeavour. You keep expecting him to wink to camera and finally admit it is some kind of extravagant Saturday Night Live parody. That Jeff Bridges is really being played by Will Ferrell and Terrence Howard is actually just a cardboard cutout. I still don't get Terrance Howard. I've yet to see him raise a palpable, or even guessable, emotion in his roles  his face seems oddly expressionless and his voice almost unbearable. He gets some good lines in this film but sounds like he's reading them from an auto cue. But I digress. As once off summer entertainment this kind of self aware film-making is bearable but I simply can't see the film becoming a much loved classic in the future.So, what does the film have going for it? The special effects are impressive, with the integration of cg and live action especially so. The set pieces, when they come, run the gamut from mundane to genuinely thrilling. Stark's armoured escape from captivity is surprisingly dull while some of the later aerial combat sequences are exciting. Once again though, the use of sfx has positive and negative effects, particularly in relation to the ending. The final confrontation has become a serious problem for the superhero film. In days of yore, special effects were difficult, so typically the best the film had to offer was saved for the ending. Now, every scene is liberally slathered with computer generated gunk. The result is explosive fatigue, a run of overpowering sequences which forgo actual affect for special effect. A dozen astonishingly well-rendered high octane scenes does not create a cumulative effect. If the same level of frankly awe-inspiring cg work is applied to the hero designing and dressing in his suit then what is left for the audience to look forward to. What makes a special effect special these days? The ending of Iron Man is another clunky computer-aided brawl, where narrative is suspended for minutes at a time while increasingly unrealistic pieces of metal and flesh beat on each other. This moment is reminiscent of a dozen other recent movie resolutions: from Hellboy to The Matrix Revolutions, all equally dull. Without vicarious involvement  a sense that a character we can identify with is in danger  it just amounts to so many polygons.Perhaps I've been a little harsh on Iron Man. I can't honestly say I was bored by the experience but I do feel its' major mis-steps are a symptom of a greater malaise at the heart of contemporary blockbuster cinema. If, however, your cynicism has not quite reached the pathological degree mine has you could well have some fun with Iron Man. Robert Downey Jnr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow are amiable enough company (even if the latter seems as though an errant puff of wind would shatter her into a million pieces) and the director, Jon Favreau, keeps things moving at a reasonable pace. Stark's character arc is minimal (more of a character stroll really) but his near trademarked delivery of PG-13 witticisms should be enough to hold your attention.

A Nutshell Review: Iron Man,"With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.This may irk the fervent fans of Iron Man, but face it, the superhero belonged to Tier B where superheroes are concerned, languishing behind easily recognizable peers who already have movie after movie being made. But thanks to the advancement in digital technology, bringing Iron Man to life no longer consisted of the prospect and worrying thought of having a man running about in a rubber suit passing it off as metal, the way Ultraman would have been done, complete with mechanical clicks and whirrs as sound effects to try and fool the visual sensory. Here, we have a very detailed rendering of the entire design from scratch to final modification, and we're in at every step of the way, with many cheeky and sometimes a tad implausible scenes just for cheap laughs thrown in.I thought Iron Man the story worked because of stark (pardon the pun) similarities with Batman Begins, also an origin story which took its time to dwell on the man behind the suit, nevermind at the sacrifice of having less action sequences, or by not giving the fans what they want through the showcase of more than the basic powers. Advanced capabilities can always find room in the sequel, and as the first movie used to establish its characters, I felt that it succeeded, given too that it had a cast of capables (just like Batman Begins had) to pull the movie through without resorting to over the top and campy performances, starting of course with the lead in Robert Downey Jr.In a nutshell, Downey is Tony Stark through and through. His affinity for the character shines, and no doubt it bore some parallels between his own personal, and Stark's life in the narrative future when he hits the bottle. He was allowed to become a Two-Face of sorts, on one hand being and later acting out his flamboyance self whose mission in life was the continuation of his father's legacy of Stark Industries, a weapons conglomerate, versus his personal mission in ridding his own weapons from the hands of the bad guys, now updated to be freedom fighters in the Middle East. The dialogue contained within each scene of Stark's, except perhaps during captivity, is full of one-liners done in double quick time, you probably would think it boiled down to a whole host of natural ad-libbing.But while Starks spends significant amount of time in his unsecured basement building his masterpiece, his human interaction come in the form of faithful secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who actually, for the first time I admit, looked really good on screen as Stark's most trusted aide, bringing about some serious spark of sexual tension and chemistry between the two characters of opposite sex, more so than any other comic book movie I have seen. And good friend from the air force Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard) complete the circle of trust who knows of Stark's secret identity, and you'd be keeping your fingers crossed at the toss of a teaser of a certain War Machine appearance should the sequel be out.Who's the main villain in the movie? It points the finger at Corporations, or at least here, the weapons manufacturers and the shady deals that go through in the name of profit, the sole objective for any corporation's existence. And Jeff Bridges, in a rare villainous role, got to personify that greed and wrestle for absolute power just like the trailer already suggested. While his performance is refreshing as he disappears behind the ball head and bushy beard, you could see his motivation and how the plot would have been developed to introduced the ultimate fodder for Iron Man to duke it out in a, sad to say, ordinary finale which any audience would probably be able to stay a step ahead.As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of similarities with the Dark Knight of Gotham in Christopher Nolan's reboot, but more so because of properties inherent with the likeness between Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark. Both are incredibly wealthy to devote time outside of the day job to pursue their ""hobby"", both have to suffer personal tragedies in order to wake up to the cruel world, and in the movie, both fall prey to the corporate raider type, spend time perfecting their suit of war, have assistants they would trust their lives with, and of course save them from impending doom, and a finales set at their facilities.But Iron Man is still a special effects extravaganza offering a thrill ride especially when he goes into battle mode, and without a doubt, Robert Downey Jr probably should be credited for raising the profile of this once Tier-B character, to perhaps becoming more recognizable now, and obviously, expanding the fan base of this weaponry filled suit of metal, which of course, in this origin movie, we were only given a glimpse of its potential. can everyone now spell sequel and clamour for more please? Iron Man has set the bar for the other upcoming comic book movies to try and surpass this summer season!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good film,"Good film. What a guy this is. He has enough many to keep a small country in luxury for decades. He can build anything with a hammer and welding torch. He lives on a vast mountaintop estate in Malibu, California. He has jets, cars, and even a robot butler named J. A. R. V. I. S. whose voice sounds suspiciously like Paul Bettaney. He's also got a Barnum-like gift for salesmanship, selling arms around the world to keep things in line. This is caused him grief. He's been called a Merchant of Death, a man whose company deals in making war profits. He argues vehemently that his company helps keep the world at peace by fighting back against those who bring about war. That builds the bulk of the movie as Stark builds the Iron Man suit, his company. After an incident in Afghanistan, he decides to shut down the weapons division and focus on building his iron suit. That doesn't sit well with his second-in-command Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), and therein lies our villain. Bridges makes a good one. He's familiar to us as a nice guy, but here he proves that he can convincingly play a villain. It's not just a standard evil villain. There's something about Stane that gives he fuel to want what Stark has. It's a good performance.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron-Badass,"I was hyped for the movie when it was on the internet as news. I wasn't the biggest fan of Iron-Man at the time, but I always liked Robert Downey Jr., because he's a phenomenal actor. Not only that, but having Jon Favreau on board made me want to watch this film even more. He's a great comedic actor, and would seem like a cool buddy to hang out with.So I went in there with high expectations and I came out very satisfied at what I just had seen. I couldn't think of anyone else who could play Iron-Man better than Robert Downey. Thanks to this film, I put Iron-Man at the second spot in my favorite super-hero list. Blade comes first.Of course I bought the blu-ray version of the movie, watched all the special features and it was great. The action was great, it was planned out where it was needed. Jeff Bridges also did a great job on his character, acting as a mentor and then as Iron-Man's enemy. He didn't like to put up with the selfish rich guy, I get it, no one likes that.Overall, a 10/10 for creativity. Now, I'm anxious for the sequel, and you know what they say about sequels, they're always the best ones in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Great Beginning for the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"This film is not the first movie to feature characters from Marvel Comics. The 2000's saw the ""X-Men"" franchise, a ""Hulk"" movie, two ""Fantastic Four"" movies, and the Toby Maguire ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. However, all of those movies were films that Marvel outsourced to various companies--notably Fox and Sony. ""Iron Man"" is the first film to be made in house by Marvel Studios, and as such it's the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the first film that will come to interact with characters from other films that are not direct sequels.For this reason, ""Iron Man"" is worth watching if you happen to be a fan of any of the other MCU movies, especially ""The Avengers"" series. ""Iron Man"" begins the process of building continuity across different Marvel films, and for the true nerds amongst us there are many tidbits of information in this movie that are beneficial to understanding the rest of the MCU films.Still, the main reason to watch this movie is not its place in the MCU, but its value as a standalone film. Marvel Studios set out to prove themselves with this movie, and they delivered a hit. The film is a solid two hours of thrills that features a robust and engaging storyline and fantastic acting. Robert Downey, Jr. defines the role of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges all turn out dynamic performances. Bridges especially shines as Obadiah Stain, and contributes much to the movie.That said, I give this film nine out of ten stars. It's one of the best in the comics movie genre, and I only stop myself from giving it a ten because I try to reserve that score for movies I see as not only great, but perfect. ""Iron Man"" comes mighty close to that, and I'm sure you'll agree that it deserves high marks.Oh, and don't forget to watch the post-credits scene, which foreshadows the rest of the MCU!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than I had expected...,"From all the hype I heard about this film, I decided to see it. I thought this would be another superhero movie disaster that has too much CGI and no plot, but I was proved wrong. Most superhero films don't have an academy award winning script, but ""Iron Man"" pulled off with a decent story that has no holes. I was very impressed by it, particularly with a surprising anti-gun/war message delivered nicely by Robert Downey Jr.To my surprise, Downey did a pretty good job as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He's funny, entertaining, and a hero that could easily be liked. Terrence Howard as the amusing Jim Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow (beautiful as ever) as Iron Man's assistant are pleasant additions to the film. Jeff Bridges wasn't a bad villain, although I did not find him to be in the caliber of Jack Nicholson as ""The Joker"" or even Willem Dafoe as the ""Green Goblin"".The one thing that I did not like about the movie though was the lack of romance. Whether it is Batman or Spider-man, the good guy always had a girl. Gwyneth Paltrow's character can be considered a damsel in distress at the end, but the relationship never grows between her and Iron Man. I'm not trying to sound like I am a lover of chick flicks, but in my opinion, a good superhero should always have a girl, or at least someone to love.Overall this is a great film with a solid plot, decent acting, and wonderful CGI that is not overdone. For you popcorn lovers, this is your ticket. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Same old same old,"This has been billed as a smarter, tighter super hero movie. It's not. It's entertaining, and has all the special effects one takes for granted, but it is still riddled with the same old clichés expected from the genre. I had hoped that the movie would stay more in Afghanistan - anywhere but Calipornia - but it gets bogged down as soon as Iron Man does his one piece of obligatory super hero rescuing the average guys from evildoers, and returns to the usual (yawn) struggle with evil corporate magnates determined to make more money and stoke the ego incarnate.The audience I saw it with clapped and cheered and laughed, and I take it that the average movie goer joe is happy with being treated once again to mindless escapism for the summer. My grandkids liked it, and what else can one ask from Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie!,"Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists.

Perfect Casting/Acting!,"Robert Downey Jr. is perfect! Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect! Terrence Howard is Perfect...and Jeff Bridges is brilliant! -There is something deliciously great and different about seeing The Big Lebowski play Tony Stark's second In Command. Bridges is truly one of the best actors of his generation, and I guess the same thing can be said about Downey Jr:I believe it is important, even essential, to get actors with such comedic talents as Michael Keaton and now Robert Downey Jr. to play these superhero types. It proves for far more interesting watching than an actor who puts his chin out and plays it sooooooo serious all the time. This is a role that perhaps Mel Gibson could have played 20 years ago, but other than him I can't really picture anyone else having pulled it of so efortlessly.The movie is entertaining with blasting action scenes and a director that clearly knows what he's doing, but what struck me the most was the chemistry beetween the leads and how well the dialogue scenes were handled. Gwyneth Paltrow is so real and beautiful in her part and you can feel the relationships between the characters is already built in and feels real.....check it out!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Move Over Superheroes, Iron Man Is Here","Until May 2008, the few releases this year that I've seen ranged from below average to downright rubbish with the exception of two movies. One being 'Iron Man'. This is the movie we have been waiting for this year. So does it match up to expectations? Hell yes! On the surface, 'Iron Man' isn't very different from other superhero films but on the other hand it isn't like any other superhero movie. This one has rich characters, it perfectly blends humour, drama, action and it has heart, all of which are presented on screen in a wonderful way that keeps the viewer staring at the screen right till the end.The writing is great as 'Iron Man' sticks to the main story all the way. I liked how Downey Jr's Tony Stark grows from this carefree business-minded tech-tycoon who's only concern is Stark Industries to a man with a mission to save the world and in the process he still stays the same person as he maintains his sense of humour, his courage and his integrity. The dialogues, especially Starks's one-liners are sharp, witty and funny. This movie is an introduction to the famous title character thus those expecting only action from start to end (like 'Transformers') may be disappointed to an extent. But for me there was enough action along with substance to make it a hugely enjoyable experience.Jon Favreau is proving to be a more versatile director and his impressive filmography, both as actor and director, prove that he's experimented with different kinds of cinema. 'Iron Man' wouldn't have been an easy film to direct but Favreau does a magnificent job. The CGI is excellent as I loved how much attention was given to detail and how the viewer is shown every step of the making of Iron Man. Of course, there's some humour added to lighten up the mood instead of technologically overloading the viewers.'Iron Man' is just the movie that Robert Downey Jr. needed and it couldn't have come at a better time. At a time, when this talented actor's performances were hardly getting enough notice, 'Iron Man' brings him back to recognition. After seeing him, one would conclude that the part was made only for Downey Jr. His dialogue delivery seems so natural that it would be hard to tell whether he was acting, if the scenes were taken out of context. I don't think Gwyneth Paltrow has ever looked better. Though the role does not allow her to really stretch her acting, Potts isn't just a typical superhero's dame. She is Tony's confidant and the one who supports him through thick and thin. Paltrow provides the necessary charisma, sex appeal and soul that makes Pepper Potts shine and she shares a sizzling chemistry with her male lead. Terrence Howard has a smaller role as Tony's good friend but there's a hint that he might have a more prominent role if a sequel is made. Finally, there's Jeff Bridges as the villain. An odd yet brilliant choice as the actor is refreshing and like his costar, he too needed an 'Iron Man' to give his career a boost.I noticed that some people were complaining that Muslims/Middle Easterners were portrayed as bad guys just like in any other American movie but I would like to state that this is no 'Vantage Point'. Here, these people weren't portrayed as terrorists working on their own but as men hired for a specific reason (I won't say more to give away spoilers). So I just thought to briefly clarify that this is no anti-Islamic or anti-anything (except, well okay, anti-weaponry) movie. It's a movie for everyone.Perhaps the story itself isn't anything novel which is what makes it somewhat similar to other superhero movies, but the treatment of it and its execution is quite unique. Add to that a fine cast and dazzling special effects among many things, this is the summer movie experience I've been waiting for in 2008. I wonder what else this summer has to offer as I doubt that it would succeed in providing anything close to the sheer entertainment of 'Iron Man'.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stark reminder of things to come.,"Having powered back through the Avengers films recently, and the ""Spider-man"" MCU series - I asked my son which set of films he'd like to see next and he chose ""Iron Man"". So, one Saturday afternoon we stuck it on and though some of the effects are starting to betray it's age a little - it's still a really solid base upon which the MCU was built.Having been captured by a terrorist organisation, billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) is ordered to create a missile for them, but instead creates a weaponised suit of armour that he uses to escape. Having seen the real usage of his weapons, he decides to withdraw Stark Enterprises from that industry and focuses on refining the suit idea making it one of the most powerful weapons in the world, but one that remains in his hands. These plans do not sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), C. O. O of Stark Enterprises, who looks to remove his protégé from the company, one way or another.Again, it's interesting to see the film again, seeing it as it is now - the first step on a 25 film (so far) odyssey that would take us across the Galaxy and the Multiverse. Tonally, it's pretty much there from the start. Funny, but not a comedy. Honouring the inspirations but not beholden to them. There are so many parts that are already in place; Agent Coulson and SHIELD, Paul Bettany as JARVIS - a throwaway part that could have been played by anybody really - that developed into the Vision Role and Leslie Bibb, who would replay Christine Everhart several times across various aspects of the saga. Even stuff that was clearly a retrofitted, such as Peter Billingsley playing Riva - who would then appear in ""Far from Home"", 11 years later and play off his scene here. Most key though, is the post credits scene, both the concept of them - and the ""I'm putting together a team"" line.What's less consistent ... well, they would recast Rhodey, obviously and Howard Stark as he became a more important character in subsequent films. It's a lot less in terms of consequences, than most films would be about in the future - admittedly, there's keeping a weapon away from a bad guy, which thinking about it does become a staple plot for the MCU - but it's not about saving the world or even America this time. As I said above too, occasionally the CGI is showing it's age a little - with regards interactions between RDJ's fact and the Ironman helmet specifically.Looking back now, is it one of my favourite MCU films? No, not really - but that speaks more to the quality of others than to any failure on behalf of what is a fun, funny and fantastic film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Great entertainment powered by star charisma,"A billionaire weapons engineer builds a flying suit of armour.Iron Man is a highly enjoyable superhero origin movie powered by the charisma of Robert Downey Jr.The plot is a fairly simple redemption story that sees Tony Stark become Iron Man and do battle with villains both abroad and domestic.Special effects and cool technology reigns supreme as we are presented with a multitude of visual and auditory spectacle. The suit feels real and it provides scenes that both thrill and generate humour.There are some nice themes explored around warfare, weapons manufacturing and blood money. The character of Stark really is a good opportunity to address topics like this.Downey is perfectly cast and it's his personality that carries the film and entertains above all. Supporting performances work perfectly, particularly Gwynneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges.The soundtrack acquired for the movie enhances the rock star persona of Stark and probably rejuvenated sales of certain heavy metal albums.Ninety percent of the movie works for me until we get to the final showdown where I found myself somewhat out of the swing of it and at one point became highly aware I was watching two animated robotic characters smashing each other about.The final scene is excellent and a cool subversion of the standard identity cliches usually found in the superhero genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He epitomizes the character beautifully, from the raw charisma to the brilliance of mind to the witty comebacks to the vulnerability of alcoholism. The movie would work just because of him (which the sequels will show), but luckily we get even more for our money. We get special effects that defied all of our expectations, we get a fetching origins story, we get Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Cane (one of his best recent roles) and Gwyneth Paltrow as the perfect Pepper Potts. This is very heavily a character film, which I don't mind at all when the characters are as good as this. Sure there are great action scenes and it's a nice film visually, but it works and it's so good because the characters work off each other so well. You can feel the underlying tension whenever those three share screen time.I could nitpick here and state that perhaps the whole film felt a bit rushed because they had to cram to much material into a single film, or that the final battle could have been slightly better (mostly because of the villainous gloating cliché), but all these minor complaints pale in comparison to the film as a whole. I love this film. It's a brilliant character study, an even more brilliant action film and one of the best superhero movies yet made. See it, love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

interesting,"I am far to be fan of comics. or Marvel universe. and , maybe, for an action film, I prefer Batman more than Ironman who, I admitt, was unknow for me before this film. the only motif to see the film was Robert Downey jr. and it is a serious motif. because, for an outsider, ""Ironman"" is real...cool. for humour, performances, meet between Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey, story, references to many episodes from superheroes adventures and, sure, but less, for CGI effects. it is part of a trend proposing its voice. with succes. and that defines it. so, enjoy it !",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Definitely the hero type.,"Held captive in an Afghan cave, Tony Stark develops and builds a suit, a suit that will change his life forever.Well overall, I thoroughly enjoyed that, it took me a little time, as I found the first half an hour or so pretty slow, but once it gets going, I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie.I have always been a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. And once again he comes up trumps, I appreciated the journey the character went on, he truly does transform as the film develops. Jeff Bridges was great, I thought Paltrow developed well as the film went on.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the acting and the visuals. Of course I liked the touches of humour that Robert Downey Jr. Added.Unlike some of the newer Marvel films I've seen, there seemed to be more focus on the plot and the characters, it wasn't just a special effects parade.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The beginning of a fun adventure...,"Telling the story of Tony Stark, billionaire playboy that goes from selling weapons to becoming a superhero, using an ultra-advanced robotic armor.First of all, a lot of people are calling this the best superhero movie ever made. Those people are idiots. What we have here is a lighter approach to the superhero genre. One might put it next to the Fantastic Four movies, rather than X-Men. And why not? Afterall, it doesn't have racism and prejudice as its underlying theme. It's a simple, light, fun and funny movie. It's so well received and reviewed BECAUSE it's in the FF category. But it's head and shoulders above those movies. The script, though predictable and fairly simplistic, is actually coherent. The movie actually has a director and Downey Jr. delivers a very good performance. Without a doubt, that was pitch-perfect casting.Now, it's only fair to judge Iron Man for what it tries to be - a light action movie. And it accomplishes what it set out to do. Simple origin story and a first adventure. Not as complex and dramatic as Batman Begins, but it does the job. And, like Batman Begins, there's a feeling you just can't shake for the first hour or so - yeah, the movie's good, but you just wanna see the hero in the suit - THE suit. The iconic suit(cape and cowl and, respectively, gold and red). You feel like the movie drags. And it does. The action is sparse, but fairly well done, with the help of some very good visuals. But the funny little lines, the development of the suit, it all keeps you distracted enough until the climax. Then, the action delivers. But still, just like the Fantastic Four movies(particularly the first one), it feels rushed and it lacks that sense of an epic confrontation. But at least he isn't lifting a huge rock into space...So, there's humor, there's action, there's an actual story. It's as good as it gets...for this type of movie. Best superhero movie ever made? Not even close. It doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Batman Begins and X2. But its saving grace is that it doesn't try to. Its strong point is the lightheartedness, its humor - it's the first big blockbuster that made me laugh out loud since Spider-Man 3(the difference being that I was then laughing AT it). It is, however, the best superhero movie since Batman Begins and a fine way to kick off the summer movie season.Let's hope that for the sequels, they keep the direction. I'm not sure that a darker, more serious Iron Man would work as well as this...unless you're turning him into a fascist, as in the comics.In the end, I enjoyed Iron Man. Quite a lot, to be honest. Here's to a great sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"MarvelousOne of the BestStark's Snark, Wonderful Action, a Winner","Marvel Studios Never Looked Back after this Tremendous Artistic and Commercial Success. It's Probably No Surprise that the Comic Book Company Knew just what to do with Their Own Creations. Although, Nothing in the Movie Universe is a Certain Thing, the Studio certainly Worked Wonders with this, one of Their Second String Characters.The Casting is Brilliant with Robert Downey Jr's. Perfect Embodiment of Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and the Rest Contributing to the Fun. The Director, Jon Favreau, was a Risk. Hardly Known for Big-Budget Action Movies, He Captures the Spirit of the Comics and turned in an absolutely Brilliant Film from Top to Bottom.Fans of the Silver-Age Comics will No Doubt be Impressed. When Iron Man First Appeared in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were in the Embryonic Stages of Reinventing Comics and the Marvel Super Hero Line was being Tested and no one At the Time (except maybe the Fans) had a Clue what They were Witnessing.In the Origin of Iron Man and for a while, the Character was this Hulky, Bulky, Tank-Like Hero, in a Clunky Iron Suit. Not the Sleek Hot Rod Red Iron Man to Come Later.In the Film, this Likeness can be Seen in the Opening where Tony Stark Creates the Character ""in a cave with a box of scraps"". This is a Spot-On Recreation from the Comics Origin Issues and it is a Great Insider's Inspiration and a Fine Tribute to the Movie's Paper Origins.This is just one of the Charms about Iron Man, The Movie.

Adequate Cure for Cinematic Anemia,"The crown prince of America's premier weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (a sober Robert Downey Jr.) grows a conscience after being captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and decides to fight for what's right in an innovative piece of body armor technology that will henceforth be known as ""Iron Man"" in Jon Favreau's predictable but fun Marvel comic film adaptation.Wisely abandoning the corny mawkishness of the ""Spiderman"" films and the recent attempt to revive the ""Superman"" franchise, ""Iron Man"" instead offers up some light satire, bright-eyed cynicism, and an attempt at witty banter. The always lovely Gwyneth Paltrow is a delight as Stark's sassy assistant Pepper Potts, and it's nice to see her doing something light and fun for a change. Also part of the off-kilter cast are Terrence Howard as Stark's inexplicable military friend and Jeff Bridges bald and bearded as Stark's mentor (and dun dun dun...enemy?) Downey Jr. apparently ad-libbed much of the dialog, which sometimes falls flat, but for the most part works. It's certainly far more enjoyable than the typical fan-boy in-jokes that plague most comic book movies.Certainly this is no ""Batman Begins"" in terms of depth and scope of drama, but with slam-bang special effects and an effortless feel (despite a slow build up to the action), ""Iron Man"" certainly fits the bill as a better than average comic book/action film. Is it any wonder critics and audiences have embraced it so warmly after suffering through loud obnoxious dreck like ""Transformers?"" While it has been a bit oversold, ""Iron Man"" proves that great special effects can be built around a smart story that doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator. Until ""The Dark Knight"" it will have to cure our cinematic anemia.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Give me a scotch. I'm starving.""","Outstanding movie and possibly the best Marvel's done to date, at least as far as their shared universe films go. Let's cut right to the chase: Robert Downey, Jr. makes this movie work. I'm not going to say he's the perfect Tony Stark because Downey's Stark is really very different from how he has always been in the comics. But it works far better this way and is a huge point in favor of deviating from the source material, which is the eternal struggle between Hollywood and anything it adapts. This is one case where the changes they made worked out great. The rest of the cast is terrific, all following Downey's lead very well. His enthusiastic performance is a joy to watch. I'm sure it must have been a ball for Paltrow, Bridges, and the rest to act with him as they all seem to be having a great time in their scenes together. Jon Favreau does a praiseworthy job of directing, especially when he hadn't really done this type of movie before. The action and special effects are great. The script is smart and funny, though a lot of the humor comes from the ad-libbing of Downey and co-stars, so I'm not sure how much credit I can give the script for that. It's really a wonderful piece of entertainment without being mindless or crude. One of the best superhero films ever made.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Go See this,"This was a great movie. I am a huge Downey fan, but was really unsure about him playing a super hero especially a guy in his 40's. I can say that because I'm right there with him. He was amazing. I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow. She was horrible, it was like she was really trying to play the part, she half-you know. But other than that it was great. Special effects, whoa.Good job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Heavy Metal,"Tony Stark - playboy, technological genius, and CEO of the world's largest defense contractor - is about to have a major change of heart. Inexperienced in the reality of war and arms trading, Stark is about to become a prisoner of of a terror cell in Afghanistan. The experience will change everything for him. To escape, he must exceed his greatest technological achievements, and in so doing, he envisions a new way to live for him and his firm.Iron Man is, far and away, the best film adaptation of a comic book 'origin story' that I have seen adapted to film. Marvel is certainly on a roll at the movies, but the real genius here is not just in the original material. The casting, script and directing make Iron Man a thorough-going success. The film has the pace of a military thriller (though it is more of an action film), the visual appeal of a well-crafted sci-fi spectacular (though it never sacrifices story to spectacle), and an abundance of talent (although star power does not drive this film).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges (Obie Stane) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper) own the screen, and are nicely supported by Terence Howard and a number of talented character actors. Downey is a perfect Tony Stark - flippant, too-smart-for-his-own-good, utterly dedicated and - at times - hilarious. While the film is far from a one-man-show, Downey's performance could have made this a great comics film even without the fine work by the rest of the cast.I was also pleased by the appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the film, and hope that their appearance is a foreshadow of things to come, not just a cameo.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Now THIS is how you start a movie franchise.,"In the last couple of years, comic book based super hero movies have had a mission to accomplish and thats kick starting a franchise.The likes of Fantastic four, batman begins, daredevil and hulk to name a few, were made to be the start of a series. Iron man is no different, but where many of these sorts of films fail, Iron Man succeeds because it not only gets the series started but its a damn good film in its own right.Exciting, funny and well acted, iron man is an all round great effort that sticks surprisingly close to its source material. The high octane sequences where iron man soars through the air and kicks bad guys asses are awesome to watch but thankfully this is a film where things are just as interesting to watch when no one is blowing anything up and its all thanks to the Jon Favreau careful direction. The plot, in which billionaire tony starks turns from brash playboy to amour clad hero, is engaging and enthralling and favreaus eye for great acting ensures some great naturalistic performances.There are two stand out performances, the first and most important being Robert Downey Juniour as Tony Stark. Junior makes this role his own, injecting Tony Stark with a sense of cool, arrogance and an Errol Flynn like swagger that makes him really fun to watch and get behind as a leading man. The second (which surprisingly doesn't get as much praise as Downeys stark) is Jeff Bridges as bad guy Obadiah Stane. Although he could have played the role as a scenery chewing , typical villain, Bridges injects the role with a sense of realism and imposing menace, making for a convincing antagonist.Iron Man is what a marvel comic book movie should be- a mix of great story ,exciting action, and a faithful representation of a classic character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man (2008) is the best original Marvel Action superhero film of all time!,"Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film that I love to death!!! The film has awesome Action sequences, it is Entertaining with full suspense, it is intense and it is fast paced. The film is not boring or lame it is brilliant and awesome. You have to put brain in this film. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man did a wonderful job portraying a comic book superhero. I love the Action sequence, the Drama, the genius and brilliance of Tony how he was so brilliant as to build those missiles for Military but get's caught by the terrorists and he is hold as hostage in the caves of Afghanistan, against his will he has to build more missiles for the terrorist, but he builds for himself a suit and he escapes from the caves, he returns home. Tony shut's down the factory and than he starts building an red yellow armor suit and he turns him self in to a vigilante to an red yellow armored suit ultimate superhero ""Iron Man"". He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him. He finds out he was betrayed by his dad's partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who turns him self into Iron Monger on the end there is an ultimate showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger.Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane did a wonderful job portraying a super villain in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow did a beautiful terrific performance as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant and his love interest. I love this film and is one of my favorite Marvel Superhero action films. Everything in this comic book film is in here. The CGI Iron Man are believable and terrific I have ever seen. They aren't bad, they are good. Jon Favreau did a wonderful and amazing job as directing this film and playing Tony's bodyguard as Harold 'Happy' Hogan the same time, that was amazing!! This film is brilliant I love how it shows Tony's tests scenes when he is building the armor suit, I love how Shows that Tony isn't self selfish centered jerk, he is a good heart person and he wants to do the right thing. To defend an innocent people from his weapons that he build and that his weapons got in to the wrong hands. It is an awesome how he redeem himself and how he had a conscious what was he done when he was building those weapons and how many people had to die.The original film is very good :) One hell of a film. The chemistry between Tony and Pepper is great, this film has a heart. The acting was great and the story was really good! This was definitely one of the best origin stories out there and the ending was fantastic! The fight scenes between Iron Man and Iron Monger was weary intense and awesome kick ass battle between those two super villains and heroes. I went into this film with an open mind and what we got, we got an fantastic comic book film. Paramount pictures sends a strong message to film comic book fans. So Iron Man is one of those movies. Jon Favreau did an amazing job of bring Iron Man to life. He so took the comic and make it look like we just watch this first time. The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy. The rest of the actors did very well, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Palltrow all did an amazing job with their roles.After surviving an unexpected attack in enemy territory, jet-setting industrialist Tony Stark builds a high-tech suit of armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man.

Downey Jr. to the Rescue,"From the minute I saw the trailer back the summer for Iron Man, I was one of the few people that said that it was not going to be a good movie. People kept saying that I was crazy and that Iron Man was going to be the best movie of the summer blah blah blah. Well, I have just got back from seeing Iron Man and I can honestly say that it was better than I expected, but not by much.I believe that mostly everybody knows the story so I will save myself the trouble of giving a plot synopsis. But, in short, Tony Stark (played greatly by Robert Downey Jr.) is captured after being attacked by a group of violent Middle Eastern fighters. When he comes to the realization that the weapons used to capture him and kill the other American soldiers were weapons from his cooperation, he realizes that he has had his eyes closed the entire time and has finally opened them to see the evils behind his family business.Now this is probably the first comic book adaptation to have a very credible cast, and that goes to show that big names don't always make the best movies. The only rightfully cast actor in this entire film is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He plays it as if he is playing himself and fits perfectly into the character of Stark. Terrence Howard is second billed but his character is thrown around and pops up pretty randomly throughout the film. Gwyenth Paltrow is in probably a good 3/4 of the film and is annoying every time she appears on screen. Plus, her name is Pepper Potts. If that were my name, I would probably kill myself. Finally, the worst casting possible, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane, the villain. Not only is his name a killer, but Bridges' acting is some of the worst I have seen in years. He does not fit into the roll at all and the bald cap that is used to try and replicate his character from the comics just makes Bridges look like a fool and he eventually becomes the laughing stock of the entire film. Also, whenever he was on screen about to give a speech I was just waiting for him to say, ""I'm the Dude."" I went to see this film with a group of 15 friends and I can bet you that every single one of those friends came to see Iron Man because they expected an action movie. Well, I can say that about 3 of those 15 said that they enjoyed the film and the remaining 12 complained that there wasn't enough action. Now I am not saying that I am disappointed with the amount of action that is in the film, I am saying that the action that was included in the film was not only dull, but terribly boring. In truth, the best scenes in the film were the cheesy comedic scenes, or the scenes where Stark is testing the parts of his suits. It just goes to show that director Jon Favreau is much better with comedies (Elf, Swingers) since the action in an action-superhero movie was worse than the comedic parts.All in all, Iron Man is not a bad movie but nor is it a good movie. It is just another film; another hugely anticipated popcorn movie that will go on to earn hundreds of millions of dollars. Just like the last Spiderman, 90% of the people that view Iron Man may come out hating it, but this will definitely be one of the highest grossing movies of the year just because of all the publicity and the audience appeal. The film is not nearly as good as Spiderman or Spiderman 2, X-2, or Batman Begins but is definitely better than Hulk and Daredevil. Therefore, that throws Iron Man right into the middle of the Marvel film package, and due to the cliffhanger ending (stay till the end of the credits) there will definitely be an Iron Man 2 on the way. And whether that one proves to be better than this one, that won't truly be saying much.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
more than an action movie,"this is one movie that was way better than i thought it would be.it's not just an action movie.it's also a smart,cleverly written movie,with some great dialogue.it also incorporates real global problems,serving as a sort of commentary on our times.it's not preachy,it just shows how far we've progressed.or maybe regressed as a society.there is also the theme of redemption in the movie.i mentioned the good dialogue.an example of that is the witty banter between Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.)and his assistant Pepper Pots(Gwyneth Paltrow).beyond that though,Stark is generally witty.i liked the origin story of the film,though i can't say whether or not it's accurate to the comic book.naturally,there are some great action sequences,especially the flying scenes and the combat scenes.and that suit is very impressive,both in looks and functionality.as to the cast,Downey is very good as Stark/Iron Man.Paltrow is very likable as Pepper Potts.Terrance Howard is good as Stark's military friend Rhodey,but i feel he was underutilized.oh well,maybe the sequel will rectify that.i heard that Howard is being replaced in the sequel by Don Cheadle.nothing against Cheadle,but i think they ought to stick with Howard,since he originated the character in the film.but the best actor in the bunch,in my opinion is Jeff Bridges,who gives a William Hurt type performance,understated,yet simmering with passion and charisma.that's just my opinion.anyway,,the movie is fun and engaging,but it's no empty headed action movie.not that there's anything wrong with that.no,this is a smart movie with heart and soul.my vote for Iron Man: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Entertaining, but it could have been so much more.","Robert Downey Jr. has deservedly been hailed as the star feature of Iron Man: he brings wit and warmth to the playboy entrepreneur-turned-superhero formula at the heart of this film, which would likely seem tired and clichéd without such a charismatic presence. Downey Jr. plays weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, owner of a vast fortune and an ego to match. After being captured in Afghanistan by a group of terrorists, Stark gets his first inkling of the misuse of the modern weaponry that he has helped to produce. To escape his captors and avenge the wrongdoing that he was witnessed first hand he draws upon his technical prowess and becomes a force for good: Iron Man.The opening scene, in which the Afghan terrorists suddenly seize Stark, is brutal and gripping. The subsequent flashbacks to Stark's nauseatingly opulent lifestyle in America form a startling contrast to the misery and fear of his imprisonment in an Afghan cave fort. The bold decision to set much of the action in the modern-day battleground of Afghanistan shows that director Jon Favreau is willing to engage directly with serious issues arising from modern warfare. It is disappointing that, from this early promise, Iron Man develops as a hit and miss action film that is unable to offer much in the way of meaningful commentary.Stark first appears as Iron Man when he escapes from his imprisonment in the cave and massacres his captors. This is a rudimentary action scene with few surprises. Other action scenes, including the final showdown with an evil Iron Man, have the same dull inevitability about them. It is only in the sequence involving Iron Man and the two jet fighter planes that the CGI and choreography combine to dazzling effect. The humour in this film is similarly patchy. The scene in which Stark's secretary (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) operates on his machine-aided heart is painfully funny. Like most of the humour, this scene owes much of its success to Downey Jr.'s personal charm. Elsewhere, the use of slapstick is far too predictable.Where Iron Man really falls down, however, is in the decision to dabble with serious issues such as terrorism and the arms trade whilst failing to offer any real insights. The Afghan enemies develop into hackneyed villains along the lines of the Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Jeff Bridges gives a darkly menacing performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's crooked business partner, but is forced to chew his way through some clumsy lines, especially during their final confrontation. Iron Man, a film with some very strong elements, falls short in the effort to mix action, comedy and current affairs. This is an entertaining film but could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"supreme comic-book entertainment; it's also more jaded, and funnier, than most in its genre","Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark's as a character not exactly the usual 'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I'm almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don't identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it's pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he'll come and wipe em out in a jiffy.In this sense it's pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we're already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he's that damn good.It's a thrill-ride, and it's very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It's genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast.You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can't do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it's a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He's able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he's playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn't work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it's due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark's technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where'd she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it's certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it's a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn't tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched 'test' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau's is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you're geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you'll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The story of Steve Jobs versus Bill Gates?; no, Tony Stark vs. Obadiah Stane or really Iron Man vs bald Jeff Bridges with facial hair cut in menacing way not like he had it in The Big Lebowski. Without short-changing the movie, that pretty much wraps up the plot and it doesn?t even take that much of Iron Man to dispense with Iron Man-wannabee. There was an attempt at building a morale to the story but I think it was something like weapons are bad and super-weapons are like?worse.? The real draw here is to see Robert Downey, jr. as a superhero. As daft as that concept sounded before I saw the film, Downey is Iron Man or rather Tony Stark: drunk, overindulged, immature and following in his father?s footsteps. As someone I discussed the movie with said: ?it takes a wealthy cocaine addled playboy to really capture a wealthy, alcoholic playboy?. Jeff Bridges is also not who you would think of as super-villain material but apparently he can play anything well. Seriously, when the last thing you say him in when he wasn?t believable? In short, this was an entertaining way to kill off two hours on a Friday night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A steaming pile of CGI garbage.,"Featuring the very latest in computer generated effects and a plot that would insult a retarded six year old, Ironman is the latest in a long line of Hollywood product culled from the dizzying literary heights of superhero comic books.Product this disposable doesn't happen by accident. Teams of industry product makers work around the clock for years to make something this tasteless, tedious and utterly bland. Don't even try to characterize this product as a ""movie."" It simply isn't.If Ironman was edible, it would be a jar of baby food. Library paste flavored baby food. If it were music, it would be chopsticks. If it were a vehicle, it would be a tricycle. A tricycle with training wheels. If it were...What? Oh yeah, the product. It's something about the usual gazillionaire playboy who flies around in a sooper-dooper extra-gadgety metal suit and frees Afghanistan from the Evil Brown People, making the country safe for, I dunno, oil companies I guess. The plot is such a pile of moronic sub-juvenile drivel it's impossible to focus on for more than a few minutes before being distracted by something more interesting like, say, the butter-flavored grease stains on the bottom of your popcorn bag.Contempt for it's audience drips from every frame of this product. No doubt the droolcase fanboy target audience will be thrilled to down to their Batman Under-Roos by Downey's lackluster performance as he sleepwalks through the product's repulsive hero role. The product is certainly simple enough for people who regard Cheetos as food group and think repetitively boring video games are the apex of computer technology.But aside from it's pimply focus group, the only other audiences to which this product could possibly appeal would be coma patients and Scientologists.

An Amazing Movie in all respects....Movie and Comic wise!,"This Film is Easily the best Comic to film adaptation there is period. The Acting is great and Downy Jr. is perfect for the role of Tony Stark. The CGI is the best I have seen and rivals Transformers, and thats an achievement in itself. The story is well put and the mixture of humor, action, and a little drama is just epic.I have been a Iron-man fan boy for 10 years now and Im very pleased to say this movie does everything right. If you didn't enjoy this movie, you are not paying enough attention. It defeats the X-men, Ghost Rider, Fantastic four, Bat-man, and all other Super hero based movies with ease.I recommend this film to the highest degree and its a must see.

Great movie,"After watching the overblown Spider-Man 3 last year; and the special effects driven Transformers, I was beginning to think that Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent comic book movie anymore. Then Jon Favreau directed Iron Man. The first thing that he does right is casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He brings a presence to the character that only he could and has the greatest one-liners that would even put Spider-Man to shame. Jeff Bridges, Terrance Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are also great in their supporting roles. I loved the banter between Pepper and Stark. However, some fans may be disappointed by the lack of CGI and action scenes but I think it works for the better. It's grounded in reality and unlike Transformers, this film has realistic special effects and the CGI seamlessly blends in with all of the practical effects; most notably the Iron Man suit. And after watching Stark tinker around with his first two prototypes (watching the scene in which he tries to fly is priceless), it's a real payoff when after an hour we finally get to see him in action. This makes more sense than other comic book adaptations because we get to see the suit in three different stages. And besides all the action it's the most fun I've ever had watching a movie. There are so many scenes that end with a punch you won't regret watching this with a large audience. Not to mention that it ends on a great note. Also, comic book fans will dig the hints at a sequel and especially the post credit scene. Fans in our theater went crazy. (I won't spoil it for you.) Bottom line, Iron Man Delivers what a good comic book film should. It may not have the brooding darkness of Batman Begins, or the over the top special effects of Transformers, but it's a fun movie that has a terrific blend of humor, a great story, and not to mention some kick-ass action to go along with it. In the end my score is 8.5/10 ""B""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not As Great As I Remember, But Still Fun.","Robert Downey Jr. is good in this, but I kind of forgot how good Jeff Bridges' performance was. You can really tell he's an experienced actor.

Iron Man,"Review By Kamal KIron Man, one of the most important movies of its kind. When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was. A B-list superhero played by a washed-up actor being produced by a barebones studio? Are you nuts? And then we were all surprised to see how great it was.It's thanks in large part to Robert Downey Jr. He really is Iron Man. He manages to give that real sense of a ""genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" It's hard to imagine anybody else playing Tony Stark this far along in the franchise's lifespan.This movie was most people's entry point into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Having only recently re-watched it, I still can't believe how small it was at this point. Nowadays we see aliens, talking raccoons, and sentient trees, but Iron Man has a realism to it that keeps it grounded while still being comic-booky.Twelve years after its release, the special effects still manage to hold up. The Iron Man suit's CGI still looks as real as possible, and it would still be in the same elite company as movies like Thor: Ragnarok or Ant-Man.Again, this is a movie that really shouldn't have worked so well, but I'll be damned if Jon Favreau and Kevin Feige didn't pull it off. It's a movie that I'll return to for years to come, if for no reason other than to marvel (heh) at how much Tony Stark has grown up since. Can't wait for new fans to experience this movie as well as the rest of the MCU.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A strong start to the Marvel universe,"""Iron Man,"" directed by Jon Favreau, marks the exhilarating debut of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Robert Downey Jr. Stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant, charismatic billionaire and weapons manufacturer whose life takes a dramatic turn after being captured by terrorists. Forced to build a devastating weapon, Stark instead creates a high-tech suit of armor to escape, setting him on a path to becoming the armored superhero, Iron Man.Downey Jr.'s performance is magnetic, infusing Stark with wit, charm, and vulnerability. His portrayal sets the tone for the entire MCU, making Iron Man an instantly iconic character. The film blends action, humor, and character development seamlessly, ensuring it remains engaging throughout.The visual effects are impressive, bringing Stark's innovative suits to life with a perfect blend of realism and spectacle. Jeff Bridges delivers a solid performance as the antagonist, though the final showdown may feel a bit predictable.Overall, ""Iron Man"" is a thrilling and entertaining origin story that effectively sets the stage for future Marvel adventures, balancing heart and humor in a way that appeals to both longtime fans and newcomers alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good,"Iron Man (2008)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
the way action movies should be done,"Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age). A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion. He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a ""merchant of death,"" but he balks at being called ""the Da Vinci of our time""). Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity. Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and vanquishing the wrongdoers.""Iron Man"" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards. But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time. He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made ""Iron Man"" what it is without him. Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory. These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen. James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie. It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film. And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be. It's nice to see that somebody finally got things right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Iron man!,"The movie does live up to my expectation. Iron man is one of the best movie in 2008. It is good to see some rising star such as director Jon Favreau, who directed Elf and Zathura and acted as the sidekick of Matt Murdock in Daredevil, now directs a big marvel movie and I am glad that he manages it well. The acting is good, CGI is good too and there are couples of intense scenes. Not much of a disappointment. Even the few action scenes are managed well so as we would not feel bored or felt that its CGI make up for the few action scenes.The story: Tony stark is rich, a Playboy and a genius. He is having his perfect life until when a group of terrorists captures him and force him to make a powerful weapon they want. Shortly, Tony decides to build an amour to protect him while escaping. He escapes, he decides to upgrade the amour and uses it to protect people. Robert Downey Jr is a good choice to play Tony Stark. While all the others are good too. CGI is amazing, it makes Iron man flexible. It is one of the most intense marvel movie I saw and that is what that makes it good, awesome. There is pretty much humour too even when fighting.Overall: As I says, Iron man is one of the most intense marvel comic movie I ever saw, it is worth watching it in cinema. The CGI and the battle scenes are worth it and it makes up for the few action scenes. The story is intense. It should be the 1st at box office and will. This will leave you craving for more, it feels quite short although it is 2 hours and will want Iron man 2. This will be added to my best movies which includes Transformers. Now CGI is really realistic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man strikes Gold,"I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy.

Iron Man Burns Bright In Red & Gold!,"Marking the commencement of Marvel Cinematic Universe, catapulting Robert Downey Jr. into the league of Hollywood's biggest stars & also announcing the arrival of Marvel Studios into motion picture filmmaking for it is their first fully-financed project, Iron Man not only succeeds as a quality blend of style & substance but is also amongst the best origin stories cinema has come up with for a comic book superhero.Iron Man tells the story of genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist Tony Stark who, while on his tour to war-torn Afghanistan for the demonstration of his new weaponry to United States military, is ambushed & taken hostage by a terrorist group. Working with another captive, he designs an exoskeleton to get out from there & after returning to US further refines his design. The plot covers the change his captivity brings in his entire personality.Stylishly directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man aims for the same grounded approach Nolan applied in Batman Begins & succeeds amazingly well for the most part. The screenplay is brimming with energy, wit & charm, and is brilliantly written & narrated. Production design provides it a very modern feel, Camera-work is vibrantly carried out, Editing briskly paces the whole story which also benefits from Ramin Djawadi's fitting score as well as clever use of existing songs.Coming to the acting department, Iron Man features a star-studded cast in Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard but the film belongs to Downey Jr. who blazes brightly in red n gold with a performance that's absolutely fantastic, effortlessly charismatic & downright polished. Overshadowing the input of the rest & fitting the suit perfectly, this is one role that couldn't have gone to a better actor & how this gifted talent renders Tony Stark on screen is a further proof of that.On an overall scale, Iron Man has enough power in it to please both fans of the comics as well as newcomers. Sure its third act isn't as impressive as the first two but the positives eclipse the negatives by a huge margin. Balancing its storytelling aspects with big budget extravaganza to triumph as a work of quality in the eyes of viewers n critics alike, Iron Man is a highly refreshing, wildly entertaining & largely satisfying crowd-pleaser that's hugely responsible for the foundation on which Marvel Studios stands today. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
VERY well done!   This is even GRITTY!  Wow!,"I have to ask ... Who better to play a middle-aged, wrung-out, loser than Robert Downey, Jr.? I say that with the utmost fondness, however, as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid, and I've never minded Robert Downey, Jr. as an actor. But in this role, he seems to have found his niche. I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride.Going back to the origins, as in ""Batman Begins,"" and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines (Check out upcoming X-Men ""Origins"" movies, ""Wolverine,"" and ""Magneto.""), seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise, or breathing new life into a dead one. It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman, and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time, even though IronMan is a ""lesser"" character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time. I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film.Downey really seems to connect with this character, and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts. Yes, she's sexy, too, but she's FUNNY and so is Downey. I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human. You get Tony Stark, warts and all, and Downey plays him that way. He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role.All in all? It may be a little too risquÃ© (in places) and violent (in others) for the kiddies, but the rest of humanity should LOVE it. It is gritty and holds some thread of reality, which weaves itself throughout, although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid. It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic. Still awesome, though.And the toys ... there are loads of gadgets, toys, and comfortably spun one-liners. This is a story-driven, blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had, although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick! It features a slick production style, top notch film quality, and a superb screen play. This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new (and great) franchise, and I certainly hope it will not be the last. Indeed, there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel.

Great start to the MCU,"Iron Man is a great film, and you can see why the MCU grew so big by starting with a project as good as this one.

Watching this now, you can't help but think that the MCU has forgotten some of what built them into the brand they are today.

You'll believe a man can fly!,"After seeing the first 'Iron Man' again recently, I can't believe how far the MCU has strayed from this. The one that started it all, and it is hard to believe it takes place in the same universe as other Marvel movies - such as Guardians of The Galaxy.Although 'Iron Man' definitely has its fantastic elements, it is all grounded into a deep level of realness. And in keeping it real lies the refreshing bit. The realness makes the funny more funny, the amazing more amazing, and the emotional more emotional. And due to how much the movie is grounded in reality, you'll believe a man can fly.Arms-manufacturer Tony Stark is captured by terrorists, who appear to own several of his creations. After his escape, Stark turns a new leaf, shutting down the weapons department of his company. Instead of building weapons of destruction, he becomes a vigilant knight in shiny armor (with lasers and repulsors).All in all, it is a very good origins story. The acting by Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Palthrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges is outstanding - the witty dialogue alone makes for a good movie.Not only is 'Iron Man' the start of an Iron Man franchise, it is also the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie brings up a lot of key elements for the later to appear Avengers movie: Enter Iron Man. Enter the Arc Reactor. Enter Agent Coulson. Enter S.H.I.E.L.D.

Iron Giant,"Based on the iconic comic book character, 'Iron Man' follows a weapons engineer who manufactures a flying armor suit and has to stop those interested in copying the suit for their own evil purposes. Robert Downey Jr. is well cast as the arrogant, wise-cracking protagonist. Shot down in the Middle East, his shock and utter disbelief over his weapons being sold on the black market, causing more harm than good, never quite rings true. His naivety does, however, allow for a solid character progression as he goes from only caring about how much money his company makes to genuinely caring about how his weapons are used. The film spends a refreshingly large amount of time on Downey's back- story too; there are only scattered action scenes during the first half of the movie as the focus is always making Downey's flawed character likable before he turns superhero. The other characters are sadly less interesting. Unrecognisable at first with one zany hairdo, Jeff Bridges has some fun bits, but the likes of Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow are given little to do; the film also keeps going back and forth on the possibility of Paltrow as a love interest for Downey. Between the film's robot butler, the in-depth character back-story and Downey's charisma, 'Iron Man' has a lot going in its favour, but whether it is truly one of the better superhero movies out there is debatable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

If you don't like the US external politic in the past few years it is better not to see the movie. Iron Man becomes a tool of the powerful administration. Pretty bad! To recap, the special effects are interesting and well build, the acting is good (Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey Jr are fantastic in general, but here I consider that they are on average; sometimes Robert seems not to be Robert), and, again I have to say, the story is straightforward. I didn't feel any emotion seeing this movie, and the same political US messages (I think the whole world had enough in the past few years) are everywhere (especially in the beginning of the movie; that turned me off).Of course, the movie is for a mature category because the teenagers will not go deeper into the details.

Tony Stark.,"Iron Man is a Marvel Film that is better than many other Marvel Films that I have seen recently.Tony Stark is kidnapped while he is over seas demonstrating some new weapons for the military. Once captured, he is forced to build a bomb but instead he builds a suit that he uses to escape from his kidnappers. As he returns home Stark decides that he must stop his company from manufacturing weapons and also begins to build a new suit that he can use to fight against evil.A major strength to this film is a strong lead character who plays the role greatly. In Spiderman I felt that they could have chosen a better actor to play Spiderman but I think that Robert Downey Jr. is great at portraying Tony Stark. Stark comes off as intelligent, funny, and in complete control in this film. Downey Jr. was a great choice as Iron Man and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel.The Iron Man suit in this film is awesome. The effects are phenomenal and outstanding at the same time. Especially the scenes where Iron Man is flying around. This really is some of the best special effects that I have seen in a film and it makes every scene involving Iron Man marvelous.I think the story is good as well. It is not too complex like another super hero film that came out the same summer. (Dark Knight) THe story picks up right away and the main conflict is upon the audience very soon. Also I like how you do not go through all of Tony Starks life and how he is given a brief back story at the beginning. This helps the story to get going.A few minor problems. For one, you really have to wait a while before Stark makes the real Iron Man suit. However I do understand that this is the film where they needed to show how the suit gets built and so on. You just have to wait a while to see Stark in the final awesome looking suit.Also I think Iron Man could have been in it a little more. It is cool seeing Tony Stark a lot, but it would have been nice to see him in the Iron Man costume more.The action is good in this film, but nothing too special. The final battle at the end is OK, but it left something to be desired.Also the supporting cast was nothing special. TOny Stark was awesome but the rest of the cast was OK. I can see why a lot of the cast is going to be changed for the next film. Sorry Terrance Howard.So this film is a lot better than the Fantastic Four films, X men films, and the Hulk FIlms.

RDJ nails it, He is Tony Stark. Jon Favreau did a great job with the writing. He is really good at making lovable characters. The dialogues, The One liners, The Action are great. This movie had a great origin story. Iron Man was a really good entertaining, enjoyable, watchable, fun, fantastic, popcorn movie. I could watch this movie a million times and never get bored. The acting, the writing, the humor works perfectly. It's always fun to watch Tony Stark build a suit out of scraps. Overall I give Iron Man an 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

T was a great start for MCU,"Good writing, good action, excellent cast, nice epic, probably the most charming villain among the all comic book movies. That's a pity that the actor who plays Rhodey, Terrence Howard, was replaced, he looked much more natural in this role than Don Cheadle, just as always money decides everything. Marvel & RDJ should be ashamed of their decision. Probably the best Marvel Movie, far better than the Avengers, this movie has much more of it's own originality, charm.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert Downey Jr. was perfect for this movie,"Bringing another Marvel Comics hero to the big screen, IRON MAN begins as brilliant billionaire industrialist/inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is abducted during a weapons demonstration tour in Afghanistan. Grievously wounded by the very weapons his company manufactures, Stark is forced by his terrorist captors to build a missile; instead, he designs a high-tech suit of armor to make his escape. Returning to America, he wonders how the bad guys got hold of his company's products and vows to set things right with the help of a rebuilt, stylish new iteration of the powered exoskeleton that made his escape possible.Robert Downey Jr. Was perfect for this movie. He has shaped the character in a very good way. You will love his acting skills and his character Tony Stark. The transition from Tony Stark to superhero is great. He first found a friend after being captured by a group of terrorists. He made iron suits to fight the bad guys. The romance between Tony and Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts was fascinating. There was an Arc Reactor that was Tony's artificial heart in the movie. This is one of the most important symbols of MCU. Marvel tried to give the audience suspense which was one of the best things about the movie about the villain character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
People Said Otherwise But I Got What I Expected,Iron Man was not the revolutionary movie comic book movie people were claiming it to be. In fact it was a rather disappointing film. I thought it was corny and even more backwards for the state of comic book movies than anything else.The acting was good when it came to Robert Downey Jr. He was the only reason I had any respect for this film at all. It lifted the movie up from garbage to mediocrity. Terrence Howard who I am not fan of was very annoying to me and Jeff Bridges was about as under utilized with his abilities as he has ever been.The directing was below average in that the action seems were un-satisfying and the film failed to engross me whatsoever. I tried very hard to get involved in the movie but the movie just felt like it was dragging on and it only got worse. The conclusion was bad and the supposed great writing was non-existent in my mind. The effects were very good but I was not put into awe by them.I obviously did not enjoy this film but if you are a die hard comic book fan you probably will enjoy this. If you are a movie fan though and are looking for something different in a comic book movie watch The Dark Knight not Iron Man.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man more than a decade later is still unbelievable!,"After rewatching This movie for what felt like the millionth time, I thoroughly enjoyed it even more than the last time I watched it. Iron Man is an instant classic and helped pave the way for many other amazing MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies to come later. If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy superhero movies seriously just watch it. The plot is fantastic and extremely interesting. Everything just feels right at home. The casting gets it just right especially with Robert Downey JR as Iron Man and Gywneth Paltrow as Pepper. I can imagine no two people to play the roles better. This movie is a blast even after 13 years!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
heavy metal,"Tony Stark is our man to the core. Just think, a multimillionaire and a brilliant inventor - there are a dime a dozen such heroes today. No, the main thing is that he is a womanizer and a drinker. In addition, he is absolutely not tormented by remorse about the means of mass destruction produced by his company.More precisely, it was so until Tony was captured by the evil dushmans, where he saw that his weapons, created to arm the American army, were being used very much against it. Fortunately, the bad Afghans underestimated the genius of our hero and allowed him to quietly assemble armored robotic armor of the MARK-1 type, thanks to which he showed the brats the uniform of Kuzkin's mother. That's how Iron Man appeared.And you can love him already at least for the fact that he is, in fact, to blame for the emergence of his superhero essence. No one killed his relatives, no mutated arthropods bit him either. He became what he became by reaping the fruits of his labors. Well, I just wanted to live, of course.The main success of the film adaptation was, of course, Robert Downey Jr. In the title role. It is clear why the role sits on him like a cast - the actor played almost himself, because in his youth he had a long pernicious affair with alcohol and drugs, but eventually broke himself and went on the right path. Recently, you can see more and more works of this magnificent actor; Tony Stark, of course, is not the best, but definitely one of them.Gwyneth Paltrow plays furniture. Drop the snide grins, and think about it properly: the Oscar winner plays furniture. They say she agreed solely because of the opportunity to work with Downey Jr. And, it should be noted, Pepper Potts in her performance is simply charming at times. Such an assistant is the cherished dream of many men, undoubtedly.You can also add a good script to the asset of the tape, evenly placing accents on different components of the story and not focusing on one thing. The energetic direction of Jon Favreau, which allowed you to never get bored for two hours. And, especially, a dashing soundtrack to match the whole action. It's a pity that ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" from the Filter team did not migrate from the teaser to the final version, but earlier I would not have been able to believe in the existence of a big-budget Hollywood movie in our time that would start with AC/DC and end with Black Sabbath.And about the effects, or what... and what kind of blockbuster is this - and without special effects? For the most part, everything is fine with them, but when Iron throws people in different directions, flying bodies with their unnatural animation give out the computer essence of themselves. But really something, and the suit itself came out just for a sight.And what do we have in the end? This movie doesn't have a maniacally reflective protagonist. And there is no throwaway pathos either. The main villain does not seem to have the idea of fixing the enslavement of humanity, and his opponent, in principle, does not keep in mind the desire to save the world from another universal evil. Everyone has their own small local tasks.That's why the film is very lightweight, it does not load the viewer's brains beyond measure, it is almost perfectly balanced. He, the Christmas trees are green, is just interesting in all its aspects. Yes, the movie came out a little loose, all its components seem to stick together, but if you remove, for example, humor, everything will instantly fall apart. However, this is exactly what makes the ""Iron Man"" a kind of charming dolt, spitting on generally accepted norms, but immediately endearing the viewer to himself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Find the Man in the Iron,"Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN (2008)I'm not a fan of superhero-origin stories, but with the original Iron Man, I never felt like the filmmakers woke up and said ""Let's Make a Superhero movie!"" What the film implies the director and stars felt like when they started each day of filming is ""Let's make the best movie we can make."" Iron Man doesn't meander in scenes that are purely self-serving to remind everyone we're watching a superhero movie. Though it has its comic-booky undertones, Iron Man instead is an impacting, polished, and enthralling film about a man who finds redemption in an unconventional way. It's not about the ""superhero"", it's about the process of becoming a hero. It's enjoyable spectacle, but also has a lot to offer its genre intellectually and creatively. Iron Man fits together as tightly as Gwyneth Paltrow's calves and is as clever as Downey's comebacks. While never feeling established as a genre picture, it fulfills every expectation you could have going in.Rating: 8/10Grade: A-I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast.Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Generic but enjoyable,"Iron Man is the first film of what is now widely known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is action-packed, humorous but solidified the aspects of what would quickly be framed as the ""generic comic-book film"" - with an antagonist that parallels the main protagonist, but is significantly less interesting and developed, a three act structure that ends with a big CGI battle, comedy inserted into inappropriate moments, and a surface level commentary of society, and a lack of any real diversity.Tony Stark is the best part of the film, all thanks to Robert Downey Junior's insatiable charisma, thus in spite of Tony being a largely unlikeable character, Robert's ooze of charm makes it difficult not to like him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Just a Nice Movie,"I've watched it around three times and it has always impacted me in the same way. The idea of an iron-made suit is not that far from reality which makes the movie a bit more interesting.

Truly a Blockbuster,"Man! I don't believe it's too overrated but still...OK we start the movie with Tony Stark, a multimillionaire playboy, alcoholic, weapon making genius. He's not carrying what happens until something comes about that changes his mind and makes him make a super suite to combat world terror. Thus Iron Man was born.This is yet another great action film with predictable plot and a big fight at the end. Comic book fans will like this movie as it is fairly accurate to the story of Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent with the part of Tony Stark I doubt it could have been played better. The only downer of this movie is the fact that it's still just another blockbuster with predictable plot but I'm fine for more of the same but it won't get above an 8 no matter how cool it looks or is acted out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This movie has it all...,"The trailer seemed to me quite stupid but I thought that it had to be some sort of a joke and that maybe there was some interesting message underneath the machismo and war mongering talk. How wrong I was...I am sure that other have pointed out how pathetic this movie was. I know its a waste of time, but let me re-iterate...You rarely see such a sexist, racist, and war glorifying movie. Only something like Transformers can compete with this.This movie is yet another enrolment advertisement for the military! Sure, don't we all know that the American military would never sacrifice innocent lives (if used as human shields) or develop weapons that violate human rights? Not even Disney is that dumb!Why does it glorify war? Again, because it makes it so easy to hate the enemy. Everything is black and white. With me or against me. The dichotomy of the simpleton. As if things were so simple. The audience cheered in the cinema as Iron man smashed people to a pulp. Killing was fun!Do I need to mention that Iron man conforms to what has become a stereotype of American movies? The typical Bronson, Rambo, Eastwood, Willis... (could go on forever!) paranoia and vigilante attitude are an integral part of this movie.Beside being racist (I will not go into this), the movie is sexist. Sure, its not the worst case I have seen, pretty tame and mainstream, I would say. Isn't this just a reflection of the world today? Makes one wonder. Is it what the male mentality dreams of? I am sure that all men want to believe that pretty girls underneath the pretence of being journalists, stewardess', secretaries, and so on, really are nothing but prostitutes that want to jump in bed with a cool guy at the first opportunity. Shouldn't the movie be commended for exposing this problem in society? Yes, if it wasn't for the fact that again it is glorifying the idea of women as sexual objects. It's cool to behave like Tony Stark (and of course, the journalist that behaves like him, is actually ""trash"" to be taken out). We don't even notice or question this kind of portrayal anymore. We have been desensitised by constant bombardment. Should we then be surprised that a multinational company like Tesco was selling pole-dancing kits on the toys and games section of its website?Just a thought. I would have no problem if the richest woman in the world, say JK Rowling, behaved like a nymphomaniac. At least I would be sure she had a choice in the matter. But of course this does not happen in the movie. It's absolute power versus menial workers (BTW even his secretary Pepper Potts, which appears to retain some dignity, takes out the trash for him).Surely it has a deep important message to tell that only a few enlightened viewers might have noticed. Doesn't it feel good, in this era of nonosecond attention span, to be able to pick this deeply encoded message? (Not always so subtle. For example, the label ""Stark Industries"" appeared in gigantic letters clearly visible from satellites in orbit on all weapons terrorists were using).The veiled message of criticism of technology is actually overwhelmed by its glorification. It's through technology that Stark triumphs in the end. And he is so cool with those jet booths, isn't he? Not to mention the way in which he blasts away enemies. It's again what you have and not what you are that matters. Weak people require a lot of gadgets, we know that. That is why kids want mobiles, ipods, computer games, and so on. They are the weakest, they need to conform. They crumble under peer pressure. Unfortunately many grown-ups still behave like that. They cannot ask the simple question what do I need this junk for? To impress people? Sorry got carried away...To summarise, this movie has all the simple minded really needs to be happy. The cool people, the killing, the sex, and the toys. The plot is never in the way and everything is clear and simple (military good, industrialist bad, women...). No need to think, just enjoy the ride!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man (8.2),"I cannot complain about their first hour, Jon Favreau next to an inspired Robert Downey Jr. they adapt the origin of the superhero very well alternating the spectacular effects with an incomparable sense of humor. However it is deflated a little at the end when the plot becomes serious and he/she plays to conclude with the infaltable it fights final. It is almost the same case that the first delivery of Spiderman where the mejorcito happened when the hero didn't dress the suit. Robert Downey Jr, their character builds to the perfection, I cannot imagine a more appropriate actor to interpret Tony Stark. The rest of the allotment is very correct although to Terrence he lacked Howard a little more than presence (that am sure it will be compensated in his more than probable sequel). That more Stan's cameo Lee and the music of AC/DC and Black Sabbath ends up transforming it into one of the best adaptations that the Marvel has carried out (and the fans already needed it after “Spidey 3” and “Ghost Rider”).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The correct way to build a universe,"Anyone remember the days when Marvel studios wasn't a mammoth technical market and didn't feature Norse gods and talking raccoons? I figured that because i am finally going to see my most anticipated film ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" tonight i would revisit the very start of the Marvel cinematic Universe and get to know Tony Stark all over again. This film really stood out to me back in 2008 as one of the best films i'd seen, not just in the superhero genre but in general. To this day the film still stands out to me as the best standalone film and the perfect way to start the universe we have all grown to love. Iron Man was very much more grounded in reality, i mean sure none of the things that Stark creates and uses can be replicated, but at the time going from this to Thor seemed like it wasn't possible. Oh, how times change.The plot follows Tony Stark, who as you all know by now is played with absolute perfection and flawlessness (is that a word) by the very talented Robert Downey Jr. He is given an electromagnet to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him from what was an explosion by his own company's weapon. Instead of building a missile that terrorists demand from him Tony builds an arc reactor and a suit of armour that he uses to get his own back. This causes Stark to order all weapons stop being made and he develops a high-tech suit to use and becomes the hero we all love, Iron Man. Jeff Bridges is also very good and uses an accent that isn't Texan cowboy with throat cancer as Obadiah Stane (Iron Monger) who has his own plans for Stark Industries and the final showdown between Iron Man and Iron Monger gives us what is one of the most spectacular from phase one. Marvel has never had a strong point for villains, Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy is a prime example. But when they get a villain right they get it very right! (Think Loki) and Obadiah Stane in this movie is one of the best the MCU has to offer.Watching Gwyneth Paltrow in this movie felt weird too. She was very much just Tony's assistant and acted a lot differently to the way she does in say, Iron Man 3. This is some really good development for her character and she of course does a great job as Pepper Potts. We also have Terrence Howard as James Rhodes which looking at it now felt out of place since we have all gotten used to Don Cheadele. This isn't to say he did a bad job, in fact he did a very good job but it would be nice to know why he didn't appear in any subsequent films after this. A particular scene featured Rhodes looking at Tony's Mark II suit (War Machine prototype) and saying ""next time, baby"". Sorry Terrence, not next time.In the end Iron Man is absolutely the best way to kick off a universe of characters and he will always be the Avenger that sticks with me as a result of this movie. Downey Jr. Made the character his very own and i cannot imagine another actor taking his place. Robert is Iron Man and is the best casting since Hugh Jackman as WolverineI give Iron Man a perfect rating as it is a film that i have grown to love more since i first saw it and it will be a part of my collection until the very end. Definitely check it out if you haven't already. Plus we got our first scenes with Coulson and our first post-credits scene which is still the best one today. All this and more, it not only stands as one of my favourite superhero movies but one of the best of all time. I will be reviewing Tony Stark's latest adventure with Avengers Age of Ultron tonight so stay tuned for that! And yes.. i am so excited that if i wait any longer i will self destruct.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The one that started it all,"Iron man begins the mcu with a huge bang. Even if the villain Obadiah stane is a little weak (although the iron monger suit is cool and Jeff bridges is great in the role), the movie easily makes up for that with impressive effects, great comedy, awesome action scenes, great character work with tony stark, and good performances (gwenyth Paltrow and Shaun Toub were standouts). But what makes this film great is Robert Downey Jr who absolutely nails tony stark (not only making him funny and likable but also showing the nice side in tony). A great way to begin the biggest franchise ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best superhero film of all time?,"Iron Man stands in my mind as the greatest super hero film released thus far. With a phenomenal mix of fantastic acting, near-perfect special effects, humor, and story, this film simultaneously gave me hope that future Marvel movies might actually be good, and brought the wonderful Robert Downey, Jr. back into the limelight.As a character, the protagonist, Tony Stark, is in every way the perfect vehicle for Downey, Jr. as he assuredly inhabits the role and plays it out to its limit. Pushing social boundaries at every turn, Stark is a chauvinistic, rich, pompous ass of a man. However, unlike his would-be DC counterpart in The Dark Knight, he is actually more entertaining to watch in many respects than his superhero alter ego.Stark manages to be both funny and endearing throughout the film- a brilliantly written script from Fergus, Ostby*, Marcum, and Holloway makes every scene both witty and often-times hilarious, without being overly campy. I found myself eagerly awaiting Downey, Jr.'s next impeccably delivered line as much as I looked forward to seeing the suit.An all-star cast play their respective parts well, with solid performances from both Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow, even if Bridges and Howard were a bit under-utilized. In addition, the special effects are top-notch, realistic, and compliment instead of impede character development.I also enjoyed the fact that this movie also adhered pretty closely, if not entirely, to the comic universe while updating it to a more contemporary setting. At the very least, they captured the essence of major Marvel superhero and made him appeal to the general public. Additionally, in a nice little tribute to avid readers, Iron Monger is portrayed in this film as the main antagonist.Unfortunately, I would say where Iron Man trips up the most is towards the end. The climax of the film, though mostly satisfying, leaves something to be desired. This is because prior to this action sequence, there are brilliant set pieces that are used in other battles, and the final fight doesn't match up quite as well as one might hope. However, the scope of the action in a film matters significantly less than the emotional meaning and story behind what's going on, and in this respect scene succeeds.And finally, following that, the last few moments of the movie last wraps up the movie beautifully and leaves us wanting more... unlike a movie starring a certain Caped Crusader.All in all, it's a wild ride from start to finish that is worth seeing again and again. This movie isn't just good as fan-fodder- it's a good movie, period.Verdict: Movie WinIMDb Score: 100%~ Søren*Fergus and Ostby were also the scribes for the excellent sci-fi film Children of Men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony Stark Soars: A Solid Start to the MCU,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Iron Man. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 14, 2008. It has a runtime of 2 hours and 6 minutes. Iron Man was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Jon Favreau and was created by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway.Summary: Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire inventor and CEO of Stark Industries. After being captured by terrorists during a weapons demonstration, Stark undergoes a profound transformation. Using his ingenuity, he constructs an advanced suit of Armor to escape captivity.Review: -I want to begin by admitting that I have very little knowledge about Iron Man, whether from the comics or the animated series, so I don't anticipate catching any inside jokes or subtle references. Over the past few years, I've gradually started exploring the Marvel universe. I've watched the Spider-Man films, the first two Ant-Man movies, and Deadpool. After enjoying ""Agatha All Along"" and ""WandaVision,"" I became interested in reading the Young Avengers comics and learning more about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This newfound interest has motivated me to watch all of the Marvel movies. I appreciated how this film opened; it evoked a similar atmosphere to The Death Cure, particularly with the aerial shots of vehicles traversing a dry landscape, which I found captivating. The introduction allowed us to meet the characters quickly, and I thought those visuals were striking. I was pleased that we didn't have to wait long before being immersed in the action.While I typically find time jumps in books and movies unappealing, I appreciated their use in this film. After an intense opening scene, we are transported back 36 hours to Las Vegas, where we delve into Tony Stark's character and gain insight into his family history during a presentation. This segment is enhanced by photographs of characters from their younger days, allowing viewers to connect a bit more deeply with their backstories. I appreciated that the film provided brief clips showcasing the perspectives of those who were holding the main characters captive, and I found the pacing of these scenes to be well-integrated throughout them scenes in the movie. I enjoyed the moments where characters experienced their surroundings, such as how it felt to be outside in bright light after being in darkness for an extended period, and what Tony perceived while wearing the headpiece. The film effectively utilized dim lighting in several scenes, allowing us to discern all crucial elements within each frame. It also employed impressive close-up techniques and low-angle shots of moving vehicles that enriched the visual storytelling.I found the gore in the movie to be convincingly portrayed within its context. The sets were impressively realistic, showcasing a remarkable attention to detail. The film's environments significantly enhanced its aesthetic appeal, as the blend of futuristic technology with grounded settings created a believable world where superhero elements could flourish without appearing outlandish or disconnected from reality.I thoroughly enjoyed the dynamic action sequences and stunts in the movie, particularly the explosions and CGI, which were impressive for their time. In 2008, one of the standout films that demonstrated exceptional CGI was this one. The design and animation of Iron Man's armor were remarkable, especially the heads-up display (HUD) within his helmet, which gave it a futuristic and functional appearance. The flight scenes showcased advanced CGI techniques that enabled realistic aerial maneuvers. The integration of visual effects in these scenes was among my favourites, as they appeared exceptionally well-crafted. Having been a fan of spy movies in my youth, I found the array of gadgets in this film to be particularly exciting.I appreciated the opportunity to see some of the suit's capabilities, including both the original and an upgraded version. The film effectively took its time to showcase the suit's development, highlighting Tony's genius while maintaining his snarky personality. However, I would have preferred if they included time-lapses and shortened the movie a bit, as there were moments where it felt like it was dragging.I appreciated the soundtrack, as it complemented the scenes beautifully. The casting of the characters was exceptional; they embodied their roles perfectly and brought the characters to life with their impressive performances. As an autistic individual, I was pleased to see that subtitles were available for the film. However, I felt a bit disappointed that translations were not provided for dialogue spoken in other languages.-I enjoyed getting to know several characters in the movie, particularly Tony Stark. His character development throughout the film was noteworthy. Initially depicted as a self-centred billionaire arms dealer, Tony exhibits traits that could be critiqued from a social justice standpoint, such as sexism and moral ambiguity in relation to his involvement with the military-industrial complex. However, his path toward redemption-where he acknowledges the repercussions of his actions and strives to utilize his technology for peace rather than profit-aligns with themes of personal growth and accountability. While I found Tony's initial treatment of women troubling, it was refreshing to see Pepper Potts evolve into a strong female lead who plays a crucial role in both Stark's life and business. I also appreciate her transformation from an assistant to someone wielding significant power and influence within Stark Industries, and I would love to see more of her character in other MCU films.-I really appreciated the unexpected twist in the movie; it added a delightful surprise that I didn't see coming. The ending was particularly captivating, featuring an open conclusion that perfectly sets up for the sequel, which I'm eager to watch soon. I found the outro visually stunning, with its illustrations against a black background complemented by fitting music. Also when watching don't forget to stay tuned during the credits, as there's an extra scene.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Superhero Movie,"As a kid I loved superhero movies. As an adult, I do too. It's really the story that drives any movie to me. So a superhero movie that is just all special effects and action really does nothing for me. Iron Man, like the original Superman and the Tobey McGuire Spiderman has a great story. Tony Stark, played in avery likable way by Robert Downey, Jr, is somewhat of an egotistical, rich kid with a great mind, but he is endearing, even from the beginning of the movie. You can tell he has aheart, but flaws like any person. After he is captured by villainous terrorists, it's exactly his heart (or damage to it) that allows him to create a mechanical suit that turns him into a superhero. So he's not a superhero, at least in his physicality, like Superman. his great mind and circumstances of his life allow him to turn himself into a superhero.Gwyneth Paltrow is superb in this film, and ""love"" story between her and Downey (Iron Man) is intesne, and so felt, though they never get together (I guess like every real superherp movie, you really are pulling for them to make out). Also, Jeff Bridges was great in the film, as usual. Fine directing by Swingers creator, Jon Favreau.One point: as good as Downey was, I'd rather have seen someone else in the role. Really, a junkie playing a superhero? Sorry, it just doesn't fit right.Ending the movie with Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" was just awesome!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An great opening to a remarkable franchise,"As the first movie to come out in the MCU, it's obviously an important movie to get right. A good movie creates interest, which a franchise needs a lot of to stay relevant. And luckily for Marvel, this movie is everything one could want in a superhero film. It's perfectly paced, it's captivating and it's funny. Most of the characters and performances are great, with RDJ and Jeff Bridges being my personal favorites. The action is well-filmed and edited, the production design is great, the music choices are good, almost everything in this movie is fantastic. My only small issue is that the villain is pretty forgettable and almost comical at times, like so many other Marvel villains, even though Bridges play him very well.

"Robert Downey, Jr. IS Iron Man","An Iron Man movie? I was worried! How could they make this work? Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark? Jeff ""the dude"" bridges as the villain? I couldn't wait to see how this turned out!When I left the theater, I was so thrilled! A new superhero movie to watch over and over again. Robert Downey, Jr. was perfect casting. So darn witty, funny, charming, smart, cocky, vulnerable, fun, tough. He did a great job in the dramatic moments and brought the laughs in the lighter moments. There is a real change in the character throughout the movie. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful and her Pepper Potts is wonderful. The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is fantastic. Terrence Howard does a good job playing Colonel Rhodes. You can tell Rhodes and Stark are best pals. There's a nice little tease here dealing with Rhodes character and an Iron Man suit. Jeff Bridges as the villain? So great! One of my favorite actors for sure! Paul Bettany as the A.I. (good choice) Jarvis? Another genius idea.Jon Favreau did a wonderful job with this movie. He actually managed to pull this off, making The Avengers movie possible. Iron Man is a total blast! Favreau trusts his actors to really give their all, keeps the pace up, and the tone light. He even gets to play a role in the film, nice one Jon!There are so many great moments: watching Tony Stark escape in the Mark I, building his signature suit, saving people's lives, battling Iron Monger, every scene with Tony and Pepper! The special effects in this film are amazing.The final fight between Iron Man and Stane was not on par with the rest of the movie though. Maybe not epic enough, too short?Iron Man flies by. It's a great time! Action packed, funny, great special effects, great performances especially Robert Downey, Jr. And that ending- ""I AM Iron Man."" Woah!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man,"Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau, is a fun, inventive, and energetic superhero film, that, unlike some of the other MCU films, can stand on it's own. This is arguably one of the best origin stories the MCU has offered up yet, having some memorable scenes throughout. Favreau worked in some great cohesive elements to juice up Tony Stark's back story, to give him some nice depth. It was such a nice relief that this wasn't just a stepping stone, to get a main character introduced, and that be it; Favreau gave us great context to who Stark is, and where he comes from. With Stark's back story set aside, the premise of the film wasn't the most original concept, with some cliché and predictable moments, but it's fine with Kevin Feige adding that Marvel flare throughout the film. The pacing of the film was decent for the most part, until the third act, and thats where the film takes it's major down turn. Everything feels rushed together, while making it feel like just another final act of a Marvel film; there was no real style to it.Robert Downey Jr. was the absolute driving force for this film! Between his arrogant, yet charming performance, to his seamless chemistry with everybody on screen, he just absolutely steals the show, without this being a one man show. I personally related to his character a lot due to the snarky, and slick comments, while also having that genuine work ethic that he poses. The writers gave Stark some good characters archs throughout the narrative, while including great risks and vulnerabilities. RDJ's performance was well recognized and respected, especially after the antics he was personally going through before the casting of the film. His timing to everything was impeccable, with this infectious charisma that simply grows on you before the first act is even finished. RDJ gave a great portrayal to the lowkey comic book character, while making him more well known and likable. Even though Downey Jr. was the star of the show, the supporting characters had a great deal with the success to this as well. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have a whole lot to do in the film, but she puts on a fine performance, being a great compliment to Tony Stark. She is probably the best love intrest between them all, offering something more than being a simple damsel in distress. I just love Terrence Howard, so seeing him casted as Rhodes was really fun for me, while it was also a smart casting, consider Howard plays in these types of roles often. Howard was another great compliment to Tony Stark, playing another character that doesn't really tolerate his antics, and tries to keep him as grounded as possible. Jeff Bridges is our main villain, and he is just whatever. His motive is somewhat there, but the execution was so fast and bland, having no actual critical plan going into everything. He ended up being a pretty dumb villain that was just wasted. On the plus side, Jeff Bridges tried his best, and made the most out of every scene he was in.The screenplay by Art Marcum, Matt Halloway, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby was pretty strong. The narrative felt cohesive, although they couldn't avoid some superhero clichés. The dialogue between everyone carried some weight, with some great jokes along the way. Some of the banter between characters felt improvised, but it worked in almost every application, giving the writting more of a genuine feel.The action wasn't heavily relied on when you think in terms of the MCU, but it was balanced real well with the story, not just throwing random action scenes in, to run the budget up even more. The visual effects were surprisingly not heavily relied on either, but for this being one of Marvel's first films with CG, it was decent.Overall, Iron Man is probably my favorite stand-alone film of the MCU, having great characters, fun writting, and a decent story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Comic Bookish in a Bad Way; Best Part: The Cast,"""Iron Man""'s best feature is its cast: Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, Clark Gregg and Shaun Toub are all serious actors who have been in actually good movies. They can afford to slum in drek like this. They don't slum, though. All of them act up a storm, as if the script were actually worth something. Good for them. Robert Downey Jr. is fascinating to watch, and Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and appealing as something of a female lead (remember, this is a movie for boys.)Otherwise, though, ""Iron Man"" is not one of those comic book movies like the Christian Bale ""Batman"" or the over the top, guilty pleasure ""300"" that transcends its genre. ""Iron Man"" is an obvious, pathetic fantasy for men and boys who are insecure because they feel unattractive, weak, stupid, and incompetent. Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is granted superhuman powers of intelligence, sex appeal, and power. The movie, heavy-handed and obvious, announces, within the first five minutes, that Tony Stark had sex with all of Maxxim's cover models, and, presumably as part of his super powers, he apparently did not contract one social disease by doing so. Stark goes on to seduce a woman who hates him, and, again this is all within the first few minutes. He stiffs his friend to play dice in Vegas, he flies his private jet around the world, and, in a cave, using scrap metal and an open fire, he invents a wearable suit that resists close range automatic weapons fire. He also, for some reason, inserts a glowing device, that looks a lot like a smoke detector, into his chest. Tony lives in a spectacular house in Malibu, he parks shiny sports cars where the camera will be sure to see them, and a train of white, black, young, and old sycophants follow him around, complimenting his every move. Gee, Tony, you're a genius. Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, whatever. Even within the boundaries of comic book movies, none of this is believable, and it's frightening to think of the childlike minds that will find it appealing.The movie lacks a strong narrative drive. Tony's agenda, his enemies, his location, and even his Iron Man suit, change too often. The movie is chopped into episodic bits. The plot twists are not surprising.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better then the 80's,"Honestly everyone trashing the video has a completely wrong view of the movie and has probably never read an Iron man comic book in their lives.The way this movie was made, actor wise, was a perfect representation of the ""playboy"" Tony Stark and Iron man when he first became it. There are a few problems in the movie but they are very minor. The biggest problem in the movie is that all the explosions look EXACTLY the same (the same person probably did the CG1 or explosives or w.e).As for anyone making references to racism in the movie. It's bogus, it isn't the usual devil horned villain killing everyone with the good ol' hero coming in saving the day. It tells it how it is with the military-industrial complex of underhanded arm's dealing. And how some Afgans are tormented and some are the tormentors. Maybe if all of the Afghans in the movie were evil then I might agree, but they aren't.Overall: Good movie, wouldn't look for the next Batman. But it does a good job with having a on the edge of your seat experience while Iron man is pounding the snot outta all the bad guys.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I absolutely enjoyed seeing 'Iron Man',"My first taste of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A great start!I absolutely enjoyed seeing 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as the titular character, who is a blast to watch throughout - love the design! The plot is very entertaining, I like how it tells the story; simply, but very effectively. Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow, meanwhile, all add to the film with good performances.The special effects are very neat, as are all the action sequences. I will say the score isn't the strongest, at least in terms of what I'd expect from this sorta film. I wouldn't say it's bad per se, just not as spectacular as it could've (should've?) been; especially with someone like Ramin Djawadi composing. I love a film with great music, so hopefully that improves as I watch the MCU expand.I know, I'm extremely late to this particularly party but happy to finally begin watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man is Alive,"Iron Man is a good start for new fanbase and existing fans, it tells a little history on how he eventually took the responsibility to become Iron Man. Barely alive and escaping from terrorist group is not one could think about it, what's more building an armor suit to fly from the terrorist hideout and to be saved once more.In Marvel Comics, Tony Stark was also saved by Dr. Yinsen but set during the Vietnam War instead in Afghanistan (prior to Afghan war-torn).There are many changes in comparison with the comics and movie. Movie tries to make things as interesting as possible for the new and unknown audience.Comic geeks like myself would have to conclude that this is the Iron Man we all knew but in the different era and technology.But I'm pretty much amazed how Favreau managed to make the suit alive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant!,"Lot's of action, comedy and really cool effects. Iron Man can keep the whole family entertained with action for the parents, a superhero for the kids and an action packed adventure with a superhero for the adults who still think they're kids. With a refreshingly underused plot Iron Man brings something new to the movie table and Robert Downey Jr's cocky portrayal of Iron Man keeps you laughing throughout. Some may be scrutinising this film if they know the Iron Man story well but I am not familiar with them and find it a 10. These people may rate it a little less but if you love explosions, bust ups and superheroes I don't see how you're experience could go much differently to mine :DFor me the best part about Iron Man is the fact he becomes a superhero almost by accident and the film deals with issues the world faces a lot like terrorism and evil. Potts is your typical love interest of a superhero and may seem a little cheesy at times but Gwyneth Paltrow works so well with RDJ that it slips your mind most of the time anyway.Overall Iron Man is a fantastic film that I will watch over and over again :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert Downey Jr. Is The Man,"I went to see ""Iron Man"" knowing nothing about the character (never read the comic books) and without great expectations. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan and if not for his presence, I probably would've ignored it. I didn't like it as much as most people, but it was fairly entertaining (and that's what I was expecting after all, we're not talking about groundbreaking film-making here and I don't think anybody expects that from this, right?) and that's mostly thanks to Downey Jr., one of the coolest actors out there, a chameleon who can play pretty much everything. Adding to the ""cool"" aspect of the movie, Jeff Bridges plays the villain. I'm glad that the long, dark phase of drug abuse Downey Jr. was living some years ago is over, and the man is alive and kicking to continue delighting audiences. Plus, ""Iron Man"" will introduce him to a whole new generation. Don't expect much and enjoy the ride; better a summer flick with Robert Downey Jr. than a dozen Michael Bays starring bland new ""stars"" and tanned Angelina Jolie wannabes. 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man Review,"By 2008, there were already a bunch of Marvel movies on the market, all presented as a big mixed cluster of varying quality and quantity. After pulling itself together as its own studio, Marvel kicked off Phase 1 of its new movie-making universe with Iron Man.From start to finish, this is one cool film. It is very sharply-made, with a very slick and high-quality look and feel. It's evenly-paced, with equal parts color, comedy, and action. And when the action hits, it is really cool stuff, without going too far overboard. Among Iron Man's heroics, my favorite scene shows him rocketing to the other side of the world, to use his high-tech suit to beat up violent extremists to protect the innocent (blowing up a tank in the process, before being pursued by American jets in a great high-speed air chase scene). The film's climax features an all-out fight between two high-powered suits, during which there's plenty of mass destruction. Even when there aren't guns and rockets going off, the film is still a blast with its colorful inter-character exchanges, funny suit-testing scenes, tense inter-corporate conspiracies.The story this film tells is a great one. The origins of Iron Man is inherently compelling, as it takes a greedy, narcissistic arms dealer and flips him on his head to turn him into a hero. The film does so by plunging the character into the heart of the very problems he's created (in a war-town part of the world nonetheless). Once Tony Stark dedicates himself to being Iron Man, the conflict shifts to him confronting everybody else around him. Through all the struggles he endures, the film lays out rich characterization and interesting thematic material worth exploring.This film looks splendid, with quality photography and editing. Acting is quite spot-on: Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as the title character, and he remains iconic through every other Marvel project he's in from here on out. Gweneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard, Shaun Toub, and everybody else is great to watch as well. Writing is pretty good and sharp. This production uses spectacular-looking sets, props, and costumes. Most special effects hold up well, and are awesome to behold. Ramin Djawadi's music score is pretty cool too.The first Iron Man film has everything you can ask for in a superhero film: thrilling action, amusing humor, a decent story, and characters we can care about. Even after having numerous other Marvel films come out since, this is still the biggest must-see of the lot.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A great, different super hero movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Tony Stark Way: Style Beats Substance,"When I went back to watch Iron-Man for this review, I remembered how unfinished this movie felt and how I thought it was an excellent start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but by no means was it a great movie. Good, but not great. But that being said, there was something so cool about this movie that you forgive its shortcomings because, without Robert Downey Jr.'s hyper-narcissism, this movie would have only have been known for the extraordinary Iron-Man suit.Everyone knows how the story of Robert Downey Jr.'s career resurrection, it's biblical in scale at this point and I couldn't have been happier to see him make Tony Stark into a household name. In Iron-Man, we meet the billionaire, womanizing, and war profiteering Stark who learns the horrors of war first hand when his military caravan is ambushed by Afghan rebels led by Raza-your stereotypical Islamic terrorists that could have easily have been plucked from James Cameron's True Lies. But this was the era we were in-the end of the Bush era and American's were growing tired of war. So it makes sense that Stark's feelings mirrored this after one of his weapons were turned against him in the attack-leaving him with shrapnel in his chest from a Stark Industries bomb that exploded a bit late. With the help of a Middle Eastern doctor named Yinsen, Stark is saved thanks to magnet installed in his chest to pull the shrapnel away from his heart. And as cool as the upgraded version of Stark's chest-installed Arc-reactor is, the hole in his chest makes for some of the more squeamish moments in this film.So, let's talk about the villain. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane-the acting COO of Stark Industries and you guessed it, he 's another stereotypical villain. Stane is a white collar corporate madman who seems to have no motivation other than being dominant. That's it. That's all I got. Obadiah isn't even remotely impressive, and his final method of attack is uninspired and makes for one of the weaker third acts in a Marvel film. Luckily, Robert Downey Jr. does enough heavy lifting in this film to make Iron-Man fun to watch. Let's face it, this a movie about a great character, not a great story. Stark is so intriguing that you can't help but wonder how he'll outthink his opponents. The Tony Stark character, as portrayed by Downey is one of the best comic-book interpretations ever, and it's the life-blood of this movie.Now, can we stop and just applaud the production design of that suit. Everyone knows that suiting up is the pinnacle moment of any superhero film. The first time the film reveal the outfit that will strike fear into the hearts of evil men is as essential to the character's mythology as their backstory. But there is something about the Iron-Man suit that eclipses every superhero costume ever seen. Maybe it's the orbiting camera, NASCAR pit-stop like nature of the sequence. Perhaps it's the testing of the all the air dampeners and locking of the metallic suit linkage. Maybe it's the badass eyes on the face of the first Iron-Man suit. Or maybe it's the lack of synthetic rubber and leotards that make it so cool. Whatever it is, it's that suit that makes Iron-Man one of the most spectacular introductions to a comic-book character. While Iron-Man is a pretty simplistic story, it's an excellent character study, and it's got enough fresh CGI to make you think that a man flying around in an iron suit is a pretty good idea. But the most fantastic thing about this film happens after the credits-the introduction of the narrative linking post-credit scene that is the drug of choice for Marvel fans worldwide.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Is anyone over the age of five NOT sick of sub-par superhero movies?,"It seems like an obsession with Hollywood to take something intentionally childish and make it ""mature"". You know what I'm talking about. The new Bond movies, the new Batman movies, Transformers, etc., etc. What Hollywood fails to realize is that only one out of every ten movies that follows this style actually ends up being a worthwhile movie.Iron Man is simply one of the nine failures.Outside of the first forty-five minutes, the entire plot line is corny and a wholesale cliché. Elaborating, Iron Man tries to be mature by mixing in the war in the middle-east. It works. That is, it works until the plot turns into the exact same plot as every other sub-par superhero movie out there. It becomes obvious by the first thirty minutes that no good person can die, and all the bad people all cackle oh-so-evilly and have no more intelligence than an average paperweight. By this point you forget the maturity of the movie's opening, and all there is to do is laugh at the impossibly cliché story. It's like watching one of the old cartoons where the good guys always win and the bad guys always have evil-looking beard stubble and talk intelligently only to be slight-handed by the more intelligent good guy. This is the ""mature"" superhero movie everyone told me about?But there is a good chance you didn't watch Iron Man for the plot. You watched it for the action. The only problem with that is there is only two action scenesyes, I counted. One in the opening and one in the ending, with a few spurts of action between that last a whole thirty seconds of screen time. The first one is well-done and actually made me think this could be a decent movie. The last, however, is possibly one of the most unintentionally hilarious climactic scenes of all time. Even if I ignore the fact it's almost copy/pasted in entirety from a Mystery Science 3000 episode, some of the worst CGI used since I Am Legend ruins anything cool about it.The space between the two action scenes is filled with some of the most cliché plotting I've seen in years, as I stated above. Put simply, there is nothing entertaining here. While Robert Downey Jr. plays his role perfectly as usual and puts on a pretty nice comedic bit every few scenes, he can't let me forget the sinking feeling in my gut that this is one of the most boring superhero movies ever made.What more is there for me to say?My pretentious critic conclusion: Iron Man is a severely clichéd, technically poor film with little entertainment value.Half-drunk, adverage joe conclusion: Iron Man is boring and lame. No way is this better than The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2!Both are correct. Iron Man has made me personally give up all hope on the superhero genre.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Incredible beginning of a saga,"Iron Man is the beginning of the MCU, and shows the origin of a character who until now was not one of the most famous in Marvel, like Spider-Man, or the X-Men, but managed to make everyone love this eccentric character.It shows the origin of Iron Man, a billionaire owner of Stark Industries (which manufactures weapons) and who was captured in Afghanistan by the Ten Rings, and to survive he needs a reactor in his chest, and to escape he built a suit of armor.The story of this film is incredible, it shows the origin of the character very well, in addition to managing to show his personality very well, as a completely irresponsible and selfish guy. The villain and Pepper Potts are also very well written characters in my opinion, James Rolds ends up not being very memorable in the film precisely because in the sequel they changed the actor (and he got much better later).The film's script is very good, and it's not a boring film, nor is it rushed, it makes good use of the time it has, with very good and memorable action scenes, and really funny comedy.Visually it's incredible, current films don't come close to the CGI of this one, the scenes of the armor being put on him piece by piece are incredible especially because they look real because of the CGI which is perfect. The action scenes are very good, the rock music in the film is incredible and suits Tony, who by the way, the choice of Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect, it's unimaginable another actor in his place.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Far from a brilliant film but still a bright, breezy and enjoyable summer blockbuster","Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines  very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture  an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie  which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark  I mean, I like Batman's tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn't think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I'm assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don't look for a lot of soul searching (Stark's change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The perfect opening of the MCU,"#MCUrewatch. It was a brave choice to kick-off the MCU with Iron Man and not First Avenger Captain America. But it was the right choice because it's the performance of Downey Jr. As Tony Stark that makes this such a highly entertaining (and still one of the best) films in the franchise. The actor is helped by a strong script with a straightforward story and brilliant dialogues. Top that off with solid action, great score and a fine performance of Paltrow. The character of baddie Obediah is pretty one dimensional but it's the assure attitude of Bridges (and a great bald head and beard) that elevates this above the average MCU bad guy. The best thing is that in this MCU rewatch you notice already some Stark character elements that are payed off quite a few films into the franchise. He already despises the lack of control over violence (which returns in Civil War) and his ""I am Iron Man"" confession returns later in a rather dramatic way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Entertaining origin story which bodes well for franchise,"Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" fundamentally changed the superhero genre and became a gold standard. What it delivered was an often dark character piece with action to match and it was a blockbuster that art-house filmgoers could enjoy. When he came to direct ""Iron Man"", Jon Favreau had Nolan on his mind and has cited that film as a key inspiration. Favreau has not matched Nolan's achievement, but he has delivered a terrific piece of entertainment, which is not without depth and is superbly cast and well made.The central character of Tony Stark has to work if this film is to be at all successful, and he does, thanks to a snappy script and an absolutely excellent performance from Robert Downey Jr. Stark is similar to James Bond in one respect. You're happy to admire him as smooth and suave on screen, but know that, if he were an actual acquaintance of yours, you would probably loathe him. Despite his gambling, womanising, smug playboy nature, Stark is likable because Downey Jr. makes him unbelievably charming, funny and engaging. Added to this, Stark's character has an arc. Its progression doesn't span the whole film, and it isn't particularly original, but it does provide a point of connection with the character which makes Stark, and indeed Iron Man, a success.The pitch-perfect casting doesn't end there. Gwyneth Paltrow is far less annoying than she could have been and does make the ludicrously named Pepper Potts sympathetic. Terence Howard does a decent job with little to work with (his role is a place-holder for the inevitable sequel). However, the real star of the supporting cast is the ever-excellent Jeff Bridges, whose former-mentor Obadiah Stane is a treat to watch whenever his inversely-haired visage is on screen.The action is done very well. ILM's special effects are flawless and Favreau has a grip on the sequences which are thrilling and entertaining. The final sequence misses the mark a little but still has its moments. The rest of the film is humorous, entertaining and not a minute too long, which suggests that more time could have been spent on character.All-in-all, this film is a decent and entertaining set-up for what could be an interesting franchise. With this cast and the apparently safe hands behind the camera, we should be in for more superb entertainment in the inevitable sequel.4 Stars out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
average,"Okay,first of all,why this movie is on n.237 of IMDb's list of 250 greatest movies is still a mystery to me. Yes,there is nothing ( in general ) wrong with this movie,but that is just the problem.I mean,Iron Man is not original movie one bit,yes the cast is great ( even Gvyneth Paltrou looks hot in this one! ),effects are great,but all in all,to me this is just an average movie. The only thing that is great about this movie is that the title character is played by probably the most popular actor today,Robert Downey Jr.,who is just a joy to watch.He portrays Tony Stark amazingly,and even ads a humorous side to the character.Also I love Jef Bridges as an actor that I haven't seen much lately.He does a good job playing the villain in this movie. So if Iron man 2 comes in the future ( and it most definitely will ) I will watch it...but... All in all,I give this movie rating 6 out of ten,and it gets one extra point only because of Robert Downey Jr. Again I say,watch it and you will see that this is just an average movie,there really is nothing special about this one... Does anyone agree with me?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am Iron Man,"Brilliant start to MCU, Robert Downey jr was perfect to play Tony Stark and the movie was really good with a good story and great build up.

"Hey, I like this movie.","There's something I like to call 'the Sherlock effect'. It basically says that Sherlock Holmes is a genius is is not allowed to be wrong ever. It's how they explain some (or most) of the things he does. It's quite a lazy way to go about the plot, but Robert Downey Jr. is such a phenomenal actor that I let it slide. And the same thing can be said about Tony Stark being everything all at once to everybody. No human could ever handle all that, but Tony Stark is more than human, and combine that with RDJr. to get the perfect person. Not perfect in that he has no flaws, but perfect in that you see past them and accept him for who he is, no matter what crazy things he does.All this talking can be summarized by me saying that RDJr. is brilliant and amazing in whatever he does and that this movie is completely worth it. I hope that many more are made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A strong start to long story!,"This is still one of the best mcu films to date. Being the first movie in the mcu aloud the writers to take more risks with the plot unlike more recent movies that have followed the same formula. The beginning of the story hooks you in instantly and grabs your curiosity, then it leaps back and tells the beginnings of the invincible iron man. The time tony stark spends as a hostage is very necessary and works very well to change his perspective on many problems.Tony as a character is very strong and excellently played by Robert DJ. From watching the first iron man again it reminded me how much the character has developed throughout the mcu, he starts in this movie as a complete idiot who can be seen as the villain in some sense. The side characters are decent, they don't add a whole lot to the movie but do become increasingly more important. The villain is excellently played and is very intimidating, he isn't that well written into the story, but just enough that the twist shocks the watcher.The action is obviously great, and for a movie made in 2008 the cgi looks incredible minus a few shots...but it could stand out against movies made today. The humour is also pretty good, sometimes a bit misplaced but it does the job nicely. Overall a very fun movie that has influenced the creation of dozens of films to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Contained,"I did not expect much from this. Marvel just seems to make what seems to me ordinary, boring movies. I was hopeful this time because the three main actors have done some rather elaborate work so far as reflected acting. Downey is something of a prince at this business of simultaneous personalities.But we have none of that here. I just saw ""Forbidden Kingdom"" and it uses what is now the state of the art regarding cameras in fights: the camera dances. It folds us into the action. Not so with any Marvel-produced project. We might as well be watching C D deMille with color.Nearly all these Marvel stories are predicated on science gone wrong. Contrast that to heroes from other companies, where it is just cosmic reality or even training that happens to make someone special. But these stories all derive from the Japanese pattern of postwar antiscience movies which in turn were based on ""Frankenstein."" (The Japanese would not have known the earlier gollum films.)So the driving force here is science. As it happens, I would have been disappointed by the blandness of everything, but they ruined the driving force of science for me. Stark was supposed to have gone to MIT with Colonel Rhodes (who wears an MIT ring), but we are told Stark was summa cum laude at MIT. But that school is unique in never engaging in that foolishness. Think about it.But what's a greater offense is how this, the man with the best mind, the most money and the most advanced science, does his work. I'm thinking particularly of the computers. This is the one place where we could have been dazzled. But what we see is ordinary, as if it were envisioned not by a man with great imagination and inventiveness, but by someone who simply doesn't know.Suppose you were shown a car from 50 years in the future and it had a key, steering wheel and dial speedometer. Its the same effect, and sorta takes the gas out of the thing.Oh, they made Gwyneth a redhead.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Stunning Craftsmanship if a little rusted inside,"There's no doubt Iron Man is an entertainment machine and a stunning one at that but it's a damn shame it takes so long and at so much expense to get there. Sure the pacing's not great and both the beginning and the end flitter with dodgy CGI and a underwhelming feel but there's no denying that the central parts of Iron man is the very best of marvel. It's lead man Robert Downey Jr. Who shines the most. He has just the right amount of dry Witt and charm to carry the film through even its patchiest moments.From Marvel Studios and Paramount Pictures comes Iron Man, an action-packed take on the tale of wealthy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who develops an invulnerable robotic suit to fight the throes of evil. In addition to being filthy rich, billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is also a genius inventor. When Stark is kidnapped and forced to build a diabolical weapon, he instead uses his intelligence and ingenuity to construct an indestructible suit of armor and escape his captors. Once free, Stark discovers a deadly conspiracy that could destabilize the entire globe, and dons his powerful new suit on a mission to stop the villains and save the world.Gwyneth Paltrow co-stars as his secretary, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, while Terrence Howard fills the role of Jim ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, one of Stark's colleagues, whose military background leads him to help in Whose military background leads him to help in the formation of the suit. Jon Favreau directs, with Marvel movie veterans Avi Arad and Kevin Feige producing. Paltrow provides some much needed flavour to the otherwise dry script and Terrance Howard adds to the humanity that is often forgotten in super-hero movies. Fortunately while Iron Man does deliver on the humanity level when needed it doesn't allow humanity and realism to bring down the overall fun of the film as it is in Spider-Man 3.Iron Man isn't perfect, it's riddled with ultimately forgivable flaws but flaws none the less. Flaws witch most of the world seems to be able to over look considering its high rating and a place on IMDb's Top #250. For some though the flaws are too huge to simply ignore.Most eyes remain of Downey Jr. Throughout the whole show and quite rightly so. He is charming, sophisticated and best of all very funny. Its clear he was the right choice for this role. The CGI is a tad strange, flitting from computer graphics reminiscent of the original spider-man all the way to last year's transformers, there often bad there mostly good.Not too light, not too dark a bit grey, then? Not at all: this is buoyant, bright, a constant breeze. But still it hovers somewhere on the superhero-adapt spectrum between the good and the great. Not as flyweight as Fantastic Four or Daredevil or Ghost Rider, but just missing the myth-spinning splendor and heft of a Spidey 2 or X2 or Batman Begins.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
NICK FURY IS IN THSI MOVIE!!!!!!  and it should be called tony stark instead of iron man,"first off stay after the credits to see nick fury, he talks about how tony stark isn't the only superhero in the world, which makes sense cuz tony is in the incredible hulk.anyway just got back from the theaters and all i can say was that it was pretty good.i liked robert downey jr. and jeff bridges a lot. Terrance howard didn't do much and gweneth palrow bugged me a lot! anyway to sum things up ice and neatley, The movie showed very little of iron man, it needed more action, downey jr. stole the show and the director knew that making the focus more on TONY stark than IRON man himself so the movie should be entitled TONY STARK instead of iron man if their was more action this would be a perfect movie, but sadly it isn't i liked it but probably wont be seeing it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"As long as Downey Jr and Favreau are aboard, so am I.","I know that it is fairly well documented by now, but apparently Robert Downey Jr wasn't supposed to play Tony Stark / Iron Man, now that I've watched it a couple times I can't imagine anyone else having a crack at it.I'm not a comic book guy, I read comics as a kid, but more Donald Duck vs the Beagle Boys stuff. I never got into The Phantom or Captain America stuff, in fact everything I knew about Iron Man I learned from listening to Ghostface Killah albums, hardly a lengthy study. Tony Stark is yet another creation of Stan Lee, the man responsible for seemingly half of the big budget movies of the last decade, and Stark has a good backstory.Tony Stark was born into money, but it helps that he is a creative genius also. Hardly a shrinking violet or a reclusive inventor, he does what everyone (at least thinks) they would do if in a position to do so. He bangs supermodels, often two or more at a time, drives fast cars and spreads his money around.He is witty, smart, sophisticated, vain and a little flawed, a description that also exactly suits RD Jr, casting him was probably the smartest move that was made, and allowed Iron Man to be strong enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the new Batman movies, although it is in my opinion just a minor notch below both.What Iron Man isn't, is derivative or indulgent, when the credits roll and everyone walks away happy it is a feeling well earned.Tony Stark is the head of Stark Industries, a massive company responsible for creating and manufacturing the best weapons on the planet. You know, ""When it comes to spreading fear, 9 out of 10 terrorists prefer Stark Industries weapons."" The movie gets right into the action, Stark is traveling with a military escort after a weapons demonstration when the convoy comes under fire. Most if not all soldiers are killed, and Stark is sent flying by one of his own weapons.Oh the irony! When he comes to, he has been taken hostage and thanks to a fellow prisoner who happens to be a doctor has a magnet strapped to his chest to prevent shards of shrapnel burrowing into his heart and killing him. The terrorists, realizing who they have in their hands, demand Stark build a superweapon for them using all the tools at their disposal. Instead of doing this Stark builds a metallic suit, the bulky and unwieldy ""Mark 1"".Using the Mark 1 Stark escapes, amazingly the suit takes a huge amount of direct fire, some near misses by rocket launchers, but literally explodes when it crashes into a sand dune on its maiden flight.Regardless, once Stark gets back to captivity he decides to ""go straight"" and tells the press that Stark Industries is out of the weapons game, which shocks the hell out of Obadiah Steyn, the public face of the company when Stark is under the weather or out whoring it up.Stark's right hand man is Pepper Pots, his secretary who handles all the everyday running of his life and tries to make sure that he stays on the straight and narrow where possible. Gwenyth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots, and really doesn't have a great deal to do. He also has a good buddy in the military Col. Roads, a virtual butler named Jarvis and a couple of robotic assistants who are largely along for comic relief.The Mark 1 inspires Stark to hone his design, and he does so successfully after some amusing failed attempts. Once he completes and test drives the suit (which looks and performs in a cool manner), it obviously becomes sought after by various parties, most of them thinking naughty thoughts, and the rest of the film has Tony Stark fighting for truth justice and the American way, (or something similar).Downey Jr is quick witted and rarely shuts up, though he is never boring or annoying, Terrence Howard sorta sleeps through his role as Col. Roads, but as a hardened military man he is supposed to be calm and stoic I guess. Paltrow plays the role that only several thousand random interchangeable Hollywood women could play, and she seems bemused to even be there after a decade of so called ""serious"" stuff.The strangest thing is how old Jeff bridges looks with a bald head and a full beard, I had to remind myself that I was watching ""the Lebowski Dude"" but I must say he has an immaculately shaped head that look great bald, and played the almost Father figure to Tony Start quite well. There are some great setpieces, some snappy dialogue and quite a few more laughs than the Batman flicks, or a season of Two and a Half Men for that matter.The acid test: my wife watched Iron Man with me, all the way through, without once walking off in disgust or needing to ""Oh sure!"" her way through long scenes, which happens in quite a few action or guy movies that she has witnessed. I might take the ultimate challenge later this year and see if my Dad will sit through more than 15 minutes of this without leaving the house.The best part? I actually really look forward to Iron Man 2 & 3, as opposed to say X-Men or Spiderman when you know you'll watch the inevitable sequels but don't expect much.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. This is a very entertaining movie that also works as a serious film. That doesn't happen too often. So as long as Downey Jr is Stark and Favreau is directing, I'm aboard for the ride.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Action movie full of Special Effect. Keep It Up Marvel !!,"This amazing and mostly a kind of realistic movie is set by the plot in the way to keep you involved from beginning to the end. The most fascinating part that blew my mind off was the extraordinary special-effect. Don't be uncertain, this Iron Man is an entirely wonderful movie. I won't write any spoilers ti its reviews and would urge to watch this movie possibly if you still haven't watched it. Marvel must have made these types of movies long ago.As the name of Robert Downey is not amongst the biggest names in the Hollywood, he still played his role flawlessly and intimidated me how he represented Iron Man so greatly. Also the humor worked well in this movie. The script is perfect and it carries the wonderful cast.I was largely impressed by the CGI. They were magnificent and are not disturbing to make you miss great scenes of this movie. It is not possible to forget that this is an Action movie, so it's not that just the stars have to be congratulated; each individual effect was also fairly wonderful. The fighter jet scenes seemed very lame in Iron Man's trailer, but when I watched the full movie, it satisfied my expectations.This amazing full of special-effects Iron Man film has to offer you a thrilling ride particularly when it comes to the battle part. And no doubt, the credit for uplifting its ranking goes to Robert Downey who once an unknown character now a familiar personality. I like the technology of Iron Man which has the quality to avoid targeting people.The second half is full of pure action. The well-written script and enough twist-scenes are well delivered to keep you tighten with your seat till the end. This remarkable movie pleased everybody succeeded greatly. The whole 2.5 hours playing of this movie offers you latest action hero for the CGA sated appreciation. The best use of the amazing leather jackets has been made in this movie, especially by Robert Downy as Tony Stark in this movie. Until now, I was wondering if I could find one of those hangar scene leather jackets outside the Stark industry. Finally, I have found the solution to all my Hollywood style leather jackets needs. Desert leather is the wonderful online website that offers all Hollywood celebrity style genuine leather jackets at an attractive price with free shipping all across the USA. They are the exact replica of the leather jackets worn by the famous celebrities like the one in this super-hit Iron Man.Tony Stark also made the weapons for war, so when he goes to Afghanistan, he introduced a new missile for the terrorists. He finally got to know that the weapons were not in the right hands so he created metal suit and became Iron Man and shut down the Stark Industry when he saw all the violence. Ultimately Iron Man set the record of success for the comic book movies and finally went beyond this summer season. In its wrap up, I would say that Iron Man will make publicity and my outlook is great as a comic book reader.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ironic and enjoyable comic Marvel superhero film ...,"Another year, another superhero film unleashed on the public mid-spring to begin the summer blockbusters hitting the cinema.For starters, I've never read any Marvel comic book, talk less of this particular one on which this film is based, so if you're expecting a review from a comic book fan, look elsewhere. But if you want to read a opinion from an everyday cinema goer, then continue reading.Acting: I felt the leading man was good in his role - he plays the deadpan, womanising and sardonic character well. The sort of hedonistic persona and charming he portrays as a weapons manufacturer works, even if his voice can seem a bit monotonous to me. Jeff Bridges' acting that really stole the show for me. He plays Obadiah, who at first is friendly towards Stark but then becomes horrified and greedy when Tony has a change of heart about his job and turns on him. I could tell he was clearly relishing the role and it's the first time I've seem him act as a 'baddie'. Utterly menacing and powerful. I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's acting as Peppa Potts was decent in places, like the banter between her and Tony but certain shouting from her towards the end during the climax came across as somewhat unbelievable. It doesn't help that the character feels quite cut-and-paste. The chemistry between Potts and Stark didn't ring true for me either - it felt unconvincing to me, and I felt more convinced by Downey Jr.'s acting in those scenes than hers. Terrence Howard was decent too, even if his character wasn't in that many scenes and felt generic.Pacing: Quite rushed to me. This is an introduction or origin story, but once the suit is built, it sort of looses it's way as it hurries to finish the film with a final fight climax. Individual scenes didn't seem to be completed in a satisfying way front my point of view and I felt like I was missing out on a longer scene -they quickly finished and moved on to the next. The action scenes in it were brief and not sustained for full enjoyment and the climax a disappointment, in my opinion. The very topical Afghanistan and the scenes where Stark is tied up and battles there do disturb but relate and update the story to today's world and conflicts which I thought was good.Cinematography: Well, I thought the special effects were terrific - the suit looked amazing on screen and photo-real and the flight scenes, if short, were soaring and fun to see. The robot-armed assistant in the lab was funny and sweet and the technology looked in ways possible, which speaking tech in the suit and lab.Music: Didn't find the score that memorable to me, but the music did heighten the mood in places but maybe another watch will make it more so, who knows? The rock songs did suit the high-flying, tongue-in-cheek and fun atmosphere of the film, though.Overall: An ironic film(in the sense that he's wounded by his own weapons, and his weapons are used against him in a sense etc), that's good and entertaining, if quite a hastened action film that has some snappy and deadpan chuckles here and there, amazing special effects and good acting mostly. Downey Jr. is an interesting, thoughtful and different superhero. Shame the battle at the end climax comes across as generic and it ends too soon, feeling too easily finished, but worth seeing I feel, if you like films of this genre - 6.7/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good, not Great, but a whole lot of fun.","Iron Man is an immensely enjoyable film. Major props go out to it in terms of direction, acting and special effects. Where thing begin to fall apart is the plot, but I'll get to that in a second.Iron Man is very well shot. The music is well picked, well placed, and well timed. When it opens with AC/DC the tone is set for the entire film. It is fast, it is fun, and it f-ing rocks. The music cues throughout the film tend to enhance this sense. When Iron Man fights, they break out the guitars and it just feels right.The special effects are beautiful. I am a cgi hater, but in the case of iron man you don't really have a choice. I'm just glad that they decided to use it sparingly and when they do it is breathtaking. I think most uses of cgi in movies look terrible. Not so here. A+. And because they use it sparingly and they took the material seriously (while keeping a light tone), this feels like the real world to an extent. Tim Story and even Sam Raimi should watch this film to show that you can have a light tone and keep things in something of a realistic realm. You can have a comic book film be fun and light without becoming a cartoon. You can be funny without being stupid.And this film is funny as hell. You will laugh. This is rare for a comic book film. Most don't know how to handle comedy. They either go overboard and its just ridiculous and stupid (certain dance scenes come to mind) or it gets wedged in and comes off as awkward one-liners that make you cringe (the one flaw in my beloved batman begins). Most of the humor comes from the absolutely fantastic performance by Robert Downy Jr. He f-ing nailed it. I could go on for pages and not come close to how good he is. This is his film through and through. It's why the film is so much fun. He is instantly likable, funny, awesome, and real. Two thumbs up all the way. The other cast members all do their jobs and pass with flying colors. The performances range from serviceable to excellent. None are bad. Everyone does something to contribute to the film overall. Kudos to the cast.Now to the major glaring flaw to this film. The plot. It's terrible. Fortunately, you don't care that much because it is otherwise so much fun. But really, it couldn't be much more silly, cliché, or predictable. The long, overblown bad-guy speeches handed out by jeff bridges (not his fault, he does the best he can with the material) are especially overwrought and overdone and the closest this movie comes to a cringe moment. If you were to write an outline for your typical comic book movie plot, hell your typical action movie plot, you'd basically have the exact plot that this movie follows. Which is a shame, but fortunately it doesn't drown the movie. It just holds it back from being something greater.Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Iron Man has one of the best endings of any comic book movie i've ever seen. It completely caught me off guard. I love it. Just another parting gift from the wonderful filmmakers. The hackneyed plot could have used such surprises. In the end, it was just really good to see marvel get its groove back after the abortions that are Ghost Rider and the Fantastic Four movies (and Spiderman 3).

I am Iron man!,"Iron man great film. It is more faithful to the comic book that inspired it. Robert Downey JR is the film he hits the ground running from his first scene and never stops running, RDJ plays Tony Stark like a lazy Howard Hughes/James Bond wannabe with a little bit of Hugh Hefner tossed in. He does not lack confidence and he almost has a childlike naive way of looking at life. Until a life altering and threatening accident places him in the hands of terrorists who demand he create a weapon for them. Stark creates something but not for them he creates a Armor with enough weapon power to take out an army which he proceeds to do. once home he realizes that he must take account for his actions his company makes weapons of mass destruction he must make amends thus is born Iron man a avenger out to protect the world from those who terrorize and commit atrocities on a massive scale. Jeff Bridges is superb as Stane, Stark's partner who betrays him and creates the Iron Monger a suit more powerful then Iron man's. the battle scenes are breath taking and suspenseful This movie delivers on all cylinders and fulfills any Iron man fan they even play Black Sabbith's IRON MAN and you know the movie is going to be fun when it pokes fun of itself by playing it over and over again specially in the background. One thing I must admit is this . the director made a movie better then the comic from which it came. This movie is a family movie deep down in it's iron plated heart it delivers action some romance some development in the form of Tony Stark as he grows from a spoiled man who does not take any accountability whatsoever for his actions to a Iron Plated hero out to not only take responsibility for his actions but those of others as well. This movie left me wanting more Iron Man and hopefully soon.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Military promotional trash,If you like watching movies that are scripted and approved by the Pentagon watch this movie. It is a blatant advertisement for the US military and is an insult to any intelligence anywhere. It is the worst movie I have ever seen.Even if you ignore the what is obviously an hour and a half recruitment effort to try and get you children in the US to sign up for invading foreign countries to continue the atrocities of the last two presidential terms - the plot sucks. Not much in special effects and the acting is 3rd rate all around.As super hero movies goes - fantastic four - silver surfer is far better.,1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Deserves 10/10 for being one of the first and always a good movie,"Maybe its because I was younger seeing this movie on FX that it always feel like a comfort movie, but it takes time to develop into a superhero movie. Feeling more like another pro military movie like captain america (even though this one was tech first lol) i still like rewatching it with my brothers. I am also one of those people that prefers Terrance Howard as War Machine but thats just cause he is a great actor. This movie is a good mix at feeling like a super hero movie set in modern times, where some of the others just get to fantasy or sci fi heavy to feel relatable.

I am Iron Man..,"The first mcu film ever to be made and man did it open with a bang!Solid story with some issues but had great pacing and buildup of plot. The characters were good. You got Tony, the main character who has decent development after his stay in at that Afghan base. Peppers, who seems to be flawless and has a close dynamic with Tony.

Good but not that good,"Well, I didn't have great expectations about this movie, I mean I imagined this could be a nice and entertained film, but not as good as some in the same category, for instance Batman begins, x-men or hulk which in my opinion are very good comic adaptations.When I saw the cast Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, I thought that the film would worth the trouble to see it.I have to say that the film is well performed and that has outstanding visual effects. The art direction is also well conceived.On the other hand the plot is quite predictable, and I wouldn't have complained if it were more interesting or suspenseful, but all in all, is not a bad start, and since due to it success in box office, they announced a part 2, I hope they will improved the script for that one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Huge Surprise...!!,"I have to admit that when I sat down to watch this film, I was a little skeptical. Marvel had come out with some really crappy movies and a few major letdowns, so there was no reason to expect anything else from Iron Man...O how wrong I was. This movie has so many things going for it. Not only is the script solid, but they had a fantastic cast. Robert Downey jr IS Tony Stark. He makes the character to be exactly what he should be and made it beleaveable and the other actors were fantasticaly cast in their roles. Whats cool about the film is that if you read the comics, you will pick up little nod's here and there to the fans of the comic which is a nice touch that the filmmakers not only were faithful to the source, but updated for todays audience. The special FX are very well done and only enhance the film experience. I think the film added humor in just the right way. Unlike the Fantastic 4 films where I felt like they were more gags meant to be funny that to me, felt really out of place and took any seriousness out of the film, Iron Man has Humor placed just right while stll maintaining a fairly serious tone. My only little nag is I wish there were more fights between Iron Man and opponits/villains but seeing as how this is the first film, what we got was perfect. All in all, this is a smart, well written comic book film that will appeal to the fans of the character and movie goers as a whole.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A charming lead helps to overcome some pretty large narrative deficiencies,"I know what Tony Stark's character arc is supposed to be in this movie. I do not know what it actually is, though.Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer who works on contracts from the United States government. He starts the movie finishing a large sale for a new missile called the Jericho. It produces its large explosions, the military is happy, and Tony makes his sale. His convoy is quickly beset by terrorist forces, Stark is captured, and the terrorists force him to produce a Jericho missile for them in a cave with some leftover Stark weapons they have sitting around. The idea that they have the right materials for a new weapon system from older weapons is a bit ridiculous, but it's probably not quite as ridiculous as the idea that these same weapons have the parts to create a state of the art, miniature, perpetual source of energy that fits into a slot in Tony's chest. But hey, it's a techno-fantasy. Let's just roll with it.Tony produces a suit of armor instead because his captors are idiots who can't tell the difference between a chest plate and a missile casing. With the help of a kindly local doctor who speaks every language the plot requires of him, Tony escapes. It helps that the doctor has the perfect mix of wanting to live long enough to help Tony and wanting to die to join his family in death so he throws his life away to help Tony escape.Tony returns home where he immediately holds a press conference and declares that Stark Industries will never produce weapons again. Everyone freaks out, but then everyone forgets about it about twenty minutes later when Tony just never shows up to work in order to ensure that his radical orders get carried out. Instead, he stays in his mansion over a cliff looking out at the ocean and plays with his toys. That is, he upgrades his cave suit for the 21st century and gives himself a new miraculous source of eternal energy for his chest (ordering the old one, which could conceivably power a house for some time, to be thrown out).Okay, so let's take a step back and try to figure out what Tony's arc is. He starts the movie as a playboy arms dealer. He gets captured and realizes that his weapons are being sold to terrorists. He gets home and starts the process (without ever following up) to end all weapons manufacture in his company. He then proceeds to build his own weapon in the form of a high-tech suit which he then uses to kill a bunch of people, protecting some family we've never met before. So, what's the arc? He almost grows and then doesn't? He starts as a playboy and ends as a...murderous playboy? Yeah, he protects people, so I guess that's it, using his tools for good instead of just not paying attention to who uses them. It's confused and thin.Oh, and let's get to the antagonist of the film, Obadiah Stane. Stane makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are really two parts to his villainy, so let's take it one at a time. The first part occurs before the action of the movie. He arranges for Tony to be kidnapped and murdered by the terrorists before Tony ever leaves. Why? The closest we get is that Tony doesn't take the business side of things seriously. He doesn't show up to an awards ceremony. I mean, I guess that's good enough reason to murder the CEO and lifelong friend. The second part of the characters villainy occurs after Tony returns from the caves. Obviously, Stane isn't going to like the idea of Stark shutting down a major division of the company, but he actually ends up ensuring that the steps Tony wants to happen never happen. There's a shock to the system (highlighted by talk of the company's stock price dropping), but once Tony's in his little lab working (for supposedly weeks), things seem to be going on as normal at Stark Industries. So, of course Stane recreates Tony's original suit in a larger form and goes on a kill crazy rampage which only Tony can stop.Stane has bugged me since I first saw this movie in 2008, and I just can't shake the fact that there must be at least ten minutes of deleted scenes explaining a lot of this. But whether they're on a home video release as extras or not, all that matters is what's in the movie itself, and the movie chose to make Stane completely nonsensical (probably for ""pacing"" reasons).Alright, I've ragged on this movie enough. I'm far from hating it. The action is good. Robert Downey Jr. is fun as Stark and carries most of the movie despite my problems with Tony's arc. It looks good in a clean and straightforward sort of way. The music is functionally complimentary to the action on screen. If you ignore the fact that none of the characters do anything that makes a lick of sense, it's actually fairly entertaining when it's not being overly serious. I remember liking this movie a whole lot more in 2008 than now, though I never loved it like many people do. Eleven years later, rewatching it for the first time in about a decade, I have to say that I was actually really disappointed in it overall.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Start of a brilliant and amazing franchise,"When Iron Man came out in 2008, I didn't know much about the character except that he was a Marvel comic book character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. After watching the movie, I fell in love with Iron Man. He became one of my favorite comic book superheros along with Batman and the X-Men. The movie is the reason why I started collecting comic books and graphic novels. Iron Man 1 is an awesome start to what has become an amazing and well-loved franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a modern take on the origin story of Tony Stark and how he became Iron Man. Stark is the CEO of Stark Industries, a company that creates weapons which he inherited from his father, Howard Stark. Tony is a self-describe ""genius, playboy, billionaire, philanthropist."" While in Afghanistan, he is captured by a terrorist group called the Ten Rings who want him to build weapons for them to use. With the help of fellow prisoner, Yinsen, Stark creates a primitive suit of armor with some weapons and escapes. Because of his escape, Tony has a chance of heart and sets out to become a new hero called Iron Man.The movie does a brilliant job of keeping the audience entertained. It has a great cast. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. He does such a good job that it's hard to separate the character from the actor. Iron Man has a great supporting cast like Jeff Bridges, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Terrance Howard. The movie has a great soundtrack, story-line, and special effects.Iron Man is one of the best superhero movies that I've seen in years. Everything about this movie is brilliant. It never gets old over time. Iron Man is starts the MCU with a bang. Definitely a comic book movie that everyone should watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Memo To Hollywood: The Situation In Afghanistan Is NO JOKE!,"I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. - I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon!It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have alway got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, some of the Merchants of Death literally have a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)!Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I was NOT expecting this.,"I had seen the trailer, and thought it to be 'just another movie' cashing in on today's trend of superhero films. I was never into those kind of movies either. However, pretty soon the name 'Iron Man' was popping up everywhere. In conversation, internet chat-rooms, everything. So, when some people I knew were off to see it, I thought I may tag along. Just to see what the hype was about... I was quite surprised when I walked out of the cinema that day. There are many things that makes this movie highly entertaining - the first, it must be said, was the amazing performance of Robert Downey Jr. as the main character 'Tony Stark'. He played the role of rich American playboy very well. The actual character Tony Stark was someone who I really empathized with I felt sorry for him as the movie progressed, for reasons I won't spoil here. As for the storyline, it's very engaging. For the most part, I found it realistic and believable. Tony Stark didn't have magic or super powers. For me, this was a refreshing change from the typical 'bitten-by-something-radioactive' story. Though I highly enjoyed this film, I found the beginning quite slow. Which brought down it's mark a little. It did take a little while for me to become immersed. Secondly, I felt the character Obadiah Stane (antagonist, played by Jeff Bridges) could have been explored a lot more. However, these minor points pale in comparison to the high points of this very fun film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Greatest Comic Book Movie...Period.,"Iron Man is just genius and not only does it live up to the hype, it obliterates with great acting, great dialog, clever humor, and awesome action sequences throughout. What made this movie is simple...Robert Downey Jr. He literally became Iron Man and his stunning performance blew me away. There is really nothing to say bad about this film except one thing, and it's minor. I believe there should have been more action sequences, not a whole bunch, just a little more and I would have given this movie a perfect 10. Overall, Iron Man is the best superhero movie to date, great actors, excellent visuals, and best of all, the amazing script to this film. I haven't seen such an outstanding script in years. This movie practically delivered on all accounts.I give Iron Man a very solid:4.5/5 or 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everything one could hope for in a superhero blockbuster,"With comic book films becoming an increasingly common component of the summer blockbuster season, the question emerges: how to make a mark as unique in the midst of so much superpowered competition while still holding true to the elements which made the originals such successes in the first place? It would seem director Jon Favreau has found the answer. From the opening chords of AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" it becomes instantly apparent that Iron Man is going to be a different kind of comic book movie. Instead of the filmmaker's usual aspirations to have the source material adapted as darker and grittier than its comic book origins could ever have been, Favreau is not afraid to embrace a very much needed sense of fun without descending into the rampant silliness which consumed Tim Story's Fantastic Four. As such, Iron Man essays a superb balance between embracing every last enjoyable detail while maintaining the gravitas and complexity of its original story and characters, a seamless melding of intelligence and action clout.What really sells the film is its intelligent script, with a series of astutely crafted lines a far cry from the usual clunking variety which could have been conceived by the average six year old boy. Favreau's Robert Altman influence also leads to some highly enjoyable improvisations on top of the scripted material (Downey Jr.'s exchanges with his robotic helpers are priceless). Similarly. by updating Stark's backstory from Vietnam to a more topical Afghanistan, the film has added political poignancy, making some intriguing tongue in cheek comments about the American military. While the occasional lapse in realism and occasionally conventional character motivations may prove problematic to some, such are easily excusable considering the medium from which the story is faithfully adapted, and Favreau's solid directing outweighs such inconsequential concerns with a sheer unabashed sense of enjoyment and unfiltered movie magic.Though the bulk of the story is dedicated to the usual origin tale, Favreau by no means skimps on the jaw-dropping action setpieces, generating some genuinely gripping and tense sequences (Stark's capture in Afghanistan is visceral and engrossing) as well as the requisite adrenaline pumping exhilarating ones - Stark's testing of his Mark One armour to escape captivity is full throttle entertainment and the final showdown is easily the show stopping setpiece of the year thus far. The film's flawless special effects are perfectly executed, used to full effect without ever swamping the picture. The Iron Man armour itself both looks and sounds brilliant, a clanking cacophony of assembled parts coming together for a heart pumping streamlined exterior. Similarly, the musical score, while not the most original, provides some suitably heroic themes and proves enthralling in its own right.Enough praise cannot be bestowed upon Robert Downey Jr., who, overcoming every last inch of apprehension over his casting, is by far the key element to Iron Man's standing out from the waves of other superhero films. Delivering one of the strongest performances in his formidable career, Downey Jr. effortlessly inhabits every last contradictory inch of Tony Stark like the pristine suits the character himself dons. Putting his own unorthodox spin on the character through his wisecracking, motormouthed energy, Downey Jr. still stays true to the spirit of Stark and his darker overtones, even making the transition from callous, arrogant billionaire weapons vendor to iron clad humanitarian feasible through his extraordinary charisma and gleaming, passionate intensity. To say that Downey Jr. is perfect for the role is an understatement; a testament to the use of quality actors for bringing immortalised comic book figures to life instead of ham-handed fresh young faces chosen for looks over talent.While the rest of the cast cannot quite match up to Downey Jr.'s dynamo of a performance, all prove equally adept in adapting their comic book incarnations in a plausible fashion. Terrence Howard delivers an appropriately curt dignity to Stark's military ally Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes, adding the perfect clipped acerbic deadpan to the character. Similarly, Gwyneth Paltrow makes a surprisingly convincing potential love interest as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts, her natural charisma and share of icy comebacks easily proving a superb foil to Downey Jr.'s livewire of a performance. Jeff Bridges moulds his usual laid back image into one of a despicably greedy businessman concealing his shockingly selfish dealings under a veneer of oily respectability, his unconventional performance easily overcoming the trappings of his otherwise conventional villain figure. Shaun Toub is charming as Yinsen, the mysterious scientist who saves Stark's life in Afghanistan and helps him construct his first suit of armour, with Toub's irreverent edge preventing the role from becoming a stock ""mentor"" figure.Simply put, Iron Man is everything a comic book movie could hope to be: a perfect balance between the grittily serious and exuberantly enjoyable, flawless special effects and a roster of incredible performances. Iron Man proves an example of the quintessential blockbuster: one not afraid to think while simultaneously bludgeoning with entertainment - for those in search of entertainment without jeopardising brain cells, Iron Man should prove just the thing.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An action film which doesn't put special effects ahead of character development,"I read the script and worked on this film, so I'm probably prejudiced. But I'm also not a fan of action adventure films which are low on character development and high on endless special effects. Thankfully, this isn't that kind of film. This is probably the most character driven superhero film since Christopher Reeves' ""Superman"". Downey was born for this role. You could see that in the original screen test (which they should include as a bonus on the DVD release). Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges are also very strong and although Terrence Howard comes off a little soft, director Jon Favreau cut out his weaker moments.The music is great, both in the needle drops chosen and in the original score. Lots of humor peppered throughout the movie and the film makes some good moral points as well.

Great  Action Movie,"By way of introduction, I have no background at all with the Ironman comics or character. I also have very little experience with the ""superhero"" movie genre, and most of the little I've seen was not that good. Thus, all of this was totally new to me so I was able to see the movie through ""unbiased"" eyes and with relatively low expectations.I loved it! A fabulous movie from start to finish. Downey's characterization of Stark was superb, with just the right mix of humor and obnoxiousness to make him endearing, rather than annoying (I especially liked the first twenty minutes or so when he was really over the top). Jeff Bridges was so heavy as to be almost unrecognizable, but played his part well. Everyone else seemed credible in their roles; the Gwyneth Paltrow character was even properly subdued and the chemistry between she and Downey was realistically uncomfortable.I guess that the best praise I can give to this movie is that it did not feel like a ""superhero"" movie. Everything was driven by at least superficially-plausible earthly technology, rather than the usual range of superpowers.My only regret is that it's probably a bit too intense for my seven-year old; perhaps in a few years. I'll look forward to seeing it again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An unexpected blockbuster,"I gotta admit, like most other people I was not a big fan of Iron Man comics or Robert Downey Jr, but after seeing this movie I have new respect for the actor and the character. With his drug/alcohol problems of the past it seemed like Downey would be the perfect guy to portray someone who went through a similar experience and cleaned up his act. Now with Spider-Man being Marvel's mascot, I was very surprised that they made me want to see more of a character that wasn't exactly a house hold name. Big congrats to Favreau & co. for pulling this off. So which makes me wonder how incredible major properties such as Fantastic Four, Hulk & Captain America could have been with the right people on the projects. This movie was so good it's hard to even watch earlier superhero films because they will not be at the level this one is. The actors, especially Downey did a fantastic job and were believable in their roles. As Stark, he perfectly captured the self serving smart ass as well as the guy who redeems himself by using his weapons for good. The story & CGI were amazing especially the origin sequence & the unveiling of the final version of the Iron Man suit. Only gripe is that maybe there could have been more action or a more major villain from the comics, but hey they're just getting started. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel and hope the same quality continues for this new franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The message has become insisting especially having failed in its war on Iraq. America finds no any other alternative way to intimidate the world but by producing such ridiculous fiction movies.

I didn't expect this movie to be so awesome!,"Marvel comics has unleashed superhero movies from The Spider-Man Trilogy, The X-Men Trilogy, The Hulk films, The Fantastic Four films, The Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider, where now the metallic superhero Iron Man makes his screen debut.To be honest, I didn't know too much about Anthony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man since I was into Spider-Man, the X-Men and Hulk. But once I slipped on the DVD, I got more than I bargain for.Robert Downey Jr. portrays smart technician billionaire and media lover Tony Stark who's gone off to Iraq in showing the army the latest weapons he created until being captured by the enemy. While being a prisoner, he must make the weapons or else he'll be killed off; his heart has been transplanted by a ball device where if it's taken off his chest, he'll die instantly. As a prisoner, Tony gets help from another prisoner by creating a metallic suit to shield himself as he escapes from the underground caves and later thinks about how with his inventions he can get rid of evil after learning that his weapons were not only used by the U.S. army but by the Iraq soldiers as well.It's fun to watch Downey Jr.'s character as Stark trying to reinvent the machine and at the same time learning from his mistakes that nobody's perfect. His performance is a balanced of comedy and serious technique like watching Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Tony Stark/Iron Man is a good comeback for Robert Downey Jr. who's really had a bit of ups and downs in the past years of his career, but he finally found the right character at last.Jon Favreau (Swingers) directs the film balancing a sense of reality along with mixing humor, action, a bit of romance, adventure, screw-ups, and thrills along the way. Other than Downey Jr. in the film, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who isn't a damsel in distress compared to most leading ladies but a tough cookie who knows everything about her employer and speaks the truth. Terrance Howard plays Stark's friend Col. James Rhodes who'll back him up in anyway while making sure that the billionaire doesn't do anything to screw up. And there's Jeff Bridges who plays Obidiah Stane, Stark's business partner with a few secrets of his own.To conclude, Iron Man rocks in every way! Just be sure to stick around after the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo performance as Nick Fury.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best comic book movies of all time!!!,"I went to see Iron Man on Saturday afternoon. I truly believe that this is one of the best superhero movies ever! It certainly is an improvement over some of the other comic book movies to come out of Marvel's lineup, like the disappointing Spider-Man 3.Robert Downey Jr. makes one of the greatest performances ever as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is hysterical and is the best part of the whole movie. It's almost non-stop laughter with him, except of course when he is in danger and when he gets into fights with the bad guys. The rest of the cast is also very good. Jeff Bridges is amazing as the villain of the movie Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger. The character is wicked, and Daniels does a great job at playing the role. Terrence Howard is good as Jim Rhodes, while Gwyneth Paltrow proves to be a good love interest for Downey Jr. as Stark's assistant Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts.The special effects are incredible and the action is fun and awesome. Sometimes I couldn't tell when the suit was real or not. The comedy is very good, way better than I expected it to be. I do agree with critics who are saying that the one thing to complain about is the length of the movie: WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE IT LONGER!? Hopefully Jon Favreau will release an extended edition when the theatrical cut comes out on DVD or shortly after that.Great job Jon Favreau!

Brilliant,"Had I been the producer of this film I would never have cast Downie in the role of Tony Stark, and what a mistake that would have been. Robert Downie Jr gave an amazing depiction of Stark that was totally true to the character as envisioned by his creator and along with Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltro to name a few the cast did a brilliant job of bringing the Iron Man story to life. The story line was well thought out and flowed like a mountain stream, the balance between action and humour was as close to perfect as could ever be wished for, the entire film was engaging from start to finish even the music couldn't be faulted and as for the props, I really want an Audi R8 of my own now. This was one film that left the viewer begging for more and the last line (pre credits that is) no-one could fault that one. Brilliant work, lets hope the sequel is as good but the bar has been set pretty high by this first outing.The Commander",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Parental Warning! A comic book movie not for the wee ones!,"Generally on IMDb I only contribute about movies that don't get heavily reviewed, but I felt I could contribute with a warning for parents. This may not be a movie for very young children. It's not that the violence is especially bloody, mostly it is not, but young children tend to relate to other young children in movies and there are a few scenes of children facing violence which they may find disturbing. I won't be explicit because I don't want to check the spoiler warning. Children over 10 should be OK, but at the showing I attended there were children much younger than that. Unfortunately, many parents are going to think their 5 year old may enjoy it because it's ""just a comic book movie"" without realizing that comics today aren't their Grandparent's comics. In today's comics superheroes have sex and sometimes they even die. I doubt you'll hear many people warning parents about this, as we've become so used to violence. But if you would be concerned about your 5 year old watching another 5 year old facing the possible the murder of their parent or even their own death, then you may not wish to let them see this.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"An Intelligent, Entertaining Superhero Movie","Iron Man was coming on TV today and since me and my friends are going to 'Iron Man 2' sometime next week, I watched it to recall the characters and see if I still liked it like 2 years back. I am very happy to say that the second time I loved it even more. John Favreau directed this amazing movie which is one of the best superhero movies ever. I am keeping my fingers crossed, that Iron Man 2 will be a truly worthy successor to this amazing gem. Also, if anybody has a lifestory to tell, Downey Jr. has the ultimate comeback tale to tell. After all those stints in rehab and prison, he came back revamped in a new avatar and 2008 and 2009 were his years. He has become on of my favorite actors now.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is rich, handsome, intelligent, quick witted, incredibly wealthy and a playboy. He is the owner of Stark Industries which specializes in making warheads for the US military. He is kidnapped by an Afghanistan terrorist group who forces him to help them make his new, modern missiles. But Tony Stark, along with another Afghan scientist who is kidnapped, builds a suit of iron and escapes from their stronghold. Unfortunately the scientist is killed and he returns to his home. He has now seen that his weapons are in the hands of the bad guys and wants to stop the production of the warheads. But Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) advices him against this, because the consequences will be too great. Stane was his father's best friend and a business partner and he is now a major player in the Stark Industries and a close confidante of Tony Stark. Will Tony Stark make a difference in the world with his Iron Man?This is kind of a breath of fresh air to the superhero genre. It doesn't have all the baggages of other superheroes. Tony Stark is a man who enjoys life and he is a ladies man. I thought, what were they thinking by casting a middle aged man like Downey Jr, but that was before I saw the movie. After watching and being enthralled by the story, I accept that Downey was really born to play the role of Iron Man. The underplayed romance between Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark works well for the story. Tony Stark changed his views about weapons after seeing what it did to other people who were in the line of fire. He wasn't a born justice upholder like other superheroes and he is a man behind all that metallic gear. This is what makes Iron Man so much more endearing. If the character of Obadiah Stane was played by any other actor other than Jeff Bridges, it would have been simply awful. I didn't even know who Jeff was before this year's Oscar, but I still remember hating his evil persona character back when it released. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best friend Rhodey, who is an officer in the US military and his character is under written. But, I thought he would get a chance to display his acting in the second movie, but they have put some other man in his part and it is so sad that he won't be a part of Iron Man 2. The banter of Stark with his robotic assistants, the freezing of the Iron Man suit and everything except the final battle is brilliant. The final battle is supposed to be like that, so I can't hate Favreau for that.The background score is awesome and the cgi effects seemed insanely real. Iron Man 2 released here yesterday (so sad its releasing late here) and I hope it will be awesome :)9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Iron Man Begins"" basically in a very enjoyable film","No need to explain who Iron Man is (I hope!), i.e. that guy in the iron suit (surprise surprise) who used to pop up in Spiderman and Marvel cartoons etc when we were all younger. Anyhow away from the comic books, they've now made a film for the character, and takes Robert Downey Junior as Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) to fight the good fight for truth justice and all the rest.Basic story is that its ""Iron Man Begins"" like as was with ""Batman Begins"" and takes us through the origins of the character etc. Mix in explosions, mega robot v robot fight and all the rest, and surprisingly a lot of good humour and you have here a surprisingly good film. I never expected to enjoy this much but this is well worth it. Even Gwenyth Paltrow was well-suited, whilst Jeff Bridges was good as always.A big plus word for the visual effects, which were very good and fitted in well into the movie, and didn't overtake the whole film as it could have, getting the balance right.Recommended viewing. Not as great as Batman Begins, but you'll still enjoy it a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superhero who isn't a pussy is a refreshing change,"Iron Man is not like other superhero films we have come to know. Unlike, batman, superman and spider-man, Iron Man does not suffer from mental illnesses. He doesn't stalk his girlfriend, pine over his dead uncle, or wish his parents hadn't got shot when he was a kid. Iron Man, just wants to kill bad guys. Another flattering aspect of Iron Man, is his lack of an alter ego. We don't have to watch in panic as Iron Man quickly gets on his iron suit before someone sees him changing. Instead, he boasts ""I AM IRON MAN"". Another very enjoyable aspect of the Iron Man film, is the setting. Not in a fictional city where the crime rate needs to be high, but in Afghanistan where it actually is. Bottom Line, Iron Man kills people. Nuff said. When did Spiderman, Batman or Superman last kill someone? Pussies! Iron Man is not a pussy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very Good video clip/passable US Air Force recruitment film/horrible movie,"One asks himself what if Marvel or DC Comics did not exist what would become Hollywood ? I mean once had been cradle of art and creativity these studios are throwing their resources , talents and investments to make clichéd worn out predictable comic book adaptations nowadays. In a few instances they are OK in artistic sense due to talented acting , decent and deep characterization and finely balanced dramatic writing with CGI or special effects are as required nothing more nothing less. (no matter how impressive they are)Unfortunetely Iron Man does not belong to this category. This is a movie produced and edited as a video clip. It has every cliché imaginable expected from a big but empty headed Hollywood blockbuster inspired from comic book aimed for 15 year olds. Cartoonish characters , sterile environment , lots of CGI , lame jokes/humor , unbelievably silly story (he made a super powerful weapon suit inside a cave ? PLEASE !!!) , hot chicks , fast cars , US Army being source of goodness around the world , swarthy Middle Eastern looking like bad guys who are evil just sake of it ( and getting their asses kicked of course as always) , an arch villain who boasts a lot , a final boss level showdown where superhero thriumps without any cost or after consequence....I understand there are lots of fans of that kind of things but frankly I am bored with them...I can endure even ignore clichés or predictability if movie presented something new , unique or original...Nope everything went down exactly I predicted above.....As for acting it is hit and miss really...Robert Downey Jr. shows a really decent performance here since his character Tony Stark is the center of story. Unfortunetely his character is nothing more than a Bruce Wayne wannabe. Mrs Patrow is usual damsel in distress...Jeff Bridges is usual uber nemesis without maniacal laugh or mustache twirling (he does have a beard though) Terence Howard is just awful. He doesn't have even a slight military presence....I see this as a trend....Comic book superhero adaptations just aimed to entertain and please fans of genre or very young or sub educated people who can be dazzled with CGI , explosions and awful characterization/dialog. Due to money making reasons (undeniable result of Hollywood becoming an industry to make profit) it is a popular trend now but this is not cinema.....I do not see a future for Iron Man (in creative sense) except a few sequels then audience will probably shift to next superhero like Superman , Spider Man , Hulk , Fantastic Four etc or its sequel/remake....They are basically same unfortunately...",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It doesn't get much better than this,"Quite possibly the best comic movie ever, hovering around the level of the first Spider-Man (before Raimi lost his mind). Robert Downey Jr was as perfect a casting job as we've been expecting, Bridges plays Obidiah Stane that you won't even think of him as The Dude, the CG doesn't suck,and it doesn't try to cram too much...(read more) in (the runtime of just over two hours feels just right). Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again.

"""Iron Man"" the Stark Superhero of Marvel","JJ Rating: A+Billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) of Stark Enterprises visits Afghanistan to show off his new weapon. Upon being attacked by rebels he sees his weapons were in their hands. They kidnapped him and wanted him to make them a weapon, but instead he creates a suit that will evolve him into Iron Man.It's another billionaire hero. In this case one that is more deviant than the Bat and far wittier than the Spider. Iron Man is exactly that: he's a man's man. He sleeps around, he drinks and he is cockier than necessary and he doesn't even get paid millions to play a sport. Well he gets billions to create inventive weaponry for America.Iron Man was never my cup of tea. But when I heard that Robert Downey Jr. was going to play him I was sure that if there ever was a thing like cinematic perfection, that that was it. From that point on I was excited to see the film.What would I want more from this film? I can't really think of anything. It's not perfect but what movie is? It's just really good. I wanted to see the Black Widow somehow but that was not going to happen. I'm really pleased with the after credits scene. STAY AFTER THE CREDITS.What did I love about the film? Iron Man's suit. That suit was so freaking cool. I loved the way it looked, how it was put on, what it looked like in flight, how it sounded when it moved about, how it looked when it was damaged. It was just wow. I liked how Iron Man was just intelligent and figured out to do the practical thing without taking too much time to moralize everything. I like the wit of Tony Stark and how Robert Downey Jr. just perfectly fit the role as if he were born to play it.Terrence Howard mad a great Rohdey. As-a-matter-of-fact there were several scenes that just make a comic nerd giddy. Count them off, if you can. Jeff Bridges was intimidating and imposing as he needed to be to play Obadiah. Gwyneth Paltrow was Pepper Potts and had the charm and smile to pull it off. I liked the way she walked to. It might have had something to do with her shoes, but still it seemed so intentional for the character and it worked.The story progressed at an even pace and allowed for the development of the entire story within the allotted time. Jon Favreau (who also played the driver who, in the comics, becomes Pepper's love interest) did an iron clad job of directing. He knew what he wanted and executed it and it came out beautifully.The C.G.I. work was eye candy for the super soul. That Iron Man get up was just marvelous. The battles between Iron Man and anyone else was done well. There was not too much and there was not too little. Just like baby bear's porridge. The C.G.I. even helped with some humor moments that were littered throughout the film either by visual gags or witty lines; humor was not missing from the banter heighten Stark.Iron Man, the superhero, is a fine balance of cocky, womanizing, billionaire war mongrel with a touch of heroics all rolled into one likable man. It is simply a work of art. Normally such a person is the villain and not well liked, but not only is he liked in the comic books he's liked in the movie and that is thanks to Robert Downey Jr's portrayal.I was impressed. This is the first movie that Marvel has financed themselves and let's just sayit works magical wonders for them to have more power.There is no question that I will get Iron Man when it comes out on DVD. There is also no question that this will be the number one movie of the weekend and I even guessed that it would make a little over the amount of money it cost to make it. So I'm going to guess about $165 million dollars. Though because of Grand Theft Auto 4 it might be lower, a lot lower or so the nay sayers would scream. Iron Man is the nity-gritty hero, the one that is all bare on who he is and what he wants; he is Marvel's Stark Superhero and Iron Man is the start of a beautiful movie franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth my 25 year wait...,"In 1984, when I was 9 and living in Texas somewhere, my Dad asked what I wanted for my birthday. We where pretty poor and I knew it, but I had seen these kids reading comics at school and I wanted to know what the deal was. So I told him I wanted some comic books and he seemed relieved because back then they where only like 40 cents to a dollar. So he took me to the nearest 7-11 and my eyes almost immediately locked on to 2 titles, Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles #1 and Iron Man #180. The TMNT license never panned out to what I wanted. Other than the comics themselves, I was subjected to wave after wave of shittastic cartoons and half-witted movies. While, IM did have some cartoon exposure over the years, it was just never that good. I also knew that the cinematic technology of the time would not lend itself well to a live action IM movie. So I waited. Patiently. Watching the progression of CGI and costumes and feeling conflicted on what medium I wanted to see my my favorite superhero portrayed in. I'll admit, I'm a fan of CGI and had been hoping for an IM movie in the vein of the Final Fantasy or Appleseed style animations. So, when I herd that IM was going to be live-action, I was worried to say the least I was shockingly and joyfully surprised to have my worries dashed against my doubt. At the risk of sounding like a mewling fanboy, I have to say this is the best superhero movie I have ever seen. Almost 25 years I have been waiting for an Iron Man movie. Now that it has arrived, I could not be happier. There where legions of nay-sayers when RDJ was announced as Tony Stark. I was not one of them. He was a great choice and he somehow managed to tap into my imagination and deliver the performance I was hoping for. The witty, over the top confident, sarcastic pimp that I prayed to Kirby for was delivered in full. John Favreau, an admitted fan or IM, did the license justice with out going over the top in character expression or over stuffing the plot. The acting complemented the writing in a manner not expected from most movies of this sort. Well, not by me anyway. The Three Headed Monster of Stan Winston, ILM and Sky Walker Sound kicked the living guts out of anything I have seen previous to this movie. Not once did I get that CGI lag or clunky costume feeling. They blended the live-action and CGI very well and I truly believed. A+ to Iron Man and all involved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Hi-tech action thriller,I was a little reluctant to watch Ironman because I wasn't very impressed by a storyline in which a billionaire war profiteer turns into a superhero. I was even a bit more skeptical when I learned that Downey Jr. would be playing the lead role. Downey Jr. first caught my attention in U.S. Marshals and since then I have always looked forward to watching him on the big screen. Again his witty personality and charm wins me over in Ironman although I must admit I was more captivated by Bridges and Paltrows performances. I was never a fan of Paltrow until I saw her in Ironman as Starks (Downey Jr.) kind hearted and clever assistant. I only wish that she had been given a bit more screen time. This high energy action packed film will appeal to most audiences though I wouldn't waste your money buying it...I would just rent it or borrow it instead like I did.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The explanation that why he turned into a hero, is completely retarded for a guy who is a genius and people saying to him ""hey your weapons are sold in the black market"" with his logo and everything, he goes ""I didn't know now Im going to be a hero"".

It was fun, to-the-point, and surprising inspirational.I liked the special effects. They weren't over-the-top (I've seen superhero movies with shiner, fancier things) but they were suitable to the story and, if I can say so, fairy realistic and down-to-earth.

Good but not THAT good,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film despite being very dubious going into it after seeing a ridiculous trailer. John Favreau has done a really good job of handling the material and bringing it all together in an entertaining way. The story flows nicely and there is a superb balance between story, character background and action scenes. The film has its weaknesses however and is flattered by its current rating at the time of writing (around 8) The characters lack any real depth and their personalities are not really developed. I hate to compare this to the new batman films but that was an example of how a superhero film could allow for real character development allowing the audience to build a complete picture of the protagonists. I agree most people want to see films like this simply for the action and explosions but I think many others now expect a bit more from action films.

This film is just OK !,"What can I say? I was so excited to see this movie 'cause it was rated highly along with very good comments, I really couldn't wait.But when I started watching the movie for the first 10 minutes, I knew the story wouldn't go so far but again about a same-old same-old hero.I definitely assure that the script is nothing but a boring, incoherent and unreasonable. The first thing I would like to point out is the change in Tony's mind. A man who has been designing weapon for decades like him wouldn't change his mind just because of being kidnap, and there is nothing which hits to his mind to make the change. In other words, it looks like the story line is not so convincing at all.In addition, what is the meaning of the movie after all this? Personally I didn't feel my heart was touched by both story and the acting. Fairly, the movie really has humor scenes but they're even not deep enough to tickle audiences. A same-old ""weird"" relationship between a man and a woman needs to be acted professionally and creatively enough to bring not only the story but also all the emotion behind that.

Nothing new here but done oh so well,"Over the past decade or so, the superhero movie genre has been a mixed bag of sorts. Ranging from the awful 'Spiderman 3' culminating in Christopher Nolan's gloriously brilliant Batman films. 'Iron Man' was released in the same summer as 'The Dark Knight' and while nobody (especially myself) expected it to succeed I am please to reveal that Jon Favreau has produced a fine film that achieves everything it should. For anyone not familiar with the plot of Iron Man (such as myself, having never seen the comic books), it revolves around Tony Stark, a military arms dealer building a robotic suit to combat the problems his previously designed weapons have caused. The narrative is quickly established and the suits origination is revealed from an early stage, however the film does take a while to get going and the action sequences don't kick in until much into the film. This is not to say that 'Iron man' is dull, in fact it is far from it. The script is quick and snappy, Robert Downey Jnr delivering his witty lines well and setting up a tensional relationship with his assistant Gwyneth Paltrow which becomes a vital subplot throughout. Comedy is also used to great effect here, always noticeable in a light-hearted superhero film but perhaps more evident here; the laughs churned out frequently keep the film moving at a fast tempo. When the action does begin though it does not disappoint, the special effects and explosions are magnificent and are in keeping with the grand scale of the film. The latter fight sequences are also a joy to behold, bearing quite a resemblance to 'Transformers'. More impressively, the performances of the actors are excellent. The aforementioned Robert Downey Jnr gets most of the gags, but nevertheless Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard all put in good performances.Iron man is a definite hit, but not quite perfect. As with most superhero movies the narrative is predictable and the villain of the movie is not a well kept secret. There is also a lack of substance beneath all the gloss and a few of the characters are 2-D and given little time to develop. The finale is also a little weak and feels rushed and finally you will need to suspend disbelief an awful lot if you want to take certain events seriously.Overall though,'Iron Man' is the surprise of 2008, a well made, well produced film that pushes all the right buttons. With a great soundtrack and terrific effects, 'Iron Man' is nothing new but everything we've seen before done really very well.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Enjoyable, but won't have repeat  viewing value","This is the brazilianth superhero movie to come out the US in the last picosecond. And it's not too bad, but, like with most of them, I doubt I will be as willing to see any subsequent sequels.In its favour is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man. The movie is basically boot-camp for people unfamiliar with the titular hero. In other words, you get the genesis of the character ""Iron Man"". Stark, as played by Bob Downey is smug, but fortunately comes with a dry sense of humour. Stark is a brazilianaire who inherited his fortune from his military industrialist father. Utilising his own scientific brilliance, Tony Stark has carried on in his father's footsteps and is now the supplier of choice for the US military.His Personal Assistant is Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Quirky name, but not in the same league as Pussy Galore, or Alotta Fagina. Paltrow provides her character with a degree of warmth...and coolth. She is reminiscent of some of Woody Allen's leading ladies at times, too, like Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton.Anyway, the story is basically about how Tony has a crisis of conscience after he gets a taste of his own medicine, arms wise, in the Middle East. Generic Middle Eastern terrorists are one of the main bad guys in this film.In a way this is an American fantasy about itself. In Hollywood movies like this, America plays the hero in the Middle East and Americans care a lot about not inflicting civilian casualties. This is ably demonstrated by Iron Man in one scene where the phrase ""surgical strike"" is not pure spin.A theme of this movie is the struggle between the individual conscience and that of society or bodies like the military/Pentagon. Stark has a foot in both camps and thus sometimes mud will stick where you least expect it to.As I was just about to leave the theatre, after the end credits, an extra scene appeared, hinting at the nature of the sequel. Dunno if I'll see it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man is ....................................Zzz,"When I watched the Iron Man trailer, I figured okay this movie will be entertaining and something fun to see. Well I guess I was somewhat right. You could say I was somewhat entertained but I don't know maybe that would be an exaggeration. Characters with 1 dimension. Terrible plot. SPOILER: Terribly developed fight scene between Iron Monger and Iron Man, which just made me sick. The Incredible Hulk was better than this film and much more entertaining. I am still shocked as to how this movie got better reviews than the Hulk, and how it is on the top 250 movie list. If your looking for thrills and chills then I'm not sure you want to see this movie. If you want to see your favorite comic book character in a movie then don't be angry when your in your seat saying ""WTF"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not very super, but quite heroic!","'Iron Man' is the surprise superhero hit from Marvel Studios which charts the tale of billionaire weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark, to the flying metal superhero 'Iron Man.' It seemed that, despite its impressive budget, no one quite imagined this lesser (when compared with the more famous – and bankable – superheroes such as Spiderman, Batman and Superman) hero to become quite as bigger box office draw as it turned out. And it definitely isn't 'wall-to-wall action' which drew the crowds in.To be honest, there isn't an awful lot of 'Iron Man' in Iron Man the movie. Our hero, Tony Stark (expertly played by Robert Downey Jr) only gets inside his costume about three times in a two hour movie. Therefore, don't expect a load of 'Michael Bay-style' explosions every few minutes.You have to get the 'origins' side of Iron Man out of the way here, showing how he transgresses from playboy billionaire to concerned citizen, prepared to put his life on the limb to save the world. So a lot of the story is taken up with HOW he becomes the titular character.However, don't let any lack of action fool you into thinking this isn't going to be one hell of a ride. Somehow, everything just works and the two hours fly by faster than Iron Man outrunning some jet fighters.You don't have to love comic books or superheroes to appreciate that this is a really fun film. It's nowhere near as dark as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and sticks to its upbeat and colourful comic book roots. It's a great popcorn film for all the family and even having Gwyneth Paltrow in it doesn't detract from the fun element *miaow!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very excellent depiction of the comic book,"As a kid I've never read comic books, and is still true to this day, but I have seen a lot of cartoons that are based on comic books. When I first viewed the character of the Iron Man, I gotta say that he was probably the least favorite hero of all the many others, such as Spiderman, Superman, X-Men, etc... It didn't fit that fantasy of superheroes that have some kind of unnatural super power. So I certainly didn't get excited when I first heard that Iron Man was going to become a film.For the film itself there really wasn't much to the story that I haven't seen before. There are heroes and there are villains--as simple as that. Although while viewing the film I actually felt like a little kid again. Everything was just new and cool. The CGI, and the comedy ensued throughout the film really made it extremely entertaining. I thought Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job as the lead, as well as Jon Favreaus' directing. Throughout their careers, usually Downey and Favreau would play supporting roles and hardly ever starring in films, and this film really got'em out of that threshold. They have certainly made an impression on me, with it seeming as if their careers would never take off, or even dwindling, they have gone 'against the grain' and have leaped on to the top of Hollywood.I certainly can't wait for the sequels. It will only get better and better, especially with CGI getting better. With CGI any film is possible, and this film is proof of that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sooo Goood,"When you look back at the influence of Marvel on cinema over the years you have to recognise it as significant. They have changed the types of movies that have been made for 20 years (and it doesn't look like ending soon).This success of Marvel started with Blade, X-Men and Spider-Man however it was Iron Man that really launched the juggernaut that has become Marvel.This is one hell of a movie. Yes it lacks the real gut-wrenching depth of the Dark Knight Trilogy, but it wasn't really aiming for that.This is incredible action, humour met with a good story and the most excellent decision to cast Downey in the titular role.Hit the lights, pump up the volume, popcorn at the ready....GO GO GO",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
not perfect but excels at the hard stuff,"If you like comic book movies, go see Iron Man. It's not my favorite, but it's pretty good. For people who didn't enjoy Batman or Spider-man, seeing this movie would be pointless.Note to parents: This movie is not as psychologically dark as Batman Begins nor does it have the random gross-out violence of Tim Burton's Batman films. If your child can handle the violence of the first Spider-man film, Iron Man is no worse.Reading the rest of my review is only necessary for the few people who really can't make up their minds...Many great comic book movies have outstanding villains, but the baddie in this movie was nothing special. Although certainly evil and menacing, the villain was not very colorful. Nor did he have the entertaining backstory or motivations possessed by many great villains. His history and motivations were quite cut-and-dry.Robert Downey Jr. was the best thing about this film. It's difficult to play a character who is selfish but still likable; Downey Jr. makes it look easy. His Tony Stark is a wealthy, impulsive, boozing, womanizing, fun-loving bachelor who happens to also be an engineering genius. Kudos to the writers for the excellent development of this character.The supporting cast is good, although Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts) is merely adequate. I'm not saying there was anything wrong with her performance, but I believe other actresses could have probably played the Pepper Potts character just as well. I felt that she had weak chemistry with Downey Jr., which is probably the result of their relationship being poorly written. I think the writers couldn't agree on whether Pepper's relationship with Tony should be like Miss Moneypenny with James Bond or more like the early stages of a serious romance. Either way, the scenes shared by Pepper and Tony were disappointing and boring.Director Jon Favreau has an excellent sense of timing. He sucks in the viewer by throwing in danger or humor at precisely the right moments (and often without warning). The humor in this movie was perhaps the best of any comic book movie I've seen. Almost every joke was funny. More importantly, the jokes never made the characters look cheesy, nor did the jokes feel forced.This movie is really fun when Iron Man is kicking butt, but that only happens during a brief portion of the film.Like some other comic book films (e.g. Spider-Man), this movie does a great job of showing the process through which our hero awkwardly tests his new powers, slowly sharpening his skills. Unfortunately, like those other films, we are supposed to believe that the bad guy immediately masters his powers without going through any sort of trial-and-error process.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Downey Delivers,"""Great, all that's on is Iron Man."" I said to my friend. We had missed the show time for the movie I had wanted to see. Upon first seeing a trailer for Iron Man I had low expectations. Just another poorly made comic book adaptation. It will be full of poor acting, crappy computer effects, and lots of action to overcome the lack of writing. Boy, I was wrong. Iron Man completely blew my expectations out of the water. Through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI: this summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please.Robert Downey Jr. is a hell of an actor. If not for him I am not sure I would have made it through Iron Man. It is rare that you find an actor that fits a role so well you forget he is an actor and think of him almost exclusively as the character. That is exactly what Downey brings to this movie. ""Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?"" and ""They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I prefer the weapon you only need to fire once. That's how dad did it, that's how America does it, and it's worked out pretty well so far."" These lines are delivered so genuinely and uniquely by Downey, you can't help but develop a relationship with his character Tony Stark that last throughout the movie.Often times when a screenplay writer can't write a good plot and can't write convincing dialog, they add copious amounts of action. Somehow, they have conceived the notion that if we are overwhelmed with action we won't notice how bad the movie is. However the audience is becoming smarter and no longer easily duped by such tactics. Iron Man did not resort to this. There is action in Iron Man, lots of action. But it is very well written and weaved perfectly into the story so as to enhance it. Iron man starts out with an attention grabbing fight scene. This is followed by many minutes without a giant fire fight where we get to know our protagonist; we bond with him and empathize with him. From then on the action and fight scenes are used sparingly till we arrive at the final fight scene between the protagonist and the antagonist.Several great advances have come to the movie industry from computer technology. One of these is computer generated imagery (CGI). CGI has allowed directors and writers to add elements to movies that were once though to be impossible, either due to price or far fetched ness. One complaint audiences usually voice is that is it too unrealistic. Not the case with Iron Man. The limited CGI use complements the movie well. Iit allows the viewer to vividly see exactly what the director and writers wanted you to see. All of this was accomplished without being annoying and causing the audience to be distracted by the effects.It is rare that a really good action movie based on a comic book comes along. Iron Man is one of those movies. Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post writes that it is full of generic fireballs and that some of the actors need to be cleaned up to make it as a sequel. I disagree. This summer's greatest action movie Iron Man is sure to please through the impeccable choice of characters, well placed action, and great mix of CGI. On a scale of five stars, I would give Iron Man five stars. I enjoyed this action movie so much I might have even paid for it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Whatta Man!,"What is Iron Man anyway? Can we really call him a superhero? As far as I can tell, he's just a guy with a bum heart that happens to be pretty handy in the shop. His superhero development falls more in line with Batman's as neither necessarily has any special power (Wait, my bat-sense is tingling?) but rather relies on strength and gadgetry to get the job done. Even Batman has the dark history to fuel his passion though. What does Iron Man have? His day job is as an arms manufacturing tycoon named Tony Stark. He's got all the money in the world, women throwing themselves at him and the worst part is, he inherited everything from his dad. This silver spoon baby has been set his whole life and now he gets to be admired and adored as a superhero too? Ordinarily, I would give in to my jealousy and scoff at this supposed superhero but Robert Downey Jr., under the fresh direction of Jon Favreau, just makes him too damn cool for me to do anything other than love him.Aside from all this, Iron Man is also hilarious. Make no mistake; he most certainly gets himself into a number of perilous scenarios but he also manages to find something to laugh at no matter how dire the circumstances. While the original comic book found Stark in some life threatening Vietnam war situation (I am not a comic book junkie so I'm afraid I can't get more specific than that), Favreau wanted today's Iron Man to have a contemporary back story and what could be more appropriate than Stark being held prisoner in Osama Bin Laden's former hood, the mountains of Afghanistan. At first, it feels all too easy to place Arab militants as the face of the bad guys but the film vindicates its initial racial vilifying by exposing Stark himself (and therefore, America) as the supplier of these terrorists' entire arsenal. It is Stark's realization that he truly is one of the great mass murderers in American history that wakes him from his comfortable, privileged existence to a new dawn of using his position for positive change. After all, a weapon is only truly a weapon when it is in the wrong hands.IRON MAN is not without its clichés. Stark suffers injuries in the Middle East that requires him to have some form of electro-magnetic contraption lodged in his chest so that little bits of shrapnel don't seep into his blood stream and eventually cut up the arteries in his heart. So what if the ultimate playboy/loner now needs help to sustain a healthy heartbeat when he has walked around for so long acting like he never had a heart in the first place. So what if the man who has everything doesn't truly have anything of real value. These kinds of truisms are the foundation of comic book characters; what genuinely matters is how the men are portrayed and Downey Jr. was born to play to Tony Stark. After rising to critical fame with films like CHAPLIN, personal problems with drug abuse led Downey to years of type casting as characters with drug problems in films like WONDER BOYS and THE SCANNER DARKLY. With IRON MAN, it looks like he might finally be able to wipe his past clean and achieve the heights his talent has always warranted. Though his body is in noticeably better shape, it is his quick-witted delivery and cynical yet sympathetic duality that make Tony Stark the kind of guy everyone wants to hang out with or just plain be.So, what is Iron Man anyway? Well, according to this adaptation, he is the superhero for the modern era. He is sarcastic and skeptical but still hopeful and genuine with those he is close with (most notably, his perfectly matched assistant Pepper Potts, played just as delectably by Gwyneth Paltrow). He is a man who is capable of admitting his failures, not dwelling on them and then fostering a new path for himself. He is the kind of man that is both envied and looked up to. He is building himself a reputation as a superhero that can manage tremendous feats through intelligence and perseverance rather than just brawn and dumb luck. And now, IRON MAN is also a movie that offers perspective on the world around us at the same time as some awesome exhilaration.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"I typically don't take the time to write something like this, but I can make an exception for Iron Man. I am a huge comic book fan, and so far many of the comic book movies have fallen somewhere between mediocre and downright crap. There are exceptions to this rule (Spiderman 1&2, X-Men 1&2, Batman Begins), but Iron Man dominates them all. Downey does an amazing job of portraying the character of Tony Stark and he delivers one liners like no one else can. The composition and editing in the movie is perfect and the pace felt spot on. On top of all this, the visuals and music were the best I've seen and heard yet.Let me put this in perspective for you: my girlfriend fell asleep during Batman Begins and she thought the Spiderman series was ""ok."" She loved Iron Man though and has recommended it to everyone she knows. For a girly girl like her and a comic book nerd like myself to enjoy it, it must be amazing ;).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It doesn't get better than this people!,"It had to happen some day... We all knew the comics where to small for the likes of spider-man, wolverine and batman... they would go to the big screen... some day... DC did it first with their superman and batman movies...marvel was falling behind in the race before they even stepped on the throttle... But then something happened...I wasn't very old when the first x-men movie hit theaters but I remember seeing it and thinking: ""Yes! they're back!"" A lot happened since then. For my part, the x-men trilogy (yes, the third included) carried marvels ambitions for the big screen. I know many people loved the spider-man movies. I absolutely hated them. The hulk was a BIG disappointment, I almost vomited out of sheer anger when I saw the fantastic four and I won't even mention the daredevil movie. I am one of the traitors who thinks batman begins is the best superhero movie ever made...at least until now...Iron man blew me away! it's as simple as that. Everything, and I mean everything, in this movie runs as smooth as a well-greased machine. The cast is nothing short of perfect and Robert Downey Jr. shines as the eccentric playboy turned superhero Tony Stark, Jeff Bridges is a brilliant villain and Gwyneth Paltrow gives just the right amount of female touch to the movie and the chemistry between her and Downey Jr. is amazing.The movie is perfectly balanced between fast-paced, explosive action and well-timed humor. The CG is amazing as it was the first time I was able to see a movie with sports cars of that caliber and think: ""F*ck the cars, give me the suit!"" The movie also functions well for the person who isn't as big a comic geek as yours truly. All comic book adaptations requires a bit of faith and suspension of disbelief as, let's face it, people with anger management issues don't turn big, green and very strong in the real world nor does people who are bitten by spiders get their abilities. But this looks like it could actually happen in a not so far away future.It isn't just a movie about a comic-book superhero beating the crap out of the bad boys. It is also about taking responsibility and having the courage and will to make changes even though it isn't always the easiest way to go. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, It will give you a good laugh and get your pulse pumping.This movie takes Marvel back in the race and with the new Hulk movie coming soon and the likes of Thor and Captain America following not far behind it looks like they're closing the distance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb!,"After Superman, I believed that a man could fly. Now I believe that a man can redeem himself, no matter how badly he's fraked up in the past.And I could not be happier that they choose Robert Downey Jr. to carry this message. It works because it's his story, and it shows that he knows this. His heart is in every frame of this movie, his heart is in every word he utters, and your heart will be in the movie, too.It's a cool movie, with lots of things blowing up and stuff like that. But, it's a well-told human story first and foremost. If the X-Men movies strike a chord, it's because each one of us have known the pains of isolation and exclusion. If the Spider-Man movies strike a chord, it's because we all know the little fears and frustrations that drive our daily lives. And Iron Man? Iron Man is aimed at those of us who have made mistakes in the past and want to redeem ourselves.And, it strikes a chord. Believe me, it strikes a chord.

Iron Man - Almost Super,"A genesis story, Iron Man answers the question, ""Where did Iron Man come from?"" Laughter dots the super hero backdrop that is visually fun to watch but lacks the lift off to be a classic super hero movie.Like the wise one says, ""necessity is the mother of invention"" and Tony Stark's mother birthed the crude chrysalis of Iron Man in a cave in Afghanistan. While demonstrating the Jericho Missile, spoiled, womanizing, arrogant weapons manufacturer and brilliant engineer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr. ) is kidnapped by the Ten Rings terrorist group led by Raza (Faran Tahir). He is seriously injured during the attack. They hold him captive with a kidnapped doctor, Yinsen (Shaun Toub), who saves him from further death by attaching a device to his chest. Yisen and Tony work together to escape alive. Instead of recreating the missile for the terrorists, Tony develops the beginnings of Iron Man, emotionally and mechanically.Iron Man is studded with easily recognizable names camping it up for the story. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts. She runs around in four inch heels, maternally tending to Tony's needs. Her dialogue is fun but a little grating at times because she is a deep as a teaspoon. Terrence Howard plays Jim Rhodes, Tony's friend in the Air Force. He puffs his chest in ways that would make a Marine commercial blush.Iron Man isn't a huge modernized Rock-em Sock-em Robots revision, nor is it a strict superhero movie. It deals with the very beginning of the Iron Man legacy, so it is more Tony's personal development story. He begins as a self absorbed, uncaring, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante with no regard for the consequences of how his money is made. By the end he is a self absorbed, skirt chasing billionaire dilettante who cares about the people around him, where his money comes from and what people do with his weapons.There is no shortage of scenes meant to make you laugh that add nearly nothing to the plot of Iron Man, including one with stripper flight attendants. The scenes meant to evoke laughter sometimes force the audience into an uncomfortable giggle, like a chuckle one might give their unfunny uncle. It isn't all middle aged relatives; some of the laughter was well earned. His machines are fun, his mistakes are entertaining and his arrogance earned more than a few smiles.The scenes where Robert Downey Jr. is Iron Man are exhilarating. I found myself clapping for flame throwers; how often do you get to do that in real life? I was fond especially of the learning scenes where Tony was trying to perfect Iron Man's suit.The computer generation of the suit is flawless. I did not have to set aside belief because the light was wrong or the shine was too perfect. The only problem I had with the Iron Man suit was the inside of the mask, which seems like it is the size of a space suit when the camera looks in it at Tony. If one was to judge the size of the entire suit as it relates to the space in the mask, one would think it was designed for a couples naked high-altitude romp.I found Iron Man enjoyable but, unfortunately, my socks remained firmly on my feet. I couldn't really escape into it but I didn't mind watching it either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Okay matinée fun,"The plot is typical super hero movie; the superhero appears in three major scenes, with the bulk give over to the trials and tribulations of the 'secret identity' character. Pure formula, and not one I've ever had much admiration for. When I pay to see a movie about a superhero, I want to see the superhero, I don't care about the secret identity.The much touted special effects are really pretty much 'more of the same,' nothing special here.The action is fun, but the 'tech sequences drag.The big plus of the movie is Robert Downey Jr. He plays Stark with a truly sophisticated wit lacking in most of these films (Michael Keaton's original Batman might also be an exception).Okay matinée fun, but hardly a 'blockbuster.'",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A very good comic book film.,"Iron Man is truly one of the best comic book films out there. Robert Downy Jr. was a questionable choice to many to cast as Tony Stark. Rob has proved them wrong as RDJ's performance is the best part of this film. Tony Stark a cocky, full of himself, multimillionaire has made billions on selling weapons. But when a trip to the middle east goes wrong, Tony finds out just how "" good"" his weapons are doing to the world. Tony builds a suit of armor to escape capture and when he gets home vows to change himself and the company. What ensues is a vicious power struggle against Obidiah Stane ( Jeff bridges) and the creation of Iron Man. The special effects are very well done and believable. One complaint is that there isn't very much action, but there are several well done scenes. The supporting cast is very good especially Gwenyth Paltrow. The dialog is smart and funny. The reference to SHIELD and Samuel Jackson after the credits are very exciting. Although my favorite comic book movie still goes to Batman Begins, iron Man is a very good film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wow,"... is the word that describes the movie. The plot is simple but current and establishes moral responsibility. Just remember that it is a movie based on a comic book so just open up your mind, strap on and step into the world of Tony Stark as he transforms into the totally cool Iron Man. Robert Downey is the perfect actor to play Tony Startk and even gave him a sarcastically funny persona (which I hardly notice in the comic books - but hey I'm not an avid reader of Iron Man so there...). I thought Gwyneth's performance would affect the movie but boy I was wrong. She did just right. I can't say the same for Terence Howard though... he didn't seem authoritative enough - even looked like a military lap dog of Tony Stark. And Jeff Bridges playing Obediah - brilliant! Awesome CGI, awesome sound track, great cast, makes for a great start of this movie's trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best superhero movies,"The inspired casting which allowed Robert Downey Jr. to play the title character was a masterstroke of genius. Downey Jr. always dispenses the right amount of wisecracks and barbs in his roles, and when added to a fun action romp, becomes totally enjoyable for the family. It also helps that finally, a superhero movie gets some brilliant actors to elevate the story, and solid support is displayed by Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard.The story is full of typical superhero movie clichés, but there's a freshness and a spark to the story that makes it all seem so original. It still, IMHO, cant surpass The Dark Knight or X-Men 2 but it comes pretty close. And wayyyyy better than the lame Spider-man movies, and the obnoxious Fantastic 4 movies.Tony Stark (Iron Man's alter ego) is at first a military weapons developer, and the filmmakers make it all relevant to modern-day dilemmas, when Stark finds out that his weapons are being used by the very terrorists the U.S Military are supposed to be fighting. This revelation and his capture by terrorists at the beginning, helps to change his outlook on life and thus begins his plan to not just fight crime, but to tackle greed and terrorism (since they seem to go hand-in-hand).The action scenes are crisply shot, and the movie features some of the best special effects of the year. The CGI effects seem so real that it's so easy to accept what you're seeing on the screen. And if you're wondering if there'll be a sequel on the way, the very last line of the movie practically gives you your answer. A fantastic action spectacle, with good actors, great story and brilliant visuals. Don't miss it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid and cool with some flaws,"Iron Man's summary with two words would be solid and cool. It is a highly entertaining, amusing film also with very well written dialogs. However, the film is not brilliant or that great because of some flaws. Before this movie, I had liked Downey Jr. but became a fan of him by this movie. Iron Man could be seen just for him and the character h created in this movie! Jeff Bridges's acting is great and despite he is not an interesting or bad-ass villain (he is a businessman) he is the second star of the movie and he is memorable. He is a cliché character a little bit (a black-hearted and hard-nosed capitalist), but Bridges makes him pretty deep and realistic. There are a few logical goofs and it seriously disturbed me. For example, while trying his new Iron Man equipment, he hits to the ceiling very badly. No one can stand against such a strike or the scene which he falls to the ground from miles, it causes person to die or at least heavily injured. As said, The movie is highly entertaining from the first minute till the last, as for action, there are not tons of action unfortunately, it can't change the fact that this is an action film. Especially, the scene that he tries to save a group of people and the jet scene were so well done. The climax fight of the movie was a bit short and far from being unforgettable, but a solid one. Final fights are generally waited with high expectations and mostly only a few of those meet the expectations. In terms of political background, the origins of some bad guys or the very American tone annoyed me, but I didn't mind much. By the way, there is a brilliant thing about this movie; the relationship between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts is different from all the same kind of movies here. It was twisty. However, in the end, the movie could have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pefect Summer Film.,"Iron Man was a great way to begin a new summer.One thing that is so refreshing about this film was the casting. The casting director did a perfect job. Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect choice for the character of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The Big Lebowski - Jeff Bridges - was a perfect villain. Gwyneth Paltrow was great even though I felt like she was trying to hard at some points. Then there was Terrence Howard, a good actor who isn't used enough.There has been some talk that Iron Man doesn't have enough action. I would not say that at all. Iron Man has quite a lot of action, it just also has a story and character development.The action, by the way, is very good.Definitely set itself up for a sequel...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
RoboCop too.,"Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again? There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
8.3/10 ? What's wrong people?,"Hi, I am really confused that this movie is receiving such a good feedback. The problem is that I cannot think of any single ""major"" superhero movie that wasn't better than this. I even think Robocop easily beats this.What's wrong with this movie? The whole script needs work. The little story there is isn't one bit credible. The guy is kept captive in Afghanistan and he is asked to build a missile. The terrorists are watching him closely, but you know what? Our genius hero manages to fool them; he is not building a missile, he is building the bloody armor that will allow him to escape! And the terrorists who are so eager for their plan to work just let it happen! What kind of terrorists are they?!I am sorry, I don't buy this.This is what the movie builds itself upon and I assure you it doesn't make any more sense as it moves on.There isn't the drama that makes other superhero movies so interesting and touching to watch.This is an overall empty movie. The guy is no hero. He destroyed his own weapons and killed the thing that was trying to kill him and the woman he loves.It is a very superficial movie.If you are no teenager or fan of the comics, don't be in a hurry to see this.May be people like this because of the setting in Afghanistan, but sorry, this isn't about news or war, it is just a movie that doesn't deserve such praise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron out the rough spots...,"Actually, I feel quite well qualified to rate this movie as, being a big comic-book fan (although more DC than Marvel!), I'd digested Marvel's ""Essential Iron Man"" re-print of all the early Stan Lee penned Iron Man comics just before this film appeared. Given my belief that, with few exceptions, movie-goers (at least mature ones like me, I suspect) prefer less crash-bang action in their super-hero flicks and more characterisation and plot, (which you invariably tend to get in origin-type stories), this film is all the better for being of that ilk.It has plenty of faults too though, which I'll get off my chest post-haste. Firstly, whilst respecting that the original Iron Man comic creation was born at the time of the Cold War and doesn't shy away from painting Iron Man's enemies as often originating from Red China or Soviet Russia, while this is okay in comicdom, I was uneasy at setting what is basically a super-hero confection in war-torn Afghanistan, especially at this particular time with the conflict far from over and US & UK casualties rising.Secondly, Iron Man isn't the most original of heroes, borrowing the playboy image of Batman's Bruce Wayne and the humanitarian angst of Spider Man's Peter Parker. Also, the movie gets off to a fairly unpleasant start, with an unnecessary rock soundtrack in tow, with a gratuitous celebration of mega-rich Stark's opulent lifestyle, where women are just ""what's your name again"" objects of desire or easy conquest, as even a hard-nosed but attractive journalist falls too easily for Stark's dubious charms.Thirdly, there's Gwynneth Paltrow who non-acts her way throughout as Stark's ""Miss Moneypenny"", Pepper Potts, who in the comics blossoms from prim & proper secretary to a dazzling beauty, which certainly doesn't happen here. And yes I could have done without the sub-Transformers action climax between Iron Man Marks 1 & 2, but I guess you have to give the teens something to watch at the finish. Strange also to see Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan restricted to almost ""extra"" status - in the comics he's every bit as important to Stark as Pepper and indeed is jealous of her feelings for Stark. Ironically this part is, I see, played by director Favreau himself! And yes, while it's de rigeur for blockbusters like this, the in your face product placement does grate (Audi & McDonald's prominent amongst them).On the plus side though, there's Robert Downey, cool as anything in the lead role. Thankfully he rarely dons the Iron Man armour so he gets to act a lot, definitely a plus. Ditto an almost unrecognisable, let's be generous, somewhat filled out Jeff Bridges as Stark's double-dealing mentor Obadiah Stane. The dialogue is invariably snappy and quick-fire, with occasional stabs of humour permeating through. I do feel though the director missed out on a possibly humorous King King moment as Stane, by now having his Doctor Octopus moment in donning the recreated prototype Iron Man armour, menaces Paltrow's Potts. The closing revelation by Stark as to his alter ego is also up there with Indiana Jones shooting of the ""whipmaster"" in the surprise stakes, certainly I don't recall Stark revealing his identity in the comics.Best of all though is the armour, which films great in burnished red and gold. Downey's extended scenes where he attempts to master his equipment are probably the best in the film and the special effects in general are at the top-end of the scale.So there you have it, another successful addition to Hollywood's roster of comicdom and no doubt a relief to Mavel after the comparative failure of big name dramatisations like Daredevil, The Hulk (twice) and the Fantastic Four.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The quintessential 1963 cyborg...,"I had high expectations having read the comic and being a fan of Popular Mechanics in my youth and was a bit sceptical that anyone could pull this off, but safe to say and I am wholeheartedly relieved that Robert Downey Jnr had nailed this hands down. The essence of 50's industrialism that was somewhat captured in the Rocketeer but failed in storyline and at the Box Office seems reversed-engineered and refined in Ironman. This tomato is a must-see...its wonderfully and tastefully etched on silver celluloid. Comic fans need not critique. Stan Winston's studios capture the magic of post war polished steel and chromium while Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway craft a fantastic story that chronicles the genesis of the original man-machine cum cyborg. Transformers...eat your heart out.The franchise had been literally begging to be given the Hollywood treatment and by no accounts does this interpretation fail.""I am Ironman""....what a classic!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underpromised and overdelivered!,"Surprisingly fun! The trailer definitely underpromised and overdelivered. Watched Iron Man as requisite summer movie blockbuster viewing; ended up happily enjoying it. The incredibly talented Robert Downey Jr. made Iron Man work by animating the character with his own inherent eccentricities.Iron Man draws several parallels with other superheroes. For one, he has a lot in common with Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a rich, orphan playboy gifted with the aptitude for high technology. Instead of having the elderly Alfred as butler, however, Stark has personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), a pair of artificially intelligent robots (adorable scene stealers that have adapted puppy-like personalities) and best friend Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). Just like Superman, he sleeps with a reporter, Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb), and has someone close to him for his arch nemesis.Writer/actor/producer/director Jon Favreau is a revelation, helming this action-adventure flick with disarming deftness; it's clear he enjoyed directing this film. How can he not with an unexpectedly well-written, relevant script and a talented cast that includes the chameleon-like Jeff Bridges and cameos from Stan Lee and Samuel L. Jackson. The special effects are excellent and the editing was just right, even if it runs over two hours.

He seems born to play the character of Tony Stark. I hope that he has his personal demons under control finally and is ready to step up as the great actor we all saw so much potential in years ago.The rest of the cast is well chosen and turns in laudable performances.

Really Impressive.......Iron Man!,"When I first watched the first trailer, then I said......Okay, there's gonna be another crap superhero movie, just like Ghost Buster. The trailer looked crap.

When I watched in you tube, well, this time it looked good. There were some really impressive visual effects.When the movie released, I waited for its reviews. So far the reviews were good. So I decided to see it. I am just back from the theater and I'm hell of impressed.The movie has everything a superhero movie needs. The style, the action, the visual effects and the story. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was just awesome. I really never thought he could do something like this. And definitely the dialogs, they had been awesome. I have never seen any superhero movie with that many excellent dialogs. Terence Howard, Gwyaneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges were good in their part. The direction has been really good. The style of story telling is really remarkable, a fast-paced stylish story with humorous dialogs to fill-in the gaps. Nice to see appearance of S.H.I.E.L.D in it. Hope to see more in the sequels.As a whole, it's a really enjoyable movie with a 40+ star as its lead.The music is good. So you get a 9star movie...........",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Different kind of superhero movie, but in the vein of ""Spider-Man""","When I say that ""Iron Man"" is a different kind of superhero movie, I mean exactly that. But it's closer to the ""Spider-Man"" movies than ""The Dark Knight."" It's intelligent, but not dense, or hopelessly grim. It has a sense of fun, which is seriously helped by a number of Robert Downey Jr.'s one-liners.Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the Bruce Wayne of weapons design. He has more money than he can count, and is probably the world's biggest celebrity because of it. When captured in Afghanistan, he creates a prototype of a suit to become Iron Man. Thereafter, much to the shock of everyone who knows him, he decides to become a humanitarian. But that's not as easy as it sounds...The best part of ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't follow the usual superhero movie plot trajectory. It goes in different directions, with more intelligence than usual, yet director Jon Faverau keeps it feeling the same.However, the movie is let down by the casting. Robert Downey Jr. is so talented that he needed a way to break out into the mainstream again. Because ""Iron Man"" accomplished this, it succeeded. Strangely though, the script lets Downey down. True, its a great performance (as only Downey can give), but once he gets back to the states (about 20 minutes into the film), he becomes a lot less interesting. Again, this isn't Downey's fault, it's the screenplay's.""Iron Man"" suffers from too much star power. It has a cast of great actors, but there's not enough screen time to let them develop full personalities. Gwyneth Paltrow is a case in point. In films, big stars generally play two roles: main characters or cameos. Pepper Potts is neither. She's in-between, and because she has so much screen time, we expect more from her (I'm not a Paltrow fan, but this isn't her fault). The same problem she had in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" applies here. She doesn't do well in action movies. Still, it is to her credit that she's doing something to help her fame OTHER than posing for Vogue magazine. Terrence Howard is solid as Rhodey, Starks' friend and military liaison. Jeff Bridges is sorely miscast as Obadiah. While he has moments of effectiveness, overall he doesn't belong here (even with the unrecognizable facial transformation).Still, ""Iron Man"" must be judged based on its intentions. Does it entertain? The answer is a resounding YES!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What's the matter with all those good reviews?! >read this<,"Really, I don't understand how EVERYONE gave a good note and excellent reviews of this film. It is REALLY FAR from being a good movie, and even more from being in the top 250 of the all-time best movies. This is my first comment on this site, and it is also the first time that IMDb deceived me on a movie... I was sure that it would be awesome but it was just stupid and pointless. Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Iron Man comics but I couldn't get in it, from the beginning to the absurd end. I loved the other superhero's movies but the context of this one was just too ridiculous that it was not interesting at all... I almost fell asleep in some parts.It is also extremely unrealistic when you consider the actual state of things in the world: Japan is way in advance on us on things like robotics and technology... just to give an example, in Japan they can create gas and electricity with their garbage... and we are far away from that. So how on earth can a little dude from the middle of the states come out from nowhere and can create those super weapons and that robot... something is not right.The music of this movie is also the worst I heard in years. It is dumb and it's really not helping the empty context of the story. Maybe if the music would have been better, I would have appreciated it a little bit more. I had shivers in Spiderman with the awesome music and the beautiful scenes of ''flying'' in the city. Not even one song was well-placed or enjoyable in Iron Man. Only heavy-metal style shouting music, not really heroic music in my opinion...Finally, the 4/10 note is well-deserved considering the fact that the music was horrible, the story was stupid, boring and too much cliché, but also because the only two good points of the movie were that the special effects were extremely good and the acting decent (Robert Downey Jr. is a revelation), unless it would have been a 2 or a 1. I strongly disagree with the 8.2 of IMDb and as I said, it's really the first time in the hundreds reviews of movies I watched here. I didn't enjoyed Iron Man at all, and a good advice to anyone would be to keep those 10 bucks to buy something useful or to go see something better.Thank you,Jeff",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"So good, up there in my top comic book films, may be #1...","This movie was brilliant! I have to say it was a joyride, a fantastic blend of comedy and action. Robert Downey Jr, was amazing in the role of Tony Stark. Just nailed it! I think the rest of the cast was good, but lets face it Downey, Jr. couldn't be out shined. Except maybe by the man behind the camera... Jon Favreau.I'd like to give Jon Favreau a round of applause. He has my utter and complete respect, and now after seeing this film, devotion. I saw him in a panel at Comic-Con maybe 2 years back and he had said that he wanted to have the least amount of CGI possible, and if it could be built then he would have it built, but he would keep the CG down to only that which was necessary. And I have to say that totally showed in this film. I think that more movies should take a note from Favreau and don't use CGI so fiercely. Hats off to Jon Favreau, and lets give him more work shall we? Captain America, please?Well needless to say this film was excellent.

Probably the best superhero movie,"First of all, I'd like to state that although I'm a comic books fan, I'm not that big on Iron Man; however, going to this movie completely exceeded my expectations.And what were they? Well, I looked forward to all the blockbuster trappings; big explosions, great special effects and since Robert Downey Jr. was in it (as well as some pretty decent actors) I assumed there'd be some _character_ in it as well. So far, even getting those things alone would have been worth the ticket price of admission.But the Iron Man movie went quite a bit further than that. The script for example was excellent - it used the normally rather boring origin part of a superhero's powers to actually both tell a story and advance the characters' points of view. We got to know Tony Stark in the process of him getting his armor - while, for example, Peter Parker being bitten by that spider gave us no insights on him.The humoristic elements similarly worked very well, dancing that line between slapstick and the movie taking itself too seriously. As bonus elements, 'real' (alright, for a comic book movie) engineering issues were more than referenced, they were true plot points - such as what portable power source could be adequate for such an energy-sucking armor, how extreme temperatures could affect its performance, or of course the obvious - how much does it weigh, and how could that be a problem in practical situations such as landing on a rooftop?I'm really happy this movie did well. We NEED to reward projects put together with such obvious enthusiasm for the material, or the studios come to think they can put any ol' crap with some special effects and a hot babe (I'm looking at you, Transformers!) and we'll go see it regardless. 10/10 from me for the best superhero movie made so far.

Suuperior,"Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.): ""Is it better to be feared or respected? And I'd say is it too much to ask for both?"" Iron ManYes, the suit is impressive, a self-contained rocket launcher cum flying machine, but still earthly enough to show some marks from bullets.The opening sequence of Iron Man sets the stage for the film's ironic view of the arms world: Stark rides in a Humvee in Afghanistan only to be wounded by enemy fire generated by his own company. His subsequent incarceration in a cave, culminating in creating the iron outfit not only sets up the rest of his days as super hero but also profoundly changes the way he looks at armament as deterrent.As Stark is played by the mercurial Downey, the sardonic attitude is only a verbal spar away. Downey's checkered life of drugs and irresponsibility helps infuse Stark with the humanity and vulnerability that make him a hero we all can identify with.Superior characterization, effects, enjoyment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Marvel Studios is off to a good start,"First off, I like Robert Downey Jr. He's a very versatile actor. Any role he is in is brilliant, (Heart and Souls being a favorite) and Iron Man is no exception.He delivers lines almost as if he were making them up as he went along. His playful banter with other characters and various machines and small bits of comedy make the film very enjoyable to watch, and the events surrounding his capture and the first half of the film hit too close to home, adding to the films realism.We get the small nods to the comic geeks (You know who you are, myself included) with a cameo by Stan ""the Man' and even Rhodes making a reference to a War Machine suit that could be in his future. Plus on a personal note, it was good to see the Air Force (of which I am a member) was all over this film, we haven't had this much screen time in a movie since Stargate and the Transformers. Plus we're the good guys again, its nice to see it again, I hate when we're the bad guys; but then again I AM partial. Plus, the Air Force knows when to step in and when to let Iron Man kick a bad guys ass.But I digress.This film is just what we needed to (1.) get the summer movie season off to a good start and (2.) restore our faith in Marvel comic movies. (Need I mention Ghost Rider, Elektra, Hulk,the Punisher, Blade:Trinity, Spiderman 3need I go on?)It is good to see we can go beyond the normal heroes like Batman and Superman to someone who has real depth as Stark does, not because hes a superhero but because he is a screwed up person with many, many flaws. In him we see ourselves, messed up, making constant mistakes but for some reason we want to do good and will try the best we can to make right our wrongs.I can't wait for the next one.

Overrated.,"The way 'Transformers' has been turned into a teen comedy, something similar happened to 'Iron Man'.The movie keeps up only thanks to Robert Downey Jr. The whole young-genius-billionaire-scapegrace thing was pretty lame though.Right after Jeff Bridges appears on the screen it's absolutely clear what's his character gonna be. Some of the characters were absolutely unnecessary, useless and undeveloped. E.g. James Rhodes or agent Coulson.The final showdown is also pretty lame and predictable.6 out of 10 might be not as low as it's described above, but I expected so much more from this movie.

"The basic concept is fun, the visuals good ... and that's about it.","I must be missing something or just expect way too much from films like this one, or perhaps one needs to be an fan of the comic character 'a priori' to enjoy the film fully because I found this well received movie to be fairly week in most areas ...First the good - CGI is fantastic (nothing special these days though lets face it). The acting, especially given the rather week script, is solid though overdone and thus 'unbelievable' at times. The basic story is imaginatively well conceived and the 'iron suit(s)' that (eventually) feature are a blast to watch in action.Now the bad - Like many movies these days, it assumes the audience is as thick as hardware shop. For example, the opening few scenes over state the 'playboy' image of the main protagonist in Tony Stark - the scene in the Humvee is just fine as it is and does the job. Do they leave it at this? No they jump to various scenes where we see his debaucherous life in all its excessiveness. After 30 seconds of it I was begging the movie to move on with the actual story, but it just kept going and going.I suppose theses scenes were there to have us build a sense of contempt for Stark setting up the redemptive hero that is to be born out by the movie's end. Well it achieves half the task, I certainly found his character ridiculously annoying, to the point of frustration actually. His 'debonair' billionaire obnoxiousness was so over the top and put a foul taste that struggled to go away for the duration (I mean poll dancing stewardess ... have we time warped to the '60s or something). Moreover, how could somebody who actually does nothing productive actually run a all conquering company like 'Stark Industries' ... anyway, the unfortunate thing is that, besides wanting the company to 'do good' instead of make weapons, he as a character fundamentally doesn't change and this is what bugs me about the plot ... he remains a narcissistic self obsessed overachiever to the end.These things appear in many films and certainly do not necessarily totally destroy a movie experience, after all given the 'comic book' genre one can't expect too much in character development and complex philosophical thought, but, this aside, the story line itself is full of holes. I mean how how stupid are the 'terrorist' fighters (who conveniently follow US propaganda running sheet in being overtly described as as 'foreign' fighters not Afghani locals). They capture Stark then don't notice as he builds a big hi-tech metal suit instead of something that at least vaguely looks like a missile which he is instructed to do?? It makes for a nice action sequence when all is said and done, but writers please please make some effort to create a believable universe.In end, fundamentally, the script reads like a very average comic with little thought put behind it - its a story for the sake of a story so that a talented graphic artist can put some nice visuals around it. Some might say that is what all of the DC Comic movies and their ilk are about - and maybe they're right - but some are clearly a cut above Iron Man, the recent Batman movies are a case in point.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Everybody is talking about Robert Downey Jr. now. Finally!!!,"Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself (like Matt Damon). It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now. Now he's Iron Man and his career suddenly blossom. Sadly you have to act in well accepted blockbusters to became widely known and appreciated actor. People didn't think of Johnny Depp as big star until 'Pirates' (of course there are few of us who are his loyal fans since ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Cry-Baby""). So, I really can say that Robert Downey Jr. is type of actor I like since I saw him in ""Chaplin"". But lets concentrate on this movie and not on right or wrong sides of Hollywood A-list actors.Based on Marvel comic ""Iron Man"" is a story about Tony Stark, a wealthy industrialist and master engineer who builds a powered exoskeleton so he can escape from people who are holding him in captive. They want from Tony to build them a Jericho missile, like the one his company is being creating. Soon, Tony escapes and he decides to modify his design so he can help the world.Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely. Although I'm not a fan of blockbusters this one as a movie is a good one. Comic is successfully brought to life. ""Iron Man"" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane. In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She acted terrible. She's obviously not into acting and as I read, the only reason she accepted this role is that filming was close to her house and her children. Oh and Clark Gregg has that plastic face and everybody was laughing at him in the cinema (how did he stayed alive in the movie when Iron Monger strikes at his fellow agents???)So ""Iron Man"" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. I don't want to talk about some views of American politics in this movie (like the one that Stark shows when he's destroying his weapon that they sold to other countries). I will just say that that could happen only on movie. So at the end, I hope you'll enjoy in this movie and too all the critics - this movie is made for people who wants to have fun, and you mostly cannot talk about Hollywood blockbusters as movie masterpieces (there are very few exceptions of course). So my advice is to take ""Iron Man"" for what it is. Just a good movie and solid fun for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Probably the most fun flick I've seen in a good two years or more.So how did this movie get it right when so many others get it all wrong? It certainly isn't just the character. Iron Man is a second-tier Marvel character that never really caught my eye much or gained the general public's love. I believe it was two factors: casting and respect for the material.First and foremost, I can't imagine anyone but Robert Downey Jr. playing this role. He owns it so completely and is such a perfect fit that I have to wonder how much of the script was completely re-written for him or was improvised. His brand of humor and wit, along with his great range as an actor allow him to convey the whole arc of Tony Stark's story, and to make it entertaining every step of the way. I am especially impressed at the studio's decision to *gasp* actually cast an appropriate actor over 40 years old, rather than cast young just to bring in the teen box office.While so many other comic book flicks treat their material (and audiences) condescendingly, or just as a silly story that can be used to show off cool effects or action scenes, Iron Man instead respects that it can be just as good or respectable as any other film. Nothing is over-the-top or forced. The story is much more grounded in reality than most superhero genre films - There are no ""superpowers"", just technological genius and talent. It's taken to extreme degrees, for sure, but never feels far-fetched or silly. The film also shows you can include comedy without it being blatant comic relief, full of forced silliness and one-liners. No the laughter here is genuine, and lots of it. I laughed more in this film than I have in any actual comedy film in a long time.Recent superhero flicks like Batman Begins and Superman Returns were well-made, exciting, and dramatic, but lacked the fun factor. The overall tone of those films is so dour that repeated viewings are a bit of a chore. Then others like the Fantastic Four came out and went in the too far in the other direction, being cheesy and dumb. Iron Man got back to the tone of the first two Superman films and found the perfect balance of drama and comedy.I could go on about every aspect of the film - the supporting players, score, effects... but I'll just say it all clicked. The rest of the summer's flicks are going to have a lot to live up to. I suspect this is the movie people will go back and see again and again, as other summer fare fades away. Just plain fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Spider-Man,"Sorry, Spidey fans, but it looks like your hero's time as the most popular comic book movie character is up. Now Iron Man's reign has just begun.When i heard that Iron Man was getting his own movie about 2 years ago, i was expecting just the average action film since that's basically what this character looks like, just a tough guy in a suit of armor. However when i saw the movie, i saw Tony Stark's true nature, and he isn't a tough guy at all, he's a wisecracking billionaire weapons inventor, who at first is oblivious to the damage he helps to cause in the world by making these dangerous weapons. After a while he makes a nearly unstoppable suit he vows to correct the damage he did and make sure it doesn't happen again.What really got me was both the action and the humor, which is rarely something that any action film succeeds at. The script is really funny and smart and the special effects really make the action stand out. The film also has a deeper storyline than any of the comic book movies, because of this you're not really gonna see Tony with the suit on a lot, but that's more than OK, because its one of the reasons why Iron Man is so unique.Robert Downey Jr. gives the performance of his career because he basically IS Tony Stark! He looks exactly like him in the comics and both their personality's are the same, there definitely isn't a better actor out there that could've been a better choice. This movie should solidify his position as a superstar. I highly recommend this instant classic for everyone, even if you've never heard of the comic book or even if you hate comic books.Just watch it and be amazed....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Superhero movie to come out in a long time,"Iron Man was a comic story I never really got into, but I did play as him in some Marvel video game with my kids. I went in expecting a ""Spiderman"" like movie, considering Iron Man isn't a super popular hero. I was WRONG!!! Robert Downey Jr. is incredible in the movie. He delivers a knockout performance. The CGI is breathtaking, and it seams perfectly. Iron Man is worth every penny! If you want a funny movie see this. If you want a love story see this. If you want action see this. This movie delivers on every single note. I was very pleasantly surprised, You need to see this movie it is absolutely awesome. You will love it!

Better than Expected.......thanks to Great Acting??!!,"Lets face it, when you go to watch a comic book adaption the last thing you expect is a cinematic masterpiece, at best you will get a FORMULA FLICK THAT ENTERTAINS and at worse FORMULA FLICK THAT Doesn't ENTERTAIN.But even more recently you had a different kind of comic book adaption, the fun is out, THE DRAMA IS IN, ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY INCLUDING THE FANS BUT MOST EFFORT WAS PAID TO THE CRITIC WHO ITS WELL KNOWN CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF DRAMA AND EMOTION...Offlate most of the comic book movies fall into this category,AND TAKE THEMSELVES TO SERIOUSLY....They pump their movies full with good actors..Put in lots of emotional scenes.....bloody everyone cries (think spidey3)....Themes of love are rampant throughout the film...superman had more problems than charlie brown...On face value this movie looks like it will fall in this category, I mean who wouldn't, one look at the starcast and you will remember HULK and be scared.But somehow this movie was different, this movie didn't have the special effects that will leave you flabbergasted or the unnecessary comic relief YET IT WAS FUN.AND SHOCKINGLY IT WAS DUE TO THE SUPERB ACTING, Robert Downey played the middle aged teen who became a superhero brilliantly, he was funny suave and a delight to watch.Jeff Bridges looked and played the part of an evil corporate honcho to the hilt.Even Gwyneth Paltrow did great job of playing the not so serious pepperpot.Thanks to the acting even the subtle romance scenes were enjoyable to a romance allergic person like me.The action scenes AND SPCIAL EFFECTS etc were in fact weak compared to TRANSFORMERS WHICH HAS OBVIOUSLY SET THE BENCHMARK FOR SCI-FI ACTION.However the fact remains that this movie remains weak in primary selling points, THE HERO IS WEAK BECAUSE FOR THE MOST PART THERE IS NO Villain AND ANY GOOD HERO NEEDS At least AN AS EVIL Villain.Special effects were only at par.The comic book excitement was lacking.SINCE IRON MAN HAS ALMOST NO GLOBAL FAN FOLLOWING ESPECIALLY HERE IN India, we definitely needed some aura building which was lacking (especially in film).Yet this movie delivers the goods and can be watched even in after paying premium rates, although watching a nice matinée show would definitely push the experience up.-s no recognition, at par special effect,so so action, no comic book feel.+\-s none quite a simple film actually.+s GREAT ACTING, ALL DRAMA AND ROMANTIC SCENES HANDLED BRILLIANTLY, even things like humour are withing the main characters.total 7/10 (not factoring in the fact that this movie was above my actually quite low expectations, expect good and you will get it, if you are one of those drama loving maniacs, BE AWARE THE ACTING IS SUPERB BY COMIC BOOK MOVIE STANDARDS BUT NOT BY THE 3 HR LONG EPIC DRAMA STANDARDS.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Marvel Movie that Actually Delivers,"Yes I will say that it is one of the few superhero moves that I have like. I first thought that movie look OK but it look very cheesy and just like all superhero movies that suck. I well say I was very shocked how this film turned out. Robert Downey Jr. is certainly the best thing about this movie and definite going to be the comeback for this actor. All the other actors do a good job but nothing compared to Robert. The special effects are really good and so is the editing. When the Iron Man song kicks in at the end of the movie is awesome. Really the big Bad thing abut this movie is the first 15 minutes is just awful and not funny, but after that the film makes you laugh, excites you and entertains you just what a summer blockbuster should.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Amazing...,"I saw this movie on opening night, not expecting much. The trailers had looked okay from what they showed, but I wasn't planning to like it nearly as much as the first Spider-Man. However, Iron Man may have surpassed Spider-Man. Robert Downey Jr. is absolutely amazing as Tony Stark and completely owns this role. Gweneth Paltrow was great as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges was terrifying as the Iron Monger, and Terrence Howard will rock as War Machine in Iron Man 2. The special effects were stunning, and the storyline was gripping. Being Marvel Studio's first film, I will expect quite a bit out of their movies from now on. I'm looking forward to The Incredible Hulk, in which Robert Downey Jr. cameos as Tony Stark in a scene with William Hurt's General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross. I wish they had the Hulk Buster suit in that movie...but that's unlikely. Overall, I loved Iron Man and recommend it to every comic fan on the planet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Finally a decent superhero movie,"Iron Man avoids many of the embarrassing clichés of the previous superhero movies. You know what I mean; the hour of boring explanation why the hero really needs to become more interesting, the pause half-way to ponder Responsibility or Redemption or whatever, the troubled love relations that doesn't make sense. Go away, says this movie, and what's left is entertainment, pure and simple.Although much of Iron Man contains the usual first-movie-in-series introducing and presenting, it is really funny and makes for solid entertainment. Unusual for a superhero movie. This is much thanks to the actors, all of them great but none as amazing as Robert Downey Jr. Still nervously babbling, but now with a touch of insufferable wealth and technical genius, we couldn't ask for a more pleasant performance. How this basically loathsome character can be so likable is all thanks to the writers and Downey Jr.There isn't an overdose of CGI either. Animatronic models where built and sets where constructed, which looks amazing in many scenes. The Iron Man suit itself looks superb and for once, I found myself thinking ""man, that looks real"" instead of ""man, that looks cool""(or more often ""man, that looks fake""). Is Iron Man special or have we finally breached some sort of barrier here? The up-coming Hulk spectacle answers that question nicely: No, CGI still sticks out like a clown penguin. I guess Iron Man got lucky.All in all, Iron Man is better than most A-level superhero movies such as the Batman reboot or Spiderman. It is fun, engaging and clever, sometimes relatively original, and very, very likable. Go see it in the cinema while you have time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A disappointment of gigantic proportions.,"If you are looking for a movie that is two hours long and has one hour and fifty minutes of useless, boring dialogue and about ten minutes of the 'hero', aka 'Iron Man' in this case, then you've picked the right movie. I don't think that I could have possibly been more bored watching this movie. I don't give a damn how he became Iron Man, I don't care how he became enemies with his company's co-owner, I watched this movie to see Iron Man, and to see him kick ass. And these things didn't happen. As a drama, (or a soap opera), I rank this a 7/10, but as an action/superhero movie, I rank it a 1/10, because there's barely any action or superhero in it. Don't believe all the hype about this abomination, don't think it's great just because everyone else wants you to think it's great. It blows. A lot. And if Gwenyth Paltro didn't look so good in it, I wouldn't even have been able to make it through the whole movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Clearly one of THE BEST comic to screen adaptations. You'll love this!!,"Iron Man is one of the lesser known Marvel Super Heroes, especially for us, living in India. To most of us, his past is unknown. With a sense of humor one rarely gets to see in a superhero, Iron Man is something of a revelation, deviating from the normal ""Saving the World"" type of Superheroes. With the coolest outfit one could ever lay eyes on, Iron Man is merely the beginning of a Trilogy that could as well be remembered for a long long time to come as one of the best comic book to celluloid adaptations ever made.Actor/Director Jon Favreau, along with a stellar cast of superstars who have been absent from the big screen of late, have come together and made something top notch after the recent spell of disappointing superhero movies made(think Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four 2, Spiderman 3). With the likes of Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Iron Man is the first big hit to come out of Hollywood this year.Iron Man stays true to its comic book, telling the story of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark who devises the idea of a man covered in metallic armor after he is captured by Afghan terrorists. Upon his escape, Stark improves upon his design. And in order to stop 'under the table' sale of his weapons to terrorist groups by his business partner, Obadiah Stane, he becomes the man in the gold titanium alloy suit, named Iron Man by the press.Certain sequences in the film are highly detailed, some others not so much. It suffers from a spot of bad editing, and it really wouldn't have been bad if it were extended by 10-15 minutes. It is entertaining enough to hold anyone's attention for 15 more minutes. Guess we'll have to wait for a Director's Cut for that. In the theater, it has a modest running time of 2hours. Broken into two parts, the introduction and the origin. The former being more detailed than the later.One of the first things one will notice about Tony Stark is his amazing sense of humor. Robert Downey Jr., who is at the peak of his career at age 43 has an undeniable flair when it comes to playing a man who is full of himself and cracks jokes at the drop of a hat. He doesn't even have to try. Its a flawless performance. He acts the part, and boy oh boy does he look the part! Even Gwyneth Paltrow plays her part well as Stark's assistant, Pepper Potts. She looks better than ever. There is a magnificent amount of chemistry between the two which will be something to look forward to in the upcoming movies. Terence Howard and Jeff Bridges are just there, portraying the sidekick and villain respectively. Fair enough, though I would have liked Howard to be given a bit more screen time.One, very integral part of the movie was the making of the original suit. Shown till the last detail, it was just a treat to watch the testing and assembly of the suit. And once again, even this contains a fair amount of humor. You really don't expect such a lot of humor in a superhero movie, but by the end of it, one realizes that that exactly is what Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark is all about. He isn't your average superhero. He is as much the khaki professional as he was before he become Iron Man. He did not get transformed accidentally by being bitten by a spider, neither did he descend from space. A little similar to Batman, he chooses to become someone different. Someone who can change things. Unlike most others, he isn't gifted with super powers. Wait till the last scene of the film for deviation, and an amazing piece of rock music in the closing credits along with concept art from the making of the film.Iron Man ranks right up there with the likes of Batman : Begins, Spiderman 2, and Superman Returns(which, I think is grossly underrated by critics) when it comes to being a comic book adaptation. And it adds a dose of coolness to the genre of superhero movies. Whether it is the miniature arc reactor/pacemaker on his chest or the part French-cut beard he keeps, Robert Downey Jr. will be best remembered as Iron Man. Iron Man, who can take phone calls while flying through the skies with two fighter jets on his tail. Now, thats what I call cool!! Great start to a promising Hollywood Summer!! 8/10 overall. Great background score. Loved the suit. Cannot wait for the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of THE BEST Marvel Movie Adaptations Since X-Men 2 & Spiderman 2,"I caught a matinée showing of Iron Man today & let me tell ya, if you're a Marvel fan, you won't be disappointed (& I don't even consider myself an Iron Man fan)! Robert Downey Jr. does a fabulous job, the CGI is not really noticeable, The SPFX compliments the film & doesn't overwhelm it. The characterizations are strong & likable, good dialog & plot & the action level is just right. Even if you're not a comic book fan or even a big fan of Iron Man, you should still find plenty of well paced entertainment & fun from this picture. Definitely a 10/10 in my book. My only hope is that The upcoming ""Incredible Hulk"" film is done this well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantasy Superhero,"Ironman's alter ego (Tony Stark) is a millionaire, playboy, genius/inventor with an off color sense of humor. Underneath his egotistical, cynical, comedic exterior is a noble heart for the larger things in life such as world peace. He even has Gwyneth Paltrow as an assistant who does ALL to service and please him. As Ironman he is the invincible beast who crushes the ""evil doers"" like flies, soars through the air at supersonic speed to wherever he wants and has a sleek hotrod suit with all the gadgets you would want. Not only is he the superhero inside the suit but he is the inventor as well. This is the ideal fantasy superhero, the type of superhero you would want to be and that is the fun of it.Smartly made in a not to be taken too seriously fashion since the overall mood is tongue and cheek, contains moments of Three Stooges type slapstick (when he first attempts to upgrade his suit), and the unlikely superhero Robert Downey Jr. plays Ironman. All this means fun which prevails over the predictability and redundancy of this superhero movies. This is another scientist who instead of mutating to something supersonic builds his mechanical organism. Then the typical superhero movie formula ensues and it is just somewhat interesting. Despite being only somewhat interesting particularly since it doesn't have a very interesting character study with a history (like Batman and Spiderman do) and it lacks a cast of idiosyncratic villains (unlike Batman or Spiderman) it is still fun, well done and well directed. You'll have fun watching this fantasy play-out",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
'08's Best?  Maybe.  A Great Film in Every Way? Definitely!,"A lot of people have been raving that this is 2008's best movie, and while it very well may be so far, the year isn't even half over yet so we'll just have to wait and see. Iron Man is an amazing film that blew me away. I thought I was going to be let down because of all the hype but it's become one of my favorite super hero movies. So if you're wondering if it lives up to all the hype, the answer is a very enthusiastic ""yes.""I was very impressed with the storyline and I loved how well everything was tied together. A lot of super hero, and just action films is general, seem to focus so much on action sequences that they don't really have much time to focus on story and this movie wasn't like that at all. It created a great story. The acting was fantastic also. Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else were amazing. I also thought the CGI and special effects were done very well. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the look of it in this movie. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.I am a big fan of the first Spiderman, the Batman films, the X-Men films, and Superman films and this one definitely deserves to be placed with those.

A very well acted super-hero movie - with a mixed bag of bad and amazing visuals.,"Plot : Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) - multi-millionaire weapon designer : is captured by terrorist during a new weapon demonstration. He invents a robotic iron suit to escape the terrorist and once he gets back to America , he is a changed man.Story : Although I do know of Iron Man - what he looks like , his back story. I've never read an Iron Man comic , nor can I tell you a single one of his enemies - so I couldn't go through this movie saying ""hey it's that guy"". That aside , the movie is played out very well and owes a lot to it's cast. Tony Stark arrives back in the U.S and announces that his weapons manufacturing company will no longer make weapons - this does not go over well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who tries his best to take Stark out of the picture. Though I did ""like"" the majority of the movie - the amazing stuff starts happening once his new Iron Man suit is complete.Visuals : This is a very mixed bag visual movie. On one hand you got some very good camera work that captures the environment and characters , but sometimes you get bombarded with close ups or very sub-par camera angles. Once you are viewing the CGI parts though - all these problems disappear and the movie looks amazing (including the great action scenes). I only wish that director Jon Favreau could make the whole film look like that.Synopsis : A very well acted super-hero movie makes up for the sometimes very poor visuals - but once you add the amazing CGI action scenes on top of this : you get a very entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
About ten times better than I expected,"For many months I had no hopes for, or interest in, this movie whatever, expecting just another explosion-loaded summer gadget-fest for the tech fanboys. When I heard the buzz on Downey's performance I decided to see it, but I still had no expectations in particular. Well, I got a surprise and then some, because this is one heck of a smart, funny, rockin' movie. It has huge kinetic energy, and stays on course throughout, never sinking into the trap of a long, dumb, drawn-out special-effects brawl (I'm looking at you, X-Men III); the Iron Man suit is a ***real suit*** from the wonderworks of Stan Winston, not CGI, thank heaven!; music choices are very cool (Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man"" and Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"", yeah!); casting and acting are excellent (Gwyneth Paltrow gets high marks); and Downey's performance is simply a marvel--pun only half intended!--perfect from start to finish. From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.To top it off, it's even got a relevant and topical anti-military message, raises touchy subjects like American foreign policy and war profiteering, and has a surprise cameo after the credits (do not leave early!) that raises all sorts of speculations for the future. =)---Man, I had the best time at this movie.

Superb...,"This movie had more of a negative buzz when the news even broke that Iron Man will be made... boy were the buzzes wrong! This is one of the greatest comic based movie ever! The moment I heard Jon Favreau was directing it, I knew it'll be great. He puts forward human interaction and self discovering in characters before wild visual effects like in this movie or Zathura, or even before Will Ferrell in Elf. Then the name Robert Downey Jr. came, this will be the movie to wait! I can't even imagine who can be Tony Stark now because of Robert Downey Jr. He's really the greatest. Even if his character here isn't that much of a difference than in Zodiac, if he wasn't in this movie, I think the movie won't even work.

Seinfeld was right.,"So George was wrong. Tony Stark does wear clothing under the armor. I always hoped he was naked. Oh well.Iron Man was a weird time. I enjoyed it overall quite a bit, but there were moments when I just didn't give a damn.My issues are minor, but for nit-picking semi-comic book nerds, they are just.My earlier comic book experiences with Tony Stark gave me a completely different impression. Stark is more of a gentleman like character. And though Downey had to include his attitude into the role, it still worked.One thing I did not care for in the slightest was the News Reporter gal. Her role was annoying (I get it), much too distracting and just a weak part of the script. And she never got her ""come-up-ins"". Stupid chick even interrupted when she wasn't supposed to! She should have been booted outta there!There were a couple talky parts, I suppose to add depth to the friendships, but overall they were just boring and felt unneeded. Again, minor issues that don't take anything away from the main aspects to the film.But the action, special effects and acting by Downey and Bridges were all really good. Actually it may have the best effects I've seen yet in a super hero movie. But ya can't forget about the effects in Howard the Duck.

"I know it's a build up of how Tony Stark became Iron Man, but it would have been much better if it had more Iron Man in it.","This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie ""Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room"" and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good. But looking forward to ""The Avengers"" movie which is hinted at the end of the credits. This movie ended in a very good note as well and will leave the audiences excited.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Wondering about human nature,"I really don't know why so many people are so susceptible to marketing and hype. I guess it's one of the bitter human weaknesses (which in fact is very useful for some). I can't say I hate this film (ok-ok, 2/10 is the indication of some amount of hatred towards it but it's not all the way down). It's yet another identical and boring superhero film with all the tiresome clichés that one can expect from it. It's flashy, alright, but it contains no heart whatsoever and leaves no feeling behind it. You've seen those a lot you will see them a lot it's the production line of mindlessly stupid blockbusters. There's nothing impressive in it -- not even CGI so why everyone is so excited about it? Are you also a victim to a clever marketing? I can even prove that this film contains no plot (at least no original plot that is). Our hero is disappointed by the evil of this world and decides to take matters in his own hands, so he becomes a superhero finds himself a villain and kicks his sorry neck amidst the fire and explosions. Is it for the 100th time that you've seen such a tired nonsense? Is this Batman? Spiderman? Superman? Wolverine? Ah, right! It's someone new to the scene.So why have I bothered to write this review? Am I a hater of a superhero American dream? I have no point I just keep wondering why is it that films like Dark Knight and Iron Man are in the same room with the ones line Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction.

Great performances,"I have to state, that I'm not an avid comic(graphic novel) book reader, so I can't point out any differences between the written (or drawn) world and the real (filmed) world. But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!But the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many ""downs"" too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the ""support"" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The light to show us the way.,"Yes, I know, the title to this review is a quote from Richard Donner's Superman The Movie, but there's a reason for that, and I am going to get to it, so bare with me.In a summer dominated by the darkness of, well, The Dark Knight, it may be hard to remember than a month of or two before it we were all basking in the universe of another comic book character, a multi millionaire, too, and, what a coincidence, a character who uses his quite considerable wealth to turn himself into a superhero. All similarities end there (don't worry comic book fans, this is not a review of compare and contrast proportions). For as The Dark Knight falls into a darker and darker pit of despair, terrorism metaphors and increasingly dark plot twists and even darker cliffhanger ending, Jon Favreau instead creates a world of blue skies, brightly coloured costumes (well, for the hero anyway), witty dialogue and, above all else, a lovely atmosphere of fun. Iron Man is, pure and simple, unadulterated fun, amazing when you consider that a good half hour of the film takes place in war torn Afghanistan, with the lead character in the hands of characters who are essentially terrorists. Of course, if the film was in other hands, this would lead to many a darker moment, probably using the comic book genre and lead character as a means to explore modern day warfare in the war on terror. Not Favreau. God bless Jon Favreau because what he chooses instead to do is have fun, lots of it.I have a confession to make. I didn't get to see this film until recently. At the time of writing I only watched the movie on DVD for the first time the night before. Another thing, I loved The Dark Knight. I levelled some mild criticism at its darkness, but loved the movie nevertheless, but here, we get something that is positively giddy, funny and very, very enjoyable. I can't believe I missed it on the big screen, because this is great, and as a sci-fi adventure/comic book adaptation, it's got everything that I love to see in a Hollywood blockbuster of this nature. Imaginative action, funny dialogue, humour whilst retaining an ability to keep the film serious so it can remain engaging and great acting. The latter is particularly impressive. I know it has been said by many elsewhere, but let it be said again, primarily because I want to say it, Robert Downey Jr is fantastic. If played right this should be a comeback of John Travolta/Pulp Fiction proportions. He was always an actor that I liked (please check out Hearts and Souls if you have a chance) and here he brings that cheeky, comedic quality he always has, but filters it through a wonderfully engaging heroic complex. Quite simply he plays Tony Stark in such a way that you want him to be a hero, you want him to make the right choices and by God you want him to save the day. There are no Christian Bale style brooding moments here. Tony Stark is a lot like the movie itself, it's a hell of a lot of fun.I still haven't mentioned Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges or Terrence Howard, but they all put in good work too, particularly Gwyneth, the will they/won't they chemistry between her and Robert is lovely and played almost in a 1940's screwball comedy way. Did I mention she is gorgeous throughout, not that it's important. She is though.And the final scene is brilliant. I want another one and I want it now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining Comic Book Movie Hurt by Slow Second Act,Iron Man was the first movie to open this summer and was one of the most anticipated it's been a huge hit with audiences so i'm sorry i've been late in writing this review.Iron Man stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark a weapons manufacturer who gets kidnapped in the middle east and held hostage by crazed terrorist Raza who wants Tony to build him a missle that would due great damage to wherever it hits. Stark instead builds a metal suit equipped with flame throwers and an arm that shoots out and sends men flying thru the caves of afghanistan. After blowing up the base where he was held captive Tony comes to the stunning realization that the weapons he makes are being used by the terrorists to do harm around the world and to kill American soldiers fighting in afghanistan. Because of this Stark shuts down all weapons production in Stark Industries which angers mentor Obidian Stane (goatee wearing Jeff Bridges)and confuses love interest and assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Realizing he must do good for now on Tony builds a much more advanced version of the suit he built in Afghanistan do defeat the forces of evil foreign and domestic. (Spoiler) We find out later in the movie Stane ordered Tony's kidnapping and planned to kill him so he could take over the company. He's also in cahoots with the terrorists and has been giving them the Stark Industry weapons Tony wants destroyed. A showdown occurs between him and Tony at the end on top of Stark Industries. Overall i liked this movie it was breezy summer fun with enough laughs to lighten the other darker elements of the picture while having enough action to satisfy action fans (even though it could have had a little more action and little less talk). My only gripe is it's slow second act that drags at times and especially the lengthy scene in which Stane goes on and on about how he orchestrated the kidnapping in Afghanistan while pulling Tony's heart respirator out of his chest. (You'll know what i mean when you see the movie) So overall definitely see it it's worth your time.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man more interested in the Man than the Iron,"If there is one thing that makes Iron Man a cut above many comic book movies, and on par with such entries as Batman Begins and Superman Returns, it is it's reliance on character and the actions that occur because of decisions that emanate from them, and not the machinations of plot. Iron Man is a story about it's central character, Tony Stark, and he is carried well by performer Robert Downey, Jr.Iron Man opens in Afghanistan, where Stark, millionaire weapons developer, is showing off his latest product for the military. The convoy he is riding in is attacked, and Stark is captured by rebels, who demand he build them a version of his new weapon. Stark instead uses the parts and tools to fashion a suit of armor to help him escape, and keep him alive by preventing some shrapnel lodged in his chest from entering his heart.After Stark manages to escape from his captors, he returns to home, and announces to the world that his company will stop weapons production, which doesn't go over well with his board or directors, or his longtime partner and friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). While the political machinations are going down, Stark is busy tinkering with his armor design to get it perfected, and when he sees the atrocities going on around the world, often using weapons from his company, he decides to use the armor to act.At the plot level, Iron Man is nothing tremendously special. It follows a typical superhero origin story, letting us see how the superhero came into being, the early testing of powers, etc. In that respect, Iron Man is nothing to write home about. However, given that framework, director John Favreau and screenwriters Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway use it to build the story around the cataclysmic change that sends Tony Stark from being a millionarie playboy who spouts platitudes about how weapons protect the US to a man awakened to the bitter realities that surround him that he had previously shut out.What helps sell Tony Stark is the strong performance of Robert Downey, Jr. Downey, in concert with the script, makes Tony Stark less of your typical superhero and more of an average, if someone eccentric, guy. Yes, Stark is a genius, and has a quirky personality, but he still manages to seem a bit like someone you know and like spending time with. Downey's exceptional dialogue delivery, paired with his devil may care attitude, makes Tony Stark a memorable comic book hero.Iron Man imbues it's secondary characters, even the minor ones, with enough development for us to care about what happens to them, so that when the action sequences occur, we have an rooting interest in the outcome, making them more than just random pyrotechnics. Favreau and company don't accomplish the best action sequences in modern comic book action film-making, but they work well enough to be entertaining.Most of the other performances are up to par, with Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's right hand woman, Pepper Potts, who has a somewhat unrequited interest in Stark. Jeff Bridges portrays Obadiah Stane with both a seemingly well-intentioned interest in Stark's success, but also a just under the surface sense of menace. Terrence Howard fills the role of reliable associate with good aplomb as Rhodey, Stark's longtime military friend.What Iron Man proves, and other filmmakers toiling in the comic book world would do well to take notice of, is that when you bring the focus of your story in on the people at the heart of it, and match them with good actors, the results can be exceptional. We can only hope Iron Man is the continuation of a trend that keeps growing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Conflict within and an anti-climax, yet a good movie?","The movie ""Iron Man"" certainly got the audience laughing, but not just at the funny bits.Anyone who goes to see a Marvel movie and wants to enjoy it has to make the switch to non-intelligent. ""Ignorance is bliss"" could have been Marvel's catchphrase; when somebody seriously tries to dismiss a Marvel movie because it was ""cliché"", that somebody is an idiot.What caught my eye when compared to other Marvel movies, was that the acting of Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I don't want to imply that other Marvel movies had bad acting, but nothing topped this performance.However, this leads me to the conflict I mention in the title. We're facing a cliché storyline, as we all know it of Marvel, and try to blend this with natural and solid acting.This works in most aspects. The comedy for example is plain brilliant, because it feels like a natural product of Tony Stark's personality, which is perfectly portrayed.But when we look at the romantic scenes (mainly referring to, mind spoilers, the ""battery replacement""-scene), this instantly leads to a conflict. Tony's personality and realism just didn't seem to fit the cliché background music and the sudden, passionate silence.The other point questionable about the ending, was the ending. Now to be sure, I'll give you the *spoiler alert*, but I'll try to talk around it.We don't and shouldn't expect an extremely original climax from a Marvel. This one wasn't, but it was so cliché it kinda hurt my head.The romantic plot line was such a detail in the movie, that the references at the end didn't do me anything. Too my taste, there were too many, some of which left some in the audience unable to repress a chuckle.Viewing back the movie was a great watch, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if Marvel had gone bold and had scraped the whole romance from the movie. It was an unnecessary detail which only led to an amplification of the cliché image.Still, Marvel did a good job and it was a good watch. If there's a sequel, I'll be there.I give the movie a 7. Would have been a 6, but in its genre it deserves a 7. (No, the Marvel stamp isn't always +1, because for movies as the 2002 ""Incredible Hulk"", a Marvel stamp would give the movie a -1. It does not meet Marvel expectations).Thanks for the (lengthy) read, and I hope I was of use.Peter Saarloos",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man rocks!!!!!,"I don't want to hear from those comic book readers on whether or not this is a true representation. This is the movie, and it rock! Robert Downey Jr. was born for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and I cannot wait to see him later this Summer in The Incredible Hulk, and in Iron Man II, which just has to be made.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is just the hottest assistant a man can have, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why he is not... every day.The two of them together is just screen magic and the banter between them is just so charged with sexual energy - it is just amazing.Terrence Howard was great as his Air Force buddy, and Jeff Bridges was perfect as the man you wanted to see die - every more than the terrorists, and you know that is the truth.The special effects were absolutely out of this world.If there is any criticism of all of this movie, it is that it could have been more adult.

Iron Slag is More Like It,"Not terrible, but almost. Robert Downey Jr. got a nice payday from this and he did what he could for the lead character of Tony Stark, but let's face it, John Favreau basically makes kids' films - and that's what Iron Man is - a movie for the 8-12 set.It's not even worth wasting too many words on this executive-notes-cut-and-paste formulaic piece of mass-market dreck.Suffice it to say too much time is spent on the backstory of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man; there is the now standard betrayer/arch-villain antagonist (Jeff Bridges slumming); and the ditzy love-interest assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow doing, well, what she does).This is a kids movie, but even at age 10 I would've only given this film 4 out of 10 stars.And the fact that this is a critical as well as commercial success - and is rated over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes, and over 8 stars here on IMDb bespeaks of just how low standards have fallen. The audience not only doesn't expect any better than this - they now consider this low level of art worth over 8 stars on IMDb.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""Iron Man"" Perseveres Amidst Legacy","Like the original ""Star Wars,"" ""Iron Man"" is a tricky film to review in isolation given its legacy. The movie that started the Marvel Cinematic Universe and launched director Jon Favreau's career to new heights, ""Iron Man"" changed the cinematic landscape in 2008.Despite all twenty-three MCU movies to come out in the past twelve years, though, ""Iron Man"" still remains one of my favorites in the franchise. It is only rivaled by 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" which I enjoy for very different reasons.While Marvel movies today can come off as repetitive or formulaic, ""Iron Man"" did not have the luxury of guaranteed success back in 2008. In fact, the now famous titular hero was no more than a B-List comic book character before this cinematic debut. Likewise, the comic book movie genre was meeting a mid-decade slump upon ""Iron Man's"" release, following critically underwhelming pictures like ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" ""Superman Returns,"" and ""Ghost Rider.""""Iron Man"" was thus a gamble from producer Kevin Feige, and it had to be a truly quality film if it wanted to kick off something as ambitiously unprecedented as the MCU.The plot is quite unique for a superhero movie. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire playboy who made his fortune in weapons manufacturing. After being kidnapped by terrorists in Afghanistan, he builds a weaponized suit to escape captivity. He returns to the United States and announces that his company will stop building weapons. Instead, he narrows his focus on recreating the iron suit and using it to independently liberate people sans the war-profiteering corruption.Rather than making the Afghan terrorists the arch-villains, ""Iron Man"" ultimately sets the American weapons dealers as the primary antagonists. Specifically, Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becomes the supervillain when he dons the Iron Monger suit for the film's climax. It is a dynamic that latently comments on America's involvement in the Middle East at the time, setting a precedent for the kind of subtle ideology that Marvel continues touting.One of the reasons that ""Iron Man"" stands the test of time in the MCU is its broad accessibility. Later installments are a bit esoteric, catering to geek culture and burying themselves in their own mythos. ""Iron Man,"" however, triumphs as a stand-alone film that everyone can enjoy.Unlike the rest of the MCU, ""Iron Man"" is not an I-Spy game for hidden Easter Eggs, and its story is far more grounded in reality. The fantasy elements of ""Thor"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are not yet an apparent part of the universe, and thus ""Iron Man"" remains within scientific plausibility.The movie's use of CGI compliments such pseudo-realism. In later MCU movies, the CGI is largely taken-for-granted. Come 2012's ""The Avengers,"" everything looks like a videogame. ""Iron Man,' however, retains tangible textures. Computerized Images are obviously there, but they all serve a purpose and never distract the eye.Above all, Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the titular hero drives the movie home. Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Terrence Howard all provide good performances, but RDJ is the picture's clear champion. He is cunning, witty, and delivers every single line with an unparalleled degree of cool. Kudos to Marvel for this infallible casting decision that brought a dying star back to life. His celebrity also transcends generations, as older audiences recognize and appreciate the leading man despite the film's mostly youthful appeal. Without RDJ, Tony Stark could have easily failed, and the MCU would have bit the dust preemptively.In total, it is a marvelous movie that stands apart from many other Marvel movies. Maybe this is in part due to the fact that Disney bought Marvel in 2009 and thus every movie in the franchise since ""Iron Man"" (and the largely retconned ""The Incredible Hulk"") has been made under the House of Mouse's influence.Or maybe it is just because the movie required more guts than its successors. The odds were set against ""Iron Man,"" so it demanded a more careful cinematic approach.That approach remains evident in the film to this day, and they have paid off in troves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The One That Started It All,"Well this is it. 13 years, 26 films and 24 billion dollars later, this is the unlikely hit that started it all. When the director of Elf and a disgraced 90s actor came together on a B-tier Marvel hero at best, many set their expectations low. But more fool then, for this film blasted out the gates running. The stars combined, 586 million dollars were made and the most significant cinematic franchise of all time began.First, let's talk about that disgraced 90s actor, old Robert Downey Jr. Himself, cast in the perfect role. This film starts on the song 'Back in Black', and not only is it the perfect song for the egocentric Tony Stark to be blasting in the back of a jeep in Afghanistan, it's the perfect song for RDJ. This film signified that he was back, and kickstarted the role that he played for 11 years and made about 400 million for. What his post Iron Man career will look like remains to be seen, but this was the gamble that paid off. Everything about his performance is perfect. His timing, his mannerisms, the subtle little changes in expression. This film was done mostly on improv and it's clear who lead each scene. Such a perfect casting that he took a character invented 45 years prior and made it his own, to the extent that no-one else, in any other franchise or series, could ever play him. In some ways, he was too good.But while RDJ shines, the rest of the cast slightly stumble. Characters such as Terrence Howard's Lt. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Pottes seem quite stiff when compared to RDJ, something that Paltrow would improve on later down the line, and that Howard wouldn't get the chance to. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane is all over the script, going from calm and subdued to loud and bombastic in the same scene. It's a good performance, and a fault I have more with the material he was given, but still, he does not go down on the admittedly exclusive list of memorable Marvel villains.But just as important to any good superhero film is the plot, for without it, it's just mindless action (see Batman & Robin). Ultimately, it's incredibly serviceable. It gets Tony Stark from spoiled brat to superhero, introduces long standing character arcs with Potts and Rhodes that continue later in the sage. It creates the fast paced, quippy formula that's still going strong almost a decade and a half later, and gave the Avengers their first hero. What else was really needed? The action is also very stylish, and the CGI, while not what it will be (obviously) does it's job.Ultimately, if you're still somehow on the fence about Iron Man, get off it and watch it. It's truly worth your time, and will likely drag you into a Marvel fandom kicking and screaming.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Downey, Jr. Creates an Inspired Superhero","In much the same way that Ron Perlman's inspired performance made ""Hellboy"" better than it would otherwise have been, Robert Downey, Jr. helps ""Iron Man"" be something beyond the standard superhero junk fests that become popular every year around this time. Downey is perfectly cast, though I never would have thought of him for the character he plays here, tycoon of a weapons manufacturing company who suffers pangs of conscience after seeing what his terrible weapons can do, and turns himself into the ultimate weapon so that he can stop others from using them.Gwyneth Paltrow is Downey's assistant and love interest, and it's a bit of a shame to see such a smart actress stuck with such a dud role as this. She stands around in heels and looks worried while Downey tries to save her.Jeff Bridges, shaved bald and sporting a bushy beard, is the movie's villain, and if the movie has a major failing, it's him. Bridges is fine in the role, but the villain himself isn't particularly menacing, and the final showdown is anticlimactic.Be sure to sit through the end credits for a brief scene that promises a sequel.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We didn't know that the MCU was gonna be a thing, but it didn't matter anyways, because this film was still great on its on.The only thing that I didn't care for was the villain. Obadiah Stone as the Iron Monger was just a jealous man, in a bigger suit than Iron Man's, that ends up losing. It wasn't anything special and it's the biggest thing that most people will criticize Marvel for in their Phase 1 of movies.However, ""Iron Man"" did so many great things, that it's only flaw really doesn't matter that much.If you love Superheros and haven't seen ""Iron Man,"" I don't know what you're waiting for.

Paid For By Stark Enterprises,"Entertaining, but not nearly as good as advertised.

Pathos is replaced with on screen charisma and witty snappy dialog, and all actors play there parts well here. My only problem was that while Stark get's plenty of screen time, I feel like Iron Man only showed up for the last half hour of the film, which I guess is common enough in this origin stories, but still made the whole thing feel kind of uneven to me. I get the impression if the director, actors, writers stay together for the next film they might have ironed out the bugs. (SPOILER)The next film could be the super-hero jamboree ""The Avengers"", as indicated by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, at the end of the credits. And this character might do better in a cross over. Like Spider Man and Batman this film is pretty close to how I always envisioned the character, there's just not enough action and hero screen time here.

But this IS an action movie and the action was just starting to warm us up. I don't think I'm asking for too much since it IS suppose to be an ACTION movie.

Another Special Effects Film,"Another special effects film which means if you want good dialog, character development and chemistry walk away now. I thought this one was going to be good and was greatly disappointed. The special effects are fine and predictable and like so many superhero films of late the characters are one-dimensional. The fact that Favreau left the dialog up to the leads instead of investing in a good writer is apparent.Surprisingly Robert Downey Jr. is just okay. His Tony Stark is mildly appealing and his scenes in the lab are probably the best in the film, maybe it's because he is talking to inanimate objects and his computer. He has better chemistry with JARVIS (Paul Bettany) than anyone else in the picture.Gwyneth Paltrow brings nothing to her part. She is again the wooden girl, but there isn't much to the part. Anyone could play it and someone else might have been convincing in her scenes with Robert Downey Jr.Terence Howard seems miscast. For a military man his character is soft and has no military bearing. It's too bad because he's a much better actor than he is allowed to be in this film.Jeff Bridges seems to have a lot of fun with his role. He plays it for fun and it shows. He is the only one who seems to be playing his part for what it is.

Just awesome,"Iron Man stands as a cinematic marvel, no pun intended, and it's not just the armor that shines. This film, directed by Jon Favreau, is a masterclass in modern superhero storytelling that laid the foundation for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).It succeeds due to Robert Downey Jr.'s tour de force performance as Tony Stark. He effortlessly embodies the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, bringing a charismatic and witty energy to the character that is nothing short of iconic. The casting choice was a stroke of genius, and Downey Jr.'s portrayal is one for the ages.The narrative arc of Tony Stark's transformation from a self-absorbed arms dealer to the selfless hero we come to admire is expertly crafted. The character development is palpable, and we witness Stark's evolution both physically and emotionally. The script balances humor, action, and heart with finesse, creating a film that resonates on multiple levels.The visual spectacle is breathtaking. The CGI work on the Iron Man suits is groundbreaking, making the superhero tech feel tangible and awe-inspiring. The suit-up sequences are iconic, and the action scenes are both exhilarating and visually stunning. The film strikes a perfect balance between intimate character moments and high-octane superhero action.Moreover, the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as the formidable Obadiah Stane, delivers stellar performances that complement Downey Jr.'s lead. The chemistry between characters feels genuine, adding depth to the film's emotional beats.Iron Man is not just a superhero film; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the genre. It laid the groundwork for the interconnected storytelling that became the MCU's trademark. From its engaging narrative to the charismatic lead, impressive visuals, and memorable supporting cast, it remains a cinematic triumph, setting the gold standard for superhero movies and kickstarting a franchise that would go on to dominate the global box office.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Retrospective Look at Iron Man: The Film That Changed Everything,"Looking back at Iron Man in 2025, it is incredible to realize how much this one movie reshaped modern blockbuster cinema. When it was released in 2008, no one knew this would kickstart the most successful film franchise of all time. Even after all the sequels, crossovers, and multiverse insanity, this film still stands as one of the MCU's best.Strengths:Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is iconic. His charisma, humor, and emotional depth make Tony Stark one of the most engaging protagonists in any superhero film.The origin story is tightly written. Tony's journey from arrogant arms dealer to hero is believable, well-paced, and still emotionally effective.The action holds up. The Mark I escape sequence remains one of the best in the entire MCU.The themes remain relevant. The film's critique of war profiteering and corporate responsibility feels even more pressing today.It tells a complete story. Unlike later MCU films, Iron Man does not feel like setup. It stands on its own.Weaknesses:Obadiah Stane is functional but forgettable. He serves his purpose but is not a villain with much staying power.Rhodey is underdeveloped. Terrence Howard plays the role well, but the character does not leave much of an impression.The third act loses some momentum. The first two-thirds are so well-paced that the final battle feels more obligatory than thrilling.Legacy:
Sixteen years later, Iron Man remains one of the most rewatchable MCU films. Its grounded, character-driven approach feels almost rare now. The MCU has since expanded into cosmic and multiversal madness, but there is something refreshing about revisiting the film that started it all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome movie,This movie made superhero movies better and it set a standard for every single other superhero movie after. It started the series with a great storyline and still gives me chills to this day after rewatching it many times. This is one of the best comic book movie of all along with the dark knight. This movie is a must watch and still has great graphics and cgi and still tops many movies. The MCU would never be the same if Robert Downey Jr. Was never in it. I love that they chose him because even if he didn't have a good background Robert had made a great actor for many good movies after such as Sherlock Holmes and other great movies. He started the series and he ended it.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Am Iron Man,"To be quite honest, while I've long been a comic book fan (particularly of Marvel comics) I wasn't really drawn to the character of Iron Man. Sure, he's a decent enough superhero but, to my mind, he's missing something in comparison to the likes of Spider-Man, Batman & the Hulk. Nevertheless, I think that Jon Favreau & company managed to make a pretty entertaining film, mainly through their astute casting.Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who engineers a powerful iron suit and takes on the persona of Iron Man. Jeff Bridges plays his business partner, a man who wants to secure Stark's technology for use in high-tech weaponry. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Stark's personal assistant while Terrence Howard plays Stark's friend and military liaison.The story unfolds smoothly and Jon Favreau's direction is capable. The Oscar-nominated special effects are solid, though not particularly awe-inspiring. The film's soundtrack & score are pretty standard. Overall, I feel that the technical aspect is ably handled but unexceptional.Ultimately, the film is an enjoyable piece of entertainment though it doesn't contain anything particularly remarkable. The acting is fine, the story is compelling but not particularly ambitious & the production values are adequate. I wouldn't count it among my favourite superhero flicks but it's a worthy addition to the genre.Addendum (June 16, 2012) - Having seen Don Cheadle in Terrence Howard's place in the sequel I'd have to say that he makes a much more suitable Rhodey. In fact, in general, I think that the sequel makes more satisfying use of all of the returning characters. Also, having recently rewatched the first film, I was reminded that I wasn't entirely comfortable with the use of a real-world conflict to drive a significant portion of the plot. It's obviously meant to contemporize the character but to me it seems to trivialize a situation that should be dealt with seriously or not at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel gets it right with this superhero hit,"Directed by Jon Favreau, Iron Man was released in 2008, only a month before The Incredible Hulk, and it marked the official beginning of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. After some time away from the limelight, Robert Downey Jr. Was cast as Tony Stark and the rest is history.This was a big, expensive gamble for Marvel and, had it not paid off, it's unlikely that much would have stemmed from it. Luckily, Iron Man was a significant hit that, not only kick-started one of the biggest cinematic franchises ever, but revived Robert Downey Jr.'s career fully, pushing the actor's popularity to stellar levels. While the story in the film is pretty self-contained, it does plant a few major seeds (S. H. I. E. L. D., War Machine) and, of course, Tony Stark would, soon after, cameo in The Incredible Hulk so Marvel were already very determined to build towards an Avengers movie and Iron Man certainly set the standard.The plot of the film sees Tony Stark, the cocky owner of defense contractor Stark Industries, get kidnapped by a terrorist group in Afghanistan where he is forced to face a few uncomfortable truths about his own company while trying to survive. During this ordeal, he loses a friend but develops an arc reactor to keep himself alive and power a state-of-the-art Iron Man suit, as you do.The storytelling here is straight-forward but effective: Jon Favreau balances character development, action sequences and humor in an effortless way, giving the film a refreshingly breezy and light-hearted, yet clever and witty, tone inspiring subsequent Marvel outings, with the exception of the slightly grumpier The Incredible Hulk which had the misfortune to be shot at the same time. Robert Downey Jr. Is simply perfect as Tony Stark. He embodies the nonchalant genius aspect of the character with ease and he balances Stark's inherent flaws with so much charm that you can't help but be on the billionaire playboy's side no matter what.Gwyneth Paltrow is very likable as Stark's assistant/love interest Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges clearly has a ball as the intimidating, and rather amusing, villain Obadiah Stane. Terrence Howard was also well cast as Stark's friend Rhodey but the role was eventually handed to Don Cheadle, who made it his own. This is one of those few superhero movies where everything gels to create not just a worthy comic-book to film adaptation but a genuinely good blockbuster as well.Iron Man was, and it remains, a slick, funny and hugely entertaining action film with tons of charm and personality, some pitch-perfect special effects and a ground-breaking approach to the superhero genre in cinema. This is one of Marvel's all-time best movies and it still very much holds up.Excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Action sequences; comedy; gross-out scenes; sexual tension complete with feint romance and a battle of good vs. evil sees Iron Man waver but just about hit the mark.,"The last time I saw a fictional superhero in a red and gold get-up flying through the air and generally trying its best to 'wow' and entertain a crowd, must've been in that 1996 Schwarzenegger Christmas comedy entitled Jingle All the Way. Thankfully, Iron Man is a little better but it additionally made me daydream about what it might've been like had Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.), the ever present lead in the film, ever stumbled across the two camp hit men from 1971's Diamond Are Forever, you know: the one's that flit around, killing people here and there while philosophising about certain ponderous subjects that come compete with quotes like: ""If God had intended man to fly, then he'd have given him wings."" Rather immediately, we can assume Tony Stark be the sort of man to think outside the proverbial box; he doesn't just want to fly, he wants to do it without the wings – bizarre, all-over-the-place-colour-scheme and all.For what it's worth, Iron Man isn't particularly that bad. It covers a tale, indeed a plight, of one small; relatively thin; harmless looking; eccentric even, and soft bodied man of whom represents something far larger, overpowering and powerful in Stark Enterprises, which is Tony's company that he's inherited from his father. Iron Man begins with one of those annoyingly quaint VT sequences, the sort that exists solely to inform us of what's going on; the sort that crams in years, sometimes decades, worth of predicament and event purely so that it can fast-track all the necessary back-log and get to this point in these person's lives. From just about here, it dives headfirst into Afghanistan and presents us with this rich, life loving and seemingly psychologically spotless hero as he merrily romps his way through the desert with the United States Army. Only, the convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive.First and foremost, Stark is an arms dealer of sorts. He creates weapons so that others may use them for destructive and ill-advised purposes. When it transpires Stark is attacked by his own weapons, there is a moment of clarity that tells our lead that things must change; and that means risking loosing all the close-to-unwatchably-bad content/lifestyle just prior to him flying out to The Middle East. The cheery and sugary scenes of the pompous Stark milling about with reporters, women and extravagant events as he indulges in nights out at the casino and one night stands comes across as woefully inept but tactfully so; simultaneously providing us with a point of attack that gets across what Stark is like but also providing us with a certain wrong belief that is instilled within the lead, something that resembles a gung-ho, ""nuke 'em now"" policy that will change.Iron Man is competent enough, but I wonder if director Jon Favreau is fit for this sort of material. Stark's realisation of what it is he actually does and what it is he actually contributes to in the world feels underplayed, while his shooting of an Afghan cave system in which Stark is held hostage, and forced into building a weapon of mass destruction, looks less grotty; grimy; undesirable and unpleasant then it does a themed entrance to 'the underground zone' at a theme park complete with cheap, plastic cave walls and fake sand. There is a distinct, but uneven, feel to this segment of the film; an acceptance that this is what's being done, and this is the study being made; but a biting feeling that had the budget been halved and the picture looked less colourful and less polished, we might be feeling the pain with the lead a little more.It's in and around that prison cave system that Stark realises he won't be building any more weapons, so rather than do that, he stumbles across the idea of building a seemingly indestructible suit made of iron that, essentially and perhaps ironically, he will use in combat later on and thus render a weapon of sorts. I think a lot of Iron Man would like to be about the deployment of weapons to other nations by more powerful nations. Stark, being an American and being the head of an all powerful American organisation that ISN'T the government, and his actions recall the giving of Stinger Missile launchers to the Afghans to use against the invading Soviets during The Cold War, and how, in 2003; that news footage of a ground Afghan using a Stinger Missile launcher against an American plane rather eerily comes back to tarnish that decision. By the end of the film, Stark hasn't perfected a weapon as much as he has modernised a suit of some sort that aids in the attempting of ridding the world of those that mis-use these weapons.But slightly interesting study aside, the film is not without reservations. The audaciously named Pepper Potts is played in agonising; not unwatchable, but close, fashion by Gwyneth Paltrow; while a lot, and I mean a lot, of time is reserved for the development of the iron suit which itself involves testing, tests failing and a lot of dumb slapstick humour. The typically British, and-thus-intelligent, computer in Jarvis (Bettany) is a nonsense inclusion as is the manner in which one such Afghan sacrifices himself in order to aid Stark in his getting out of a predicament, which is a little off key. The film may be a large, loud and somewhat dumb at times production, but it's aiming for that in the first place. The fact it has a degree of substance running just below it, calling into question one's morals amongst a few other things, helps elevate the film slightly but it's underwhelming and quite daft in the long run.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Shiny Kitsch for Kids Only,"First and foremost: if you are an adult and you would like to identify yourself (a bit) with a fictional character then you have to chose a CHILD CHARACTER (Harry Potter or Lyra Belaqua for e.g.) because the fictional adult characters are so childish they need to be told not to suck on their thumbs. And where the moral would be: For a start we got a careless billionaire making megabucks on gun manufacturing and trading. Then he realizes that guns are bad (not spoiling the buzz about the moment how he comes to this conclusion...) And what's his next move? To build an armor full of missiles and set out self-judging like Charles Bronson in Death Wish. Great pattern for kids, huh?Same childishness goes for the Actions Department: as if the people responsible for this crap were giving out Iron Man toys to some 5 year old kids and copied their playing with them, then added some CGI and tapped on each others shoulder for good work. Pityful.My three stars needs some explanation then: one for good casting (even if it's wasted grossly) and two for the Iron Man outfit which is the only one so far (amongst the Marvel adaptations) that truly resembles the original.Badly hurts that we're not spared from the sequel as it seems there is an audience out there that is completely ignorant.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A superhero film for The whole Family,"One of the coolest things about this film is that you can really enjoy it with the whole family. Even when some will say they don't like superhero films.It has great action, romance, comedy and a little bit of drama as well.IronMan not being a true superhero makes it easier to enjoy for fans who don't like this genre. IronMan is a character who never got super Powers, he built his suit and improved it with time.The acting is great and They couldn't have chosen anyone better for the Role of Iron Man than Robert Downey Jr.He was born to be IronMan. He is incredibly charming and his timing to go from comedy to drama Is just perfect so he can go from saying a very cool one liner to serious moment in a matter of seconds.The romantic chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow is great which helps to make the romance look believable and not put in just to make women happy.The whole is really good.It's really a film you will enjoy with everyone.

Marvel Studios entry into popularity and success,"Iron ManThe movie that began a media franchise, brought Marvel's comic book storylines to the mainstream, and birthed the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Iron Man brought a lesser known character to the big screen. Over the years, Marvel's characters had been licensed to other movie studios. But with Paramount distributing the film, Marvel Studios finally had their chance to make it their own.Iron Man fans got to see Tony Stark brought to life by Robert Downey, Jr., starting out as an indifferent and ambivalent war profiteer, using his great intellect to manufacture weapons and military technology. His vast fortune allowed him to hide from the moral questions by losing himself in women and drink. Tony's alcoholism was a major plot point in the comics decades ago continuing Marvel's groundbreaking work with bringing elements of reality into a fantasy world.The parallels to Batman have always been clear as Tony has no supernatural abilities, but only his intellectual genius. In order to be of use, that intellect aids him to build a suit of armor. The movie pays homage to his earliest comic book appearances when the suit was gray and clunky.Marvel Studios movies are different than other comic book adaptations because the superhero plot also serves as metaphor for various social, mental health or moral issues that have always affected me as they are all relatable. At the beginning of the film, Tony is kidnapped in Afghanistan after being severely wounded by shrapnel. The device used to save his heart is implanted at this time. Instead of building the weapon demanded of him, he builds the aforementioned clunky suit and escapes. While it takes his personal trauma to develop his character from indifference to involvement in world affairs, Tony seems to genuinely embrace his change. His original naivety ironically leads to strengthening his decision to change his outlook, as he uncovers betrayal in the company that bears his name.Also, in perfect comic book fashion, this movie is only the beginning of a long term storyline that has gone on for over 15 years at the time I wrote this. In order to maintain continuity, other characters are introduced from the comic books including Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes, the organization the Ten Rings, Phil Coulson and Obadiah Stane. Stan Lee also continues his tradition of providing cameos in Marvel films. The audience must then pay full attention to the details as they are used throughout the other films.With that, Nick Fury, S. H. I. E. L. D and the Avengers seeds are planted.

The Film That Started It All,"Upon my third re-watch, I still find Iron Man a solidly entertaining movie.Positive:One thing that really surprised me about this film was how efficient the storytelling is. Every scene feels like it demands the one that follows, which is insane considering how a great deal of the film was made up on the spot.It also goes without saying, Robert Downey Junior totally sells Tony Stark in this film. He's kindove like that you hang out with that you're aware s a jerk, but somehow you're able to let them get away with it.I also surprisingly enjoyed the humor of the film. Some later MCU humor I sometimes find to be annoying and unnecessary. Here, though, I believe it fits naturally as most of the funny moments are just simple gags, which I believe works in the film because it's a fun superhero, action movie.I also really like the natural progression of Tony Stark. His moral compass totally shifts from when enters the cave to when he escapes. I believe this is what makes his character intriguing in the film. I love watching him create the Iron Man suit, yes, but watching him stand up to Obadiah, destroy his own weapons in Iraq, and take responsibility I find really effective.Flaws/Nitpicks:Unfortunately, the problem with this film is similar to many early MCU films within the villan. Jeff Bridges' performance is fine, however, Obadiah as a villian is not particularly compelling. Personally, I think I would've rather had fight Raza be the main villian and not Obadiah. That wouldn't have saved the film, but that would've been my preference from the film.The final battle can also feel a little under welming. Not awful, just weaker than what previously came before it.Another minor note is I feel like they should've spent more time in the cave. It only amounts to about twenty minutes in the film, and I kinda wish they'd spent more time there.Still though, a solidly entertaining movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Special effects still stand, and the storytelling, directing, acting are all on point; there is never a wasted scene, and its relative sober nature compare to the later extravagant MCU flicks helps making it feel a lot more grounded.

The beginning of a legend,"Iron Man, now 15 years old (I'm old), is an excellent movie that introduced the world to Tony Stark, the billionaire industrialist who builds a pimped out suit of iron and transforms into a superhero. The film was a game-changer and revolutionized the superhero movie genre, and how to create an interconnected universe.The acting in this film is top-notch, led by Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark as an arrogant, quick-witted, and charming hero. Downey perfectly captures the character's transformation from a selfish and ruthless businessman to a hero who is willing to put his life on the line to save others. I still believe Downey deserved recognition at the Oscars for his iconic portrayal.The storyline is very engaging, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and emotion that set the tone for over a decade worth of movies. The direction by Jon Favreau is excellent, and the special effects are impressive. The film manages to balance the spectacle of the explosions and action scenes with the depth of the characters and their relationships.The supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as James Rhodes, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, are all excellent and bring depth to their respective roles. A pity Howard didn't return, and that Bridges is a one and done character.Overall, Iron Man is a must-watch for fans of the superhero genre. The movie is well-crafted, entertaining, and manages to be both fun and meaningful.

A good movie (only) for kids...,"In my opinion, not nearly as good as everybody says. In a nutshell, a very good movie, but suitable only for kids (but rated PG13...?)Why, one would ask?

Granted, I am not a fan of superhero pictures (I think that they are much better printed in comic books, where they belong), but having said that, there are some outstanding movies based on comic books out there that are far, far better than Iron Man (the Batman and Spiderman franchises come to mind). Iron Man's story is so simple, so childish, I am certain even many kids will find it uninteresting.But then again, what do I know?

At first I wasn't sure what to make of the middle east conflict being involved in this movie but I think it was actually incorporated pretty well and a reminder to the existence of terrorist groups and actual war in that part of the country, as well as the possible abuse of weapons.I think I'm becoming a superhero fan!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man,"I did not have any expectation from this movie, especially after seeing the trailers a couple of times. I had thought  the same usual stuff, and had reminded me of Transformers, gadgets etc. which I do not like.But when I settled down in the movie hall, within first 20 minutes, I started enjoying what was going on.A genius arms industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is kidnapped by terrorist in Afghanistan and asked to make the deadliest weapon for them; Tony instead makes the Iron shield that would help him to escape from the clutches of terrorists. He succeeds. Back in US, he realizes the big dis-service he is doing to the world by designing and selling arms. Against the wishes of his industrialist partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) he decides to stop the company and he designs the Iron Man suit. Once ready, he fights the terrorist, but faces a new enemy in Obadiah who designs a similar giant Iron suit. The last fight is between our real life hero Iron Man and this giant Iron Man.Robert Downey Jr. is the most unlikely hero material for such a role. He is middle aged, does not look suitable for such a heroic role. But surprise, surpriseit is only because of Robert Downey Jr. that the movie becomes watchable. He is a great actor, and brings the extra punch to the persona of Tony Stark, that it is hard to imagine anyone else in his shoes.The movie is a fantasy movie and so everything is tolerated  no question asked. But it is entertaining. The movie thrills and has right amout of humor and action to keep you entertained. The Iron man suit is really cool and convincing enough to believe what all things it can do.It was interesting to hear the terrorist in Afghanistan talk several languages, one of them was Urdu  Hindustani. Interesting! A good entertainment..I enjoyed it a lot, and I am happy that a new series of Iron Man would start with this movie. I am also happy to learn that this movie is doing very well at the box office  not to the happiness of the detractors who did not bet on this Iron Man.

Stark would have been liverwurst at that point.Then we find out that his heart condition is now merely shrapnel.And that's all I could stand.Why couldn't they make an Ironman movie about Ironman? Why did they have to make one about some god-awful person who was only fit for a Kardashian wedding.They could have had a decent movie that was faithful to Ironman and used the same plot.Extremely poor if you like Ironman. Maybe okay if you favor crap.I won't regret not seeing this turkey, but I do regret the five minutes that I spent seeing how badly they treated a pretty decent character.This movie gets one star for the casting.

Real Iron hero.,"A military jeep moving through a lifeless desert-symbolically marking not only the beginning of Iron Man's story but also the birth of the entire MCU.In the vehicle's cabin, alongside three soldiers, is the main casting gem of Marvel Studios - Robert Downey Jr.It seems that Jon Favreau (the director) understands perfectly who his main trump card is. That is why he starts building the personality of Tony Stark from the very beginning. First AC/DC music, then we get the sarcastic remarks and appearance of person -clear character development. Every phrase, action, joke, and improvisation, along with the incredible charisma and dedication of the actor, contributes to the overall result. The formula for a classic hero has long been known: at the end of the narrative, he must become the best version of himself.Tony is a wonderful example of this. As a result of the film, having gone through deprivation, trials, and a reassessment of values, Stark Jr., decides to direct his energy, resources, and knowledge for the benefit of humanity. The audience easily connects with such stories. People have always wanted to believe in miracles.Perhaps even more than that, we love well-balanced stories where authors combine the funny and the sad, the dangerous and the thrilling, the inspiring and the profound meaning. The evidence before us suggests that, in the past, films in the Marvel universe indeed embodied these qualities.They were smart, vivid works of art, crafted with immense passion, inventiveness, and love. When watching «Iron Man», I feel all of this. There is a fear of potential failure and a responsibility to the fans. There is creativity. There is imagination. There is an attempt to execute the work with the utmost quality on all possible levels, aiming to achieve more than just another action film, to establish a solid foundation for the Infinity saga, to create a milestone in the history of world cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man - 8/10,"1. Overall Plot - 8/10
This is a perfect introduction to Tony Stark and Iron Man. This film is revolutionary to super hero films as we know it. It set up a comic cinematic universe for the first time. It is a great origin story that really shows why Stark becomes Iron Man and what it means to him. It is very good at showing how Stark deals with different challenges, and yearns for survival. The antagonist is setup to be a villain in a way that makes sense for reality, and is something that would actually happen.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 9/10
This film does a great job of keeping you attentative and entertained for the entirety of the film. At no point did I get bored while watching it.It keeps you engaged very well, by constantly giving Stark new challenges and adversaries to overcome.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 7/10
Nothing in this film hits you hard emotionally, but it still uses your emotions to keep you engaged. You understand and agree with the hero in his journey of trying to do good.Throughout the film things are being setup for the future that leaves you invested in the overarching story very well.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 8/10
The theme of this movie is making right your wrongs, and doing what is right. The way Stark learns from his mistakes and learns to do what's right and become responsible is done very well.5. Characters - 10/10
All of the characters are portrayed very well and accurate. The choice in side characters and villain feel great, and fit extremely well for an origin story. And they use lots of different characters to set things up for the future very well too.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
The choice of Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark is absolutely perfect. And years later I still can't imagine anyone else being as good as he is. His personality fits extremely well, and even a lot of RDJ's real life challenges are similar to Tony Stark's in the comics.All of the other actors did a phenomenal job and I have no complaints.However, Terrance Howard as Rhodey wasn't very good. This could be biased, because at this point I'm just used to Don Cheadle. But putting that aside, his acting seemed kind of dull, and he didn't really show any emotion throughout the whole film.7. Cinematography - 9/10
I LOVE the way some of the action shots are filmed. All of the flight sequences are very fast paced and exciting. The frame the shots with Iron Man to make him look super cool all the time.The only complaint I could really think of is that it is kind of generic. There is nothing special, and it is filmed like every other action movie.Another thing I really enjoy, is the shots of inside Iron Man's mask. The way they still made it so you could see Tony Stark and get his emotions is great. And it is done in a very cool way of showing things he would see, like the heads up display.8. Score - 8/10
I really like the music in this one. It fits Tony Stark's personality so well. And goes well with the action of the movie.9. Editing / Pace - 9/10
The scenes when Stark is suited up as Iron Man are edited very well. The way you get the action shots, and shots inside his mask to see what he is thinking and feeling is very cool.This movie is paced super well. It doesn't really have any boring parts, and you are entertained throughout.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 7/10
For 2008 standards the effects in this film are spectacular. Even in today's standards they hold up pretty well.The only complaint I have is whenever it shows Iron Man with part of his suit off. The CGI with the human hand or head with the rest of the suit just isn't very good.The explosions in this movie are done very well. They are all either real practical explosions, or the CGI for them is done very well.Average Score:
8.4/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
8/10
This is a very good super hero movie. It is also revolutionary because it kickstarted the whole MCU. I love when the Iron Man character is just Tonh Stark being a genius who just wants to help people. And this is perfectly that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man,"Having inherited his father's skill, ""Tony Stark"" is supplying just about every bit of military hardware to the US Government. On a trip to Afghanistan, however, his convoy is ambushed and he is seriously injured. He awakens in a cave, held hostage by insurgents, and with the help of co-captive ""Yinsen"" (Shaun Toub) must use all of his skills to stay alive and to find a way out of his predicament. Cannibalising just about every bit of kit he can find, he concocts a power source to keep him alive and a suit of armour that enables him to fight his way out. Once free, he determines to further hone this flying suit of armour and use it for the common good. His business partner ""Vanko"" (Jeff Bridges) soon realises there are other, more lucrative, uses and a conspiracy is soon afoot. Can ""Stark"" thwart him and save the day? As ever, there is no jeopardy whatsoever - what this is, is a fun action adventure with loads of top notch visual effects and quite a bit of humour in a script well delivered by an on-form Downey well supported by Gwyneth Paltrow and a solid cast. The ""Iron Man"" stories are not the most complex. It's a pretty linear depiction of good and evil - though it does, at the start, demonstrate some of the ironies of the weapons supplies industry. It's overly long, we spend just a bit too much time getting going, but once it does - it is worth a watch on a big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
my favorite forever,"When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Downey's the man!,"Its Robert Downey Jr.'s day in the sun as he absolutely nails the character of Tony Stark! The playboy billionaire who develops a conscience seems to be the part that Downey was born to play. Often, a problem with first super hero outings is that the backstory establishing the origins of the hero gets cumbersome. As a result, action is compromised and one waits for the sequel which one hopes will hit the ground running. While an elaborate backstory is depicted in Iron Man as well, it never gets tedious. The action, when it arrives, is all metal & testosterone and while the climactic battle could have done with a bit more flair, there really isn't much to complain about. The always reliable Jeff Bridges as Iron Man's nemesis is excellent & so are Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard as the allies. Despite the predictability that inevitably plagues the comic-book-superhero genre, director Jon Favreau injects a freshness into proceedings & never loses his grip on the pacing. A couple of hours well spent!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man becomes realistic in Favreau's film.,"Iron Man is a stylish, intellectually sensual, restless characterized film that tells the simple event of good vs bad with an inclusion of science and politics combined. Favreau has brilliantly depicted the idea of a superhero in as much realistic as possible. Iron man is engulfed in global issues like terrorism on one side and personal jealousy on the other hand. By showing how science could lead to both humane and evil ends the film have made a special mark in Marvel based films. You will be entertained and will be engaged throughout the film. Favreau, though depicted the very American tendency, constituting glam girls, successful millionaires, USA lordships behind terror fundings and exotic techies but still he correctly have shown the transformation that Tony underwent. How tony became reunited with rural peaceful minds, thought for them, understood the futile showy attitudes, contended by sitting on the floor or perhaps surviving on a cave with the help of an unknown fan etc.There is no other imaginative villains in the film. Both hero and villain are Iron man, one is humane and other is not. Iron man is not a fantasized character rather a man named Tony Stark (Robert D. Junior) in iron suit brilliantly developed by a himself, out of desperation under various circumstances, who saw the terrible reality in the practical ground. He becomes confused about how his previous creation have brought doom to so many lives. This turns his table upside down and he changes, enquires about the reality, takes a reverse path from previously luxury based reckless life. He becomes humanitarian, tries to make a difference using his acquired knowledge, among all the multi billion dollar corporate minds and his glamourous society. This bought him insult and mostly unsupported by many, but his constant eagerness bought him to the reality. And he wages the final war, out of which he turns victorious. But his victory in the war is not as easy as bed of roses rather portrayed very real, which is a treat to watch. Robert and Jeff fits well with the role too as the hero and villain.The chemistry between Mr Stark and Miss Potts is lovely to see. A decent affair, a relationship of trust from both is what perhaps gave Mr Stark the strength to choose his self rather than what others think. The scene 'Proof that Tony has a heart' and it's relevance to antagony's claim about Tony's 9th symphony are gripping zones of the film. The technical depiction of building the iron suit is included in the film which weighs heavy. Nevertheless there is scientific fallacies too regarding it, which actually doesn't matter because it's an entertaining film not a documentary. So some scenes may falls flat in respect to reality.The humane representations of the film is what impressed me so far. I am not impressed by its visuals or CGI based technology or it's action sequences or even it's glamorous sensuality. Rather I liked the tale of a modern man in his 40s who at first enslaved by technology and materialism, then transforms into a practical human being, becomes a twice born guy and tries to do something for betterment of people. Simply put, John Favreau's have made a story of Iron man with realistic appeal, having practical and believable storyline with performances not the best but still good, well knitted subplots and edges of the script and BGM as appropriate as it could get, like glam and scientific vibes throughout. For me it would be an 81/100. An 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The best hollywood superhero movie,"This film is just so damn enjoyable. Particularly Robert Downey Jr's performance, he makes every scene with him in fun.

Not usually a fan,"I'm not usually a fan of comic book films such as spider man, most batman films, Superman, hulk etc but this should be grouped with Hellboy and X-Men as one of the few that really make the grade as great films independent of their comic book heritage.The acting from the entire cast was superb and the action looked polished and was highly entertaining. The thing I appreciated about this film the most was the witty and well delivered humour that credited the audience with some intelligence and didn't resort to the usual slapstick that a lot of these films tend to go for, in fact it was this feature in the trailers that really drew me towards this film and fortunately it stuck to it's word. If only Indiana Jones had lived up to its trailer, which, on seeing it for the first time before Ironman last night, was much better than the film itself.Overall Ironman is great fun and refreshingly mature (in some ways!!!) and credible for a film of its genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Surprise, surprise.","I scoffed at the idea of this film being made initially. Having not-so-fond memories of 1990's Captain America and 2004 and 1989's The Punisher will make you wary of any Marvel movie but surprise, surprise. Iron Man is actually a decent film, and Marvel's lofty goals of a possible Avengers film look plausible if this good effort is a sign of things to come.Robert Downey Jr. was a natural pick for the role, and surprisingly Jeff Bridges had a pull-out-the-stops performance for his role as Obadiah Stane. The movie is full-of-wit, humor and character. Comic book characters such as Tony Stark and Pepper Potts seem to be more real on the silver screen than real life persons being portrayed and I think that's where the real cinch is here. Somehow, past the science fiction and action, we can still identify with these characters, albeit in a humorous way if any, that we can enjoy the film. Because once we return to the action the film doesn't hold up well anymore on its own, particularly during the final fight between Stane and Stark. Nevertheless the film ended on the best note yet, for all movies that lead into sequels, and a valuable lesson is learned for myself that you shouldn't judge a movie by its poster or genre all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Let the Fun Begin,"'Iron Man' starts the MCU off with a big bang, and over 30 movies later, it still holds up as one of it's best entries.I remember before this came out there was a lot of uncertainty and trepidation. RDJ had previously hit rock bottom and was in no way regarded as a bankable star. Favreau wanted him and had vision. He had faith in RDJ and the character of Stark/Iron Man.It's hard to believe, but Iron Man was not a well known character to non comic book people and it was a gamble kicking off a possible franchise with a relatively unknown character. I'd say it paid off. Also, comic book movies were not trending at that time, and had a recent rough history, with few successes. Since then, this movie and everything to follow completely changed the movie landscape, for better or worse.Terrance Howard was a great Colonel Rhodes and it's too bad he got greedy.

What Happened To The Mandarin?,"Every super hero needs an arch nemesis. Spiderman has the Green Goblin, Batman has the Joker, Superman has Lex Luthor. As any longtime time reader of the comics knows, Iron Man's arch nemesis is the Mandarin. So why is Obadiah Stane, a relatively minor villain, the bad guy in the movie adaptation? I suspect political correctness. The Mandarin is an old school ""yellow peril"" inscrutable oriental super villain modeled on Fu Manchu. You could still get away with stereotypes like this in the early sixties when Stan Lee and co. dreamed up the Mandarin, but now the character comes off as distinctly racist.Which is too bad. The Mandarin could be easily revamped for the current generation. After all, Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter ego, started as a shameless member of the military-industrial complex, doing his part to win the Cold War for Uncle Sammy. It wasn't until the seventies that he experienced self-doubt, redirected Stark Industries into humanitarian activities, and became a born-again peacenik. There's no reason the Mandarin couldn't be similarly redesigned to embody, say, the challenge of modern, industrialized China to the United States' global hegemony. Maybe in IRON MAN 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Surprisingly Entertaining Superhero Flick,"I came into the theater looking for Harold and Kumar tickets, expecting a light and silly comedy, but unfortunately, it was sold out.

Granted, all Superhero movies have some similarities, but this was often a far-cry from many of the unrealistic, somewhat laughable superhero movies we see today. The villains are not as defined as some of the others, but that may actually a positive in this film. Instead of seeing Spiderman fight the Green Goblin for 150 minutes, you get to enjoy a great plot and very solid character development for the protagonist. But don't worry, you get some great action sequences as well.The acting overall was solid. Robert Downey Jr. owned his role as Tony Stark, the weapons genius/mogul. He played his part close to flawlessly, and often carried this film. Jeff Bridges also had a noteworthy performance as Obadiah Stone. I must say Gwyneth Paltrow has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means.The special effects were very slick, and the visuals were stunning as expected.

"Not bad at all, but no classic.","The season of blockbuster movies in 2008 kicked off with yet another adaptation from Marvel Comics, this time the lesser known Iron Man. This being the first independent film from Marvel Studios, with its all-star cast, it's clear that they're pinning high hopes on this one.Director Jon Favreau does it clean cut, going by the same ol' ""rule of thumb"" in making comic book movies; hero inherits power, tests them, uses them, then villain gets his too( you know the rest but in case you didn't I won't spoil it for ya). Some of his bad decisions almost proved costly though; for example, his choice of non-linear story-telling in the beginning(he seemed to have taken the ""Batman Begins"" example too literally) nearly backfired. Unlike Christopher Nolan who utilized the style and enhanced the story-telling process, it gave some minor pacing problems to Iron Man, which continued towards the end. Despite that, Favreau has his share of praises though; his reputation as an ""actor's director"", letting the Oscar-worthy cast improvise their performances, was what separated this from the mediocrity suffered by the likes of Fantastic Four etc. And the numerous references made to the figures and icons of the gargantuan Marvel Universe would send the pulses of fan boys racing, in what looked like another step towards a ""Avengers"" movie(an all-star team of Marvel superheroes).Robert Downey Jr. is almost perfect as Tony Stark. From the moment he came into the picture, the entire movie thrived on his abundant flow of charisma, dry wit and deadpan humor, comparable to the likes of Jack Sparrow from the Pirates movies. It really makes you wonder who else could have commanded the role so seemingly effortlessly. The rest of the cast is more than competent; Jeff ""Lebowski"" Bridges is unrecognizable as the ruthless and manipulative Obadiah Stane, while Gwyneth Paltrow is *gasp* likable as the damsel in distress. Terrence Howard is underused here but matches Downey Jr. with his own brand of humor, and one of his lines which underlined his future role even gave me goosebumps.All in all, a great way to start the summer, as the world braces itself for yet another year of sequels and adaptations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"200 years from now, maybe...","I wish they could have found a way to make the Iron Man technology fall a little more in the realm of realism, but instead they took the 'transformers' route and made the technology from 200 to 300 years in the future, literally. Some will say, ""yeah but its a movie, so who cares?"" and to a certain extent I agree, but in this particular case the technology is so far from what is possible now, that the whole movie made no sense because it was presented as if it was happening in the modern day. This lack of realism affected the whole movie to the extent that when I walked out, I felt like I had seen a film about cavemen building F1 race cars and putting on their own Indy 500. It was that insane.At least in 'Batman Begins' the technology was only off by 10-20 years, and it was set in an alternate universe where the exact date was never set, so I was able to suspend disbelief for 2 hours with no problem.The lack of realism is further hindered by the obvious fact that they never built the suit, it was 100% digital from start to finish. This is lame in the same way that not making a single storm trooper suit for the last 3 star wars movies was lame. Lame! I hope Iron Man is the last big movie in the super hero genre because I for one am completely sick to death of getting the two hour origin story of every new hero thats introduced on film. Can you imagine the 2 hour origin of Thor or Namor? Somebody kill me before these movies are made...Robert Downey was Tony Stark, I'll give him that, best part of the movie.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man is a Total Blast!,"As many of you probably know: Iron Man is the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which is a connection of multiple superhero movies in one shared universe. Directed by Jon Favreau, it stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwenyth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges. I absolutely love this movie.Billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is injured and captured by a terrorist organization called The Ten Rings to build a weapon. Tony builds a mechanical suit of armor to escape and is shortly rescued. When he gets back home, Tony decides to announce that his company will no longer make weapons. He makes a more advanced suit and decides to use it to fight evil.My favorite scene of the movie is when Iron Man fights Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), a co-worker who has made an even bigger mechanical suit of armor. The armor on armor action feels more personal than him blowing up a tank or outmaneuvering a couple of jets, which are also great scenes. Seeing them use their weapons against each other was exciting. Despite knowing how these movies usually go, there was tension in that fight that made it believable for Obadiah to defeat Iron Man.I really enjoyed the story they told in this movie. The sound effects are great. It has excellent action scenes. The cast is overall very good. The designs of the Iron Man suits look amazing. Jeff Bridges as the main villain is really good. Jon Favreau should be very proud of the movie he made.The actor that stands out the most in this movie is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. He nails the personality of Iron Man and is often humorous. They couldn't have made a better casting choice and it's great to know he will be returning in many of the MCU films.Iron Man is a great action-packed film with solid performances and entertaining scenes across the board. I highly recommend it to action and superhero fans who love a good story. For keen-eyed Marvel fans Stan Lee does make a cameo. In case you aren't familiar with Marvel its a tradition to have him appear briefly because he helped create a lot of the characters. Be sure to stay after the credits for an additional scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Scrap Metal,"It's loud, it's lame and after all of the hype should make a trillion dollars as the same ready to mix super hero recipe follows all of the directions in this overcooked CGI spectacular of blowin' things up real good. Updated from its comic book beginnings to our present century of world terror I M villains are the usual suspects of semi-literate hateful Afghans and greedy American capitalists strikingly familiar to the same difficult types encountered by Super,Spider and Bat mans.Tony Stark, brilliant inventor and mega rich arms dealer goes through a moral conversion after being wounded and captured by Afghan terrorists. Managing to build an armor plated flying suit under the eyes of his moronic captors he escapes to fight another day, this time in a really neat looking metallic model. When Tony wants to do a one eighty with the business his evil partner attempts to thwart him. Who shall win this titanic struggle of good and evil? Who cares. We're here to be visually mesmerized and that we are but only for brief periods and with the same twists and turns crashes and explosions that every mega budgeted fiction fantasy flic offers.Robert Downey Jr. as the I Man is a brilliant piece of marketing in art imitating life. The one time drug sodden loser like the comic book character has managed to rise Phoenix like from the ashes of a ruined career and parlay it into what looks to be a mega money maker for the next decade. Downey is the right choice but hardly tested as an actor since a super hero's emotional range is very limited (it's the reason villains are so much more interesting)but he does manage to bring a cool hipness to the square super hero model. Jeff Bridges overacts a tad with an evil Daddy Warbucks impression and Gwyneth Paltrow as suffering girl Friday Pepper Potts seems to be in the downward spiral Downey was with the culprit not being drugs but lack of talent.The special effects are predictably spectacular and there's a heavy metal music score to bludgeon you along the way as the assembly line plot unfolds with less grace than the first Spiderman and even less humor and suspense than Robo-Cop.

One of the best the MCU has to offer.,"This is easily in my top 5 favorite CBM origin films. I did not see this or any MCU movie in theaters until Age of Ultron. But The suit-up scene is still amazing to this day. One of my favourite scenes is the start when we see the unpainted Mark 2 for the very first time. The pan up the suit to the helmet is wild. This is the movie which started it all in the MCU and it proved that you don't need a popular character to make a good superhero movie and before someone tries to correct me I'm asserting that I meant MAINSTREAM popular. Before anyone argues about his popularity in the comics. Back in 2007-2008, no one expected this movie to be great let alone do as well as it did at the box office. Hell, it grossed more than Batman Begins and Superman Returns. Give credit to whoever you want, but this movie would not have worked if they'd cast anyone other than Robert Downey, Jr. For the role and for that I thank Jon Favreau, who had to fight for RDJ's casting. 2008 was an epic year, with *Iron Man* and *The Dark Knight* coming to us in the same summer! Although tonally very different, they both accomplished so much for the superhero/comic book genre of films in that they legitimized the category by being a great film first and ""based on a comic book"" second. Robert Downey Jr. Is up there with Hugh Jackman and Chris Evans as pitch perfect casting, to the point where it is going to be extremely difficult for Marvel Studios to re-cast the character down the line if need be. ""*Tony Stark was able to build this, in a cave! ...with a box of scraps!*"" I also think Obadiah Stane is under-rated because he sort of falls into the familiar trope of 'evil version of hero rises to challenge said hero', but even though this becomes a bit of a common theme among origin films it is still the first film in the MCU and imo necessary for Tony Stark's character arc that he sees the destructive potential for his own creation (which is possibly why *Iron Man 2* is not as widely loved, because the main villain is pretty one dimensional and another version of Stark creations gone bad, despite the fact that it sets up make a god bleed in *Infinity War*).Anyways to wrap this up *Iron Man* is so pivotal to the creation of the MCU that it remains in my Top 10 MCU Movies, just edging out *Captain America: The First Avenger*.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great,"Iron Man, the blast that launched the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the stratosphere, and oh, did it soar. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is a magnetic force, blending genius with a hefty dose of charisma that had me rooting for the billionaire playboy turned armored hero. The film editing is as slick as Stark's engineering prowess, seamlessly building the arc reactor of a narrative that powers the entire MCU. Strengths? The origin story done right, giving us not just a superhero but a flawed and charming human beneath the metal suit. Weaknesses? The plot occasionally veers into predictable territory, but it's forgivable when the repulsor beams start firing. The music, Ramin Djawadi's score, is the sonic blueprint of heroism, turning every suit-up sequence into a symphony of metal on metal. Cinematography captures the glitzy tech world and the gritty reality of Stark's transformation, creating a visual feast for comic book enthusiasts. The message? A reminder that even the most brilliant minds can find redemption in doing good for the world. 8/10 is an Iron Man armor-grade salute to its game-changing brilliance, a film that not only kickstarted a cinematic universe but also made us believe in heroes in high-tech armor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
delivers what's expected but goes on longer than it needs to,"Downey brings the perfect blend of strength, smarts, and humor to the role of Tony Stark, a flip and wealthy industrialist who's made a name for himself by following in the footsteps of his late father and producing high-tech weaponry without assuming any responsibility. A near-fatal accident in the Afghan desert leaves him with an artificial heart, and for the first time allows him to see the repercussions of his business endeavors. A changed man, he decides to pull the plug on weapons marketing and surreptitiously builds a state-of-the-art iron suit that gives him the capability to combat rebel militia groups who've acquired his technology under the table...but unfortunately that's easier said than done. Marvel Comics adaptation is less fanciful than most of its predecessors but certainly true to the genre, well-cast with intriguing (and believable) characters, spectacular action/effects sequences, and an engaging hero, the only thing it lacks is a human story compelling enough to sustain its length. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I am boring Man! (well, for 1/2 the movie at least)","I'll give it a 6 because the effects were such that everything looked physically real. Nothing too shiny, gravity actually exists, things like that.But honestly, this movie just drags in places where the director thinks he is developing character. But he's not. RDJr. is wooden, Jeff Bridges is phoning it in, Gwenyth (sp?) is simply awful with no personality (what's new?).One more ""evil corporation"" movie in the books. And setting this movie in the pseudo real world just makes it confusing. What the heck is Jim Cramer doing plugging his stupid ""Mad Money"" show in this movie? He's a clown for one thing, and it takes us COMPLETELY out of the alternate reality universe, as does the whole Afghanistan thing (despite us not actually fighting Taliban or Al Qaeda there).But on the plus side, there were a lot of AUDIs in the movie, including my new favorite car the A5/S5, so that's a plus. And a modified Boeing BBJ digitally changed to have some weird tail section.But considering all the hype and the positive reviews, I was expecting something, I don't know, great?

FilmCreature Reviews 'Iron Man',"Quick review here.You can breathe, fanboys. 'Iron Man' lives up the the hype (unlike that godawful '300'). Robert Downey, Jr. is effective and funny as Tony Stark the profiteer-turned-mechanical-superhero. The action scenes are truly awesome. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard's poorly written roles are outdone by their finely tuned performances. (Although I did laugh harder at Paltrow's ""hohoba"" rant in 'Proof' than at any time in 'Iron Man'.) Jeff Bridges is especially good (in an equally bad role), as the John Malkovich/Darth Bill Gates villain.It does seem at times that the screenplay only requires clever dialogue for Downey's character. This nearly lethal habit gets annoying after a bit (I mean after the first five minutes).'Iron Man' is doesn't contain anything new or original, but the performances are excellent, the special effects are exhilarating and groundbreaking, and the inept screenplay does have its moments with some clever dialogue. This is stuff for a particular audience, if you get what I mean.2.5/4",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

He Is Iron Man,"Back to basics here as my MCU rewatch continues with the movie that launched the MCU in an explosive way led by the always charismatic RDJ. I couldn't imagine Iron Man any other way than with him at the helm as Iron Man. He just makes the character come to life and his chemistry with all the other characters he interacts with is just so damn good you cannot help but smile as you witness most of his scenes. Although the first movie takes a while to Iron Man with having it have to tell the origin story which takes about 30-35 minutes to do, the second half really picks up and ends with a cool mech on mech fight that some may consider to be lame but I enjoyed it for what it was worth. It's a breath of fresh air compared to most of the later MCU flicks having to end with big CGI sky beam battles etc. Overall, Iron Man still holds up well almost 17 years later and is a damn fun ride along the way with action and spurts of comedy sprinkled about here and there.

Will always be one of my favourites,"A perfect introduction to not only RDJ as Tony Stark, but also to the Marvel movie franchise.RDJ completely embodies both Iron Man and Tony Stark as if he was born the play this role.This movie serves as a great, yet unconventional, hero's origin as his personality suggests you shouldn't like him but you can't help but love him throughout the entire film.RDJ may be the star of the film but all the supporting cast add to it's quality and Jon Favreau demonstrates he can direct just as good as he can act. Also, the action and laughs make this movie infinitely re-watchable.The scale may not be a large as later movies but that does not take away from it's quality. However, the only flaw may be the movies villain which is not as compelling as other characters here, or villains that feature later in the franchise. Despite this, the villain is still a good one and Jeff Bridges delivers as always.Overall, as Marvel Studios keep producing more and more mcu additions, I have no doubt this will remain one of my favourites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Jeff Bridges as our first supervillain of the MCU Obadiah Stane was a perfect choice and great casting. Probably personally one of my favorite villains of the MCU. Terrance Howard as Rhodey I thought was great. I liked the chemistry him and Robert Downey Jr had. It is kind of a bummer that Terrance Howard gets recast in the second Iron Man, but honestly I cannot imagine anyone other than Don Cheadle nowadays playing the character. Other than that, Terrance Howard did a good job in this film. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is definitely as far as love interests goes in the MCU one of my favorites ever and is astonishing.

The plot undergoes makeover for contemporary times thus making it easy to relate. As with any Marvel comic it has complex protagonist narrating a tale of transformation into a super-hero. Robert Downey Jr is impeccable, but was he warranted in the super-hero race? Your guess is good as mine. Jeff Bridges leaves an impact as the second in command.

Not a bad way to start off the summer...,"Other reviews I've read have been mixed, so I was worried that my eager anticipation of this movie was unwarranted. Thankfully, Iron Man turned out to be a rather enjoyable experience for me.Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as the movie's protagonist: genius inventor and weapon's tycoon Tony Stark. He starts off as snarky and arrogant, but he undergoes a change of heart (both figuratively and literally) after he's captured by terrorists who use weapons he's manufactured to do their dastardly deeds. He escapes, thanks to a suit of armor he built on the fly, and vows to use his technology for the betterment of mankind rather than it's destruction. He returns to America, retires to his fancy seaside condo, and begins work on a second prototype of that same suit of armor.As I mentioned before, Downey's performance was fantastic. The supporting cast was pretty good overall as well, particularly Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's perky assistant Pepper Potts (alliterative names are so fun, aren't they?). The only chink in the armor, as far as the cast is concerned, is Terrance Howard. He seems like he's going through the motions, like a high school freshman who doesn't want to be in the play, but his parents forced him to audition for it. His role isn't that big, thankfully, so his lackluster performance is tolerable.My one and only gripe, and one I'll probably get flack for, is that there's not enough action. I like superhero movies with an engaging story and dynamic characters, and Iron Man's characters and plot are well rounded. But more emphasis is put on plot development than blowing stuff up, rather than finding a balance between the two. ""Spider-Man"" and ""Batman Begins"" are movies that have successfully found this balance, which is what made them so great.That doesn't mean Iron Man is terrible. In fact, it's far from it. The action that IS there is beautifully orchestrated, the special effects are top notch, and the script is well-written.

Something to do,"Very similar to the approach Marvel had with it's Fantastic Four series and other marvel movies; lots of one liners, new model cars (and other shameless displays of endorsements), and cute/kinda lame cameo's by Stan Lee (I love the man but the joke is losing its luster). But you know what, it still was entertaining. Really it was. Hulk (first one), Daredevil, catwoman, punisher, etc. Those are all beneath this one and will probably always reside in that section of the totem poll because they were exceptionally horrible.The only notable complaint I had with Iron Man was this; Gwyneth Paltrow needs to learn to act accordingly in front of a green/blue/whatever screen. There were chase sequences where her character was in danger yet she reacted as if she were missing a flight or an elevator. Just didn't feel the urgency.Otherwise: Downey is still a remarkably efficient softener and Jr. pulled off the acting with flying colors.Oh yeah, I enjoyed leaving the theater with a Sabbath soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A flawless Start to the MCU,"With the start of what we know now as the MCU, Marvel's Iron Man makes a huge impact and starts up a beloved series perfectly in this first installment.With now legendary director Jon Favreau as the director of epic. It proves that superhero movies can be so much more than just corny action flicks that leave the audience with more than just a sour taste in their mouths. Breaking off of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man series to a more serious and more unique story of the billionaire weapons dealer turned superhero after having his chest filled with lead and nearly killing him from it.Every shot in this movie is beautiful and drives the movie and characters further with its great storytelling and various homages to the comics and even the various setups for the future movies to be released in the series. For this now lower budget movie in the MCU at just under $140 Million, it has become a huge influence on the rest of the series and for any future directors as well.Talking about directors, Jon Favreau, he directs the hell out of this film. Every shot like I said is beautiful and each and every angle adds to the whole franchise as well. And with the balance of tones from light hearted comedy to deep metaphoric drama and action sprinkled throughout makes this movie feel real and puts the audience right in the front row to enjoy every second of this two hour film.Acting wise, Robert Downey Jr. does his best acting ever, he is flawless in this film as the Iconic Tony Stark with his oversized ego to his scenes of groundedness too. And with Jon Favreau making a cameo throughout the series as the beloved Happy in it, he proves that he is just fantastic as an actor, writer, and director. Jeff Bridges returns as another beloved antagonist in this film looking extremely different spotting a bald head and thick beard. And of course the various middle-eastern soldiers also do amazing jobs with their comedy and sternness depending on what side has more power. And of course Gwyneth Paltrow kills it as Pepper Potts and sets up one of the best love stories in the MCU to date.The action in this film is flawless, between the comedy bits and one liners used in the film to the overall rustiness of Tony using the suit and not knowing exactly how to control everything in it and what it's full strength is makes every action scene a nail biter for sure. And with the choice to remove any type of music in the major fight scenes makes the whole movie feel more grounded and gritty at the same time.With the start of the MCU going as strong as it physically can, Iron Man is one of the best films in the industry and will stay like this for many many years.Iron Man gets a 9.25/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

After a second watch, I realized how good it was and how much better than so many others.Good and quirky dialog, never a dull moment, well dosed action scenes with enough suspense and sense of danger. Great fun. The characters' motivations are always clear and believability never went below the expected minimum. Action scenes are very well filmed, efficient and never with the usual cheap fast cuts. The villain simply works because it's someone seemingly much more powerful, plus a treacherous man you just love to hate. And our protagonist has much-needed weaknesses: he's only human, and a bomb shrapnel close to his heart.The film looks and sounds great overall. Every character, including Jarvis, adds value and has an important function for the story and the entire casting is just sublime, with Downey's star shining the brightest. He even manages to make you care about a selfish billionaire playboy before he transcends himself.I can't put this film down. It still serves as a benchmark for all other Marvel productions that have come out since and none have achieved it's level, though some have come very close (Winter Soldier).

Iron Man aka Robert Downey Jr Show,"After a long wait and hearing everyone acclaim this movie, I finally had the chance to check it out by myself.This movie is pretty good. It is not Oscar material,its pure entertainment but done very nicely and stylish. In my opinion this is the first successful marvel super hero adaptation to date.The Story has been adapted for the modern times which was a good move in my opinion(In the original story tony stark became iron man during the Vietnam war although later they pushed this moment forward to the golf war.) The plot is good,the GCI is acceptable( the suit is amazing),it has several well made action scenes and as the movie goes on you become even more interested.But the greatest thing about Iron Man is no doubt the choice of Robert Downey Jr to play tony stark and the way producers approached this character. He is a player,he drinks,he smokes, he is a political incorrect smart-ass who wants to live life to the fullest.Just my kind of Hero. And taking into consideration Robert Downey Jr past, you realize that that no one could have done it better. He truly was a bit of tony stark in the past and he excels in this role. If they had shown a little more of this side of tony stark I think the movie would be even better.Iron Man has some tiny flaws but its pure entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Solid, but overrated","7,9 points, I wasn't expecting that. For a movie to deserve such a high rating, it should have something special, or something new. This is a good movie, no doubt. But it isn't intellectual, it isn't moving and it isn't creative. God, it isn't even extraordinary atmospheric. Yes, it's entertaining, very entertaining - I must admit. Of course it has amazing special effects. - But that just isn't enough for me to give it 8 points. I expect more from movies.The story is bad, and totally didn't convince me. But, and this is the true strength of the movie, it's told detailed and well. If you take a closer look at the story, you will realize how simple and uninteresting it is – but the movie does a great job of hiding it. The same goes for Jeff Bridges. He does a great job of hiding how boring his Character is.Filmmakers have such crazy freedom in Superhero movies, sadly they rarely use it. They could have been so much more creative.7.9 points for Iron man. I still can't believe it. X-men, the Tim Burton Batman movies and Watchmen are all rated worse, but are far superior in my opinion. They are more creative, atmospheric and more fun to watch than Iron Man.7 points from me. Because it's a good movie after all.

I quickly out of frustration said ""uh, no it wan't"" I then got into several arguments over the weekend over it.I found the movie entertaining and exciting but over all it was just another forgettable movie. The character of IronMAN was weak and we were punished with poor story and writing with such lines as: ""I can feel it in my heart"" and ""I LOVE THIS SUIT!""x3 It wasn't great by any means.

"Yeah, Iron Man can fly.","Unspectacular. Stygian. Tedious. Youth Hostel. These are just some of the terms you will never hear in conjunction with 'Iron Man,' the latest Marvel superhero brought to life with hundreds of millions of dollars for the big screen. Happily, it belongs far more to the 'X-Men' and 'Batman Begins' camp more than it does to the poorhouse inhabited by 'Ghostrider,' 'Daredevil,' and 'The Fantastic Four.' However, 'Iron Man' appears to be holding back slightly throughout (clearly for the sequel), which prevents it from properly cementing its status as one of the frontrunners of the superhero genre.Iron Man works due to Robert Downey Jr. It is as simple as that. With any other actor in the role (except perhaps Christian Bale; obviously not an option), the character of Tony Stark would have been an annoying, conceited and unfunny idiot with a beard. Therefore, the film could not work. Downey Jr, on the other hand, becomes Tony Stark incarnate. He makes him likable and believable, especially during his transformation from carefree playboy to killing machine. Unlike other superhero movies, where upon gaining their life changing powers the protagonist becomes a total do-gooder with absolute values towards right and wrong, Tony Stark remains grounded in his own world, maintaining his own flawed set of beliefs and essentially continuing to live as the same person. Due to his status as a playboy there is no blatantly proposed love interest which is a relief because nobody goes to see a superhero film to watch the protagonist try to find true love (think about that, Batman.) Sure, eventually Tony will bed his assistant, the outlandishly named Pepper Potts (a shrewd Gwyneth Paltrow), but not in this instalment so nobody has to worry. Also, as much of Terence Howard's role as Colonel Jim Rhodes (the future most imaginatively titled superhero ever, War Machine) was cut, there is little focus on characters who aren't Tony. Downey Jr has all the time he needs to mould his protagonist into a real human being. Conveniently it also leaves much more time for seamless CGI ass kicking which, with the exception of the final battle, leaves you wishing Tony Stark spent more time in the suit than he does designing it. One case in point is when the 'Man is flying at the speed of sound when he is shot from the air by a tank. After falling hundreds of feet to the ground he stands up, sidesteps a second tank shell and then destroys it with a flick of his wrist. It is so cool. Explosions and death for all.'Iron Man' does not deserve congratulations all round though. Director Jon Favreau decided at some point that, instead of a final battle between good and evil which would uphold the intelligent atmosphere created by the rest of the film, he would direct the sequel to 'Transformers' instead and shoehorn it in. Because apparently that is what everybody wanted. Iron Man battles the ingeniously named and similarly attired Iron Monger (played camped-up villain style by Jeff Bridges), who take turns to punch each other through buildings. When they tire of this (not soon enough), they fly into the air and punch each other some more. Finally, they fall to the ground, punch each other in the helmets a little and then the entire audience has a seizure and dies. It is such a letdown. Sure, Jeff Bridges' character was a little cartoonish in relation to the darker tone pervading the film anyway, but that doesn't mean that the final twenty minutes of 'Iron Man' should be the equivalent of watching somebody play a video game.Aside from this, 'Iron Man' is still easily able to support its reputation as the first of this Summer's 'must-see' blockbusters and, with Robert Downey Jr wholly committed to the character and the inevitable sequels, it could supersede 'Spiderman' as Marvel's flagship franchise. The creases just have to be ironed out. As Jim Rhodes says, ""Next time, baby!""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A really simple and nice hero movie,"A great origin story about an egotistical weapons dealer learning the effect of his actions and trying to change for the better, the story is really well told and very sweet but it is still relatively basic and is a simple origin story, the movies villain is also very boring and uninteresting with no real reason for being evil, that being said it is still a fun and enjoyable movie that is definitely one of mcus best and a great film to just watch with or without the mcus instalments.

Birth of the MCU,"I've seen all the marvel movies many times, big fan of comics, big fan of the movies. Recently I decided to rewatch them all one after the other to see if I liked them anymore or less.Iron man is one of those films that easily stands on its own where others need cameos or connections to feel part of the MCU. It's easily the best origin movie, it has that comedy charm but before it became a bit too Disney. RDJ as iron man probably won't be remembered in 20,30 years as iconic. But for this generation and genre it should be. He is Tony Stark, and makes this movie and what turned out to be a full blown franchise/universe.This film holds up now despite being shockingly 12 years old at the time of writing.

I liked how they incorporated world events into the story: in this case, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) makes weapons for the army but has misgivings after his experience in Afghanistan. I'll admit that I'm not really any fan of superhero stories.

Decent Comic Book Action Sunk By Flimsy Plot.,"First and foremost, I am an ardent fan of Marvel Comics and even though my favourite superhero happens to be Spidey, I decided to catch this flick as comic book film adaptations have always been a must-see for me.As expected, this film draws its blood from the Iron Man comics from Marvel and Favreau directs this one beautifully. Downey's performance as the poor little rich boy Tony Stark is average to say the least and his chemistry with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is awkward. However, this does not totally derail the film from its track of satisfying the Iron Man fans in the aisles.The premise and basically the whole plot of the film is stupefyingly simple which in a positive way, does not distract the viewers from the actual action sequences but does pull down the quality of cinematography for this film.Tony Stark builds a suit and fights bad guys climaxing with a furious battle against the main villain. Works for comic books but in this case, you'll probably figure out who's the arch nemesis from the very beginning which really kills the plot head-on. Not that there's anything wrong with it since Spider-man, X-Men and other comic book film adaptations worked around it fine but somehow, Iron Man doesn't quite pull it off.Perhaps it's the stereotypical fact of Stark being an American and having to fight USA's number one enemy (read: Middle-Eastern Caucasian-hating terrorists). Or maybe it's how the arch nemesis goes overboard at displaying how he's the baddest of all badasses. Or it's just the fact that there's only a SINGLE part where Iron-Man actually fights bad guys before the final sequences with the main villain. I for one would have preferred Stark take on more bad guys instead of just having a major part of the movie focused on the drama of Stark's personal and corporate life.The ending is particularly unsurprising so don't expect any shocking revelations. A cliff- hanger it may be but still, anyone watching could've spotted it a mile away.In short, Iron Man is an average quality comic book film adaptation which is worth a watch but I doubt you'll be resisting the urge to watch it again and again like Spider-man or X- Men since there's really nothing much that hasn't been done by earlier films.Granted, if you're a truly fervent Iron Man fan, it's a definite must-see but if you have no interest in comic book superheroes and the like, I suggest you give this one a rain check unless you have a passion for CGI action sequences and get a hard-on watching things blow up.Iron Man succeeds at being a satisfying film but seems hurried and leaky. Do look out for Stan Lee's cameo as a, without spoiling it, playboy. That's a cute scene by itself since Stan Lee cameos in all Marvel Comics films. Get a ticket, munch on popcorn and stretch yourself when it's done because it's just another film based on a comic book superhero, nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good film - loved the suit,"Directed by Jon Favreau (Vince Vaughn's wife) and screen played surprisingly well by its four writers, *Iron Man* takes its time focusing on the man inside the metal, rather than the mayhem the metal man musters. (Can I have a prize for that one?)In captivity, a fellow prisoner, Yinsen (Shaun Toub) creates an electromagnet to keep the shrapnel from entering Stark's heart, which Stark refines into a glowing ""reactor"" or something, forever to remain his albatross - and simultaneously a cool superhero chest-piece.Yinsen turns Stark from unrepentant war dog to humanitarian avenger by telling him of his ""life's work in the hands of these murderers."" Let's get the ""murderer"" definition straight: when Stark shows off his death-dealing toys in callous arrogance (""Respected or feared? I say, Why not both?""), he merely echoes the stance of the Amerikan Military War Machine, who also believe the ""best weapon is the one you only need to fire once."" Who are the murderers again? Secondly, a business genius like Stark should know how the supposed ""enemy"" market is the house of sand the Amerikan military economy is built upon. When it comes to killing for profit, Amerikan ethics are quite, quite plastic.The first taste of the crude, silver armor is magnificent. Though the '63 comic book version now looks like a clown suit next to his red-and-gold juggernauts, the movie gussies up the suit with mechanical ganglions to lend it cave-cred. And in this roughshod mechanical man, Stark escapes the Arabs like a runaway tank.Back in ""civilization"" Stark turns his focus from corporate warfare to one project - his new armor. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges scares us with his shaved head.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Nice Introduction To The Marvel Cinematic Universe.,"Note: I am going to start with a lengthy introduction about my relationship with superhero movies. It is necessary for me to do this to properly give my thoughts on Iron Man. Please bear with me, thanks.I am 21 years old, a life-long film buff, and I once actually took the time to find out that I have seen over 1,125 movies. With this kind of enthusiasm for film, it may shock you that I saw Iron Man for the first time just last night. In fact, it's the 2nd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that I have seen-the first being Spider Man: Homecoming.You see, Iron Man came out on May 2nd, 2008. I was 9 at the time. There were very few superhero movies that really engaged me then. I can think of Tim Burton's Batman and Spider Man with Tobey Maguire, and I think the line ends there. The genre never really appealed to me, and just a few years ago I started gradually gaining a love for superhero flicks.When Avengers: Endgame released, my youth group was going to see it but I stayed behind when I realized how far behind I was in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like I said, I had only seen Spider Man Homecoming.Back in December, just a few days before Christmas, I bought the first 2 movies- Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk. But even though I was gradually getting into superhero movies, I was struggling to get myself to sit down and watch Iron Man. I kept making excuses- I don't want to right now. I'll watch this movie instead. What if it falls into the weaker superhero movie category?I finally sat down last night and watched the movie. I laid on the couch, opened my mind....and turned on the subtitles. I notice with a lot of movies that the characters talk too softly and I need subtitles to get the dialouge, so I put that aside and focused on the movie.The plot follows Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.), a billonare weapon inventor who is kidnapped to build weapons for some terriosts. Instead, he builds a man made of metal and uses it to escape. He uses this invention afterwards for good, and then he needs it to fight Obadiah Stane(Jeff Brifdges), who doesn't like Stark's change of heart.The first positive thing I noticed about Iron Man was the cinematography. Iron Man is one of the most polished looking movies I've ever laid eyes on- it's bright, colorful, and even though it's 12 years old, it looks like it was made today.Iron Man contains some really nice and intense action, such as when Iron Man and Obadiah duke it out in the final act. Wherever Iron Man is in action, it's quite stunning to look at.There are also some comic relief moments that work well. The main example I can come up with is when Tony is testing his suit and it malfunctions in multiple amusing ways. Another was my favorite scene in the movie, where Pepper, Tony's assistant, helps him repair his heart's electromagnet. I won't explain that any further to avoid spoilers.When it comes to acting and other elements, Iron Man usually succeeds. However, there are a few flaws that make it a 9 and not a 10. I already mentioned that I found the dialouge to be quite soft, but I've seen 10s that have that problem, that's more a personal thing than an actual flaw.My biggest problem is a flaw I have with most superhero movies, even good ones. Here's the problem- the opening runs too long and the hero is more compelling than the man occupying it. The best superhero movies(Spider Man 2 and The Dark Knight particularly) tell a deep story that makes us care about the hero as much as the man. In Iron Man, while Tony Stark is a compelling character, the movie was more engaging when he was in his red and yellow suit, which, by the way, happens in the middle of the movie.Also, like I said, Tony is kidnapped by terriosts. This takes up roughly a half hour of the movie, and while it is essential to the plot, it could have been cut down maybe 10-15 minutes at least. It runs too long and it made me anxious for the plot to drag less. However, the more the plot unfolds, the better the pacing gets.Iron Man also has many minor pleasures throughout for Marvel fans. Early in the movie, we see a cameo of Stan Lee at a party for Tony, so see if you can spot him! Near the end, Terence Howard's character alludes near the end that he will join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though this was changed to Don Cheadle.And, like all the movies, after all of the credits roll, there is a post-credits scene that teases future movies. This one gives a cameo with Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. I must confess that I took out the DVD after the cast credits, forgetting to watch that part, but I re-inserted the DVD just to see that 45 second clip. If you watch a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, don't forget to stay after the credits!A personal pleasure for me were the Biblical allusions. While they don't advance the story or anything, I smirked when Tony donates some money to a man dressed as Caesar, and quotes Matthew 22:21, saying: ""Render therefore unto Caesar what is Caesar's!"" There are references like this that I admired. Also, I don't know if this was planned, but the villain shares a name with an Old Testament prophet.So while I don't think Iron Man is a perfect movie, I do have a deep admiration for it. In fact, if I made a top 10 list of the superhero movies I have seen, Iron Man would probably make that list. As an introduction to the biggest franchise in Hollywood history, it's a decent start. I look forward to seeing more MCU movies and catching up with all the hype. Iron Man is a bright look into the cinematic future.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Thank you :-),"This is coming from a guy who doesn't like comic book blockbuster movies (except anything Frank Miller does), but this one is done well and is my favorite comic book film underneath all of Miller's.There are gaping plot holes that really annoyed me- and that is the reason I gave this film a 7 and not a 9. But I won't get into it here. ""no spoilers this time around."" I like it when movies (comic book fantasy or not) can make me believe in their world. Ironman didn't even come close to doing that, but the acting was superb and the dialogue was great. The comedy was surprisingly sharp and fresh. Jeff Bridges and Downey Jr. are incredible as always, and the special effects are top notch. So for those reasons, I was pretty forgiving with this one. If the plot holes were any deeper, the dam would have broke and this rating of 7 would have been a 2 or 3, but it was so entertaining that it engaged me all the way through. That's tough to do with a weak plot line. Make no mistake: Ironman has a weak plot line. I can only imagine how cool it would have been with a super strong story and well polished script. A rare thing now days, especially with giant money pig movies like this one.So here's to the Iron Man franchise- thank you for not wasting my time, and actually making a decent movie out of a multi- hundred million dollar budget. Which is more than I can say for 90% of all films costing over 150 mil to make. It could have been a lot better, but I still was very entertained.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We Need More Superhero Films Like Iron Man,"After seeing the success of their other superheroes on the big screen, Marvel Comics brings one of their original Avengers to the screen with Iron Man. Being relatively unknown to the wider masses at the time, the film tells the origins of billionaire Tony Stark donning the Iron Man suits. While the superhero origin movie has felt overplayed in the last few years, Iron Man still holds up a higher quality and feels truly well thought out in a way that has been lacking lately. Reviving his career, Robert Downey Jr. Fully encapsulates the character of Tony Stark and creates a figure that easily became a household name from his mix of charisma and heart. With visual effects that are unbelievably realistic, every action scene acts as a compliment to the captivating story and delightful acting. This film was lightning in a bottle at the perfect time, allowing an entire universe to be born out of it, while having fans invest deeply into it.

Brilliantly Kicks of the MCU,"In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Iron Man is one of those films that gets better with age. Even though I loved it upon first viewing, I wasn't all that pumped about going back another time. There's been so many MCU films now that it's hard to imagine one without numerous Marvel superheroes in them, but that's what is so brilliant about Iron Man. It can easily stand on its own as a singular superhero adventure, but it also presents the universe as somewhere that could have dozens upon dozens of heroes.At this point, it's hard to think of anyone else in the Iron Man suit but Robert Downey Jr. But it may be equally as hard for Downey to find a role more suitable to his acting strengths than Tony Stark himself. With the recent announcement that Downey will indeed be in the next Spider-Man installment, I can't hope but help he plays this character forever, in every Marvel film. A mixture of humor, wit, sophistication, and absolute charisma, Tony Stark may be the most engaging character in the MCU.With all that said, we only get to the rest of the MCU films if the first Iron Man works, which it does. I love the way Jon Favreau sets the tone for the MCU as undeniably dramatic but with a good amount of comedic undertones so that it appeals to all ages and demographics. When the plot of the film involves a billionaire who develops tech and weapons that end up killing many innocent people, you need some comedic relief to give the film smooth pacing.Favreau also manages to develop a romantic superhero relationship that is something you truly care about without overselling it, an admittedly difficult task. Pepper and Tony aren't your typical superhero damsel in distress type of relationship, but they also don't try and turn it into something it isn't. It's teased just enough in this movie to keep those invested something to hope for in later installments.Of course, Iron Man is one of the best superhero films of all time, but it's also just a really well made film. Sure, the villain, in the form of Obadiah Stane is nothing special, but Marvel has never had the easiest of times creating great on screen villains. But as a whole, Iron Man is phenomenal work of cinema that only gets better with age. It serves as a reminder that you can make a serious superhero film and an enjoyable experience at the same time.+Downey Jr is Iron Man+Romantic relationship that you care about+Perfect tone setting up the MCU9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Explosive and well informed film that's shows the action as raw and gritty. And that's suits this flawed action hero just fine!,"""Iron Man"" is clearly not as well known to the masses like ""Superman"" or ""Batman"" yet still this is a superhero that's interesting and his character flaws make him likable as Tony Stark/Iron Man comes with no boyishness or glower he's just all action packed business! Robert Downey Jr. with his troubled past and rocky personal life was well suited to play a flawed and hard living character like Tony Stark. Stark is a hard partying, womanizing, high tech celebrity weapons magnate who's loaded with money and lives the luxury of fame. Yet when he's wounded upon a trip to Afghanistan a raw and gritty transformation takes places as Stark becomes a hulking machine type rocket man! The film then shifts off to the great special effects we have became so used to in action movies, yet the theme of the character transformation so dominates the film from the development of his body chest suit, to the making of his clicking limbs and flamethrower arms all rounded out perfect when he's topped off by a medieval knight mask to become ""Iron Man""! Stark/Iron Man fooled his captures by constructing a cluster bomb they demanded only he built a mechanical alter ego to fly to freedom! And his goal is to destroy all weapons that he once created, as he now wants to fight for peace.The film is really a great characterization of a flawed man being transformed into a superhero even though the action and special effects are good. Supporting performances are well worth mention from Jeff Bridges as Stark's former friend but now evil corporate partner with his shaved head and beard intimidating. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts who's Tony selfless assistant and Paltrow gives a cute spark like twinkle to the role as the chemistry and sexual tension between her and Downey is well shown. Overall this isn't the greatest attempt at a superhero film clearly falling short from the feel and excitement and thrill of ""Batman"" or let me say even ""Superman"", yet still with Downey's performance and the action plus with the way it tells of the transformation of a flawed soul into a superhero most film watchers and comic fans are compensated in a grand way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Totally defies expectations: Great Characterization, bad action","You'd assume in a movie of this sort that it would be the action or the spectacle that makes the film and the characterization that feels tacked on. But oddly enough, it is quite the reverse. Robert Downey Jr.'s Stark explodes off the screen as a likable, well-rounded scoundrel who isn't merely a slime ball with an eventual (quite literal)change of heart: he is a sympathetic idealist throughout, even when he's at his hard-drinking, womanizing worst. Downey is extremely comfortable both with the drama and the comedy and I found myself believing in his character more than I've believed in any comic hero outside of Christian Bale's more stoic Bruce Wayne. Surprisingly good work comes out of Gwyneth Paltrow, who's Pepper Potts is the perfect combination of empowered and vulnerable. Terrence Howard is likable as the straight and narrow boy scout best friend and Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the sleaziest character in recent film history. Some say he's less believable as Tony's friend, but I found him just as enjoyable as a good guy as he ultimately became as an out and out villain. Outside of these performances, there is an effort to make a fully realized comic book world around Tony which succeeds quite admirably. The many references to Iron Man lore never feel tacked on or excessive. Now for the main gripe: the action sequences. Not only are they too few and far between, but those that we get seem extremely forced. They are all over before they can truly get the pulse pounding and there's a sense that what little appears is merely to keep the kids from stampeding out. Action scenes are in fact an art form and a necessary part of a film like this, so the lack of satisfying escapism can simply not be overlooked. Here's hoping Favreau develops a Spielbergian or Jacksonian action acumen by the time he brings out the big guns with the Mandarin and War Machine in the second film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am Iron Man,"When it first came out in 2008, I don't think anybody expected it to be as big a hit as it was.It's a great backstory and introduction to the characters surrounding Tony Stark. The plot is fairly simple - but to contain the origin story the movie can't do much more without becoming bloated (see most other Marvel movies). So the Obediah Stane ""Iron Monger"" (really, we aren't going to say anything about that villain name?) plays out as a way for Stark to physically reject the way Stark industries has gone and turn it to a new direction.His change in world view and progression from selfish weapons mogul to tech-hero is fairly smooth.Iron Man is a great character. His is a reflection of the role of industry in conflicts - issues of autonomy, government supervision, and loyalties play at the heart of the character. When his heart is damaged, he changes his loyalties and uses his genius and entrepreneurial power for the betterment of others instead of himself or his company. And this movie does a decent job of showing that.Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Tony Stark and is possibly the best casting in the MCU.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's a mediocre flick at best and extremely overrated,"I went to go see this, because of the many recommendations it was getting from film critics and superhero movie fans. Now I'm no superhero movie fan, but I do love some of them (""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Ghost Rider"" are my favorites). So, I went to go see the film with my dad, uncle, and brother. What did I think of it? Well, I thought it was mediocre and overrated. Why? Because: 1) There was too much backstory! I mean, 3/4 of the film is backstory about how the guy became Iron Man and the other 1/4 of it consists of fighting bad guys. We need some more fighting in here. If the film was half-backstory;half-fighting then perhaps I would have enjoyed it more.2) Another problem with the backstory: Borrrrrrring!!!! I mean, Jesus Christ! I almost fell asleep! I am astonished that you IM fans find a guy in a cave building a suit, ENTERTAINING. Damn. Someone needs to go see a doctor.3) No romance. WTF? I mean, no superhero movie is complete without romance. The only romance I saw in this movie was that brief sex scene and that was it.So, there ya go. Because of these problems, I cannot recommend ""Iron Man"".",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved it,"I loved this movie I had high hopes for this movie and I must say that they went way past what I thought was possible. This movie was awesome. This was the best movie that I have seen in a long time. Robert Downey Jr does a great job at playing Tony Stark. I loved the action, It was funny at all the right times, and the graphics where just awesome (love CGI), the movie moves smoothly there are no boring parts that you are waiting for something to happen. I won't get into any more detail because I don't Want to spoil it for anyone but I must say this is a must watch. I can't wait to see it again.

Iron Man Review,"I was unsure of how much I would like this film, but I must say it was awesome. Excellent special effects, humor, plot, and action throughout. A instant classic and a must see! Well done Marvel! I can't wait for a sequel!!! This film has to be one of your finest ever.Robert Downey Jr is back and better than I ever knew he could be. He plays the cocky and cool billionaire Tony Stark very well and gives the character a witty and likable personality.Although I have enjoyed other superhero films such as Daredevil, the Spiderman Trilogy, Batman Begins, and the Blade Trilogy, I had never had much of an interest in the Iron Man character before this. After seeing this film, I have become a lifelong fan! Marvel-us!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid,"Iron Man is arguably the biggest blockbuster movie this summer (aside from the highly anticipated Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). With a marketing campaign of $50 million dollars, Paramount was banking on this movie pleasing the core fan base and the general audience. What happens when you risk it all? Generally, you're going to play it safe.This is exactly what Iron Man does. Now, Iron Man is by no means a bad film. It's actually rather good. But come on Marvel, we have seen it all before. This is the mandatory 'origins' story (which means this is turning into a film franchise of course) which builds up protagonist Tony Stark from multi-billion dollar CEO, socialite, and Albert Einstein-like genius to the vigilante that must uncreate everything that he has created.RDJ (Robert Downey Jr. for you ignorant fools) plays the part very well, though if you've followed his career for quite sometime, it's nothing that exercises his acting ability. Gwenyth Paltrow does well for Stark's PA and love interest, though unfortunately her character doesn't accumulate into anything substantial. Jeff Bridges played well as the antagonist, and though it was a great concept, it was handled poorly by the filmmakers. The best thing about Terrance Howard's character was when he looked at the spare suit Stark built and said ""Maybe next time"", hinting at the possibility of War Machine in the sequel.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is that it does not try to break out of conventions; it does not have an edge to stand out as a defining film, let alone a defining Marvel adaptation. It does not help that Favreau and his team kept the look rather generic. When we see Spider- man, we can see Sam Raimi's touch. Nolan can be seen throughout Batman Begins. This film could have been directed by Tim Story (director of Fantastic Four ""fame"") and you would not even be able to tell the difference.What I did like in the film was all the references to other Marvel properties, which are all conveniently coming together (the Avengers movie is coming soon). S.H.I.E.L.D and War Machine are the two I remember the clearly, and releasing the movie about one of Marvel's lesser known characters before his alleged cameo in The Incredible Hulkmovie will be a treat to all movie-goers alike.I guess what it comes down to is the gut feeling I have inside. When I came out of Spider- man 2 & 3, I wanted to be Spider-man. With Batman 1 & 2 and Batman Begins, I wanted to be Batman. With X-Men, I wanted to be Wolverine, only because Cyclops was treated as a pansy. With Iron Man... Iron Man is just damn bloody cool. He almost makes me want to be him, but it's just not quite. Maybe his character is too overwhelming for me to want to be in his shoes (pun not intended), but rather fight along side him like all the other Marvel heroes that have had that honour.Final Rating: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Remarkable Film. Oscar Level Performances and FX.,"First off, I have to mention that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play the part of Tony Stark. He portrays the perfect combination of suave and selfishness, energy and ungoverned gluttony, troubled spirit and a soul seeking redemption. It's clear that Downey has brought everything to the part.Sure, this is science fiction but the believability and realism are off the charts. Tony Stark isn't a mutant or a ninja or nothing silly has happened to him. Stark isn't a cheesy, tights wearing superhero. It's great that he can't jump into a phone booth and be on his cheesy way. He's a flawed man but he's anything but ordinary. From origin through design to testing and then gaining expert usage, every step of the way is believable and incredibly interesting. All of the amazing effects are grounded in realism. I know they built the armor in real life and that worked remarkably well. It wasn't all a CG mishmash. You could tell that they sent up real fighter planes and filmed them. They looked like the aerial cinematography for Top Gun or a well choreographed air show and all of it plays out in a stunning fashion. There was a realism to the bumpiness of the camera and the results of actually shooting at those tremendous heights shined through. Using practical effects and a practical suit of armor paid off big-time. Even if, for some strange reason, you watch the film trying to nitpick, I seriously doubt anyone will be able to tell the difference between a CG shot and a practical shot. The suit of armor develops a personality of its own. It grows from a crude infant in to something awesome. It adjusts flaps during flight (again making it appear to be more then a feasible concept); it communicates and allows us to see Tony's POV. There are so many great details that I truly believe this movie is made for repeat viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I've seen better,"While the first 30 minutes are very well told, in my opinion the storytelling has some weak points from there. Okay we are dealing with the realization of a comic hero here, so let's not overrate that.So the plot is kind of typical for a superhero movie, I'd say the closest related hero is Batman, because he also does not have any talents by himself but is relying on technical gimmicks. Just as Iron Man does. I really liked the acting, but there were a couple of scenes that I thought were a little stupid. Oh, and the product placement of Audi was a little to obvious for me.I rented this movie because the sequel is opening today in German theaters, but I will save my money and wait for the DVD, I was not into this enough to go and see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best Marvel movie yet.,"When i heard people calling this movie the ""best comicbook movie ever"" and ""Masterpiece"" i should have known that was fanboy hype.So when i went to the movie theater i was expecting to be blown away.The movie can be best described as solid but nothing that special.Robert Downey Jnr basically holds this movie together,without him it could have been a disaster.But the movie was quite enjoyable and given what Marvel have given us the past few years this was one of their better offerings,kudos Mr Favreau.Overall this movie was a 7/10 and i still feel that Batman Begins is the benchmark for style,depth and tone of comicbook movies,sadly this does not surpass it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A blast-one of the best comic book movies!,"Iron Man provides about as much fun as one could ask. While it lacks the emotional punch of films such as Superman: The Movie or Batman Begins, the film has many virtues going for it and could be enjoyed any number of times.The movie has some of the most visually inventive special effects I have ever seen. Watching all of Tony's inventions come to life consistently put a smile on my face. Plus the humor in the film is considerable. Jon Favreau knows how to brighten a viewer's day, and the film never ceases to be a joyous crowd pleaser.The cast adds to Iron Man tremendously. I'm not usually a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she knew how to add spice to the role of the loyal love interest and she shared great chemistry with the hero. Terrence Howard makes a strong right hand man; all of Tony's goofy indulgences were made that much more entertaining by the contrast with his responsible, endearingly square best friend. Plus the caring bond between the two of them gave the film more heart. Jeff Bridges isn't given the kind of memorable villain role the likes of Willem Dafoe and Terence Stamp have gotten in the past. The movie is sometimes too light for its own good and the good vs. evil battle is not that compelling. However, Bridges is one of the best actors in history and he still manages to create a character we love to hate. Of course the most entertaining supporting character may have been the robot...However the unquestionable star of this show is Robert Downey Jr., who elevated the film to another level entirely using his magnificent charisma. I found myself wanting to applaud Tony Stark even when he was at his most hedonistic, because he was just that charming. And when he chose to be a superhero, you'd be hard pressed to find someone you'd want to root for more. Downey of course proved himself to be too human in the past, but after years of his being clean his talent has finally taken over and brought him the role of a lifetime.Here's hoping Iron Man lives on forever and its gifted star is only beginning his reign as a major Hollywood force!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Don't miss it!,OK so Iron Man is probably way behind Spiderman on popularity stakes right? I myself have always been a Spidey fan through and through but I've got to say that this film squashes Spidey like the bug he is! It has a great feel right from the off and with the more frequent use of the UK's 12A certificate I think our superhero movies are gaining a slightly harder edge that is becoming them. Don't leave your seat until the final credits have rolled either because there is a spectacularly important scene for comic book fans right at the end of the film. Whether you are an Iron Man fan or not I couldn't recommend this film more! If the new Batman and Hulk films are nearly as good as Iron Man then it's going to be a great year for comic books!

"Acting, writing and armour makes Iron Man fly at the top of the genre","This is the first actual movie made by Marvel comics's own studio instead of having their characters ""leased"" to another movie studio. They hit this one out of the park. The script is smart but what made Iron Man such a critical and financial success beyond the special effects is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. I just cannot imagine someone who could be more suave, funny and perfect as a genius playboy millionaire tech geek (yes, he beats whatsisname as Bruce Wayne handily). It's like having an Oscar-calibre actor in a popcorn superhero movie. We actually have three with Gwynneth Paltrow and the underrated Jeff Bridges. Tony Stark seems excited about creating and trying his Iron Man armour and it transmits to the audience. I remember thinking when I first saw Iron Man that despite Stark's genius, he could also be a jerk and irresponsible hothead but it's to Robert Downey's Jr and the writer's credits that you like Stark anyway.There's a genuine sense of fun permeating the whole film yet it's not without its serious dramatic moments. Everything would crumble if the superhero armour wasn't up to snuff but the different versions look amazing and believable, with lots of little incidental animation making it more dynamic. Sometimes you might think it's computer generated (and honestly it probably is most of the time) but it's easy to suspend your disbelief especially with the constant but cool close-up shots of Tony Stark inside the helmet with those constantly updating computer readings. That clever trick permits us to see the emotions that are not outwardly visible from the outside. Iron Man doesn't reinvent the superhero movie genre like Watchmen does but it does everything right while adding a few bits of originality such as the initially egotistical selfish almost villainous protagonist who changes as well as the guy becoming super-powered not through accident or mutation but by designing the coolest armours ever seen on screen. Let's not forget that clever never seen before ending who put a big smile on my face and probably most people who watched it in theatres the first time.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fantastic Addition To The Superhero Genre,"Iron Man is not your typical superhero movie. Forget the screaming fans, the nerdy boy who becomes the hero, the mad scientists and the radiation experiment gone wrong. This is perhaps the perfect superhero movie. From the mind of Stan Lee comes Iron Man played brilliantly by Robert Downey J, a film with comedy, jaw-dropping effects, great villains, unique action sequences and a plot that would make Spiderman's missions look quite lame. Robert Downey Jr. Is perfect in the role as the owner of a company which builds weapons. Frankly I could not have thought of a better person in the role as Tony Stark. If you enjoy movies like Spider-Man, Transformers and X-Men then this movie is for you. The Incredible Hulk and the Dark Knight have some very stiff competition at the box office.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
No rust on this sucker,"I have to admit that Iron Man wasn't on my preferred reading list as a kid when comics made up a large part of my reading material. Superman, Batman, and the more obscure Tomahawk were my staples. So taking in John Favreau's rendition of Marvel's Iron Man allowed me the luxury of not bringing excess baggage to the screening. The result? Iron Man is a treat for the senses.Telling the story of billionaire military industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who during capture by Taliban-esquire guerrillas, develops both his tin man design and a clarity of vision causing him to see the evil of his company's ways, Iron Man unfolds with a style and flow that most movies can only envy.During filming Favreau allowed his principals free reign to improvise their own dialog. The result, along with some smart plot scripting by a quad of writers, is a film that has a natural, unscripted feel that lends it a natural, somewhat realistic feel.Rounded out by an impressive cast that includes Terrence Howard as Stark's military confidant Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as his long-suffering love interest, and Jeff Bridges (The Dude) as the movie's villain, Iron Man plays out very much in line with creator Stan Lee's original vision of Tony Stark patterned after genius billionaire playboy Howard Hughes. His vices of alcohol and women are there, but in muted form.Designed as the first installment of a trilogy, with all actors signed for the duration, the continuation is expected to further delve into Stark's alcoholism as well as the advent of Rhodes' morphing into War Machine, which is hinted at late in the film.Originally optioned by Universal with horror icon Stuart Gordon (Edmond) to direct, Iron Man bounced around studios and production houses ranging from 20th Century Fox through Paramount, with, at varying points, everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Joss Whedon, Smallville's Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, to Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise having being penciled in for the production, the final culmination under Favreau and Downey is a movie that will enthrall viewers from the first frame to the last.

Whats With The Hype?!?!,"Everyone LOVES this movie.I just like it. I don't really see what all the hype is about and why everyone thinks its so much better than all the other big summer blockbuster hits that shamelessly parades PG-13 violence and charming entertainment but lacks clear narrative, dialogue, or character development. Out of all these comic book adaptations, Spider-man has been the only one that has touched a human nerve and it was still rather corny. This movie is absolutely unbelievable (not just unbelievable in the ""comic book"" sense), but rather because the plot is completely undeveloped! Robert Downey Jr. makes his big comeback as charming bad boy Tony Stark but fails to save the entire movie with only his blindingly white smile. Paltrow is horrible and needs to go back to acting school (which is sad because I rather liked her in Shakespeare in Love which proves that she does have the chops but is just dusty from being out of the game for so long). Stark's ""helper"" machines provide some comic relief in a scene that is memorable only in its absurdity and the bad guy is so cliché he reminds me of the kingpin from the summer flop: ""Daredevil"".Overall, its good entertainment but it doesn't deserve a high rating. It is mindless fun, it doesn't make you think but may make you laugh, it doesn't call for intense emotional investment but it makes you feel good and happy at the end. All in all, its rather conventional fare and so it deserves a rather average rating.On the other hand, I rather enjoyed The Incredible Hulk with E. Norton. So if you have to pick between the two then pick Norton, who brings vulnerability to his role and who actually has chemistry with his leading lady (Liv Tyler).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great Acting and Sharp Directing make this a Must-See...,"All to often, superheros turn into geeky, rather dull characters when they get out from behind their various costumes. 'Iron Man', on the other hand, in a stroke of brilliance, makes it possible to love the man behind the metal mask even more than the hero itself. For the first time, we're not dealing with a dual personality here- Iron Man and Tony Stark (his true identity) are one fully realized character.Mr. Stark is the rich young owner of a huge weapons dealing company. While displaying his newest creation for the army, he is captured by terrorists who order him to build them a bomb of their own. It is in this place that he has a revelation and escapes with one purpose in mind: He must retrieve the weapons that he himself distributed.Robert Downey Jr. is spot-on perfect in the lead role. He somehow blends sarcasm and real caring into nearly every line. The result is someone we can laugh with, yet also genuinely care for. As Pepper Potts, Tony's longtime secretary/caretaker/love interest, Gwyneth Paltrow delivers the goods once again, playing both hard-to-get intelligent and still very girly. The relationship between the two leads plays wonderfully, never going into schmaltz or typical lovey-dovey-ness. Instead, their interest in each other is not hardly addressed up front, yet through great performances is made clear. Jeff Bridges adds his own flavor as Tony's business partner.Director Jon Favreau keeps the pace quick and the editing sharp, bringing the excitement to near boiling point at times. Yet he also shows an intelligent and graceful hand with the more plot-centered scenes, in particular the ones between Tony and Pepper. All in all, a fun and exciting way to start off the summer.

It's about time they made an Iron Man movie,"(Synopsis) Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the CEO of Stark Industries which produces advance weapon systems for the U.S. military. Tony's father started the company after WWII, and after his death Tony inherited the company, worth billions. Tony lives the life as a hard drinking, rich playboy ladies man, but he is also a genius who has invented many high-tech items for the company. Tony flies to Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test to the army. On his way back to his plane, his convoy is attacked by terrorists, and Tony is wounded by a Stark Industries missile. Tony is captured and held hostage in a cave with Raza (Faran Tahir), a doctor who saves his life. The terrorists force Tony and Raza to reproduce the new destructive Jericho missile Tony was demonstrating from parts of other weapons. Instead, Tony decides to build a suit of armor with Raza's help. The suit gives Tony the strength and protection to be able to escape the terrorists. Back in America, Tony builds a better suit of armor which gives him superhuman strength with the ability to fly. With the help of his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Tony vows to protect the world as Iron Man.(My Comment) After 40 years, this is the first movie based on Marvel's comic book superhero, Iron Man. The special effects in this move were fantastic, and I wanted more. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific as Tony Stark, as he shows his charm and wit in every situation he encounters. Robert has some of the same traits as Tony, making him a perfect fit for the character. Robert is able to make you believe that he actually changes from an egocentric person into a humanitarian. Jeff Bridges does a convincing job in his part as the power-hungry villain. Gwyneth Paltrow is just charming as Pepper. The movie has action, comedy, and even some drama. The storyline was a little slow for the first hour, but that was because it is showing the birth of a new superhero. Once Iron Man goes into action, it is all good from there on. This movie has sequel written all over it. The next movie can begin with Iron Man saving the world. (Paramount Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG-13)(7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of Marvel's Best to Date,"Iron man is a great start to this years movie season. It is just a sweet action packed adventure. The great colleague of trailers leading up to the movie was worth the eight bucks for a ticket as well. This is one of the best comic book films to date. I would go as far as saying this is Marvel's best film alongside X-men 2.Robert Downey Jr. portrays the playboy and illustrious Tony Stark perfectly. His mannerisms and attitude are everything I could hope from the character. His casual and laid-back attitude mixed with a serious and devoted approach to his work is an excellent portrayal of the Stark character. Downey is phenomenal in what I would call his best performance and most memorable to date. His character may have a bit too much cockiness for my pleasing though. The rest of the cast including Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges as the villain Obadiah Stone all deliver good performances Jeff Bridges character can seem relatively dull at times but his character definitely improves as the movie goes on. Noteworthy is Downey, Phenomenal acting on his part and he makes it appear as if he was born to play Tony Stark.The conceptual designs of Iron man are outstanding. I love seeing the evolution of the armor going from an original grey giant to a perfectly designed red-blue suit. The effects are terrific and watching the evolution of the costume and Stark's designing of it is a great addition to the film. The Iron Monger is a great robotic villain for Iron man. I was just expecting him to use Tony's original costume but to see a new design made it much better. The special effects are terrific.The story is outstanding. A couple of new concepts are added to the story and help make it interesting. It is easy to follow and easy to dive into. I am so glad that the biggest concept of the Stark character was handled so well in this film. The idea that Stark feels at fault for all the harm he has created with his weapons. This ultimately leads him to designing the suit and become a protector. And even better, we see the struggles and challenges he must overcome. The stress and hardships he feels after his incident overseas.This is it! Indiana Jones, The Hulk, Hellboy, Wanted, and EVEN The Dark Knight have a lot to live up to. This is going to be one of the best films of the summer. I am not just saying that from the perspective of a fan boy, but also as a movie goer. This is one of the best comic adaptations to date that has helped modernize a character and help relate him to a modern day world. Fantastic film. Bravo Jon Favreau.P.S. Watch the movie all the way through. Don't leave until after the credits. You do not want to miss the scene afterwards. I literally jumped over the seats and down into the aisle way once I saw it.

Comic Book Popcorn Tripe,"Okay. I confess I am not a fan of comic book movies. Comic books were great but they were just that - comic books. But I guess fans of the genre want to see them brought to life on the big screen. And with today's technology too many of the movie today are just that. Comic books brought to life.Maybe it is because I am older and grew up in an age when there was something to really lose yourself in on the big screen. There is very little subtlety to these films as they are often just a lot of noise signifying nothing. There is no social commentary like we saw with many of the films of the late 60's and early 70's and there is even in my opinion little of the unknown of blockbusters of the early days like Star Wars and Jaws.Okay they are reasonably well done. I am a fan of Robert Downey Jr. and have enjoyed before in films Gweneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. But Gweneth is largely eye candy and pleasant while Terrance seems to wasted in a vacuous role. I can only hope that he doesn't end up like Cuba Gooding Jr. who started out good and these days seems to wind up in films that are trite comedy films that are usually not even funny. Jeff Bridges was appropriately over the top and evil. I barely recognized him behind the beard and the shaved head.In a $200 million film I would fully expect some great special effects and there it didn't disappoint. I say this even though for example the final battle (now wasn't that predictable) between Iron Man and Iron Monger was pretty good. But that is just the problem - the entire film was almost completely predictable. No subtlety's, no nuance nothing to keep me guessing. Just vacuous entertainment. But then as a producer friend of mine said ""just entertain them"".Oh is that to say ones like last year's No Country for Old Men or There will be Blood were not entertaining? Of course they were. But then maybe the fans of Iron Man might not enjoy them. And Jaws was thoroughly entertaining but it also kept you guessing.But what really put me off is the unabashed America raw raw that pervaded the movie. I might as well have been watching a Rambo or Chuck Norris flick. Or even an old John Wayne movie. Okay John Wayne made far better pictures then either Rambo or Chuck Norris could even dream of.The Afghan war lords were just a cartoon joke. Why did they have to be Afghans? Are all war lords in Afghanistan animals like these people were? Well they may not be exactly good guys but these guys were a bad joke. On the other side the Americans while not perfect they were portrayed as the good guys fighting the evil war lords. What was presented was that this was supposed to be the reality of Afghanistan today.What crap. As bad as the war lords are the big problem with the war lords is that they are actually in the Karzai government and hold important positions as Governor's of provinces and cabinet minister's in the Karzai government.These war lords were not Taliban fighters as they don't dress like that and are completely different then the ones portrayed.Indeed the war lords are the US allies. And the terrorists are often the Americans themselves bombing villages from the air killing primarily civilians. Oh don't get me wrong not all the Americans are evil in Afghanistan but then they are not earnest nice guys as portrayed by Terrence Howard either.Okay maybe you are going to tell ""hey its just a comic book. Lighten up"". But that is not the point. Thousands of people watch this stuff and come out believing that evil war lords of Afghanistan are what the Americans (and Canadians - yes I am Canadian) are fighting over there. There are not. What they saw was pure utter unadulterated propaganda spouted by Hollywood whore masters.And for that the film is a complete failure for me even though I was kind and gave it a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Absolute treat to the comic book fans,Iron man is a marvelous entertainer. It offers an outstanding movie experience to people who are not familiar with the comic character and at the same time stays true to the regular fans. This was one comic book movie that was hyped up with a lot of expectations and Iam happy to announce that it lived up to every inch of it.Robert Downey Jr was last person I expected to play Tony Stark. However he delivered an excellent performance and anchored the role to perfection. The CGI was splendid and brought our favorite tin man to life.

"IRON MAN (Jon Favreau, 2008) ***","As I was growing up, one of my main sources of entertainment (not to mention education) was Italian TV which is where I caught several of the now-classic animated TV series based on Marvel comics superheroes like Captain America, Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman, Submariner, Thor, X-Men, etc. It goes without saying that, with time, these were turned into movies and, in some cases, highly successful franchises. This year was Iron Man's turn to hit the big screen and, happily, it turned out to be one of the best such adaptations.The primary reason for the superior end result is one: Robert Downey Jr. is an inspired choice for leading man and he meets the blockbusting challenge head-on with a terrific, nuanced central performance that makes Tony Stark a believably three-dimensional character. It is reported that Downey was a fan of the original comic books themselves and that his contribution to the film was a far more creative one than is usual for actors and it shows. His extensive commitment may also have been triggered by the fact that, for all intents and purposes, the life story of Tony Stark uncannily parallels that of Downey himself: a talented person living in the shadow of his famous father who wastes his time away in hedonistic abandon until a traumatic experience set his priorities right and well onto his way to full rehabilitation.A hero is only as good as his nemesis and, in this case, Jeff Bridges' duplicitous business partner comes up trumps. Perhaps wisely, his bald-headed, goateed villain is not the overacted, larger-than-life type but a sleek, ruthless profiteer whose line of work happens to be the proliferation of warfare around the world. Equally important for superheroes are their girlfriends and here Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is the sweet, sensitive secretary rather than the usual on/off damsel-in-distress. Also on hand is the sidekick in the shape of Terence Howard's army official and the eccentric lab assistant who – as a sign of the times – is an Afghan family man who has been taken prisoner by an ambitious war lord! Leslie Bibb's blonde bimbo reporter is worth mentioning as well not only for her looks but even for the way in which her character unconsciously spurs Stark onwards to first adopt a conscience and, atypically for a superhero, reveal Iron Man's true identity at the very end.For a modern Hollywood blockbuster which has its eyes firmly on becoming a lucrative franchise, IRON MAN is a literate movie with only a handful of action set-pieces which, needless to say, deliver the goods when they do come. In fact, the film's middle section is taken up by Stark's various experiments with perfecting his equipment, refining the look of Iron Man and, amusingly, his love/hate relationship with his clumsy robotic assistant. If there is one major flaw in the film, it's the climactic assumption that businessman Jeff Bridges is as much technologically-minded as his junior partner in creating and working iron giants – especially when just moments earlier his employees seemed at a loss at coming up with anything resembling the capacities of Iron Man let alone tower over them as his Iron Monger eventually does. Anyway, it's small fry, I guess, when their climactic rooftop confrontation was, as they say, destined to happen from the outset.A frustrating modern trend in movies is that of continuing it after the credits have already started rolling and, apparently, IRON MAN is guilty of this fallacy as well – although, personally, I wouldn't know as I walked out of the theater right after the cast list was over! Anyhow, the film-makers have to be complemented for not taking the obvious route by making excessive use of Black Sabbath's classic titular song except for maximum effect i.e. Downey's (and the film's) closing lines being, ""I am Iron Man"" and an instrumental passage as soon as the end credits kick in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The racist marvel action hero.,"In the first 20 minutes of the film, I was already beginning to wonder why I had purchased tickets. The main character was a terrible human being. A Womanizing, spoilt playboy who manufactures weapons of mass destruction. What a hero? There are no real likable characters in the entire film. The storyline is dragged out and uneventful. The action barely worth the film roll it's printed on. There is a naively racist vibe running throughout. With the 'hero' only realizing making weapons may be a bad idea, once he witnesses Americians dying by his creations. As if the countless innocents of less fortunate countries being murdered beforehand weren't worth his thought.It was like watching old cartoons that are so racist, they don't even know it. The film was mildly entertaining, however the characters all being terrible people took away from the fun of Iron Man. There weren't enough scenes of Iron Man doing great deeds, to classify him as a hero. His actions seemed selfishly motivated, and egotistical.The only stand out in the film was the suit.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An untypical hero,"Untypical. I like this word. Is it in English language? Not sure. Could be that I invented it. Anyway, it is a nice word. Something untypical has to be special, different, unusual...my kind of thing. Here is one, Iron Man.This world is never in shortage of superheros. Spider, bat, someone in his underwear, a giant green guy... but iron man is unlike them. He is more real and human-like, to me. An M.I.T graduate, a high-tech weapon developer and a notorious playboy, Tony Stark had everything. However, after seeing his weapons used by terrorists to kill innocent people, Stark changed his mind. He realized that he was not making peace so he wanted to close the company, which frightened his collaborator whose benefits were much threatened. So, a fight between them was unavoidable. So far, we have the hero and the enemy, but where is the beauty? Gwyneth Paltrow comes as a vase, again, playing Stark's very important assistant, a job that I envy much. Now, we can just sit back and enjoy the chasing, exploding, flying and...no sex, not even kissing!The scenario has no sparks, but the way it's told is consistent and reasonable(the least requirement we ask for superhero blockbuster). With the help of exciting rock music and brilliant action scenes, Iron Man presents us a special experience of watching superhero saving world. What's more, the amazingly charming Robert Downey Jr. has made us believe that he is Tony Spark. Downey's history is colorful as a movie itself, but he's a wonderful actor with strong personalities, no doubt. I've listed him onto my favorite actors. He's made Iron Man a film that actually has some acting in it.I don't really fancy heroes that much because they are so perfect. Thought Hollywood has realized this and tried to add defect to its heroes, they still look unattractive. But Iron Man, or Tony Spark, has got his charm because he is not always so heroic. Actually, he is kind of bad, but we like him!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Who'd of thought that Ironman could be so nimble?,"First off, this is Robert Downey Jr.s show & he soars in the role. It is arguably the best performance by an actor in a ""comic book"" movie next to Bale's in Batman Begins & it is 180 degrees different in tone.Gywneth Paltrow has never looked more beautiful on-screen & what could have been a thankless role crackles with life due to her skill as well as the writers & director.Hello Jon Favreau! Thank you for your touch. You obviously have great talent in front the cam (Jeff Bridges & Terrence Howard and the rest) & behind it. That said, it still takes someone to let the talent shine without it getting out of control. It looks, feels & sounds great.

In short: One of the best superhero films ever,"A movie that starts off with a bang ends as such, with none of the usual superhero trappings to get in the way of the action. You won't find in this film a conflicted main character, tortured by their duality and hidden selves. You will find a main character that jumps off the screen with attitude and strength of character to amaze in and out of superhero suit. Robert Downey Jr does well to include the pompous attitude of the world's most powerful billionaire industrialist with the subtle humorous breaks that do not lend to camp or sappy under-emotions usually noted with today's sensitive superhero.Does Ironman (the character) boldly go where none other has gone before? In the end, yes he does, and the film is much better for it.To tastefully prevent a recanting of the entire film, my only info to provide at this time is that this is one film that deserves the extra $$ to be seen on the big screen. Think Transformers minus the kiddy-entrapments and commercial influence.Nine to avoid the over-utilized 10-rating it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent comic book adaptation- others could learn from it,"'Iron Man' has to be up there as one of the best comic book film adaptations and is certainly one of the most enjoyable films of the year so far. The film, based upon the Marvel comic, centres on billionaire Tony Stark, who has continued with his father's successful weaponry business. However, when a trip to Afghanistan to sell missiles to the US military ends with Stark being held as a prisoner of war, he begins to see the darker side to his work and resolves to change his ways by using his technology and intelligence to do good. And the first step to doing so is for Stark to become Iron Man...Robert Downey Junior is not exactly a big named actor but he easily steps into the role of Tony Stark, the spoilt playboy, and Iron Man, the hero Stark strives to be. Perhaps his own personal issues helped mould Downey to play a role of a man who realises he has to grow up and accept the consequences of his actions but, whatever the case, he definitely brought strength to the character, walking the careful line between delivering jokes and sustaining the serious nature to the film. He was well-supported by a wonderfully evil Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard as the loyal best friend who perhaps will play a larger role in any future sequel and Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant who keeps him grounded. Shaun Toub also made his presence felt as the short-time mentor who sets Stark onto his path of heroism.When it comes to the visual effects, 'Iron Man' had it nailed. The action scenes were breath-taking without compromising on the script (since there is nothing worse than a film with excellent CGI and rubbish storyline). As it should be, the plot was what made this film so successful. Unlike other adaptations, specifically 'X-Men', this film never pandered to kids and maintained a more mature storyline and development of the characters. Stark wasn't turned into a twelve-year-old, there were no wee moppets popping up to appeal to children nor was the villain of the piece some two-bit, two-dimensional terrorist.This is an excellent film that should appeal to those who love action flicks as well as comic books/sci-fi. Here's looking to a sequel being released some point in the near future because it is certainly a franchise Marvel should expand upon.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"An overrated movie that is somewhat of a mess, and fails to entertain.","Iron Man is a movie that had some good ideas, but failed to realize them. Here's the bad: The pacing of the movie was rather poor. Rather than presenting its events in a fashion in which they build upon each other, therefore building the movie up like a great structure, it rather mixes things around, spending more time on small things than on the big things, making it seem kind of uneven, sort of misformed. Too much time is spent on building the suit. The CGI, for some reason, seeing as how this has the potential to make so much money, is mediocre at the very best. It is really obvious that what your seeing has been made by a computer. The movie is only 126 minutes long, but feels much longer. There isn't enough action. There's three scenes of action, his battle against the terrorists, the skirmish with the jets, and the battle against the Iron Monger at the end. These scenes feel much too short when compared to the non-action scenes, and i know, you have to spend time on the characters, but this movie spends way too much time on its characters, and that time isn't well spent. The action isn't well crafted, isn't designed well to be that thrilling, and there-for isn't. There is also a very clear potential for greatness with Tony Stark and a character named Yessin in the beginning, a very clear potential for some entertaining and well done character development, but what could have been great was muddled by some less than great writing and pacing. The acting was good, but did suffer in some parts, and wasn't some landmark as people have claimed. Bottom line, Iron Man, i don't think, is very good, because it doesn't have any parts that would make me want to watch again. Cloverfield has the same Re-watch inefficieny, but it was actually well done, and much more memorable. I gave Iron Man a 6 because it isn't terrible, but very, very mediocre. I don't understand, at all, all of the praise going towards it,especially all the critical praise. I wouldn't see it again, simply because the entertainment wouldn't be there. You can see it if you want, but you might not have nearly as much fun as you would like.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Easily one of the most over rated movies....ever!,"So basically, what do you get when you have a super-hero action movie with no action? ""Iron Man"". Don't be fooled by all of these other reviews. ""Iron Man"" contains less than 5 complete minutes of action. In fact, 5 minutes of action (with Iron man involved) is a generous statement. What a waste of two hours. ""Iron Man"" could have been great! All it needed was about 20 minutes more of actual Iron Man fighting! Iron Man only threw one punch. Yes that's right. This move is 2 hours long and the main character, (in an action movie) threw one total punch. The best part? The punch missed!

Awesome - Fun from 6 - 106!!!,"I was there for the first screening of this movie here in South Australia. I have to say that from the ads I expected a lot, but then again I always do when it comes to superhero type movies, and I am generally disappointed. But not this time. I sat there and within a couple of minutes it had me engrossed. It was full of action, excitement and kept me happy through the whole movie and brought me to applause a couple of times! When I heard that Robert Downie Jnr was playing the role I was somewhat perturbed as I couldn't see him playing any sort of believable superhero. I was totally blown away at the way he fell into the role. He played it with a great deal of wit and I had no problems accepting him as Iron Man, The rest of the cast were enjoyable as well, but my favorite, apart from Robert Downie Jnr, was Jeff Bridges in the type of role that I haven't seen him play before.I guess that those who are Marvel Comic aficionado's will have their problems with this movie, but, as someone who had no previous knowledge of Iron Man and his creation, I think that it works really well. After seeing the movie I have no intention of rushing out to buy the Iron Man comics, but I will be there to see the next installment in the Iron Man movies... and yes, according to the director, Jon Favreau, there is the potential for at least 2 more movies and I can't wait. They left a few little hints for us to pick up on that the potential is there for sequels, if, as Jon says, the movies make enough money.I have no problem taking my grandkids to see this... there is no bad language. Yes Tony Stark does seem a bit of a sleaze at first and is definitely a ladies man, and yes, there are a whole lot of explosions and guns blasting, but, it is so over the top that it can't be in anyway seen as believable. And even with things blowing up all the time there is very little in the way of blood or gore.A SuperHero movie for kids of all ages. I gave this a 10 out of 10 because for full length of the movie I never once looked at my watch, I was totally engrossed, and came out thinking it was a good $16 spent. That doesn't happen very often. Just remember to suspend your belief... this is a movie based on a comic, not a historical drama, not an Oscar contender. Just a fun filled, action packed, Good guys vs Bad Guys movie. How can it fail!!! Iron Man Rocks!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Ordinary,"Iron Man kickstarted a juggernaut franchise, but is fairly ordinary alone. The story is formulaic and its arc is contradictory. Specifically, Stark denounces weapons manufacturing after almost dying from a missile. However, he then builds Iron Man (a highly sophisticated weapon). The film paints him as an honorable peacekeeper. Yet in reality, he's a violent vigilante. It would've made more thematic sense for Stark to advance medical technology, but action was the predetermined goal here. Overall, Downey is a perfect fit, the dialogue has clever quips, and the plot is decently paced. It's just hard to digest Stark's illogical progression.Meanwhile, Iron Man's craft is passable. The only noticeable visuals are a few hero shots. The soundtrack has some classic rock songs yet isn't particularly impactful. The editing does a minor timeline manipulation, but lacks any stylish transitions or elevated sequences. The effects are significant but also have awkward combinations of CGI bodies with real faces. Plus, the direction is almost intentionally voiceless and neutral. Really, the only clear strengths are the complex sound (with symbolic touches) and the recognizable production design. Ultimately, Iron Man doesn't have many blatant flaws, but doesn't have powerful strengths either.Writing: 6/10

Iron Man Eats His Spinach,"From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day.But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
All I can say is Marvel has redeemed itself!!!,"Spider-Man 3 and Ghost Rider SUCKED to the highest extent of the comic-to-movie craze of the millennium. 2007 was a bad year for superhero movies so I came in with low expectations to see Iron Man. The previews looked good but I feared I will be disappointed again and suspect that Marvel has lost its touch after the first two Spider-Man and X-Men films. Well, to be honest I was THOROUGHLY impressed and ENTERTAINED at the same time!!! This film EASILY blows those two crapfests mentioned earlier out of the water completely with an intelligent and well written plot, good acting, action, special effects and most importantly character development, something Sider-Man 3 completely neglected to do. The less said about Ghost Rider the better. But the real star of the show is no doubt the unlikely casting choice of Mr. Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man. His performance really caught me off guard in almost every aspect as a charming, no-nonsense, weapons-making womanizer whose at first glance ""imbeded"" with man's destructive nature but ultimately rises with a heart of gold. Gwyneth Paltow is both sexy and sweet as Stark's secretary who keeps him from slipping further; nice to see a woman whose smart and sexy with real depth in a comic book movie. Jon Favreau's direction is top-notch and knows the material well; moreover, this is the first Marvel film made independently of any major studio. I also like that the Iron Man armor is a combination of CGI and practical effects, helped along by Stan Winston, the king of practical movie effects and his work and attention to detail is very impressive as shown in the past. Though there's lots of humor in Iron Man, it never becomes overbearing and OTT like Spider-Man 3 whose idea of humor is more on the lines of an SNL sketch. My only negatives are some underdeveloped characters and the liberties taken with the Iron Man comics (Tony Stark being captured in Afghanistan rather than Vietnam, not delving into his alcoholism) but those are miner hiccups in an otherwise stellar movie.In conclusion: Iron Man is the best Marvel movie made and I'm eagerly awaiting future installments and after seeing this awesome film I can say wholeheartedly and sincerely that Marvel has truly redeemed itself. See it and be blown away!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Total Package - Downey is Perfect - Can't Wait For Sequel,"24/M/Detroit - This movie was spectacular.

Here's a review for non-die hard Iron Guy fans...,"I can't say that I can name one particular plot twist from issue #x of series wutever. Nor do I desire the capability to do so.

But it ends there. No original story line to speak of. The acting by Junior was okay, maybe a notch above average, but that's about it. Though Gwenyth is a knockout, she just didn't deliver the screams and lines of devastation well enough to convince me that she's really a ""damsel in distress"". Th bad guy is a steryotypical bald guy who wants to make lots of things that go ""Bang"" and make lots of money that way. The cast is mediocre to put it....lightly.

Iron Man Is Made Out Of Gold.,"Tony Stark is a wealthy weapons manufacturer on a routine trip back from a demonstration of his latest weapon, when he is attacked by rebels who want him to build his latest weapon for their own evil gain. Taking shrapnel to the chest, he must have a pacemaker like device on at all times in order to live. After escaping his captives, Stark sees a new side to life and wants to protect the people who have died from his weapons. Thus creating Iron Man.I've read a few issues of Iron Man, enough to know what the story is about, who the characters are and what to expect from the film. I never went in with high expectations, wanting it to be the best thing since sliced bread, and I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Iron Man is the firs real summer blockbuster movie to grace the screen in a long time. Filled with humorous dialogue, great casting and high flying special effects, Iron Man is one of the best comic book adaptations ever put to film.With the announcement of Robert Downey Jr. playing Tony Stark, I knew John Favreau was the right man for the job. Downey has shined a light on himself so bright that I expect more leading roles to come his way. With perfect comedic timing and a dramatic arc to boot, he has created one of the most compelling comic book characters on film to date. With Peter Parker we are beaten over the head with his love for Mary Jane and his guilt for his uncle, we never really get pass this. X-men has too many characters to keep track of for us to emotionally connect to one central character. Iron Man manages to make a womanizing, alcoholic, weapons manufacturer actually likable. All of that is because of Downey's charisma.Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much to do here, but she makes the material work. Howard was a little off his game. His presence wasn't there. It seemed like he wasn't confident enough in this role and it was really out of place. Jeff Bridges is menacing in the looks, but comedic in the dialogue. I don't know if it is my hours upon hours of Lebowski watching, but I just did not find Bridges voice to be menacing at all. I kept hearing the dude. He wasn't threatening enough.Iron Man sets itself apart from other comic book films (except for Batman Begins) with how serious it is. The film prides itself on being more realistic then what one would think. This is accomplished by focusing more on the man inside the armor then the high flying rocket shooting, breaking sound barrier hot rod red ""superhero"". This is because Iron Man is simply that....a man. He has no special powers, no enhanced ability. He has loads and loads of money.The problem with most origin stories is that it has to set everything up. It doesn't have the time to have fun with the story and make it seem really dangerous to the characters. Iron Man has a lot of set up and little delivery on the action. There are two scenes in which Stark throws on the suit and does actual battle. Not including the cave made promo device. This has pros and cons, it does make the film seem more plausible. I believed a lot of what was happening, until the final fight scene. Unfortunately, that final fight scene doesn't knock anyone's socks off. It doesn't blow our minds, it's too generic and the suit, environments and weaponry were not used to their full potential.The special effects are well done, nothing too jaw dropping. It seemed like the crew knew what they had to do and just went for that. Nothing seems to be trying to grab our attention, it all fits naturally. Some scenes are bit off and noticeable CGI is used, which may be distracting to the eye. Specially when Downey is sitting in front of the TV and he has the armor suits arm on his right arm.I'm impressed with Favreau. I wasn't a big fan of Elf and Zathura was garbage. With Iron Man Favreau has found his calling. I hope he doesn't try anymore kid films and sticks to what he knows and does best. He never let the content get away from him, considering it is so huge and upon first glance, would seem out of his league.Iron Man is a fun ride that kicks off the summer blockbuster trend. While it is not as good as X-Men 2 or some other comic book outings, it is indeed one of the strongest ones.

As good as a man of steel!,"When the Iron Man movie was announced, I was unusually ambivalent (unusual as I'm a massive comics nerd with a ton of IM comics amongst my megaton collection).

Then the news that Robert Downey Jnr came through and I thought ""Mmmmminteresting"".

Against my usual efforts to not get my hopes up, I began to look forward to Iron Man, and by the time that I saw it, my expectations were huge.

"Iron Man, a Great Summer Blockbuster","When I saw Iron Man, I expected to see something that I would like just as much as other comic-to-movie adaptions (Spiderman, for instance). However, I was not expecting what I got. About half-way into the movie you can tell the Director did not do what most summer blockbuster directors do; he did not focus only on action. The story that this movie maintains is very entertaining and well-developed. I have heard people complain that this movie was doing nothing but disrespecting Arabs, but I did not see this. If this movie featured all Caucasian people, all African American people, all Hispanic people, etc. as bad guys nobody would be saying anything racist was going on. The fact is that the people who made this movie just wanted a villain familiar with people today and that villain is terrorism. Even with that point aside, it should not detract people from seeing that this is a great way to spend 2 hours.Pros:Well told storylineGreat ActingSeeing Tony Stark transform from egotistic to a caring individualSuperb CGICons:Horribe climaxThe last line (I won't say what it is), in my opinion, ruined the ability for a sequel to reach the heights this movie did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Get your armor suit on,"Much like SPIDER MAN, IRON MAn is at its best when the characters are not in costume. While Robert Downey is not my idea of Tony Stark, he is at least his usual charming self and entertaining whenever he's on-screen. The problem comes whenever he dons the armor suit: it's cartoony and not terribly convincing. The CGI is like something from a video game, and I suppose that's what this movie is targeting: young white males who spend half their lives playing video games and seeking their connection to the big screen. I also am not a big Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she gives it her best as Pepper Potts, Tony's perky and devoted secretary.

Everything that makes superhero flicks awesome is back and this time it's iron clad,"It's time to suit up, because the comic film genre has a new face bringing it back to life and it's a shiny one. ""Iron Man"" delivers everything you want in a comic book-based film and is probably the best thing to happen to Marvel Studios since Spider-Man 2--that's nearly 4 years of a lot of money with disappointing delivery. A good start for the first film fully produced by the studio with no additional funding.Iron Man is not the most well-loved of Marvel characters, but at this point in the Marvel film universe, he feels like next logical step to give the comic company a boost in the right direction. The man is Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), a millionaire playboy in the arms dealing business. On a routine demonstration trip in Afghanistan (updated to the modern era), Stark is captured and held hostage by a rebel band of Afghanis who demand he build them one of his best missiles. Instead, Stark devises a plan to build a suit of armor so he can escape.A victim of the very weapons he created, Stark's uniqueness in comparison to other Marvel heroes Stan Lee has created is that he learns the error of his ways, his ignorance to the evil his industry produces, and the experience changes his perspective. It's not a vengeance story, it's one of personal redemption.Downey Jr. carries this film. Not entirely, but the film focuses more on his discovery and creation of Iron Man than it does on him being on Iron Man and fighting evil, a wonderful choice by the writers. Downey Jr.'s standard witty comedic acting fits this perfectly as finally there is a superhero with a sense of humor. ""Iron Man"" could be the funniest of all superhero films, or at least it certainly beats the awkward attempts of ""Spider-Man 3.""Marvel was way overdue for introducing a new character after the 3rd installments of the ""X- Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" franchises. An origin story, the reason why those other franchises took off, was in order. Those films were fantastic in many ways, but failed because they tried to do too much and ""Iron Man"" doesn't. The plot is straightforward. Now there have been other Marvel origin films ""Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"" for example, that fail as well. ""Iron Man"" is better than those films because it is so focused on Stark's character. This is interesting and fascinating because of the visual effects and the sheer creativity of those behind the concept of what his suit could actually do. A lot of scenes are test scenes and while not much is going on, they're really cool and captivating. There's no law that superheroes have to spend most of their time as the hero and fighting. ""Iron Man"" doesn't do that--it reserves that for the climax of the film and doesn't dwell there any longer than it must. You want more, but what you do get isn't bad.The supporting cast really helps too. Bridges in his first truly evil role as Stark's adviser turned-bad, Obadiah Stane, is great, Paltrow provides a nice change of pace as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and even Terrence Howard is likable as Stark's friend and military ally, Jim Rhodes.The only thing to complain about ""Iron Man"" is that there wasn't enough. So much time, though rightly so, was spent on Stark's development of ""Iron Man"" that there wasn't enough room for more awesome action sequences in the suit and most disappointing of all, further thematic development, which is what made Spider-Man revolutionary. It's all there, but it doesn't get as much attention as it should. A second viewing might bring those themes home more.Jon Favreau should get incredible applause for outdoing the skepticism he unjustly received when it was first revealed he would be at the helm. There are plenty of treats for the comic book fans in this film and there's just a lot of great realism to this film than previous films too focused on great one-liners and the like, which is what someone like Favreau of the ""dude romantic comedy"" persuasion can bring to a genre in so much need of that normal/ human touch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The rebirth of Robert Downey Jr.,Iron Man is a great superhero movie and sadly the reason there was an explosion of superhero films back then which never seems to end. As a standalone this is a great film about Tony Stark and his origins. Played superbly by Robert Downey Jr. and ably assisted by Jon Favreau Iron Man seems like a derelict of the past when viewed through the lens of 2018.

Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations ever,"Like a few, I was one of the people that though this movie would totally blow, based on the trailers. So, I went in with very low expectations. I walked out with a smile and exclaimed to my friend ""That was pretty good!"" It really was. The movie is a bit slow moving but done very well. A very selfish man, Tony Stark (played surprisingly brilliant by Robert Downey Jr.) is hit with reality and turns against what he's worked towards all of his life. But it's a force that won't go down without a fight.The script for the movie is not incredible, but the way the cast delivers it is. Robert Downey Jr. is great; he's very convincing, and even when he changes to a more heroic type, it's not overdone and he hasn't changed as drastically and unrealistically as some might think.Other actors include Terrence Howard, who was good, Tony Stark's friend in Afghanistan (I forgot his name) was good, Jeff Bridges was pretty good (with the exception maybe of his last scene in the film), and Gwyneth Paltrow, who was excellent with the exception of the showdown. She overdid it in that scene, and I was surprised by the sudden cheesiness that overcame her.Like I said, the movie is a bit slow moving, but when it delivers, it delivers. The action sequences were good, though my least favorite was the climatic showdown, which was too clichéd for me. The movie as a whole is clichéd, but its done intelligently, so the clichés don't feel as clichéd.I was happily surprised. I thought this would be another Fantastic Four, but I'd stick it between Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins, which are my favorite superhero movies. I haven't seen a ton of comic book movies, just mainly the superhero ones, and this is one of the best of those superhero-comics-turned-movies. It's a fun movie the whole family could see and enjoy. But you can honestly enjoy it. 8.0/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Comic Mentality,"The special effects in this picture are good but not much else worth saying that about this movie. It is made for people with juvenile minds or for those who take comfort in reading comics. The plot so called is about a super rich and clever arms' dealer who decides that he will create an iron 'superman' to fight what he perceives to be injustice. Where this movie errs badly it is pure and ridiculous science fantasy yet it brings in real life war torn Afghanistan and starts preaching politics and other self interested propaganda. The lead actor and actress are totally miscast and are wholly unconvincing; she thinks by just posing she is putting in a decent performance which she does not, and he is no hero and neither acts nor looks the part. The film is far too long. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Yeah, I can fly.""","My Take: Robert Downey Jr. is the real treat here.Comic-book movies are growing up! After the success of a revamped BATMAN franchise and the SPIDER-MAN pictures which successfully venture beyond its basic premise, it's about time Marvel's metal-suited action hero to get his share of the spotlight. I'm talking about IRON MAN, of course. And it's quite a surprise. Thankfully, IRON MAN doesn't fall on the tragic path of cheesiness and artificiality like the FANTASTIC FOUR pictures. Instead, IRON MAN is nearly as potent and mature as the SPIDER-MAN pictures, although not as dark or sinister as the new BATMAN pictures.That's fine however, since IRON MAN aims for a different approach. It's a comic book adventure for adults. It's mature and geared more to adults than on the little tykes, yet it still has the feel of a comic book movie. It's got flashy action sequences that are lighter than those in Chris Nolan's new BATMAN movies, including a rock 'em sock 'em battle between Iron Man and a larger metal-suited behemoth. It tackles deeper issues than most superhero/comic-book movies (maybe even deeper than the SPIDER-MAN movies), but it never forgets to be fun, even in the forgettable sense. Robert Downey Jr. makes an eccentric Tony Stark, a weapons industrialist and a genius, not to mention a playboy. Think Bruce Wayne meets Nicolas Cage in LORD OF WAR. Ironically, he's a superhero's own worst enemy. He sells nuclear weapons of the best quality. But after being captured by a underground terrorists asking him to re-build a weapon of his to be used against the Americans, he suits himself up with an artificial ""heart"" and a metal suit armed to the teeth to blow you apart.From eccentric weapons engineer, Stark finishes his advance armored suit and turns himself into a real man-of-steel of the title, much to the dismay of his superior Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, who looks exactly like William Hurt in another Marvel-based movie of the year THE INCREDIBLE HULK), who wants Stark Industries to continue producing the latest in weapons technology. Gwyneth Paltrow also stars as Pepper Potts, Stark's assistant. But the real star is Downey Jr., a superb actor who gives deeper dimension to the typical superhero alter-ego. If the explosions and eye-popping special effects will be gone the moment you step out of the theater, the character of Tony Stark will stay with you like a person you just met. The character is funny, eccentric but most of all, memorable. Director Jon Favreau may not stage the action as good as Christopher Nolan's BATMAN pictures or like Sam Raimi of the SPIDER-MAN films, but he handles the characters real well. IRON MAN is a good start for the summer movie season, but it isn't just a while-you-wait blockbuster for THE DARK KNIGHT (arguably the summer's best picture).Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man-comic vs. film!! (spoiler),"I just saw the movie last night and was honestly impressed. In comparison to past comic movies I thought it was pretty damn close to perfection.Robert Downey was a great Tony Stark, a little older than the character would normally be but it still worked. All the other characters were equally as well matched with actors.My only bone with this movie was that some of the scenes seemed to drag, and though this may not be a popular opinion I honestly don't like Samuel L. as Nick Furry. When I see him I don't see Nick Furry I see him as Samuel L./Windu/and a crap load of other characters. One of the reasons why I liked the casting for X-men was because most of the actors weren't that famous. I could make the connection between them and the character rather than thinking of all their past characters. This may just be me being anal but it's what I think.As a comic nerd and a practical person I know they don't make movie adaptations for fans. I know they do a little bit but it's mostly to bring non readers in and entertain. If anyone bothers to read this and doesn't read comics I encourage you to pick one up. People put negative connotations with comic reading, but as someone that reads both comics and regular literature I can say some of the best characters and story lines I have ever read came out of comics.They movie was great. One of or the best comic movie yet I think. I look forward to a sequel even though Sam L. is going to be Nick Furry. I am also looking forward to Wolverine Origins. Which will have the first movie appearance of Deadpool!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He really does whatever an iron can,"Iron Man The trailer for this film spoke volumes. The film... speaks an entire library. It falls in line with the great superhero films, like Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins. And in some ways, tops them. Such is Iron Man.Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a multi-billion dollar industrialist who made his money from weapons development for the military. After experiencing the destructive nature of his arms first hand while a hostage in Afghanistan, Stark feels it necessary to change his life's goal, much to the chagrin of his business partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Keeping Stark on track and in line are his assistant/love interest Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison/best friend Jim Rhoades (Terrance Howard). In order to combat his former war profiteering ways, Stark develops an advanced suit of armor with the latest in robotics, computers, weaponry and metals, leading him to be affectionately known as the Iron Man.In recent years, mostly since 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Downey has become one of my favourite actors. and the character of Stark/Iron Man is the best for him. Or maybe he's the best for the character. The thing fascinating thing about Stark is his motives behind being a hero. With Batman it's revenge, Superman the desire to do good and Spider-man it's guilt. But with Iron Man, it's atonement. Stark experiences first hand the wrath of his weapons. And then he realizes that he has to do more than just denounce weapons production. He has to right his wrongs. Only way to do that, is to be Iron Man.And that's where Downey takes over. Downey has a knack for playing uniquely troubled characters. Tony Stark is one that he deeply understands, as he himself is a fan of the comic book. Downey figured out the character, and enveloped it. Too many times we had Brandon Routh as Superman or Tom Jane as The Punisher. But with this, it was Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man.But Downey, as talented as he is, did not make this flick on his own. There was the bizarre, inexplicable romantic chemistry between him and Paltrow, as his long suffering assistant Pepper Potts. The two actors have had very different careers, and never in a million years would I have picked those two to portray romantic leads in a film. But for some reason, it worked. The fact that they are so different, and so are the characters, made it work.Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Arlington Road) is an actor, who if you were to ask me to define his career, I couldn't. He's played a multitude of characters in a myriad of different genres. But his turn as the villainous Obadiah Stane/War Monger is a fantastic look at a villain. He wasn't the traditional villain. He wasn't driven by hatred for the hero, or megalomaniacal desires. He's driven by protecting his own interests in war profiteering. He's the embodiment of true villainy. He's looking out for number one, and he's protecting his greedy interest. He's got no real regard for anyone else, just himself. He's the perfect counterpoint to Downey's Stark.Director Jon Favreau deserves a lot of the credit for this film. He kept the reigns on the story to keep it from getting too out there, and actually explored the practical science of Iron Man. Sure you have to suspend some disbelief as several pieces of technology don't exist or completely defy laws of physics. But a lot of it is very interesting. And Favreau, like Downey, knows and understand the material. He was able to respectfully bring Iron Man to the big screen.I highly recommend this for anyone. It combines what made the dreadful Fantastic Four popular and what made Batman Begins so damn good. It finds the balance with light fun, hard core action and in-depth character study.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Experience,"Does a summer blockbuster get better than this one?Well, at least in this day and age....I don't think so.As I have grown older, I am more cynical of films. I am frustrated more by the flaws....clichéd plots, over indulgence of CGI and poor writing are just some examples of the problems of movies these days.I have spent too much of my life wasted watching bad movies that were supposed to be good (Independence Day for example).I knew going in that Iron Man was well-received. I expected a good film. You know what? I got it.From a great lead character (thank god Robert Downey Jr. has cleaned himself up. He is great in this film), dazzling yet not overdone special effects, and direction that allows this film to go at a tight pace...Iron Man soars.What an enjoyable cinematic experience.

"The mechanical encrusted on the living, with a a vodka martini","Is this story supposed to have political significance? In it Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), the brilliant playboy scion of a megabucks American weapons manufacturer (are there cut-rate ones?), discovers that his company's products, which he ostensibly thought used to protect the US and preserve ""peace,"" are being supplied to some multinational bad guys in Afghanistan. To keep us guessing about who's being demonized this time, these blokes speak Egyptian Arabic, Dari, Pushtu, Hungarian, and after that I lost track. You wonder how they carry out their operations since they change languages every five minutes. Naturally their leader turns out to speak perfect English so he can spar verbally with Tony as the need arises.While Mr. Stark is held prisoner with a friendly foreign scientist, he's supposed to develop a super-rocket so the bad guys can take over the whole region if not the world, but miraculously he manages to conceal the fact that he's in fact not doing that at all but engineering a spectacular escape by cobbling together a giant robotic weapons-fitted iron suit out of scraps. That'll show them.Oh and by the way, Stark's chest got filled with shrapnel when the baddies captured him, so he's fitted first with a giant magnet to keep the lethal metal from going to his heart, and then some sort of artificial heart gadget. It's supposed to be a wonder but we're not to know how it works. All we know is that it gives out a luminous glow. It's the symbol that Tony himself, hitherto into life only for the pleasure it could give him, has acquired an ability to care. He rushes home, flying through the air being one of his suit's abilities, and after declaring his Stark Weapons Technologies out of the weapons business, begins devising a much more high tech and sleek version of the robotic suit thing, in red, and no longer made of iron but some sorts of miraculous alloys.There is a little of James Bond in Tony Stark. He likes to drink, he likes women, and frankly, up to now, he doesn't give a damn. On top of that he has wavy hair, a sharp mustache, a nice tan, and a fearsome intellect. His repartee is rapid fire and offhand and only occasionally mimics the delivery of Kevin Spacey. Remember Bond's blazing Astin Martin? This robotic suit thingy is some sort of grossly hypertrophied offshoot.There are two kinds of real fun in Iron Man for those who are patient enough to sit through all the wizard explosions and pointless political confusion. One is the dazzling special effects of Tony's private robot suit factory (he shares his process only with tool-manipulating robots that he handles with witty condescension). This stuff becomes most entertaining when Tony learns how to fly, with some nasty bumps along the way; but for gadget geeks the elegant complexity of the artificial limbs and head and the way they click miraculously onto Tony are equally pleasurable. The other fun thing is to see Bridges and Downey Jr. and Paltrow play off each other. Yes, real people can be fun in a movie too.It ought to be inexorably comic, since the concept of the robot suit donned by a man is such a literal expression of Bergson's definition of comedy--""the mechanical encrusted upon the living."" Only it isn't. Nor are obvious, perhaps much too obvious, implications about technology shielding man from his humanity, ever brought to light in this movie.Well, yet another comic book has been brought to multi-million-dollar screen life in Hollywood. Favreau has assembled an excellent cast and one stops wondering why they bother (for the money, yes?) when one sees how typically mercurial and witty Robert Downey Jr. is in the lead, how disconcertingly unpleasant Jeff Bridges becomes as Obadiah Stone, his would-be nemesis, and how appealing and present Gywneth Paltrow is in the neutral role of Tony Dare's (Downey's) girl Friday, Pepper Potts (cute name). Terrence Howard is wasted and too mild as some kind of air force commander who basically just works for the weapons company.You might wonder why Iron Man has done so well with adult film critics. Isn't this just adolescent fare given a mild gloss of adulthood and a heavy extra coat of S/X? But then you think of how much better this is than the competition, and you understand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man is a Solid Movie,"Tony Stark is a playboy who also happens to be an engineering genius. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile he has developed he's captured and wounded. The captors want him to assemble a missile for them but instead he creates a suit of super armor along with a device to prevent his own death from some shrapnel that was left in his chest by the attack and not removed by the hostage takers. He uses the suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the very people that had arranged his capture to begin with. Stark then uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research. What prevails is a new superhero Iron Man.Jon Favreau, who directs the film, was the perfect choice for Iron Man as he is a lifelong fan of the comic book hero. He even makes a cameo in the movie. The gadgetry is amazing and well done along with the computer wizardry that combined with the humor of the whole thing gives a relaxed feeling to the movie. Robert Downey, Iron Man himself, utilizes his bad boy persona in his acting characterization of Tony Stark. His performance is right on the money and very enjoyable. The weakest link here is Jeff Bridges who plays Stane, Stark's nemesis in the film.

"Hey terrorists, terrorise this","Given that over the past eight years or so we've seen three X-Men movies, three Spiderman movies, two Fantastic Four movies, Batman, Superman and the Punisher, it's not hard to imagine a few people rolling their eyes as Iron Man, the latest superhero franchise turns up this Spring. Cast all those aspersions aside though folks, years from now people will be talking about the first time they saw Iron Man with the sense of wistful nostalgia usually reserved for the likes of Jaws. This is one of those movies that reminds you why you keep going to the cinema: pure escapist entertainment that for two hours provides the perfect break from Council tax, mortgage repayments and neighbours throwing four month old watermelon slices at your conservatory windows.The somewhat familiar story revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr), a billionaire weapons dealer with a penchant for fast cars and loose women. His self-absorbed life comes to sudden end though when he gets captured by Afghan rebels after demonstrating his latest super missile, goodbye California Condo, hello dusty pit of hell. Tasked with building them a missile, Stark turns the tables on his captors by fashioning a formidable armoured suit Macguyver style out of their weapon supplies and smacking them into oblivion. A free man again, he returns to America and brings a burning desire to correct some of the wrongs he's helped to engineer with him. That and a massive great hole in his chest.From here the story follows typical superhero-origin archetypes but is still constantly watchable thanks to Downey Junior's charismatic performance. His Tony Stark is a walking charm offensive without any nauseating smarm (thank the lord Tom Cruise did not get it) and manages to exude chemistry out of everyone he comes into contact with. Nailing every single one-liner, it is abundantly clear why his GI bodyguards in the opening scene are so starstruck; if you're in this man's presence for more than a few seconds you will want to be him. Heck, even the anthropomorphic robots in his lab enjoy his company.Granted, by the time the first hour has gone by and our hero still hasn't put on his iconic red and yellow suit, some of the ankle biters might get a bit impatient but the payoff is well worth it. His brawls with the Afghan militia are eye-popping enough but his closing battle with the Iron Monger (think over-sized alter-ego) is the real clincher. It's a barnstorming highway smash 'em up which puts the ADD camera of Transformers to shame. Parents need not fear though, this is not violence, it's action. There is no blood to speak of and even the potentially harrowing scenes of villages being raided or young American soldiers getting machine gunned fail to put a downer on the colourful escapism.The film also boasts the strongest supporting cast since Batman Begins and they all do their best, but despite Terrence Howard's matey military liaison and Jeff Bridges oozing menace, this is still very much the lead's show. His star quality practically drips off the screen and combined with the outstanding set pieces, turns what could have been yet another production line origin movie into the best blockbuster of the year so far. And make sure you stay to the end of the credits, it's well worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

First step in a new universe,"Growing up the best comic book movies we're Batman (1989) and Superman hands down because all other comic book movies up until Spiderman (2000) were all terrible, cheesy and were considered by many to still be childish movies not meant for adults investors saw comic book movies as a very risky investment and you can see why when looking at early comic book movies then.In the early 2000s We were then given the (Sam Raimi) Spiderman trilogy that while not perfect opened the doors for what comic book movies had the potential to be then in a short span of time we had the new Batman movies which gave birth to The Dark Knight one of the best comic book movies ever made but marvel at the that time was knowhere to be seen after releasing disappointing movies like the Fantastic Four movies and Daredevil it seemed like DC and Batman were the only good movies we were ever going to get but that all changed when in 2008 Marvel released the first movie in a planned Marvel movie universe even fans of Iron Man thought the movie was gunna be bad and fail but fortunately we got one of the best comic book movies made in a very very long time and Marvel finally got it right after almost 30 years of trying.I was absolutely blown away by Iron Man the first time I watched it and was happy to see more and more people taking an interest in comic books and comic book movies this one movie opened the doors for future comic book movies to be taken seriously and get a real budget now comic book movies are everywhere and honestly it's a great time to be a nerd and a comic book fan.The cast is perfect especially Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man his personality matches the comic books pretty well.The visuals are stunning and the special effects still hold up 12 years later they only got better in future movies but for a starter movie they are very impressive.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a comic book fan or just a fan of comic book movies it's action packed and this movie was the very beginning for the MCU a strong start and it only got better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't let the flood of great reviews fool you, this might as well be a coaster!","Positives: the suit looked great! He flies once or twice. He fires once or twice!Cons: 1. The origin of Iron Man should have been adapted more to movies rather than keeping the same comics version. Sometimes, it's great to stick with the origin. This is not one of them. Mainstream audiences knew nothing about it and it's very bad; that's when you do away with an origin. Tony Stark is supposed to be an electrical-mechanical genius, not a medical one. He'd have to be a medical genius as well to pull off what he accomplished. Parts of the suit keep him alive and that's medical and knowing how to merge the 3 technologies almost perfectly is what he'd have to know how to do! In my opinion, they should have allowed Stark to be shot close to his heart or have an explosion where shrapnel gets into his heart maybe 20-30 years later than the 2008 date where medical science has made monumental leaps forward. They put an electronic/mechanic device in his heart that is typical with his injury. Then, he builds upon that to create Iron Man. 2. The things he whipped up in the movie where just plain silly! Iron Man's metal inorganic suit is supposed to act like Spiderman's symbiote(a living organism or entity)! That's why I never liked Transformers at all! Metal does things that no inorganic thing can and you certainly can't do it mentally as Stark was able to. 3. Iron Man does very little as a superhero. A flying scene(or possibly 2) and a blast scene(possibly 2). He does lift a heavy car. 4. The villain was super awful and the fight was worse. 5. The plot was boring! The acting was bad, too!I honestly don't know what can make you give this garbage even a 5! I used to read Iron Man when I was younger and liked it then. I bought this movie, but trashed it!

One of the best Marvel films there is!,"As fans of superhero films like Spider-Man, I can say this is another nearly flawless Marvel adaptation...This film is huge fun. The film starts off great, and it continues to blast off. the pacing in this film is very well done. I have never seen an action film so well put together, scenes come and go, yet you feel you are so satisfied with what's on screen. The pacing allows us to really interact with this film. The screenplay is also strong. I have seen a lot of Marvel films, and many of them do not work. This film was a huge surprise, because I thought it was going to be ridiculously bad, and it was the opposite. The amount of 'cool' style this film has is why a lot of teens have loved it! It is so well-based, and I have never seen an action film so well received by fans. The great critiques and great fan reactions is no surprise. It was funny, light in parts, and the characters had great things to work with. The writing really allows us to see each characters for what they are, and the reason we are also is because of the acting in this film. I have to say, this film is probably the best acted superhero film I have ever seen. Robert Downey Jr. is a genuine surprise, and I think that his performance is really quirky yet magnificent. Like a lot of people, I was surprised he took on the role of Tony Stark, who is really a very money-based character. His performance only adds the great style of this film. His character has a lot of great moments on dialogue, together with Gwyneth Paltrow, who also shines when given the right wit. This film stays true to the comic books, which not a lot of people can really recognize. The action scenes are very well done. Even though there is not a lot, the film really can attract to a lot of people because of it's fun style. The special effects are also very realistic. i could not tell when i was watching the armor suit of CGI or the real one... I think this film has done enough to add to great blockbuster films. I have to say, it is as good of a film as, in my opinion, the best superhero film to this point Spider-Man 2, and a great introduction to what will become a great trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Far Exceeds The Character's Usual Presentation,"I have never been terribly fond of Iron Man.

I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation, but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted, both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan, but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films), he needs to be modern, and I think this was handled excellently.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great even if you never read the comic.,"As a female who never read comics, I was not looking forward to seeing this movie with my husband. It completely shocked me! I am not one who laughs out loud usually, especially in a public space. There were scenes that I could not control myself. Those scenes were equaled with ones that made me jump, as well as scenes where I wanted to applaud the hero. Ladies... Give the movie a chance. If for no other reason than you get to see Robert Downing Jr. go see it! To the fellows out there... My husband did read the comics growing up and he really enjoyed the movie. Seriously, the movie was so great that the whole theater of late night movie watchers cheered and laughed out loud though out the film. One fan even jokingly cried out for the theater operators to rewind a particularly stunning scene. Two thumbs way up on the creativity as well as the conservative nature of the film.

A great begining to a fantastic franchise,"Iron Man, one of the most iconic heroes on the planet and for what reason? This movie that started a whole entire series of fantastic movies. Iron Man focuses on the main protagonist Tony Stark, who is a technical genius devoloping many machine weaponry for his company Stark Industries, which he realizes after being captured for 3 months by Arabian terrorists that were using his weapons, decides that there is a different way to make the world peaceful, and he does that through the iron man suit. He thenbecomes the super hero with the name Iron Man and helps out people across his city and across many countries, such as stopping terrorists from killing many citizens and stopping many forces, that happen to be some of his own, and finally beating the final Antagonist of this movie. It's not a plot twist of any sort, but more of a betrayal, and this movie has incredible fight scenes, incredible acting, the writing is amazing, and this movie brought back Robert Downey Jrs career as a whole, and began the Marvel Franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Gold and Titanium Alloy Man......,"....................................just doesn't sound quite right.Jon Faverau scores a hit with this latest Marvel adaptation. Much like the initial entries of Spiderman, X-Men and MAYBE even Fantastic Four, the production values in this latest sci-fi/comic adaptation are tight and worth the exorbitant admission price. Story line, screen play and script are all good and well executed. Glad to see that 'Marvel' has created it's own production company. I think that this can only help in delivering projects which are truer to original concept, both now and in the future. This movie is one to see in the fancy theater, particularly if it has a giant screen and great sound system.The integration of topical events into the story line provides a credible backdrop to the milieu. The plot was interesting and flowed well, although credibility must be suspended during certain parts..... but hey, it IS a movie and I had no problem buying into the story. CGI technology keeps getting better and better and this film takes full advantage of that.Robert Downey is very good as Tony Stark and I must admit that I've never been a huge Downey fan, but he pulls it off as the somewhat arrogant, wise cracking genius billionaire wunderkind. I've got new respect for him. Jeff Bridges displays versatility with his portrayal of the corporate baddie, Obadiah(?) Stane....he is impressive in this role. In my view, he has elevated himself to the next level of acting credibility AND capability...BRAVO,'DUDE'! Gwyneth Paltro, as Pepper Potts, looks pretty but is bland and forgettable in her portrayal of Tony Stark's assistant. A better casting choice would have helped here. Batman's 'Alfred' she is not. Jon Faverau and Stan Lee are seen in very brief cameo....cool !There's no cussing, nudity or overt sex in this film. There is, however, lots of action, effects and stuff blowing up. I found it to be a satisfying experience. I just hope the sequels will not disappoint, as they have with so many similar franchises.......I rate it 8.5.........",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

This movie is what sells and what is good about our country, $10 at the theater and a costumed hero on a McDonald's super size cup. just like your imagination for buying into this is the equivalent of fast food. The yellow pictures being the established character and actors. Like having Robert Downey Jr. who's life would at least like to be a polar opposite in standards. I like him but please we cannot forget. So I find that amusing, along with the peppered script of good goody, gee gollies dialog. every one in the movie is a parody of the character, even Jeff Bridges whom I'm sure only did this one to play a bad guy. half way threw the plot.Remember Fire engine red is the go sign for profit, when it only turns your minds on fire.So now...""damn...

Writing the Origin Story,"It's an easy bet to say that Iron Man will be the best action picture of the '08 summer. Some of the credit has to go to the casting and performances of Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. They're so good it makes us realize these two actors should be in a lot more movies than they are. But most of the credit has to go to the script.There's a natural tendency to think of the action genre as the most director-dependent of all the forms, what with all their spectacle, staging, and special effects. But this is just another example of where conventional wisdom is wrong. Invariably when an action film goes wrong, it's because of the script. And when it stands above the crowd, it's definitely the script.Comic book action films like Iron Man look deceptively easy to write. Just a fun, heroic character flying around and fighting evil villains. It's actually a tricky form, because you are combining three genres: action, fantasy and comedy. In this script, writers Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway avoided every pitfall of the form and made all the right structural choices.One choice was already made for them. As the film that introduces the character to the audience, Iron Man is an origin story, and that is always the best story in a series. Think of Batman Begins vs. all the others, even the Nicholson one.But the key choice the writers made that set this action film apart had to do with the characters. In the Action Class, I talk a lot about how to create characters that have the capability to change, a structural element that becomes even more important when you combine action with fantasy. Here in Iron Man, instead of a superhero who is super heroic, main character Tony Stark has a number of weaknesses and is in many ways an unlikable person. Instead of being a one-note fighter for good, he is a real man with a deep need that is both believable and relevant in today's world.The writers take this same approach to the opposition. Instead of battling a silly, over-the-top villain, Stark must go up against a deadly Afghan warlord and a corporate boss who will let nothing get in the way of profit. These opponents are not detailed or deep in any way. We've certainly seen them many times before. But they are believable and relevant to the audience in the real world, and that gives the contest power beyond the boundaries of the comic book world.This grounded and real character work makes it even more surprising that this is also the funniest script of the season. The action-comedy combination has been popular for a long time (it's one of the seven comedy sub-forms I detail in the Comedy Class). In the past this has been used most often in action-crime films, like Beverly Hills Cop, as a way to show that the action hero is so good he can make jokes in the face of death. But here the comedy is used to undercut the natural pretentiousness of the superhero character. The writers extend this technique by having the main character make fun of the comic superhero form itself. This again makes him seem more real as he performs his heroic deeds, because the comic book heroes are all those other guys.The combination of action and fantasy is now virtually the sole genre of summer blockbuster films. It's obviously one of the main products that Hollywood wants to buy in their never-ending quest for worldwide popularity. If you want to write an action fantasy, do not underestimate it. Going back to the deep structure techniques necessary for any great story is your only guarantee of success.FOR MORE REVIEWS, go to www.truby.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Raw fun,"Taking baby steps on my fourth decade of life I'm no longer a comic kid or comic adaptation fun - yeah, Sin City has it's moments, two latest Batman titles are OK in whole (with some drawbacks - and some sparks like Ledger, God rest his soul), but none of these films got at least 4 out of 5 on my scale.Beautifully mastered by director and camera-men, it shines. Robert Downey Jr. and Ms. Paltrow are so much in place and their acting (with a lot of humorous touches) is great. Jeff Bridges looks cool despite shaved head and pepper'n'salt beard. And all in all, it's a bright story which you can safely let your kid watch, not worrying about excess of violence pouring from the screen. This movie, somehow, is not about action for me - it's like, as I said, raw fun.Definitely recommended even if you got your degree already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Real Clunker.,"Over-exaggerated and over-wrought would-be superhero dynamic action thriller gets bogged down in a silly screenplay, sillier characters, and sophomoric direction by Jon Favreau. Extraordinary U.S. arms dealer Robert Downey, Jr. is captured by Afghan terrorists on their own turf and must escape by creating his alter ego---the titled character. Now he is a Captain America-styled modern-day freedom fighter who uses state of the art technology and high brow intelligence to fight the dreaded opposition. Jeff Bridges has a predictable role as Downey's would-be associate. Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard supply uninspired supporting roles who do nothing to advance the film's sporadic tone and helter-skelter approach. Downey, Jr.'s supposedly revolutionary role as Tony Stark is little more than a mediocre caricature of an old idea which has never shown much depth or complexity. Based on a comic strip first created by Stan Lee in 1963. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outlandish and Fantastic!,"Absolutely the best movie I have seen in ages.Robert Downey Jr. does quite an excellent performance. Tony Stark is the perfect arrogant asshole you hate to love. Yet he is such a buffoon sometimes you want to smack him. Every second of this movie is a complete riot, well scripted, and the actors pull it off perfectly. The director delivers just enough action to make it entertaining and keep you on the edge of your seat, without overdoing it for as much a second. And the best thing? There wasn't a single ""gotcha"" moment that makes no sense, unlike some other comic-based movies that will remain nameless...My favorite goof in the movie, though, are the monitors in Tony's basement with the Dell logo in the front and an Apple logo on the back, rofl. I especially enjoyed that little detail (though product placement rich) because I use an Apple computer with a Dell monitor and it gets me strange looks when everybody sees it ;)The only thing this movie is missing is a bondage scene, Secretary style, between Tony and Pepper.

A thrill ride tour-de-force,"I was commenting about Spider-man 3 earlier, and this film is almost the antithesis of that. It's lean, slick, smart, and it only has one villain, and a really well-fleshed out one at that! This is what every Marvel film should be like.Robert Downey Jr. puts so much heart and soul into this role that I believe it's one of his best roles since 'Chaplin'. He really nails the character well, and his comic timing is absolutely perfect in this one. He realizes that it's his time to shine, and he uses the opportunity immensely.Gwyneth Paltrow takes one of the more shallow characters in the comic and makes it her own. The chemistry between Stark and Potts is undeniable. She's so much more than a damsel in distress in this one. She plays a pivotal role in the film and is just as important as every other character in it.Jeff Bridges raised my eyebrows when I heard the casting, but he works perfectly within the context of the film. His change in look is drastic enough to easily make him the defacto villain in this film. Having said that, I didn't quite buy into his turn later in the film, but that's just a minor quibble.Terrence Howard knows full well that he will get his opportunity to shine in the sequel, but that's not to say that he phoned in his performance as Jim Rhodes. His concern about Tony will start to become more and more a center point in the story as time goes on, and it seems that Terrence knows he has a role with meat on it to keep him interested for the long haul.The special effects of this film are absolutely amazing, and I didn't feel this way about a man flying since the first Superman way back in 1978. We are taken on a ride with Iron Man, and I must say it's quite exhilarating.I believe that this will be one of the huge Marvel hits of the summer, with the Incredible Hulk showing great promise as well. Marvel Studios is very deserving of each and every dollar spent to see this film, and I believe that the future looks bright for future cross-overs/appearances of other Marvel superheroes in other films.

While watching i was thinking only one thing ""the movie is for kids"" nd the film contained minimum action. when i heard that its Iron Man the first thing came to my mind was action. i hope next one would be better and i would be waiting for it. yes also i didn't understand the end that how tony stark survived.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We've seen this all before (Batman begins) and we seen it better, so where's something worth mentioning to rate this movie higher than very average? There was no sophisticated storytelling, no extraordinary action, even no acting that was more than schematic. It's so black and white. No one seemed to invest more than an evening in the plot to make it half-way intelligent. Jeff Bridges - hum, he should have stayed at the grand piano, Gwyneth Paltrow - she acts like ever, namely she doesn't act at all, only Robert Downey jr. gives at least a face and he sometimes acts like Tony Stark might feel.

Robert Downey Jr. is amazing,"For an action hero, I think Downey was the perfect choice. There isn't a woman on earth born between 1970 and 1980 who isn't drawn to his magnetism on screen. I laughed as I read some of the reviews dissing him in this role, for anyone who saw Less than Zero, Chaplin, anything with his name attached knows he can transform before your eyes. That his troubled past contributed to the portrayal of this conflicted super hero is obvious. His face and dark gaze emote more than just some pompous actor putting on a suit. The humor and intelligence behind IronMan was a result of his collaboration with the director. Perfect: Love him, loved the movie - - although I agree it got very ""Transformers"" near the end. Terence Howard, on the other hand, was a bit wasted in this movie, but I chuckled near the end of the movie when he saw the second suite prototype. Also, he and Gwyneth had fantastic sexual chemistry. I was hard pressed to imagine her in a super hero movie as Pepper Pot, especially as his love interest. But each time they were on screen together you could tell she respected him and adored him as an actor, if not a person Cannot wait for the sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man Begins........,"I'm just back from the theatre, and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. There is nothing out-standing about it, and I don't really have the urge to go back and view it for a second time, I would however recommend everyone to go at least once and see it on the big screen.The Positives- Robert Downey Jnr is a rather dashing, and likable Tony Stark. His performance is assured and pretty much spot on.Special Effects are very much up to scratch, Iron Man looks awesome throughout his evolution on screen.Humour and tone. Lots of laugh out loud moments thanks to some sharp writing and some RDJ dead pan deliveries.The Plausibiltity factor, it almost feels (similiarly to Batman Begins) as if something like this is feasible (In the not too distant future). Yes its still fantasy but tangible fantasy.The Negatives- Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrace Howard and Mr Bridges all under-used, some terribly under-used.The action sequences could have been better. Not enough super hero at work scenes (They will be in part 2 I'm sure). The final battle I though was slightly weaker than it could and should have been considering the build up.Overall the positives out-weight the negatives, an enjoyable way to spend two hours. Not a patch on Batman Begins, but no other comic book movie has in my opinion, but its still way above average for a movie of this genre.7/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
surprisingly likable,"The superhero fad rolls on. Many were predicting that the comic-inspired flicks would burn out with Iron Man, but the wise decision to cast Robert Downey Jr. in the lead put paid to that theory. At this juncture in history, the man can do no wrong.The story is so familiar as to be a side-issue. Arms manufacturer Tony Stark has an epiphany after being taken hostage in Afghanistan. This brings him into conflict with company bigwig Jeff Bridges, whose bald pate is strangely if crudely menacing. Yes, it is another tale of ""You were like a father to me, but you've betrayed me,"" a la Minority Report, Mission Impossible, LA Confidential... But the obviousness of the plot is done in a nudge-wink style, as if to say ""Sit back and enjoy the action sequences and Downey riffing off in his own inimitable style."" And there is a lot to enjoy. Downey lights up every scene he is in. He is funny, intense, sardonic, passionate... The chemistry with Paltrow works extremely well, as does the homo-erotic undertone to Downey's relationship with Terence Davies. No doubt those two will get to scratch each other's eyes out in a sequel.I'm not sure the franchise has the legs of a Spiderman or Batman, but the initial outing is a fun ride if you are in the mood for light fare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not just another comic book movie!,"Well well well, the summer blockbuster season of 2008 is officially upon us! Things get started off rather well this year, and if this movie is any indication of whats to come later on, it could be quite enjoyable box office wise. Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. in the title role has just enough action, humor, and a little drama to keep you entertained and keep your butt planted firmly in the theater seat. Things start moving from the very beginning, and they don't slow down a whole lot, although there are some breaks for character development and humor intermittently throughout the film.We follow Tony Stark in his journey from carefree playboy billionaire to iron clad justice dispenser and the ups and downs along the way. Downey Jr. and the rest of the cast interact well and give the whole movie a measure of credibility. This is no Daredevil, Electra, or Ghost Rider, this movie delivers! There are several supporting good guys and bad guys but the conflict between the main two is very well done. Downey Jr. and a somewhat unrecognizable Jeff Bridges play well off each other, with Bridges being the serious sinister business man and Downey playing a sort of lighthearted funny genius. The special effects are great, the soundtrack is awesome and the cast superb! I wish I could say everything that I wanted to about this movie but I don't want to give to much away, SIT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING and I don't think you will leave the theater disappointed. Also, due to the somewhat political undertones in the scrip the movie might go over slightly better with adults rather than teenagers and younger but I still think everyone can enjoy.

Leaden,"The head of a company that makes national defense weapons is kidnapped by Arabs and develops an iron armor to escape, later using the suit to become a super hero. This film seems like a rehash of Batman and Spiderman except it is much worse than any film in those two series. The director's obsession with tedious special effects adds to the woes of an awful script. The climactic battle between Good Medium-Sized Iron Man and Bad Over-Sized Iron Man is utterly ridiculous.

The best original Marvel Action superhero film one of my favorite films of all time,"Iron Man (2008) is American Marvel Superhero Action film and the best one in the trilogy. It is my favorite best superhero film of all time that I love to death!!!
It has a great story great origin story about Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) how he become armored avenger ""Iron Man"". The movie has high-flying action sequence and super speed. Iron Man was build and not born. Excellent performance by Robert Downey Jr. as playboy billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man. The first movie in the trilogy is the best one it is my favorite MCU film it is also intelligent and interesting. How from an selfish, arrogant prick turns in to a good heart person who want to do the right thing to protect innocent and destroy the weapons his designed that fall in to terrorists hands.It begins in Afghanistan on a tour Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is captured by an enemy terrorist and is forced with Yinsen (Shaun Toub) is forced by terrorist known as ""Ten Rings"" to build in a cave Jericho missile who designed for American military that is his price for a freedom but Tony knows they want let him free so instead he builds an powered armor suit in their escape. But his friend Yinsen during the escape dies. In a battle of fire fight Tony Escapes and try's to destroy the rest of weapons. After returning home Tony Stark industrialist shut's down the factory of weapons and starts building high-tech suit of armor red and yellow color and vows to protect the world from treats as ""Iron man"". Tony finds out that he was betrayed by his friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who hired Tony's hit and Obadiah was the one who was selling weapons to the terrorist group. Iron Man must not only to protect our world he has to fight Iron Mongler on the end of the film in a suit that is Obadiah Stane. He goes back in to Afghanistan and destroys all his weapons and he defends the weakest people. He also has a blue heart in the chest because the shrapnel hits him.The film has great direction from Jon Favreau who also plays Happy Hogan Tony Stark's personal bodyguard. The music score for the first Iron Man is excellent from Ramin Djawadi who also made an excellent music for Prison Break TV Series. Great performance from Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts Tony's secretary and assistant I enjoy her performance. Terrence Howard is great and likeable as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes he was better as Don Cheadle. Paul Bettany as JARVIS voice was excellent I love hearing JARVIS advices to Tony. Jeff Bridges was super fantastic bad-guy as Obadiah Stane/Iron Mongler.Great action film and great action sequences watch in which Iron Man battles Iron Mongler best epic sequences ever. I am been a fan of Iron Man my whole life after seeing him in animated series and animated movies. I was such a huge fan of this movie that I want it to buy in the store DVD but I found only animated movie not this movie. After this film was released I become so excited about seen this film and I never expect how good it would turn too. Everyone from the cast at acting did an excellent 100% of them. It is an 10 year anniversary since this action masterpiece come out. Yes I am calling it a masterpiece cause I love it so much.The writing work so well with the actors with their roles. There's a lot of development into the writing and made relate to the comics. But of course the main that people loved this film is Robert Downey Jr. He killed it as Tony Stark and Iron Man. I couldn't see any other actor to take the role. He brings so much development and emotions into Tony and make you relate to him real easy.This movie get's 10 a perfect score is my favorite origin MARVEL superhero movie of all time the best one in the trilogy. From the special effects of the design. You have soundtrack AC/DC in this film ""Back In Black"" and Iron Man by Black Sabbath which I love those songs to death.The film isn't praised only for CGI, action sequences and acting it is praised for AC/DC soundtrack.

Intelligent Super-Hero Action,"4 May 2008. A step-above the normal superhero, in fact, this movie is more spoiled rich man with technology who discovers a conscience. This movie movie delivers a Robocop (1987) except bigger and larger but without the more poignant loss of Robocop's wife and family, delivers the Aliens (1986) scene of hi-tech individual warfare with the alien factor that actually provides a more intimate Civil War (1861-1864) angle, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) without the alien factor again. What Iron Man can't provide is due to its very nature - the everyman, common man perspective, a level that the mass audience can identify with as with the Spiderman franchise as well as the more personal relational boy-girl conflict. While Iron Man is truly intellectual with a conscience, that is what it remains whereas Spiderman focuses on the universal experience of all of us. Additional, unnecessary flashback sequence like with Batman Begins (2005) or even the more contemporary movie such as Made of Honor (2008) allows for the underdevelopment of the familial relationships important to the movie. So while Iron Man is worth its ticket, it allows some of the gloss to overlook the more important flash underneath. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Political look of Iron Man,"I wrote some political interpretations about this film. The whole text is here in my blogspot blog sceneinpolitics. It's far fetched, but I thought it would be fun to do. Here's a part of text:There is a lot of different political toposes and lot of different ways to analyze this film, but I will raise up couple of ideas that seems interesting for me.First is the films admiration of technology. It follows through every aspect of the movie: lets face it, Tony Stark or iron manis nothing without all that fancy gadgets and fire power. The people who achieves their goals are people with technology. Especially iron man: because he has superior technology, he can not be beaten. Iron man depicts technology as the reason for success and people without technology can't achieve as much. Technology is seen as a resource for power.But the movie doesn't only see technology as positive. Technology can make its users as dependent for it. Tony Stark literally can't live without technology: his body functions because of that weird shining light (shining light can be seen symbolizing life power and goodness: think about how for examples angels are usually imagined).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Faithful to the material, stunning special effects, amazingly well written, though the plot *might* be predictable (well...to fans of the comic book anyway), the execution was exceptional.I'm giving this a 9/10 just because I think they went a bit over the top with the ending. Other than that, you can't afford to miss this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
As expected.,"After seeing several commercials and trailers of Iron Man, the movies delivered just as expected. All the actors played a great part, except Gwyneth Paltrow - her performance shocked me. She played such a big part in the movie, but she just couldn't play her character good enough. If she had performed the movie would have been 10/10. Other than that.. Great effects, thrilling action and plenty of funny scenes. I didn't even know what Iron Man was before this movie.. So I can totally recommend this to anyone.One last thing.. The CGI effects really amazed me. I've compared Transformers to this movie, and there is a clear difference between the animation quality. Several scenes in Transformers look animated, however I couldn't spot any CGI 'errors' in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Perfecto!,"This movie is flawless! Robert Downey Jr. is reborn as the great actor he was before his... troubles. The story rocks, it is fast paced and coherent. Supporting characters are credible and actually add to the action.The time frame of the action is also pretty funny to look at, several items are straight out of 2008 but some aspects of the technology are light years away. It's fun to watch.The little flaw is the good'ole cliché of the Arab terrorists but it's not like nobody else does it.I'm counting days until #2 and I hope they're filming #2 and #3 back to back.I'll go see it again this week.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Lives up to the hype, and just might trigger even more hype for the sequel","To kick-start the 2008 blockbuster season is an enjoyable entertaining first look at Marvel's answer to DC's Batman. After years of begging, one of Marvel's more popular comic books appears on the big screen equipped with a stellar cast, massive budget, and drastic marketing campaign displaying how much more fun it is to follow the man in the metallic suit rather than the man in leather. Iron Man is a film that contains enough attitude and energy to intimidate other films of the same genre. Much like Batman Begins, Iron Man slowly but surely explains the origins of our hero and displays how and why he becomes the superhero that we all know. The only difference is Iron Man is simply a lot more fun and enjoyable to watch.The hero in this tale starts off a womanizing, sarcastic, selfish and carefree leader in a weapons manufacturing business. Tony Stark was trying to sell his latest greatest inventions overseas when suddenly he is kidnapped and is forced to manufacture weapons for the enemy. Right then and there he realizes that he's accidentally producing for the enemies as well as for the allies. Upon this revelation and being caught up in the middle of it, he crafts his greatest invention: which is a killing, nearly invincible machine full of ammunition and tricks. With a few major adjustments, this ultimate weapon becomes his new alter-ego, which is the heroic yet fearful Iron Man.Iron Man's biggest strength lies in the realism. Guess what, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not a flawless hero, he has his moments of questionable decisions, lack of morals, and inability to see some of the dangers he creates. His secretary (Gwyneth Paltrow) is not a mere toy for our hero, nor does she settle for Stark and all his flaws. The lack of attempt to make the superhero seem perfect is definitely a breath of fresh air when compared to recent comic book movies. To add to that, Iron Man is not a mindless action movie full of explosions and carnage; most of the movie focuses on Tony Stark and his transformation from carefree millionaire to protector of the general public. Using a great script from Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, the movie is sprinkled with great one-liners, good dialogue, and very little slow-down and unimportant moments.Robert Downey Jr. does an absolutely stellar job as Tony Stark, and fits the role perfectly. Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Terence Howard do pretty well with the material they were presented, with the exception of one scene that wasn't supposed to be funny (Bridges can't yell). Complimenting the acting is the special effects, which never overpowers the actors nor does it overpower the scene. When Iron Man is fighting, the only thing you can do is sit back and enjoy the wild ride. The special effects weren't the greatest, but they certainly got the job done. Unfortulately, the final fight wasn't that great because we witnessed robotic carnage to the nth degree last year in Transformers. Topping Spielberg and Michael Bay is never easy in terms of action pieces.What keeps Iron Man from becoming a comic book movie with the top-notch quality of the best comic book movies (My personal favorite is Spider-Man 2) is the fact that the main character and alter ego need time for presentation and introduction to the audience. The potential in the Iron Man franchise is not only immense, but it basically spills into the screen at all times, especially in the final moment after the credits. Iron Man is the beginning of something potentially very special. Spider-Man 2 had the advantage of us knowing the man behind the suit, and got the pass to deliver two hours of intense, emotional, and excellent film-making. Iron Man 2 can be the next Spider-Man 2, as long as the same amount of dedication and effort is put into the project.Bottom Line: In the meantime, we have one heck of a flick here, as Iron Man dwells beyond the typical comic book flick and delivers a great start to the 2008 summer movie season. Great acting, excellent special effects, and more promise for the future of Iron Man should be enough reason for you to see this. Even if you don't know a lot about the comic book, the movie does a great job in presenting the man behind the iron mask in all his glory (and anti-hero glory). Recommend, as the beginning of a great franchise is offered here.P.S. Except a killer soundtrack here too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really Surprised Me!!!!,"I usually hate Superhero movies, most of the times for the same reason: they don't seem believable. And that's a great thing about Iron Man, it involves only technology, so you'd believe stuff from the movie could happen in 50 or 100 years.The storyline is really well written, too. It begins when Tony Stark, a rich, playboy guy who owns a weapon industry, ends up as a hostage by terrorists using the same weapons he developed. When he manages to escape, he decides to destroy all weapons he created.Another remarkable thing about the movie is the acting, Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry together, and their romance, even though seems as if it was between ten years old kids because of their constant arguments, is really exciting and fun. Robert's character is really likable even though he's a total jerk, you feel as you actually wanted to be him.Well, that's pretty much it, so even if you don't like superhero movies, give this one a try, you might like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MY OPINION: Probably the best film ever made.,"2008. I wonder if it is just a co-incidence that Incredible Hulk, The Dark Knight and Iron Man (my top 3 movies of all time), all came in the year 2008. That was a time when the Golden Era of superhero movies was at it's most 'golden'. Each of these three films was magnificent. I often wonder that why films like these are so hard to make nowadays.Iron Man was a film the likes of which had never been seen before. It had that surprise element that superhero movies nowadays don't have, I had never ever seen anything like Iron Man when it came out. It truly was, the first of it's kind. Beautifully directed, wonderfully written, superbly acted and thoroughly entertaining, Iron Man was the film which could be watched again and again and again and again without being bored. It is probably the best film ever made, with the only movies in the same league as this one are The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Liked it.,"Iron Man is cool. It was great that they picked Robert Downey Jr to play the lead.Too often they choose very clean cut bland types and then the super hero movie becomes bland, with no interesting dimensions. That is why Spiderman was so popular as both a comic book and as a movie.The director did a great job of capturing the feeling of the Iron Man comic book series. The cinematography was really good and the scoring fit in just right.Nowadays, with all of the special effects that it requires to make a movie, Iron Man steps up to the plate and still keeps it interesting. Although, like many other cinema devices, computer generated effects will soon overstay its welcome. Audiences will probably again look for ""story."" Iron Man fulfilled it's promise to telling a good story. But big special effects projects beware - We're getting used to the effects, concentrate on story!I recommend Iron Man and am anxious to see where they go with a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Barely made it to the ending (my wife didn't),"I must be out of touch with modern pop culture because I have no idea how people can spend 2 hours watching movies like this, and the flood of top ratings and positive reviews on this site make this all the more mysterious. I was even more surprised that several friends and neighbors highly recommended the movie. So, my curiosity piqued, I watched it. Perhaps this negative bias overly influenced my reaction.Maybe it would have helped if I had been an avid fan of the comic book -- that seems to be necessary to accept the absurd back story. But I found the plot, story, characters, and cinematography to be unbearably predictable and far-fetched. I realize the movie is supposed to provide some indulgent escapism. But setting it in Afghanistan ruined this for me, which forced me to think about the terrible realities there. Setting it in a fictitious city like Gotham would have helped.Iron Man has a lot in common with Spiderman (not to mention the long list of formula superhero adaptations before it), but I enjoyed that movie much more, as it had a much more plausible human side, and a humble super hero main character is much more palatable to me than the smarmy Robert Downey Jr. who acted like he needed a good paddling.Despite a lot of dozing off and eye-rolling, the highlight in the movie for me was Gwyneth Paltrow, who is not only cute but did a marvelous job of acting the conflicted role of Stark's better half, and somehow didn't look ridiculous walking over piles of broken glass in 4 inch heels.Perhaps it is a comment on our culture that enormous sums of money are spent making and watching movies like this? Do we truly have nothing better to do with our collective time?",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very good superhero movie.,"When billionaire weapons maker Tony Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan, he builds a suit of iron to allow him to escape. When he discovers that the weapons his company make are being used against innocent civilians and American troops, he re-designs his suit to fight back.....I don't know that much about Iron Man and Tony Stark. I never read the comics on which the character is based. So going into this I had no expectations what I was about to see. And I'm glad as this is one of the best superhero movies so far.Robert Downey Jr, as Stark is clearly having a blast in the role. Stark comes over as a fun guy, more interested in designing the weapons than ever really thinking about them being used, but when his eyes are opened up after his capture, you do see the change in the character.The rest of the cast are also pretty good, with special mention to Jeff Bridges, Terence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow. In a way the casting here is similar to the approach taken by Batman Begins, in that they have gone for good actors as opposed to big name stars.In fact, the plot of this movie is structured in a similar way to Batman Begins. Both movies don't show the hero in his 'proper' costume until nearly an hour into the movies, and both start with a smaller threat before engaging the main villain in the movie.The visuals and CGI by Industrial Light and Magic are superb. The only criticism I have about them, and it's a minor flaw only, is that the final confrontation between Iron Man and his opponent is very similar to Transformers. This is understandable giving it is two men fighting in metal suits, and as I said, only a minor flaw.Jon Favreau is a curious choice of director. Not known for making big budget action movies, he acquits himself well. As I said, it the casting helps, and he draws excellent performances from them, and the action is also impressive.While this movie is not quite up to the brilliance of Batman Begins (in my opinion the superhero movie against all others are judged), it is an impressive origin story of a hero, and you do hope that any sequels are just as good.Oh, and if you do go see this, stay until after the credits.... there's a nice little scene for fans!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Robert Downey, as usual, rocks this film!","Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film. Say what you will about his repeat trips to rehab and his ""Hollywood Bad Boy"" persona, but this is an actor who was truly born to play the title role. You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were ad-libbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home. Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen. He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I liked the action, and the CGI holds up extremely well.My only problem is its length, maybe just cut 10 minutes out of it.Overall, it has risks, balanced humor, neat supporting cast and a good protagonist and antagonist.A pretty good movie that redefined both the superhero genre and Robert Downey Jr's career.7.8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Downey Jr. is perfectly cast in a film that is better than expected,"There is really little to say about the plot of Iron Man that most people do not already know about. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is an obnoxiously wealthy CEO of a US weapons manufacturing company who is taken hostage in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. He manages to create an armoured suit he wears to escape his terrorist captors, and returns to the US a changed man.I was a little apprehensive getting hyped up over Iron Man. I was never a huge fan of the character, and with Jon Favreau at the wheel, it did not exactly sound like it was going to be as great as other comic book films like X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins or the Spider-Man sequels (my personal favourite remains Tim Burton's Batman from '89). But rather impressively, the film is much better than I think anyone could have expected.For one, Stark's characterization is a little more rounded than most. Much like Bruce Wayne, he is not really a superhero by the standard definition, but more someone who becomes one. He has the skeletons in the closet, he is a womanizing prick, and he's a border-line (if not full blown) alcoholic. He is not shown as in-depth as Batman was in Batman Begins, but the work put into his evolvement is much better than a typical comic book film.It also helps that Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Stark. I do not think anyone could have pulled him off anywhere near as well. He has just the right amount of cynicism, sarcasm and wit to make the character truly memorable. Any fan of the character, or anyone just looking for an actor putting in the work needed for his character to be believable should look no further. Downey Jr.'s own sketchy past only helps make his portrayal even more credible of someone living the high life, and then re-evaluating themselves and changing to be a better person. It almost speaks as a bit of a metaphor for his own journey, and makes his work here that much more personal. His wounded eyes speak volumes for him and the character.Unfortunately, as far as origin stories usually go, there is not a lot of room for the supporting characters to shine. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts, but Terrence Howard's Jim Rhodes is very much underused. We know of his importance to the story, but he never truly overcomes the flaw of just being a smarter and more successful tokin' black guy we all know from the years of stereotypes. He sets himself up for future installments, but I think his dialogue could have been fleshed out to be a little more useful than it is here. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is another underused character, but Bridges manages to chew up a lot of scenery when he is on-screen. I think this may be his most involved and most fun performance since The Big Lebowski.The story itself is another great thing about the film, because it is nowhere near as far-fetched as most origin stories. While the creation of some of the more scientific elements may seem preposterous, its real world basis makes it miraculously relevant to the current war time events going on as we speak. This is a character who could only work after 9/11, and coming out now is probably the best move any studio could have ever made. Stark's story is one for this generation, and I think by not glossing anything over, the filmmakers have done justice to a character who cannot be any timelier. I also like that it focused a lot of attention on the meticulous work he does creating the suit, and showing his little failures along the way. The humour injected into a lot of scenes is also very well done.If anything at all, it could have used a bit of editing here and there however, shaving some time off in Afghanistan and the suit creations (as much as I liked them). Some of the dialogue is a little off as well (especially with Howard's character), and could have been tightened to better effect. I realize that these portrayals are based off comic book characters, but that does mean their dialogue automatically needs to be cheesy, or so silly that it needs to be funny.The special effects are another marvel, making the preposterous science elements seem even more real. Just watching the scene where Stark is trying out his suit's flying capabilities before creating the rest of the suit may be enough to make the film's imaginative structure look authentic. Yes, it does have a few moments where it looks fake and could have used more work, but for the most part, this may be the most fully rendered and realistic looking comic book character to date (in the realm of relying heavily on CGI of course).And as for Favreau, I was very impressed with the way the film handles itself. He truly kept it on the rails, and did not let its ambitiousness become too much for him. Yes, there are flaws, and yes, the film is imperfect. But for someone whose name I doubt could have ever been synonymous with creating action-orientated films before (not counting the family fantasy Zathura), Favreau has truly outdone himself. He has brought a complex character to the big screen, and has created one of the strongest comic book films to date. As I said earlier, I had my apprehensions, but his work here can only lead to bigger and better things.From its startling opening all the way up to its action infused finale, Iron Man is great film in every respect and one hell of a start for the summer movie season. It has its flaws, but the finesse of the story and the lead character make it truly memorable.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Where's the action?,"I don't think I need to explain who Tony Stark is, or what the plot is about (that's a very simple - a little too much for my taste - and straightforward ""good vs evil"" story) but I'll still sum it up for those unfamiliar with the Marvel characters. The others can skip to the third paragraph!This is the story of billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Downey), kidnapped in the middle East and forced to build WMDs for a mysterious terrorist group. Instead, and with the help of his fellow captive (Shaun Toub) he builds an armor and escapes. From now on, he vows to protect the people he put in harm's way under his new alias: Iron Man.First, the good points: this is a light-hearted (sometimes a little too much, leaning on silliness at times) blend of comedy and action that doesn't take itself seriously. It's definitely more ""Fantastic Four"" than ""Daredevil"" or ""X-Men"". The jokes aren't always hilarious, or delivered with efficiency, but it holds up pretty well. The abundant CGI is overall as good as last year's Transformers and the use of music is very well done.Now, for the problems: WHERE'S THE DAMN ACTION??? Every bit of action is present in the trailers, there are no surprises at all, no big scene kept under wraps till the movie opens. There are only three action scenes with the armor on, and all of them are frustrating for being way too short, barely having the time to gain momentum before stopping. Then, the story: like I said earlier it's a little simplistic and lacks depth. They try to convey more emotional weight with the comedians but the director Jon Favreau is so ham fisted and demonstrative, and the actors' performances lack so much nuance - especially Downey and Bridges, which saddens me a little as they are two of my favorite actors - than it just gets in the way of the action sequences and adds even more frustration. It's like those scenes stretch for twice their real time before the action finally unveils... More worrying: the striking similarities with ""Batman Begins"" (the detention, the use - with much less mastery - of the flashback device, the realistic approach and (too) long scenes of the hero testing his abilities) and the new ""Hulk"" movie (the bad guy is just a bigger, meaner version of the hero) give the movie a seriously clichéd tone. Nothing truly original.All in all, it's a decent comedy adventure with some campy undertones and a serious lack of action and fresh ideas. A good appetizer for those who wait patiently every year for the summer movies to open. The others can wait for the DVD that'll allow them to skip the boring parts.2 1/2 stars - out of *****",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man An Entertaining Comic Book Movie,"When I went to see Iron Man I wasn't expecting much but this film surpassed my expectations thanks to a knock out the park performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark. In tradition of ""Batman Begins"" this movie tells the story of how billionaire industrialist and genius inventor Tony Stark becomes the high tech armored superhero Iron Man. Downey Jr. delivers a great performance and he owns the role from his very first scene just as Christian Bale did as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins and the late Heath Ledger did as Batman's arch nemesis the Joker in the sequel The Dark Knight. He's perfect for the role of Stark making you believe a man like him could really exist. The rest of the cast also turn in terrific performances including Terrence Howard as Tony's best friend Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane and later Iron's Man nemesis known as Iron Monger, and Gwenyth Paltrow as Tony's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. The film may be a bit light on action but what it does have is character development plus lots of humor, drama, some suspense, and thrills. The action sequences are well choreographed and most of them happen toward the second half of the film. The special effects are fantastic especially when Tony puts on the suit and becomes Iron Man. Jon Favreau the director and actor did a great job of bringing the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man to the big screen. The battle between Iron Man and Iron Monger at the end did feel a bit anti-climatic and a bit rushed but fortunately the good more than outweighs the films tiny flaws. Because other then that Iron Man was definitely much better than I thought it would be and now I'm looking forward to see what they have in stored for the sequel.

"Well made, well acted and never campy.","Iron Man - Billionaire playboy/weapons designer Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) suffers a mortal wound and has a change of heart (literally) after he is abducted by terrorists in Afghanistan. After seeing his own weapons used against him and innocents, Tony Stark creates several armor suits to escape his captors and become...Iron Man.Now this is what I'm talking about! This movie is badass. I would have to see it a few times over, but I think it may have a notch over Spiderman 2. This movie made me feel like a 13 year old, watching the Spiderman movie with glee. Origin stories are boring unless you do them right, but it is terribly fun to watch Tony Stark transform himself technically and mentally into Iron Man. And there are several (very well done) action scenes, but it never feels over the top or too much. They always leave you wanting more, which is a good thing. It's such a great feeling every time he puts on the suit.Robert Downey Jr. has done a commendable job. He is quirky, hilarious and entirely believable without ever stepping into the dangerous camp zone, as Marvel movies are prone to do. He has me believing that a man with more money than God and the coolest suit of armor ever could have problems. Everyone else turns in a good performance, and especially Jeff Bridges. I never got to see him do anything villainous before, but his performance as Obadiah Stane is quite chilling. Even Stan Lee's cameo is actually funny this time (I thought he left Marvel. huh.) Looking forward to Terrence Howard's extended part as War Machine, as he's kinda stinted in this one. It's mostly Robert Downey Jr.'s movie, and he sells it.I've never been much of an Iron Man fan (I do like the Ultimate Universe comics involving him though) and only saw Robert Dwoney Jr. in Zodiac prior to this. I'll have to watch his other film. He's fantastic. See the film whether you're an Iron Man fan or if you're not. If you read comics, if you don't. It's a very GOOD FILM regardless, and easily accessible. I can't wait to see it again. It'll almost make you believe a man can fly.

Duuuunn---duuun---da-da-daaahhh,"Yeah!This movie was flamboyantly ROCKIN'!!Robert Downey Jr's quickly-delivered one-liners were barbed with bite by marvelous Marvel scriptwriters, and Downey's delivery was as impeccable as his Malibu house.**SPOILER ALERT**The story begins crisply as Tony Stark's military escort in the Mideast sands is ambushed by terrorists. This scene is swift, and very realistic for this type of flick.Then, we get a major flashback which uploads tons of information on Tony Stark's character, career, and friendships. Here, we get big bang for the buck invested in this background.A mini-story then transpires, giving us a glorious new beginning for the man of iron, including a terrific technical segment long enough to linger, and short enough to keep our attention. Here, Tony also receives his motivations for the remainder of the movie.After a battle royale, and rescue (I don't want to give away too many details), Tony Stark continues constructing an updated version of the suit.Engaging enemies in foreign lands, and taking to the skies like a rousing rocket, Iron Man is born!Of course, Iron Man meets a formidable enemy, but it won't be who you think it is.Other great aspects to this movie are a generous portion of good-natured and true humour, a very believable Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, an unobtrusive Cuba Gooding Jr, great Lucasfilm robotics, and a cool music score.Now, some bad points:(1) Iron Man's major foe has two question marks which are not explained - namely, how can the foe exist if the technology is not backwards-compatible with Tony Stark's creation? and how can the foe be formidable without any experience with the technology?(2) Major explosions generally cause great damage, injury, and loss of life, yet the finale will have you scratching your head as to realism in these things.However, these negatives aside, ""Iron Man"" was worth the price of admission.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The story... not the original one: the characters and acting...terrific!,I have seen the movie a couple of times to find moments if any of the actors 'acted'(other than being the character they should be) in the movie and i couldn't find a mini second of failure. Especially Downey... outstanding performance for this kind of movie.When you look at other super hero movies the starring actor or actress generally cannot reflect the character they should be which is -i think- a huge failure of the director.Downey here portraits who Tony Stark is. I have to admit that the story is not even close to the original story but it is a fine adjustment in todays political and military issues. and also Tony Stark character is almost recreated in the movie.The supporting characters were also well chosen starting with Stane(Bridges) and Rhodey(Howard) and continues with Pepper Potts (Paltrow).The visual effects of the movie...It was also another thing that stunned me.

One of the better Superhero movies,"I always liked Iron Man growing up but I thought it was ripe for having ""Hollywood types"" mess it up. I am very happy that this movie was not messed up and it delivered on all counts as far as I am concerned. It did not have a lot of WOW or incredible stuff but it surely met my expectations and with the movies I have been seeing lately, that is a pretty good accomplishment.Some Superhero movies were terrific and were like watching a comic book. Spiderman had to be the best but Batman Begins was also extremely good. On the other end, you have things like Electra, Superman Returns, Ang Lee's Hulk and the other ones that seem to forget they are about a comic book character so we do not need tons of backstory. Say someone is self-centered and maybe one scene with it and it becomes a given. Don't spend valuable screen time showing us over and over or writing lengthy speeches. Film it like a comic book.Here Robert Downey Jr. shows again that he is one of the most talented actors around and I could not imagine anyone else playing Tony Stark better. Tony's selfishness and genius combined with his desire to take nothing seriously but everything for granted just shines through. I understand that much of the dialogue was ad-libbed and if so, they did a really good job of being smart and sassy. One of the toughest things in a superhero movie is the villain because with the first movie, you have to have a villain that is quick and easy to get into action since most of your time is taken with the origin story. Superman movies keep trying to involve Lex Luthor and he is a complex villain that just begs for lots of screen time. Spiderman did great with Green Goblin and Batman Begins was brilliant to use 2 lesser known villains. Here, the Iron Monger is certainly not one of Iron Man's most notable foes but, as in Batman Begins, his motivation and story intertwines so well with the hero that you are not losing any story telling time. He was the perfect villain with the perfect motivation for this movie. A villain like Mandarin would be great but that is for a later movie where there is time to tell more of the villains story and set up more things. Here, we get lots of how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man and changes his outlook and how he developed that marvelous armor.As with most movies I have seen in the theaters lately, there were the annoying people talking to the screen and one another throughout the movie. If there is anything that will kill the cineplex, it not going to be DVDs and home theaters, it will be these inconsiderate fellow patrons who cannot understand that they are not sitting in their living room. Combine that with the skyrocketing cost of tickets and concessions and even I am starting to prefer to watch movies at home. This is one movie though that really benefits from the large screen though because for Iron Man, you need big sound and big pictures. As it should be.Go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good story ... Nice effects!,"This movie combines a good story with some nice special effects. The result is an action-packed movie that is fun to watch. Now, it's not without its flaws - but it's not easy doing ""yet-another"" superhero movie either. Fortunately for audiences, the overall result is strong.Basically, Iron Man is about a billionaire businessman and weapon scientist who has a change of heart after he is injured in a war zone. He develops a new energy source and body armor that give him the ability to fight terrorists - especially those who are using weapons he helped develop. But things turn out to be a little more complicated than they seem ...If you like special effects - this movie has scenes that won't disappoint. The body armor / suit looks pretty cool and the flying sequences are outstanding. (There's an older movie called the ""Rocketeer"" which had similar scenes, but didn't capitalize enough on them enough like this movie).Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow all do great acting jobs - especially Jeff Bridges, whose performance is superb. While the editing and some aspects of the plot seem a bit too rushed at times, the overall movie succeeds anyway.It's hard to think about who would 'not' enjoy at least something in this movie - so it's pretty easy to state that this one's worth seeing for just about everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More than matched my expectations.,"Outside of Batman Begins, it's my favorite superhero movie and Downey Jr. gives my favorite performance in said genre. He took his normal hilarious personality and charisma, which works incredibly well for the character, and added touches of internal angst in the struggle of trying to make right for all the wrongs he has committed in his life. It works well as a character study of this complex man, and as a massively entertaining blockbuster. One of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while, and Downey Jr. kills once again. The action sours high, the characters are rich and the entire ensemble gives good support to the man of the hour. It really is Downey's film; nobody could capture this essence so perfectly and I don't think there's an actor around who I enjoy performing more than him. It's ridiculous that he actually had to fight for this role, because he is just too perfect. I'd go into more detail, but you get the picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am the Iron Man,"Iron Man was a pretty good movie. It is obvious that Robert Downey Jr has found his true calling. He is a very convincing super hero. I am not a comic book fanatic and don't really know much about the history of Iron Man. However, you don't need to know this to really enjoy the movie. A barely recognizable Jeff Bridges plays a big part in this movie. His head is shaved yet his voice sounds pretty much like ol' Jeff Bridges. There are a few corny scenes in this movie that include Terrence Howard. Yes, there is a scene where he looks at a very shiny Iron Man outfit and says ""another time"". In other words this movie is being set up for a SEQUEL! Movie purists will scoff at the scene when Iron Man FLEW from the United States into Afghanistan beat up a few people and then came back. Purists will question how HE DID THIS? How did he go to the bathroom while flying that distance? Or how about when he was testing out his flight suit and was body slammed against the wall at about 70 MPH? He didn't even get INJURED? Also, that funky looking FAKE HEART that was installed in his chest was not fully explained. All in all, a great movie. Not enough special effects. This isn't like Batman when there is a lot of crime fighting. There were a few scenes when it would have been appropriate for Jack Bauer to show up, especially when that bald terrorist was going to make that one guy CHEW on a RED HOT ROCK. Sheesh, talk about a horrible method of torture!! Two thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
marvelous Marvel,"With ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", Marvel has finally arrived at a top form of the superhero movie. Granted, as Roger Ebert noted, that its themes are not as multi-layered as the Ang Lee version, nor its characters as complex and ambivalent (Bruce Banner: ""When it happens, when it comes over me, when I totally lose control  I like it.""), I still prefer this Hulk incarnation precisely because it does not take itself too seriously, and simply delivers a popcorn movie with a tight plot, wit and humor, and, dare I say, ample CGI whizz-bang.Critics who complain about the lack of investment in meaning and psychology have obviously not read comic books. Not that such works are deficient in meaning, rather, they generate it differently, than say the realism of 19th century novels. Comic books do not aspire to realism, but rather to formula and stereotyping (cartoon), much like soap operas. They are most effective when their audience recognize the class of forms they are citing: ""this is the part where the bad guy gets his just desserts"", and exactly how he gets ithow the premise was set up and the story cleverly toldis what makes or brakes the deal.This is precisely my frustration with the first two X-men moviesthey were too solemn, too much trying to make a point, too busy filling their cup with meaning extraneous to propelling the narrative. They felt too held-back, saddled, as if reluctant in being superhero movies. ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"", on the other hand, joyfully embraced the genre, dropped all pretensions of meaning, and delivered the comic book goods.(This review also appeared in stickslip.wordpress.com as ""'The Incredible Hulk': Marvelous Marvel"")",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man...Best Marvel Movie Yet,"I just watched a preview screening of Iron Man last night and i must say it's the best Marvel Comics movie yet.I am a comic reader and work in a comic shop as well and must say i am very critical of comic movies.But this one has it all.Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this part.There are big laughs,tons of action,great acting and overall just kicked ass. The CGI in the movie was done very well,not fake at all.The casting was right on,no crappy actors.No corny scenes like some other Marvel movies(Ghost Rider,X-Men,Fantastic Four,etc.).I really hope now that Marvel has control of most of it's movies now that the Iron Man will continue with putting out quality Iron Man sequels.Definitely one of my Top 5 must see movies of the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

IRON MAN Excellent,"Iron Man is an excellent movie. Jon Favreau did a good job on the direction. Everybody will enjoy the movie. The director is also in his movie.

I wish i could have a suit like this and fly with the speed of sound. Seeing Jeff Bridges bald was a shock for me but he looks good with it. He is the right actor to play the Iron Monger.

Back when Marvel actually cared,Still is the best MCU film. Tony Stark actually has a backstory unlike all other Marvel characters and decent motivation. Good action and VFX.

"Tries very hard, but fails to come off as truly memorable","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningTony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the world's most renowned arms manufacturers/sellers, who is able to live a funky, eccentric lifestyle on the back of the success of his Stark Industries company. But this all changes when he goes to Afghanistan to show off his latest weapon and is taken hostage by terrorists and forced to build a weapon for them. Instead, he builds a super-hero suit and uses it to break free and go back to America, where he reveals a change of heart in relation to his profession and tries to aim his talents more at peace than war. But this doesn't go down well with his boss Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who's only worried about the profits they will lose now Tony no longer wants to make weapons. And when Tony learns that his company has been making under-handed deals with the men who held him captive, he uses the super-hero suit he made once again and becomes Iron Man. But his corrupt boss has ideas of his own in regards making his own super-hero suit...You can always count on a good super-hero film to fill in the obligatory summer blockbuster slot in the filmic year, and this year we have this adaptation of one of Marvel Comic's truly lesser known creations, which just shows how far towards the bottom of the barrel we're scraping. An ambitious piece that seems to have caught onto the trend of making extra long summer blockbusters, this tries to invest a lot of unnecessary depth and characterization into a story that's ultimately not worth the effort.It just feels overlong instead of something really special. Okay, Iron Man isn't your typical action hero. He doesn't just magically get his super powers like Superman or Spider-Man, we see him struggle to get his super-suit to work, failing to guide it properly and make the special gadgets work, but the whole piece just feels overly labourious, with an uninvolving, predictable script that fails to rise out the ground.Cast wise, in the lead role, Downey Jr. is an odd but admittently effective choice, a snazzy, cynical anti hero who slowly sees through his own BS but he's just not enough to keep the whole boat afloat. Bridges is also a decent choice as the villain, but the weak script fails to make the most out of him, while in support rising star Terrence Howard goes through the motions as a comic relief Air Force colonel and Gwyneth Paltrow is noticeable as a personal assistant with a ridiculous name.All these type of films just seem so manufactured nowadays, with so much back story stretching them out so long and enough publicity to guarantee a great opening weekend and an obligatory equally inferior sequel a year or so later. For all it's quantity instead of quality, Iron Man truly has an Iron Soul. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
3 Words: KICK A** MOVIE,"I'm not bothering to write a page long summary of the movie...IRON MAN kicks a**!!! Whereas recent Marvel movies sucked at best (Blade Trinity, FF: both of em, X-Men: the last stand - Brett Ratner should've never been allowed to direct and Ghost Rider - same goes for Mark Steven Johnson) this one truly delivers the goods even though i have to admit I was unsure about Jon Faverau at first.Whatever you've seen in the trailer - The film is 10 times better unlike the afore mentioned outings where I almost feel robbed of my money. Robert Downey Jr. is a revelation as Iron Man he gives Christian Bales/Batman a serious run for his money.That said I'm looking forward to the Invincible Hulk again after Ang Lee made him look like a chubby something in the mental state of an 3year old.To put it simple Batman ain't got s*** on Iron Man!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Righteous Flight!,"Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a modern day DaVinci, tinkering with his gadgets while his weapons company happily builds and supplies the most modern and devastating of killing machines to the highest bidder. And he is a playboy to boot, ignoring the ever faithful Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), and flitting from babe to babe. Then the unthinkable happens - he is shot up with shrapnel, kidnapped, and confronted with the cost of his company's business ventures. He needs a battery powered magnetic device in his chest to keep the shrapnel from entering his heart and is forced by his kidnappers to build a destruction device. But what emerges is a breathtaking Iron Man!! Of course there are whys and buts when he gets back. And since he is a Marvel comics character he has to undo all the wrong his company had been doing. There is a baddie who is bigger than the Iron man. Many breathtaking flights and shoot-ups later, good does triumphs over evil and all is well with the world!Iron Man works because of Robert Downey Jr. He injects just the right amount of wryness, urbanity and mischief into the role to make the Iron man much more than a mere superhero. Gwenyth is decent in a small and undetailed role. Jeff Bridges is very great in a larger than life role.

Tony Starks: Bruce Wayne with Joker attitude,"As the hype built and built leading up to this movie I slowly began to buy into it. I was never a big Avengers/Iron Man fan so I did not have any huge expectations for this film. In fact, I didn't even expect that I would watch it until it came out on DVD. Well, I buckled and fell victim to the hype... and I couldn't be happier.Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job as Tony Starks. Tony Starks was a very captivating character, far more than a Peter Parker, Bruce Banner, or even Bruce Wayne. That brought the movie more to life when there was no action going on.The second part, and maybe the most important part of the movie (that being the action) was done well and in the right dosage. Even the MacGyver style of build up with the gadgets, doo-dads, and inventions helped fill space brilliantly. I must say that I saw significant parallels and similarities between Iron Man and Robocop 2 (another movie I happen to love).All in all this movie was a pleasant surprise, the best comic book movie since X-Men: The Last Stand.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
awesome,"Comic book adapted films just don't get any better than this. And this isn't your casual viewer talking. Iron Man, or 'shell head' as he was nick-named in the marvel comics, was a huge icon for me in my formative years. I was an avid marvel comics geek when I was a kid (not so much in my twenties and thirties thank goodness) and Iron Man was my favorite book of them all. So the jump to big screen for this one meant a lot to me.Well let me tell you, Favreau didn't disappoint this die-hard. All the main elements of Stark and his world were depicted in an electrifying, larger than life, accessible in relation to today's societal/technological climate, manner. Sure, fantastic enough, but somehow made believable...well, believable enough to enjoy immensely anyway.The character development was crisp and the plot moved along at a spanking pace. There was not a wasteful moment in the story-telling. The effects were dazzling... and easy on the eyes since CGI rigid bodies (namely things made of metal) always look more realistic than flowing, organic forms.Watch this and love it like it did!

Also Robert Downey Jr. played his role well but they entire script was very corny and unrealistic.

Iron Man Rocks,"""Iron Man"" is great. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. I was completely surprised by Director Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"". ""Iron Man"" never struck me as the most compelling superhero, after all his powers derived from the high tech metal suit. Despite the army of screenwritersMark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, ""Iron Man"" evokes spectacular visual excitement and a great character arc. Downey at the beginning is so out there as hysterically arrogant billionaire CEO Tony Stark, who asks at a demonstration of his latest Stark Industries weapon, ""Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?"" In dramatic transformation as hero, Downey later poignantly confesses to Pepper Potts (beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow), ""I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."" Robert Downey Jr. has always been his generation's most talented actor. It is gratifying to see him back, recovered, and at the peak of his powers.Yes, ""Iron Man"" is perhaps the coolest cutting edge technology display. However, it is Downey's masterfully balance of comedic and dramatic power that amazes. He is also supported by great actorsOscar winners and nominees. Terrance Howard plays Col. Jim Rhodes, who is Tony Stark's Government liaison, is smart and quietly solid. Gwenyth Paltrow plays to her strength in her light comedic romantic role. She is brilliant and charmingly goofy as Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. Jeff Bridges is the charismatic dark force of Obadiah Stane, Stark's partner at Stark Industries, whose true intentions are murky. All this and watching Iron Man jet super sonic in the heavens makes this one the year's best and coolest movies.Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is boy genius from M.I.T., who is now CEO of his late father's Stark Industries. Stark Industries is the world's largest Defense Contractor, and Stark himself is anointed the ""Merchant of Death"". His father's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges) remains Tony's business partner and confidant. In a weapons demonstration trip gone amok in Afghanistan, Stark is mortally wounded, and held hostage by ""freedom fighters"". Along with fellow prisoner Yinsen (strong and endearing Shaun Toub), Stark rigs an ingenious power generator for his damaged heart that keeps him alive. At the same time, he creates the prototype ""Iron Man"" to affect his escape. This forever alters and transforms Stark, who now honors the words of Yinsen, ""Don't waste your life.""Returning back home Stark announces to the world, while eating a cheeseburger, that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons of mass destruction, much to the chagrin of Obadiah. Stark secretly develops the ""Iron Man"" suit for himself at his ostentatiously high tech Malibu estate. Stark comically and intensely works on the crimson and gold ""Iron Man"" amidst his Audi sports cars and cool cyber toys. Downey looks great bulked up, and artistically executes physical comedy genius. Here Paltrow brings her best. Her Pepper feigns disinterest in Stark, but her unquestioned loyalty hints at her true feelings. Downey as Stark also plays brilliant and aloof, who finally gets a clue about making a difference in life and Pepper. They are so amazing and funny together. Bridges as Obadiah emerges as the visceral threat. Of course ""Iron Man"" veers into darker conspiracy, and the battle of good against great evil. Director Favreau orchestrates the CGI battle with pathos and style. ""Iron Man"" at its best is visually breathtaking.""Iron Man"" is one the year's best movies and Robert Downey Jr. returns with a spectacularly multidimensional and powerful performance. What Downey does is not conventionally acknowledged with awards, though it really warrants it. The special effects particularly the Iron Man rendering is so cool. ""Iron Man"" has a strong story and great actors. See ""Iron Man"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I enjoyed it back in 2008...,"So, this is how it all started for Tony Stark/Iron Man in films. This Marvel superhero film is different to other superhero films in the sense that our hero is human, making the film more realistic. He is simply a genius weapons developer who utilized his brain power and designs to save his life. Although the film is presented as pure fantasy, the storytelling made it look very possible. At the rate technology develops at the moment, 'Iron Man' will potentially become reality soon, instead of fantasy...Tony Stark is a very wealthy businessman. The film starts in Afghanistan, where Stark give a weapons demonstration to potential buyers. Antagonist Raza (Faran Tahir) wants the design for himself and compromises the demonstration and takes Stark captive. With limited space and time but a wealth of knowledge, Stark builds the Iron Man suit. He soon realizes his design can be used for doing good, hence becoming a superhero.Stark can't fly without his suit. He has no firepower without his suit. In fact, he has no powers at all without his suit. He is just a man - with a fancy pacemaker gadget in his chest that keeps him alive. This made me root for him as a superhero, and as a man. There's also a love story that felt natural. The love interest comes in the form of Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) who has been Stark's right hand (figuratively speaking, off course) for some time.The visual effects are good, and the action sequences well choreographed. There's a twist towards the end, when the film presents us with another villain we probably never saw coming.I enjoyed 'Iron Man' when I first saw it. It is a stylish action thriller with interesting characters.Would I watch it again? No. And here's why: when I first saw 'Iron Man', I loved it. However, watching it now I'm not a fan anymore. This is mainly due to the character crossing over to so many Marvel movies since this film (Avengers, Spider-Man...). As a result, I lost interest in the character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Shiny, entertaining and a great cast, but this is nevertheless a disappointing experience.","IRON MAN is the latest superhero-movie in cinemas, and it's another round of man-turned-into-amazing-powerhouse with CGI, love interests, a full on CV-cover-up and mayhem. And this is the first Marvel-child that's fully financed by Marvel Studios, and being a blockbuster it's surprising how they've chosen such a bold casting and choice of director; surely, casting Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is interesting even before you've seen the teaser, Gwyneth Paltrow as the smart and sexy assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges villain Obadiah - and director Jon Favreau seemingly came out of nowhere.The film opens up with twinkling ice-cubes in whiskey, and soon the high-flying main character Tony Stark gets blown up by his own weapons as he gets locked-up for three months by Afghanan guerrillas to build a missile, instead he and his temporary sidekick makes Stark RoboCop 2: the Rusty & Deserted Sequel, as Stark shoots his way out of danger and returns to his glossy everyday - but now, as a changed man. The near-death experience kick-starts his goal for becoming Iron Man - but as soon as Stark adds the hot-red colors to his suit, the movie loses momentum; this is where Iron Man actually starts, so we're expecting something spectacular, but instead we get messy. Director Favreau is funky, and he knows how to squeeze every little drop of cool and swagger from Downey Jr., but as the action-bits starts coming, they're too brief and feels like a lackluster. IRON MAN's surely got potential, and the soul of the movie is surely in here, but a sequel that's right-on explosive is surely the right way to go from here.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

The pithy one liners fly back and forth, the practical & visual effects are seamlessly integrated and the secondary characters all decent. Aside, that is, from the insidious cardboard cut-out Taliban-like fundamentalists! It could have had more action maybe, but I think they are leaving a trump card when it comes to the inevitable-and welcomed- sequel. Jeff Bridges fleshes out a fairly straight forward,""I thought you were on my side"" bad guy part. The other supporting cast of Paltrow and Howard are also very likable.

Moral behavior sometimes takes courage.,"Excuse me while I recover from the shock and amazement caused by my extreme surprise that this is an excellent movie. I expected the usual vacuous Hollywood hokum with the usual Hollywoodish heavy handed combination of outlandish special effects masking a superficial story and two-dimensional characters and instead was treated to an actual well-acted, well-crafted science fiction story with actual character development within the framework of an interesting plot. Robert Downey gives a marvelous, surprisingly powerful performance as a hugely wealthy, arrogant arms merchant who undergoes a major personality transformation - for the better. This movie is entertaining from start to finish and is worth watching.This movie is, for Hollywood, a rare combination of special effects extravaganza combined with a substantive story that actually has some dramatic content. This movie dramatizes the problems caused by industrial activity that gains profits through war and how special interests can completely drive and distort a country's foreign policy. That there are some in our society who reap huge profits off the suffering of others is a sad commentary, which is a theme of this movie. The Iron Man is representative of what happens when someone decides to take the high moral road. To survive, the main character has to literally wear a suit of hard metal to fend off the attacks from those whose profiteering schemes are now threatened.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron man rocks!,"Iron Man, based on the MArvel comics character, is a fun ride from start to finish. Robert Downey Jr. does a good job and Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly appealing as his assistant, ahem-Pepper Potts. The effects are really good and the score, which features AC/DC and Black Sabbath, is first rate.That's not to say it doesn't run out of gas about halfway in, that the middle section of the film is really boring. Hey if I wanted to watch someone work with a computer all day, I got to the Microsoft office!! The giant robot climax is pretty silly too. Still kudos to Jon Favreau for a good sense of humor here. You can't possibly take a comic book film too seriously and he doesn't. Downey has lots of fun with that, I did feel though that he never really takes Tony Stark beyond that playboy we meet in the first five minutes. Also I love Jeff Bridges, but what was he doing in this, Obie is such a moron! Any thinking bad guy would've iced Pepper when he found her in his office. I mean c'mon!! At least he rebounded with ""Crazy Heart"", but sheesh.Iron Man is pretty good action, despite it's flaws and it's miles above pretentious nonsense like ""Unbreakable"".

Best Movie to be release so far in 2008,"I am currently an employee at a movie theatre right now and let me tell you with the acception of a select few films this year most of the movies that have come out this year have sucked. Iron Man came along wow! This movie is tech-no and action filled, with a little bit of a love story on the side going on. I loved this movie and I would recommend this movie to anyone is into action or just wants to see a new movie. This movie has left the spider man movies in the dust. All I have to say is watch The Incredible Hulk, because Iron Man just may be the biggest movie of 2008!

Iron Man in Iron Script & Cast,"I've seen all of Marvel's movies...but this one,in one word...WOW!!!The action starts almost immediately and only stops at the very end!! The cast is,in my opinion,excellent!Robert D.Jr is great and he's a believable Iron Man and Jeff Bridges,man,unrecognizable but still great! The CGI is very good,not top notch but just sufficient to show that this movie means business,and the way Tony Stark builds his prototype and later is final suit is just...well,just see it to believe! It has humor,serious,love,flirt and action scenes...what else do you want???Don't listen to the negative critics (without reason in my opinion),go see this movie,you'll not be disappointed,money well spent without a doubt! I'll give it a 9/10 because it misses just a little more action,but hey...maybe in Iron Man 2 no???!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man,"Tony Stark, billionaire American industrialist, is kidnapped by terrorists whilst demonstrating Stark Enterprises' newest missile system in Afghanistan. The terrorists force Stark to build them one of his weapons. Instead, he builds a giant armoured suit and escapes. Flying over the desert, the suit malfunctions, and Stark crashes. He wanders around for a bit, and is rescued by American troops.Upon returning to America, Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) feels guilty about his company's warmongering, so develops a new version of his suit which he can use to destroy those of his weapons that have fallen into the hands of terrorists.Finally, you might say to yourself, a comic book movie that deals with current political issues. Unfortunately, no. After Stark repents and devotes himself to ridding the world of the evil that he has helped create, we are treated to an hour and a half of Robert Downey Jr. flying around in what amounts to a humanoid racing car.Admittedly, any Hollywood blockbuster that attempts to explore the politics around the ""War on Terror"" deserves some respect. But I can't help but feel disappointed when a film goes so far toward a critique of US foreign policy, only to pull it back in the final third in favour of the obligatory action-packed climax.Politics aside, Iron Man is entertaining enough. Downey Jr., a controversial choice at first, is well-cast as the billionaire playboy- cum-superhero. (I wonder where they got characterisation?) Rumours that much of the film's dialogue was improvised seem likely, as Stark has all the wise-cracking charisma we're used to from Downey Jr. The problem is, Downey Jr.'s star persona, even in Stark's private moments, never lets any real emotion to the surface. We never get a genuine sense of why a man would throw away his entire life to fly around in a robotic suit.The film tries to use the supporting characters to represent other aspects of American politics, but it can't quite pull that off, either. Colonel Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark's best mate, is a by-the-book military pilot, and obviously meant to represent the dilemma the American military finds itself in, forced to fight unnecessary and unwinnable wars. But he does absolutely nothing. And Jeff Bridges' Obadiah Stane, Stark's business partner and analogue of militaristic capitalism, always seems one step away from holding a white cat and laughing maniacally.Jon Favreau has certainly crafted an entertaining comic book movie. The decision to set Iron Man in California, instead of the otherwise seemingly obligatory New York, does give the film a distinctive feel. It's just a shame that a film that, in its opening scenes, proposes to deal with important political issues, eventually wimps out and descends into the same old blockbuster chicanery. In that respect, summer 2008's other movie event, The Dark Knight, shows us how it's done. Christopher Nolan's film keeps its political viewpoints under its belt, only allowing us a peak when the narrative demands, and so allowing us to make our own interpretations; while Iron Man wears its political heart on its sleeve, and therefore shows the world just how shallow it really is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Ironman, a naive special effects showcase","I didn't really know what to expect, and having never read the comic, knew nothing about the plot. The movie was mostly a boring series of naive events, ""cool"" American style tech idolization and flat one-liners.The special effect displayed through out the movie were admittedly bleeding edge, and acting was mostly good considering the awkward script.Undoubtedly if you are a fan of the comic, the movie was probably your dream come true. For the rest us, just a brainless special effects showcase. 4 out of 10.Disclaimer: I haven't really liked any of the marvel comic movies",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Funny as a comedy and super cool at the same time!,"I've never been a fan of iron man, I just slightly knew who he was and I usually only see movies where i know there's many great actors present. So I was very skeptical when i found out that Terrence Howard (which i've only seen in 50 cent's get rich or die trying') and Robert Downey Jr. (never seen him in a movie before) belonged to the main-characters.Thankfully the trailer was really cool so i couldn't help myself but to see it... and i'm glad i did. The movie was excellent. I laughed more to this movie than i do to most comedies and it made me more excited than most action-movies. The only words that came out of my mouth on the way home was ""wow"" and ""I must see the sequel, NOW!"".Terrence Howard was great and i couldn't believe that it was the same actor from get rich or die trying'. Iron man, who i barely knew, became one of my favorite heroes and I almost feel obligated to see more movies with Robert Downey Jr. because of role in this masterpiece. All the other actors were great as well but these two caught my attention most.The story ""how Tony Stark became Iron Man"" worked better than i expected and the movie caught and held my attention from start to finish. The movie was so interesting that the time just flew by and that is very rare!I know that i've not said anything bad about the movie yet and frankly, there is not much bad to mention. The only thing that made me disappointed was that even tough the movie was almost two hours long, it felt short. I could easily have watched another 20-30 minutes of Iron Man, this year's coolest and funniest superhero.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great action-adventure film,"This is one of the best action-adventure movies I have seen. It delivers the goods - entertainment and fun, clean language (very important since I like to watch movies with my kids). There is all a film like this needs: dramatic, anxious, and passionate protagonist; subtle, implied romance (without the grossing out sex so common in other films), conversion of the hero from his former line of work, since he's seen things from a different angle (the moral growth); punishing the bad guys; well developed pace and sequence of scenes - good story-telling.Generally I don't like movies to tell me their directors' and/or writers' political or troubled philosophical views. Movies are generally for good fun-they have to be enjoyed by the viewer. The writing and the lines of the movie are crisp and intelligent. There is enough good humor, yet there is what to think about as well. The acting is also at the appropriate level: Robert Downy Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges deliver - they make us understand their characters and motivations. Good film for the whole family, with the exception of some of the violence and more intense scenes even for the younger. Hopefully the sequel will not take the usual turn to the darker side of movie-making.UPDATE ON IRON MAN II: Regarding the last sentence above -- unfortunately my hopes were in vain. Iron Man II is NOT a GOOD sequel. It did take the usual wrong turn to the darker side.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I guess it's because it's just an intro movie to Iron Man. I hope they have a strong plot for the second one. Robert Dowrney gives an amazing performance.

The beginning of a phenomenon,"This was the first film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and introduced one of its most iconic characters. While it has its cringeworthy moments, we see the seeds of the self-aware wit, the stylish action and the compelling charm of Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark/Iron Man that made the franchise such a huge success.The movie did, however, do its best to alienate me in its early scenes. I assume that it intended to set up Tony Stark as a charming if selfish playboy, but all Downey's appeal can't prevent him coming across as the sort of greasy, entitled creep that the MeToo movement has since hopefully made us more wary of. We see him, for example, making unnecessary comments to a female soldier about her gender and appearance and apparently staffing his private jet with pole dancers (at least I hope so, as it would be even worse if they were primarily cabin staff who were nevertheless expected to do sexy dancing). And the film doesn't do enough to distance itself from Stark's sleaziness when it does things like show the female soldier laughing at Stark's comments without any apparent awareness that this is too often an uncomfortable defence mechanism that women feel they have to deploy, or invite us to laugh when Pepper Potts, Stark's general dogsbody, is unpleasantly rude to a female journalist whom Tony discards after a one-night stand.Still, once Tony is kidnapped by a violent criminal organisation calling themselves the Ten Rings, things start looking up for the film if not for our protagonist. Instead of the weapon the gang want him to make, he constructs his first Iron Man suit and uses it to blast to freedom. Back in the USA, his blinkers about the impact of his company's weapons removed, he announces a corporate change of direction and as a result is sidelined by its board, including Jeff Bridges's Obidiah Stane. With time on his hands, Tony begins perfecting his Iron Man suit, and freed from the necessity of acting an oleaginous womaniser, the humour and charm that Robert Downey Jr brought to his portrayal of Tony Stark can start to shine.The scenes in which he builds and tests his suits are well-done, and the special effects are mainly still convincing today. The suit apparently has real weight, and the ways in which it assembles as Tony puts it on and moves once he's in it are extremely cool. The action is exciting, despite or perhaps because of being relatively restrained and small-scale in comparison to some later Marvel films.The plot is straightforward and Jeff Bridges's Obidiah Stane, while enjoyable, isn't particularly nuanced or ground-breaking as an antagonist. But that's probably expected and forgivable in an origin story like this. The budding romance between Tony and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is surprisingly sweet, given that neither character starts off as particularly sympathetic. And Clark Gregg steals all his scenes as slightly awkward SHIELD agent Phil Coulson.So, in short, this is an imperfect film that is still worth a watch as laying the groundwork for a phenomenon, as well as having enough positives as the film progresses to earn forgiveness for the ick-factor of its opening scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"I, Ron Man, er. Iron Man rocks!","Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark from the Marvel comic; a flamboyant billionaire inventor who runs a weapons company. On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his latest invention, the Jericho Missile, he is kidnapped by terrorists and made to assemble one of these missiles for them. Instead, inside the cave in which they have imprisoned him, he builds the prototype Iron Man suit, and effects his escape but during so realizes that his company has been arming the bad guys of the world for years, a fact that does not sit well with him. This is what changes him and sets the table for the rest of the movie. The visual effects are great, RDJ inhabits the role very well as he suffers a bout of conscience in his chosen field of work. Hs decision to become someone that matters by donning the Iron Man suit makes sense. I felt by the middle of the movie that it could very easily have sputtered to a halt, but that feeling was quickly dispelled, because the character is shown to be the type who will never sit around as long as he has some cool toy to play with. And as Iron Man, the playboy has a purpose. It may be standard comic book morality, but it works. There will be sequels, and hopefully they will be almost as good as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Blockbuster Superhero Movie that Kicks Off the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr. In the titular role, is a thrilling and action-packed superhero movie that kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film tells the origin story of Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist who builds a high-tech suit of armor to become the superhero Iron Man.The movie is a perfect blend of action, humor, and character development, with a standout performance by Downey Jr. As the charming and witty Tony Stark. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard, and Jeff Bridges all delivering strong performances.One of the best things about Iron Man is how it balances the superhero action with the human drama. The film explores Tony Stark's journey from a selfish playboy to a hero who uses his wealth and intelligence to make the world a better place. It's a journey that is both compelling and relatable, and it's what sets Iron Man apart from other superhero movies.Overall, Iron Man is a blockbuster superhero movie that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Ironman more like Iron-LAME,"This review is an attempt at saving your life by persuading you not to see this movie. Single worst effort in film making I've ever seen. Gwyneth Paltrow is gross they should have gotten some hot broad to play that part then I might have gained some semblance of entertainment from this pathetic excuse of a blockbuster. Iron man is the worst super hero ever, hands down. Like I heard the incredible hulk beat him up in a back alley once, and that's how you know your an awful hero. Rumor has it Downy Jr. only got the part because he entered an Iron Lungs contest against Colin Ferrel to see who could smoke more marijuana in a 10 minute time period, and Jr. only won because he secretly laced Ferrel's and he passed out. Iron Man was written by James Favreau's 12 year old son, with the help of that bumbling idiot Toby Mcguire. Mcguire was able to manipulate Favreau's son into creating an even worse flick than spaceman, to prevent spaceman from being the obviously most awful super hero movie ever. Hopefully someone sends out an internet virus and completely wipes out any bootlegged remains of IronLame on the web, and then burns all the remaining copies of the film on the planet so no one else has to subject themselves to that atrocity of a movie.Don't you dare contribute to Downy Jr's drug addictions by buying this film, if you do your sinning.

The perfect Iron Man adaptation.,"Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Stark a billionaire, genius weapons manufacturer who gets injured by one of his own company's bombs whilst travelling in a combat zone.Not all the shrapnel can be removed from his body so to keep the shrapnel from puncturing a major ventricle he has an electromagnet inserted in his chest to hold the shrapnel in place and keep him alive. He then invents a tiny power reactor to power the electromagnet and a prototype armour that he uses to escape his captors whom are trying to force him to build them a missile.Once Tony has returned to the United States he has a change of heart and announced that his company will no longer build weapons. This causes his company's stock to plummet and Obadiah Stane gets a court injunction freezing Tony out from his own company.Tony perfects the Mark II armour and uses it to destroy caches of his company's weapons being stockpiled by warlords in the Middle East. In the meantime Obadiah Stane uses the remnants of Tony's prototype armour to create the 'Iron Monger' but needs the mini power reactor embedded in Tony's chest to power it.John Favreau has done a fantastic job adaption Iron Man to the big screen. John's version of Tony Stark is spot on. Tony is arrogant, brilliant and compassionate in equal measure and all aspects of the character are explored.I also liked how the military were portrayed. The Marines/soldiers were regular young people with personalities just like real life soldiers/marines are and it was the weapons corporations and top brass that were rightly the villains of the piece.Obadiah Stane was also brilliantly realised by Jeff Bridges and the Iron Monger armour was truly menacing, the total opposite to Stark's svelte red and gold armour. The special effects in this movie were terrific and some of the armour's gadgets when used in combat were suitably advanced just like in the comic books.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. There was plenty of action and comedy and a good storyline. If you enjoy superhero films or just good action films then I definitely recommend this to you if you haven't already seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We're not reviewing the right stuff...,"I walked into the movie with low expectations for the record. Comic book movies this day and age are alright, and there are definitely titles I enjoyed and proudly adorn among my DVD collection - but there's a lot of hit and miss in the field and not a lot of movies in general seem comfortable with themselves these days. So the movie starts... And it's loud, flashy, the action scene editing is too quick to take it all in, the main character is a prick, the film has a lot of cheap jokes and gags, some of the dialog is corny, the plot is so predictable you can see the ending coming from a mile away, the actors and typecast, John Favreau is not an insane action director, there's too many characters and there's more vfx shots than in Spiderman. - wow, it sounds like this movie stinks... but if you pay attention to the subject heading you'll see what I'm getting at. The things we'd normally find flaws in these kinds of movies make this one fun and excel and, as one of my friends said, ""I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time."" I can cop out and try and solve why all this works by hailing Favreau's superb direction, the all-star cast for their strong performances, ILM for the great work they brought to the table... but all these just enhance it and take it from being a good movie to an excellent movie. I have to credit the writers first and foremost for the fact they made a solid and tight script with just enough humor, just enough action and just enough drama that you don't notice anything else but that you are having a good time. The true villain is very predictable, which normally irritates me - but it's not building up to an ""aha"" moment in any sense of the term, so they aren't wasting time trying to keep it mysterious and failing. Iron Man also is subject to some very cheap humor, but it pushes it further and actually causes you to burst out in laughter (something most good comedies fail). The story is tight, the characters are fun, the action feels good and rough, and for all the reasons we rip other films to pieces, Iron Man makes you want to see it again... and again... and again. Which brings me to question... then what exactly is wrong with the movies that we find so terrible. I submit it's the script, the backbone of any film story - and Iron Man has a great script, everything else just becomes icing on the cake.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark aka Ironman!,"Possibly the best Marvel movie franchise character debuts in this movie. Yes, the obvious choice might be Spider-Man. But readers and fans of the IronMan comic know if it were scientifically possible to extract DNA from a comic book character right off the page and turn it into a real person; it still wouldn't equal how Robert Downey Jr. embodies Ironman! It is uncanny how he has captured every aspect of this character perfectly! From personality to appearance to personal problems and faults... and so much more I won't waste time elaborating on.In this first installment, the story starts off pretty much holding true to the comic book origins. It opens with a lot of action, and closes with plenty of action as well. The movie is somewhat bookended that way. But the story is not empty of action through the middle. So it has good pacing. Visually its very well done. I don't think the Ironman suit could've been done any more realistically. The humor generated fits the Stark character. Paltrow also pulls off the Pepper Potts character. There are frivolous and fluff moments in movie. And some might find it juvenile for their taste. But they usually revolve around Tony Stark's narcissistic side. True to the comic book character. And also true to the character, part of his character development is his narcissism becoming more of a surface personality trait as he cultivates more noble traits that become the deeper part of his soul. But the movie (as well as the sequels) reflects one of the weaknesses of the comic series. And that is great archenemies and villains! In the comic series it seemed like Ironman's best battles usually were against someone else's archenemy. And in my opinion, that has carried over to the movie franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Logic-Dumbing Movie,"i never thought that watching iron man will be worth the wait and expectations. I already anticipated that it will be boring, childish crap, and just nonsense stuffed movie most specially since it has been based on a best selling literature (we have a saying ""Don't judge a book by its movie""). But there I was, awestricken, dumbfounded, and fully amazed without an accurate emotion to express the feeling overwhelming my entire being.ever since i was a kid, i already developed curiosity and great interest to movies. That is why, as I grew older, i started to develop great criticism on the movies i get to watch so as not to be attached to them. Like i remember rationalizing over some fictitious things getting into animated characters. A newly developed habit that most of the time kill the enjoyment over seeing movies i once had when i was kid. But then, as the movie progressed, every second has just passed without my logic convincing me that THIS IS STUPID! A METAL CANNOT FLY NOR BE INVULNERABLE TO BULLETS! Mind you, I really did experience full time enjoyment as if everything in the world can explode without me being panicky. I didn't even remember that I was alone cause my friends turned me down on this one.so for that, all i can say is that this movie is something all stressful people should watch. every cent you paid on this one is a well spent money, i believe. It isn't just another movie made to showcase gorgeous body & perfect faces. It is more than that. It is a movie packed with a great sets of talents ( I literally mean GENUINE talents ), great mind, and futuristic technologies.So for those who really like to give themselves a break, try this one! Cause for some weird reason, you'll find yourself with your brain relaxed, satisfied and amazed! A feeling i thought i lost long time ago!P.S. the only con i have for this movie is that it's as if it has been made so as for US to inflict intimidation, fear, and dread to the world. It's as if they're showing us how they can be that modern and advanced when it comes to warfare. And how they can make a war by giving out enemies the means to level with them. Well, I just hope that what the movie portrayed isn't really and won't be happening to real life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Exemplary work,"I'm probably getting old, but Speed Racer tired me and somewhere in the middle of Iron Man I found it a bit slow. Either that or I experience burnout from wallowing in the pre-release internet publicity of both movies. Some people are saying that this Iron Man is better than Batman Begins. Yes, in one aspect, I think Robert Downey is a better actor than Bale. They are both quite good, but I give more points to Downey for being self-deprecating and funnier, plus, his personal history outside the movie adds to the baggage (actual positive baggage!) he brings to this role. Very inspired acting, aside from the fact he's quite qualified to do the role anyway. I do prefer the basic story of Batman over Iron Man. A Batman story relies on atmospherics (hence the use of a bat, and the generally dark tone of most of movies and comics). He also uses a bit of deductive reasoning in combating crime. Tony Stark is an inventor, and his suit is a wonderful toy, but Iron Man's antagonists aren't that inspired (except maybe the Mandarin). The comic's best story arc are Stark battling his personal demons. I like the way Favreau makes his fanboy homages so integrated to the movie. Not being aware of them won't detract a whit from a newcomer's experience, but knowing about them will send a fanboy to nirvana. In any case, exemplary work. My rating of an 8 may seem too low for a positive review, but I'm a bit of a contrarian. To me, the best comic book movie was The Incredibles, and I'm in the minority holding that opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
MCU introduction to the world.,"Iron Man is a shapely piece of mythmaking. Director Jon Favreau doesn't go in for stylized comic-book frames, at least in the first half. It's utter, wish-fulfilling crap, but when the whole world hates you, it does feel good. Director Jon Favreau pays homage to Brad Bird's The Iron Giant for the look of Stark's helmet. Jeff Bridges plays a villain who gets hold of the same technology and uses it for evil instead of good.Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark is a sex addict who has to clean up his act. Bridges makes Stane scarily at ease with his villainy. Iron Man is more family-friendly, but it's in the same liberal-fantasy tradition as Lethal Weapon 2.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great entertainment,Iron Man is a great night out.Robert Downey JNR delivers a fun packed cocksure performance that will have you laughing out loud on a few occasions.Fans of the comic book must be delighted with his interpretation of Tony Stark. He truly brings the character to life and provides us with of the best comic book to film translations in memory.The visual effects are also outstanding and the film is very cleverly directed.The film goes a little 'Transformers' towards the end but on the whole it is a thrilling ride and has set the bar at a high level for the rest of the summer blockbusters to try and beat. Great stuff.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
He's Iron Man,"Iron man is an interesting film in the fact that it deals more with the character and less with the action. DOn't get me wrong, the movie has action, but with Robert Downey Jr. in the title role of TOny Stark/Iron Man, he steals the show and makes Iron Man a pleasant surprise for fans of the character and the comic book. I enjoyed this movie.THe movie starts with Stark (Downey Jr.) talking with American troops in a Hummer in the Middle East. THese first scenes set the character perfectly and lead to the goods that follow. He is at once humorous and likable, and this continues throughout the film's running length. THey are of course attacked. All the troops are killed and Stark, who is a weapon's expert, is taken prisoner by a terrorist group who has used his own weapons against him and America. THe group forces him to build a weapon they can use against their enemies, but he instead creates a suit of armor which he then uses to attack his captures and escape.Once back in America, Stark realizes that the weapons he thought he was developing to help America are being sold to America's enemies. He decides that he must create a suit of armor, like the one he created in the Middle East, to help America and stop the enemy from harming more people. THat is how Iron Man is created, and it goes through two more upgrades before he finally gets the armor to where he wants it.THis movie hits on a lot of issues that are effecting the world today. One of them, and probably the biggest one in the movie, is the corruption that factors into everything. A strong jab is made at the US weapon's industry, and it had a profound effect on me. THe movie makes some strong points about why America is probably struggling, and it all factors into the corruption of the corporate elite and how they will sell their souls to make a buck. It sickening but oh so true.THe director, Jon Favereau, never preaches this, but just lets the viewer know, with subtle hints, that not everything is the rest of the world's fault. It's good, great even, but it's too bad he can't do action as well, which brings me to my next point.The action in Iron Man is there, but it is never in your face like many other blockbuster action films. It is more of a drama than anything. If Downey Jr. didn't pull off the part so well, as well as the rest of the supporting cast which includes Terence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, this movie might not have made the money it has so far. THey hold the movie together and keep you focused on the characters, and you never really notice how very little action there is. Of course this is an origin story, so maybe the director will do better with the sequel, that is if he comes back to do the sequel.I liked the movie, I liked the performances by all, but Iron Man could've used a little bit more of a kick-ass sense that would of made it an instant classic. Still, it's hard to argue with what we get with Iron Man. It is definitely one of the best Super Hero movies since Spider Man 2, and Batman Begins. And on a final note, make sure you stay until the end credits to see something special and very interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Great but.....,Great movie I have to say the action was good. Storyline OK could've been a little better. Pepper is how she should be. You can't really say much about the movie otherwise I'd give it away in one review. However I will say that Jeff Bridges played a great role in the movie. Who would've thought but then again he's a good actor and plays his roles well. I didn't like the ending though. Who thought that up I wonder? Actually it made me quite angry it might be because I probably expected a carry on go figure let me know what you think of the ending!! I've just never known a secret superhero to narc himself out how funny that is.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert has redeemed himself !!,"Very enjoyable, action packed movie. I already like Robert Downey Jr, but I thoroughly enjoy a movie that I'm not constantly trying to change the character and quizzing the story. Although there are sure some unbelievable moments it's not one of those movies you question. The story was done very well and the technology and special effects are great. My wife did not want to see this movie, but someone else told us how good it was, commenting his wife even agreed; my wife is also in agreement here... she said this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Good luck topping this one in a sequel (but we hope it's being made).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another super hero movie,"Personally, I could care less whether or not I ever see another super hero movie again. To me, they all follow similar plot lines and are therefor rather predictable. Furthermore, I could really care less what happens to the main character. As for the action scenes, there are enough movies out there with huge explosions and whatnot that it just doesn't interest me anymore. The fact that I've never had much of an interest in super heroes and comics is probably the main reason why this film didn't interest me at all.If your like me and your sick with all these super movies that have come out over the last year, then you could skip this movies.But, if you liked Spiderman and Batman and found them entertaining, by all means go see Iron Man because you'll enjoy it. The only serious flaw with this movie that I had was that it didn't use the song of the same name by Black Sabbeth until the end credits.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert Downey Jr most legendary role(more than Chaplin),"Iron Man. 3 *'s out of 4 Cast: Robert Downey Jr. Gwyneth Paltrow.Director: Jon Favreau.Tony Stark is a different type of alter ego for a super hero. Of course there are similarities to Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne, but while those characters are always mourning for the loss of their relatives. Mr. Stark enjoys living the life of a playboy bachelor. He has a great house, the best cars , and has sex with hot women, and enjoys being Iron Man. Most characters in comics become a super hero due to either a scientific accident, being born with powers or something tragic happens and you build a costume .However, that is not the case with Iron Man.Tony became Iron Man due to a basic need to survive. At the beginning he is captured by terrorists after the testing of his company's latest weapon. They want him to build a weapon for them, but instead of their weapon he makes an invincible suit and escapes. He wants to do away with the destruction his weapons have caused and start helping out those who need it.What I enjoyed about Iron man was not really Iron Man himself, but the character of Tony Stark. Robert Downey Jr is that character through and through and I can't imagine any one else who can portray him. If there is one reason to see this movie, It's because of his performance. Most super hero movies you can't wait to see the hero kick ass. Don't get me wrong the action sequences are very good, and worth the money alone, but the scenes between Tony Stark and his assistant Pepper(Gweneth Paltrow, who looks really hot as a red head) were very captivating even if you knew the outcome before they did. The rest of the cast where very good. Hell they were all academy award winners or nominees. I hope That we will continue to see people who can act take these types of roles.Another thing that impressed me about ""Iron Man"" was that it was directed by Jon Favreau. He was the writer of Swingers, but his directing work with ""Made"" and ""Elf"" made me question if he could pull off a super hero movie, and the answer is yes. He loves these characters and does a great job of letting you know the heart of them instead of just running around and kick ass. I think what makes a super hero movie works is that you like who is inside the costume a little bit more than you like the hero. Tony Stark himself says he is not a hero, but whatever he does. He rules at it",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but dumb,"This slick superhero movie is fast-paced and has brisk, often witty dialog, and I did enjoy it, but it's a pretty dumb piece of work. There are both the little things - the stated purpose of the gizmo in Stark's chest contradicts its implied purpose based on what happens when it's removed, the villain is far too skilled based on his experience - and the overall premise of the film. The movie's naive take on war seems to be that the problem is weapons makers and (middle eastern) warlords, as opposed to say, imperialism, greed or, more to the point, the knee jerk use of force to solve all problems. Like the movie itself, Stark has a surface revelation but can't or won't look at the deeper issues. So while Iron Man works perfectly well as a popcorny action flick, its failure to deal with issues raised by the very nature of the screenplay makes it less satisfying than a superhero movie that never raised these issues to begin with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pleasantly Surprised!,"My son arrives home with the freshly released ""Iron Man"" DVD in hand. ""Mom, you've gotta watch this"" and I roll my eyes expecting the typical garbage. Not having seen the DVD cover, I have no idea whose in the film.It took me 10 minutes to recognize Jeff Bridges. The trademark gorgeous head of hair was shaved but that was to his utmost advantage. Bridges got inside the skin of this character and he really scared me.I've always loved Robert Downey, Jr. He chews up the screen. Up until now, my favorite Downey movie was ""Home for the Holidays"" where he completely stole every scene. Downey is just so... likable and believable in everything he does. This film is no exception. And it is not devoid of humor. The scenes where he is testing out his product will bring a grin to your face.I wasn't a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow until ""Sliding Doors."" In Iron Man, she not only plays the role smartly, she looks good for a change. Paltrow's added a few pounds (but in the right places). No longer the gangly teenager, Paltrow is now a beautiful woman. The directors wisely chose not to interject too much romance in the film either so as not to interfere with the quickening pace of the story.The traffic/city scene literally brought a comic book to life. I was completely blown away.

Iron Man gears up for a sequel,"It was a good film and certainly worth the admission, but not awe-inspiring like Spiderman 1 & 2. There were definitely some very cool scenes, like the fighter flight, design and building of the v.2 armor and everything having to do with Stark's fancy computer interfaces, and in the end, the scene building up to ""I am Iron Man."" Iron Man seems to be made to reach its eventual payoff not before a sequel or possibly several. It's very much an introductory movie where they're holding out on the Iron Man goodness to establish characters and develop them.This is not to say that the film would necessarily benefit from more action. The break from the constant fighting of superhero movies is refreshing, and the character interactions are handled really well and in an interesting way - with the exception of the baddie, who was just an excuse to kick any and all dogs available, and to provide an underwhelming ""big fight"" at the end of the movie. Whatever motivations the antagonist might have had, they were completely undermined by the baffling and unfounded actions forced upon the character to bring some sense of conclusion to the movie.Iron Man is a good film, but held back by too much prepping for sequels instead of focusing on the movie at hand, and a main baddie whose development and motivations are criminally poor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

His performance was so amazing and believable and it was consistent throughout the film. Also, Jeff Bridges's supporting role was commendable.

I was quite disappointed after walking out of the theater last night. I was expecting Iron Man could offer me as much entertainment as the Transformers did, but the good stuff was already in the trailer and nothing more exciting was in the feature presentation. Visual effects were stunning, but did not give me as much awe as Superman Returns or Transformers. Storyline was straightforward, but too much time was spent on Tony Stark's R&D of making the suit rather than his adventure or fighting the villain. Too many dull moments slowed down the tempo.

Sublime blockbuster filmmaking,"Man, I just flat-out love Iron Man. It's right up there with Raimi's first two Spider-Mans, X2, and The Incredibles on my list of favorite non-Christopher Nolan superhero flicks. To start out with, Robert Downey Jr. is simply one of the single most talented actors working today and has been one of my favorites since Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, and he absolutely rocks in this movie. He's alternately awesome and hilarious through the whole runtime, and no one else gives the quirky yet always entertaining line readings Downey Jr. delivers without fail. Also, after nearly a decade of dead-eyed, snooze-inducing performances, I have to say that Gwyneth Paltrow kind of shocked me here with hitherto-unprecedented sparkle and pep and energy. I guess the director promised her a cookie if she acted because she really lit up the scenes she was in and is one of the best superhero love interests I've ever seen on screen.But more so than love interests, we go to superhero movies for action, at which Iron Man excels. Jon Favreau had a bit of special effects practice in Elf and more in Zathura, but this was his first full-blooded action flick, and I think that might be what makes the action so damn good. He's never ""learned"" any of the wrong, Michael Bay-esquire action tricks of cameras haphazardly swinging in the fray or ultra-spastic cutting that makes the action hard to watch by awkwardly trying to make you feel like you're in it or something, and as a result the action scenes are gorgeous and entertaining. Iron Man fights dudes, and the camera actually stays on the action in smooth noncutting wide shots that let you see and enjoy everything. Almost every action scene in the flick is like that, shot in a wide, clean way that is so very refreshing. This gets a monumental thumbs up from me.Beyond that (this is the ""checklist of other cool things"" paragraph), the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. There's nothing precisely innovative about them, but it's Industrial Light & Magic at the peak of their powers, and nothing in the whole movie made me think ""fake!"" at all. The Iron Man character, while I had no knowledge of him before seeing this movie, is really fun and has pretty sweet powers. And the comedy in the film is incredibly strong; this has a lot to do with how funny Downey Jr. is, but the movie has a pretty massive amount of slapstick and one-liners and other hilarity (probably even more than Spider-Man 2) that won huge and consistent laughs from me.If the movie has any weaknesses, it's the plot and the music. Not that there's anything wrong with the plot at all, it just won't surprise you. It's a pretty basic and utilitarian superhero origin story, with most of the major goings-on in regards to the the villain and the hero's character progression pretty traditional. A montage of the hero honing / practicing his powers, the hero's love interest being threatened by the villain, and all that. It's just done exceptionally and unusually well. And the music, while again having nothing exactly wrong with it, lacks any truly memorable theme for the Iron Man character. Although I suppose it would be hard to make a theme more iconic than the Black Sabbath ""Iron Man"" riff, so they're excused.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"the movie that ""Transformers"" should have been: stimulating, witty, character-populated, and above all, fun","After the disastrously disappointing summer special effects extravaganza ""Transformers"" (2007), ""Iron Man"" was just the kind of movie to boost up my anticipations again for the big-budget action blockbusters. This was the sort of movie that ""Transformers"" should have been: action-packed, witty, intelligent, character-populated, plot-backed, and above all, fun. Whereas ""Transformers"" had me yawning thirty minutes in with its awful dialogue, two-dimensional characters, and lack of awe-inspiring moments from otherwise visionary special effects, ""Iron Man"" had me interested right from the start, mostly due to the stellar performance by Robert Downey, Jr. and although I felt the climax was a little less climactic than it should have been, the movie pulled itself through clear to the end.Robert Downey, Jr. stars at Tony Stark, a multibillionaire weapons manufacturer entrepreneur, who while demonstrating a new weapons system for the U.S. Army in the Middle-East, is captured by bloodthirsty insurgents, who critically wound him and then force him into building the same weapons for them. Dodging their supervision, Downey Jr. designs and constructs with miraculous success a mechanical combat suit that allows him to escape. Upon returning home, he immediately begins construction on a newer, better suit, which he then uses as his tool for fighting crime.It's at this point that ""Iron Man"" basically becomes your standard superhero movie, but it does it with such vigor and zest that one cannot help but be enthralled by it. But I think that a lot of people love the movie for the completely wrong reason. Yes, you get your money's worth with the special effects. They are terrific, just as good as the visuals in ""Transformers."" But what makes ""Iron Man"" so fun is because it has what ""Transformers"" did not have and severely needed: characterization. Part of the reason why Robert Downey, Jr. is so great in this movie is because he has real character material to work with. The Tony Stark character is charming because he is likable and three-dimensional, not just the standard mathematical genius who thinks he can do something good. But it doesn't just stop with him. The always interesting actress Gwyneth Paltrow gives a superb performance as his costar, but she doesn't become overworked into becoming the typical damsel in distress which we usually get in superhero movies. There is real chemistry between Downey Jr. and Paltrow, they have profound dialogue to work with, and their relationship does not evolve into a sappy overly romantic jinx.But in regards to the special effects, the genius is not because they are great, but because they are used imaginatively. Whereas the robots in ""Transformers"" only transformed, talked, and occasionally did some clashing with another robot, ""Iron Man"" uses its visuals to stimulate excitement, awe, and laughs that actually work out. But the movie does not just throw special effects after you one at a time. The movie is not about the fact that Iron Man can fly or shoot weapons and it does not lead solely up to these moments. It's just proof that special effects should be a *service to the film—part of what works, not the only thing that works.If I have any complaints, they are minor. The movie ran just a tad too for my liking and again, I felt the climax could have been more energetic and riveting like the previous three-quarters of the movie, but that's hardly a detractor from this otherwise stimulating and entertaining blockbuster.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Strong early summer entrant(not to mention a lot of fun),"My bias in Superhero Comic characters made into movies sides mostly with DC,so my familiarity with a fair amount of the Marvel world is somewhat light. Particularly with Iron Man,so my learning curve on this show was in one part helped by a friend of mine who IS a MArvel fanatic and in another--a much bigger one--in this movie.I'd say I did okay in that regard. Better than OK.The transformation of debauchery-loving rich kid/gifted inventor and demi-genius Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.,fantastic!) from cynical war profiteer to wounded crusader on a mission(via his creation and film's namesake,of course)is somewhat of a slow one,as he survives a kidnap attempt in Afghanistan and has to use his smarts and the equipment he's given to escape,not to mention the help of a equally gifted translator(Shaun Taub,underrated),but that's okay. Downey's arch,oh-so-real acting and perfectly glib persona makes his reform interesting and even fun to watch so that by the time the finished version of Stark's creation comes to fruition,it doesn't seem like much of a wait at all IMHO. With the help of his loyal and attractive(also attracted)assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow,someone I'd sorta forgotten how luminescent and lovely she really can be before seeing this movie),he strives to use his nascent technology for good rather than evil,which naturally will incur resistance from within.Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend,Jeff Bridges as Tony's mentor and potentially shadowy menace and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon FAvreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the wan,flavorless ""DareDevil"" from 2003.THis is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies,it's great;for those who enjoy a good message movie,it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true;and as a summer film,it's large and captivating,never letting the viewer go till the credits(and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with a ten for this film,it's a very strong nine. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes ""Summer"" films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not That Bad,This way a great starting point for the Marvel universe. Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as Tiny Stark and he brings the character to life. The plot was solid and lots of fun. It takes a bit to get going but it's a blast. All the supporting characters are great as well. Good special effects and humor. Mediocre villain and parts were predictable.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvelous,"This film is the best marvel movie to date in my opinion, with the possible exception of the first Spiderman film.When reviewing or talking about films with friends I must admit I enjoy picking any flaws apart and making fun of them. With Iron Man I was greatly disappointed as I have nothing to moan about! I cannot think of a single valid criticism for this film from my personal standpoint. If I really had to look for something bad, I'd say that the final battle is a little stereotypical of superhero films with the whole ""I'm like you just a little better"" scenario as with the Hulk vs The Abomination and Spiderman vs Venom, but personally I enjoy those type of battles as it proves to make for entertaining cinema, however I know of people who are beginning to find it dull.As one of my personal favourite superheroes, I was glad to see a good, critically acclaimed actor such as Robert Downy Jr. cast as Tony Stark and am glad the role was not taken by anyone else. Not only was his performance (along with the rest of the cast) good, but it was right on the money for the character of Stark. This combined with the witty scripting made for a facetious and charming screen persona.The story was taken at a nice pace with just the right amount of impressive pulse pounding action and intense CGI sequences to keep even those with criminally short attention spans enthralled, but with enough story and character building in the right places in-between, to give the film some substance and a good plot.The numerous references to sequels also peaked my interest. With the imminent introduction of War Machine, Nick Fury and the remainder of The Avengers undoubtedly looming not far off, it is something I personally shall be looking forward to greatly.In summation I would highly recommend this film to anyone reading this and believe it to be a definite contender for best film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert Downey Jr. is perfect.,"This is a comic book adaptation, and yet I really didn't care too much about Iron Man the superhero. This is what makes Iron Man such a great movie, not just a well-made action hero story. The character Tony Stark is one of the most fascinating in recent memory and Downey Jr. plays him with such humanity, wit and charm, you can't help but me mesmerized by him. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow will soon become legendary among superhero movies. The first time seeing it, I was impressed but not convinced. The second time around was much more enjoyable as I knew the story and concentrated on how well Jon Favreau paced the action, how good the acting was by all involved, and how well the music fit with each scene and added to it rather than being a distraction. This movies just works so well together, it makes for a great time in the dark. Certainly it is one of the best movies of the year so far, but it also introduces us to another world and another story that we all should get excited about: The Avengers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Like a Cheese Burger - nothing more, nothing less.","Since Batman Begins released three years ago, most new superhero movies have been particular about their casting  especially about the non-lead characters  and also great care is taken to please the geeks with trivia scattered all about the movie. Iron Man is the first such ""production line"" movie for Marvel since they have started producing their own movies. And with all our luck, they succeed. Iron Man balances a big budget/big explosions popcorn movie with a host of intelligent actors to make it a worthy opener for Hollywood's Summer Season this year.Iron Man is an origin story that focuses on how genius billionaire industrialist playboy inventor Tony Stark goes from creator of WMDs to an iron-clad superhero standing up against selfish war-mongering. Robert Downey Jr. plays Stark as a fast-talking faster-thinking man-boy, yet instills likability to his shallowness. Get this: his secretary reminds him it's her birthday; he asks her to get herself a present from him; she says she already has; he then actually asks her if she likes it! The secretary (& babysitter) is played by Gwyneth Paltrow in a very cute turn - she harbors a secret crush on her boss yet is conscious of their social difference. Terrence Howard plays Stark's best buddy and the Army's liaison to Stark Industries (fanboys: hint, hint!). The supporting character that does stand out though is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane in a menacing bald & beard look accentuates his jaunty performance. It just shows how important it is to have a strong actor in villain roles (think Brian Cox from X2).John Favreau does not really carry a legacy to set any valid expectations for his latest movie. Considering he did a passable turn with Zathura, most of the anticipation for Iron Man comes from recognition of the superhero himself and the wonderful cast. Each of the four actors brings a conviction to their characters that lend the required believability to the world they inhabit. And yet, the movie recognizes itself to be an entertainer and sticks to its purpose. It finds a niche spot between the successes of Batman Begins and the Transformers movie. Much like the Cheese Burger that Tony Stark craves  it is fun, fulfilling and easy. Nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Features signs of greatness that make X2 and Batman Begins as good as they are,"Between the winter and summer a little switch goes off in my head, and I move between two schools of film-making and film appreciation. Six months ago, I couldn't be less interested in big-budget glory fests. I judged the movies I saw in theatres  movies like No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Atonement  with the sharpest of critical eyes; the slightest detail out of place would have thrown me off completely. But now, in the upcoming summer months and eagerly awaiting releases such as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and The Dark Knight, my eye is different. I see a movie like Iron Man and don't care that it is almost entirely disconnected from anything remotely realistic. I don't care that it portrays Afghani terrorists as caricatures operating in backwater, undeveloped, ridiculously improbable cave networks. I don't care that there is a character named Pepper Potts. In the upcoming months, all I want is to sit back and enjoy the ride. And if these films have a little something more to offer, then all the better.As I previously mentioned, Iron Man does slightly dab into moments of elated poignancy. Some aspects of it do serve as a very contemporary reminder of the current status of world politics, especially in terms of weapons distribution and military support in foreign countries, coming back at us like a boomerang. In this sense, Iron Man is almost like a comic book version of Charlie Wilson's War. In addition, the filmmakers and the extraordinary Robert Downey, Jr. do a fantastic job in creating an interesting, well-rounded and satisfyingly flawed protagonist. But for the most part, it's just, plain and simple, a really good show. Visual effects are top-notch and seamless; the action scenes are thrilling; the theatre's surround sound system was working overtime, and in all I have to admit that the two-hour runtime felt like a lot less.Jon Favreau, famed actor, has had slight experience in directing but nothing nearly as large-scale as this so as to indicate that he was even capable of pulling it off. Well, he does indeed manage to pull it off, and quite will at that. The film looks stunning, the scenes are directed and choreographed exquisitely well, and in all Favreau manages to create a very strong balance between big-budget action comic book movie sentiments along with more smaller-scale techniques more in vain with Favreau's breakthrough role in Swingers. And most of this is thanks to the one, the only Robert Downey, Jr.Downey, Jr. is the kind of actor who can almost sleepwalk through a role. Like the greats such as Daniel Day-Lewis or Al Pacino, acting and charisma seems to be an utterly and totally natural thing for him. With roles as varied as a book editor, a crazed drug addict, Charlie Chaplin and now a multi-billionaire playboy turned super hero, Downey Jr. still manages to apply his unique and personal fast-talking, rapid-fire, neurotic, cynical acting style in everything he does. I guess he's just lucky to always get to work with directors who let him cut loose and do his thing. This film is no exception  many scenes involving Downey, Jr. with rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue seem like straight out of a Robert Altman movie and totally improvised. What is so great about the performance is that Downey, Jr. combines this trademark acting style with a really impressive sensibility and connection to the more comic book action-movie-oriented aspects of the role. Every single frame he is in becomes all the more worthwhile and entertaining; it's just a fun, great, funny, well-rounded performance that proves once and for all  if roles in other smaller recent films such as Good Night and Good Luck, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly and Zodiac didn't quite break it to the mainstream sentiment  that Robert Downey, Jr. is back.The cream of the crop of super hero movies are the ones not only featuring strong, rounded, interesting characters from the original comics but are also films in which the filmmakers take special care to place action in a familiar, as-realistic-as-possible setting, providing not only interesting characters but also believable settings for us to identify with them in. The single best comic book adaptation movie of all time is for me a three-way tie between Spider-Man 2, X2: X-Men United and Batman Begins. Other impressive efforts include the first Spider-Man and X-Men films as well as Tim Burton's non-realistic but uniquely stylized versions of Batman, and also Richard Donner's old Superman movie. And the more lousy, effort-less super hero movies come out  such as Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Ghost Rider and many others  the more the quality of the good ones is emphasized. Iron Man contains bits and pieces of what makes a movie like Batman Begins so good, but also many bits of guilty pleasure over-the-top fantasy that are entertaining but quite silly and unbelievable. That said, Favreau and crew are definitely on the right track, and while Iron Man was a good introduction, I'm hoping that the sequel will take everything that was good about this first film and amplify and further develop these points. A darker, more flawed exploration of Tony Stark's character is always welcome, and with Robert Downey Jr. on board, it's almost a guarantee to up the ante, similar to the X-Men and Spider-Man sequels. Here's hoping for the best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doing the MCU after all...good start!,"TL/DR intro if anyone's curious:I never thought I'd go through all the MCU movies, but one particular hardware-upgrade has got me addicted to 3D-Blurays: namely the Meta Quest 3, the first viable VR-headset for home cinema due to its consistent clarity.Out of curiosity I watched The Guardians Of The Galaxy 3D in it and was blown away by the massive visual spectacle! Such enormous depth. The likeable characters & fun story helped too, of course. Then there was all that intriguing side-plot about Thanos and Infinity Stones. As an aside I also did Mad Max: Fury Road 3D in the headset. Wow. The illusion of depth coupled with a screen so big it fills your entire vision, plus the sheer immersive isolation of the image within the headset (just black void outside of the movie) means this is the closest technology can get to really make the viewer feel they are in that movieworld themselves. Adds a profound extra enjoyment & thrill of such films.So I've gone on a 3D-Bluray buyfrenzy. Gobbling up the used markets where the prices are reasonable up to the end of the so-called Phase 3 Infinity Saga...Phase 4 onwards doesn't interest me as the 3D prices are far too steep & hard to find, plus poor reviews and no relation to the epic Infinity Saga. With the exception of Guardians Of The Galaxy 3 (saving that 'til the very end) my own saga will focus on Iron Man 1 to Far From Home.Almost all the Infinity Saga movies are available in 3D, except the first three. Even in 2D the gigantic virtual screen of the Quest 3 makes for great cinema.I went into Iron Man 1 with low expectations...and enjoyed it! Very effectively told, and paced, origin story. Surprisingly more sci-fi than 'superhero-fantasy'. Watchable characters, quality dialogue, effective FX, decent plot. I appreciated the Lord-Of-War-lite subtext of the US arms industry powering foreign conflicts, which in the film as in the real-world only make some people rich while tragically ruining countless lives of innocent civilians. Tony Stark's hero's journey is credibly portrayed, and the final battle is satisfying.But Iron Man 1 is still ultimately a lightweight: the Arab antagonists are drawn too thinly, relying on cliché. Stark's main nemesis has a fine build-up but from a narrative point-of-view his decision-making in the finale was uncharacteristically dumb......then again, this is a movie based on a comic-book superhero, so narrative-accepted :)Overall a good film, and puts me in the mood for the next: The Incredible Hulk.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IRON MAN (no spoilers),"*Ok. I have to admit, I am not a HUGE Iron Man reader, or The Avengers, really, either. So if you are a purist, then I have no applicable idea as to how the movie compared to the series. HOWEVER, I have read a few Iron Man/Avengers story-arcs, so I am not completely out of touch with the character itself.*I have some serious questions that need to be answered here:Q: Why Robert Downey Jr.? A: Because he's AWESOME. Downey Jr. is what you might call...A REAL ACTOR. Unlike so many less-than-exceptional actors that have been playing superheroes since, well, the dawn of time (a few exceptions can be made, yes, feel free to list them in rebuttal comments), Downey Jr. captured the highs and lows of Tony Stark as perfectly as he was allowed to. It was clear that he was held back a bit by director Jon Favreau, who has a tendency to do such things to actors. Sometimes it works (i.e. ""Elf"") and sometimes it hinders a bit, as is the case for Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark. That said, Downey Jr. still conquered Tonk Stark with a mighty and powerful...OK, now I am just thinking of him naked.Q: Why Gweneth Paltrow? A: Only God knows why she is in any movie. Ever. Wes Anderson did with her what he could. John Favreau gave up, I imagine, halfway through filming. Chemistry of a doorknob, that woman.Q: Why couldn't they make the action sequences in Transformers more like the phenomenal and easy-to-follow, non-distracting action sequences in Iron Man? A: Because Michael Bay is a budget-waster and should be put on trial and convicted of murder for the crap-fest that was Transformer's action sequences. The vomit in my tummy threatens to erupt at the very thought of the upcoming Michael Bay remake of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". John Favreau did an excellent job of maintaining my increased heart-rate and keeping me ever-so-slightly panicked, without over-doing the action to the point of disbelief.Q: Where can I get a robotic suit like Iron Man's? A: In my wildest fantasies. Seriously, if it wasn't weird enough that I had all kinds of crazy superhero fetishes before, now I have to be into robots? Whoever did the character design for the Iron Man itself did a superb job. Say it with me, Joe, superb. From the first moment you lay eyes on it, it oozes with personality. If you can suspend your disbelief like I can, then you will get the maximum effect. I encourage this.A few otherwise notable things:The character and plot development was well thought out and although the plot was fairly predictable at times, it was no more predictable than your average graphic novel, which is what I like in a movie based on graphic novels.This movie is entirely appropriate for most kids, as long as you don't mind your kids getting more anti-brown-people ideas placed in their minds by the media. The writers did a fair job at not making it an ""us against them"" situation, but it's still something to put on the discussion table with your kids after the viewing.There is much, much more to this movie, but in the interest of keeping my ""no spoilers"" word, I'll just say that Iron Man isn't perfect, but it isn't crappy, either. I was expecting crappy. I ended up getting new images to, um, ponder in my ""me"" time...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Close But No Cigar,"It's amazing what a wonderful package director Jon Favreau gave us with this 2008 feature. I also have to applaud the excellent cast choice as far as appearance goes. I feel that Downey executed the role with flying colors. I was impressed with the accuracy Marvel kept with this new franchise, however, I can only say that overall, this movie came close to being a hit in my heart but no cigar.We are exposed to the whole origins of Iron Man in this movie. We are also given lots of high-end graphics, exploding action, and even a light risqué motif as we follow Tony Stark on his way to becoming the Iron Man we all know and love. I do have to say this, the movie built me up with so much consistency to the comic, non-stop action, and even though this day and age CGI is overused and has become a modern day film standard, the graphics were indeed, a work of art. Then we reach the ending. It does not matter if the movie gained 100/100 stars up until then. That ending killed it, and killed it fast. I was not pleased with how abrupt the franchise chapter closed, and found the teaser a touch cliché.So is this worth the time to watch and/or the money to purchase/rent? I would have to say yes for the younger audience. Overall, the film is a fun family feature, so do pass around the popcorn. I simply feel that it could have been done a touch different, and ended a little more cleaner. This is indeed apart of the curse of the year 2008, where a truly GREAT feature has yet to release, but I will cut this one as a GOOD film. Let's see what happens in the sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worst Iron Man? Or just amazing Character Development?,"I enjoyed Iron Man 1, but not like I did with Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3. I mean it's still not a bad movie but the other 2 are better. I don't know if that's just the character of Tony Stark that's developing or if it's actually just a bad movie for me. Iron Man fighting against his former colleague wasn't that interesting for me. The first half with the Ten Rings was pretty interesting though, so still a solid 6/10 for a nice movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A tried and tested conversion from comic to silver screen,"Series -whether they're TV, comic, books - have a problem when they get made for the big screen. You have a hero, you have a villain, you have the love interest, and in a series the hero wins, but never destroys the villain (and like wise, somewhere in the story, the villain usually has the hero in a life or death situation, that they can get out of). When moved to the silver screen, the rich back stories and free flowing nature of the characters that makes them so long running ends up truncated for mass appeal, usually involving some family member or work colleague (Tomb Raider, Mission Impossible, Charlies Angels, S.W.A.T.), rather than expanding on a story line from the original series. Ironman is no different. You have the man in the flying metal suit, you have the love interest, you have a bad guy to stop, all tied up with plenty of amazing CGI and a thumping soundtrack. It's definitely the Robert Downey Jr. show, and he plays the flamboyant Stark with flair. The fact they cast a great actor like Paul Bettany in a none acting role (simply voice work) shows how much the team behind this film have invested in it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
You're a man that has everything... and nothing.,"There are only a small handful of superheroes I like, and it's not because they have muscles the size of buildings or outlandish superpowers - it's because they are self-made heroes, ones that are just as much human as you and I. And in that pool falls a man with the incredible mental capacity to create a suit of armor that he can use to protect the people of his city (and eventually, the universe).Iron Man is an extremely interesting hero because of that reason - he isn't limited by his powers and can continue to iterate on his creation and make it better to combat his enemies. He doesn't have a single source of weakness (cough cough Kryptonite), but is human like the rest of us and has people he cares about. But ultimately, Iron Man shines where the rest don't by placing an enigmatic Tony Stark into a situation he can't charm his way out of - the way Stark develops as a character (and all the praises for Downey's incredible depiction of him) forces him to evaluate himself and find a way to adapt and innovate, just like his father. With Jeff Bridges bringing up the evil, the Iron Monger is yet another spectacular addition to the film - Tony found a way to survive earlier, but now he has to find a way to destroy the very thing he created, to exploit his own weakness and find a way to learn from it. These elements come together and paint a beautiful picture of loneliness, self-development and the capacity for any man to be more than what he is.While I'm not a huge fan of Iron Man (the lacklustre villains really get me here, aside from Iron Monger), I certainly appreciate this film and love what it does with the superhero genre. Similar tones from Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy are present in Iron Man, and they certainly raise the bar for what a superhero film can be.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Above Average,"""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downing Jr.) is a wealthy industrialist who specializes in the making of military hardware. While in Afghanistan demonstrating a new missile system he is seriously injured while being kidnapped by militants. Fortunately a doctor who was also kidnapped named ""Yinsen"" (Shaun Tomb) manages to keep Tony alive with a new device that is hooked up to his heart and powered by a car battery. Effective but crude. Naturally, it isn't long before Tony manages to make some improvements upon it in order to allow him greater mobility and a better power source. Once that is accomplished he then sets about creating an armored suit for himself while his captors think he is building his new missile system for them. Anyway, rather than disclosing all of the details let me just say that at first I wasn't expecting too much from this movie figuring that it was nothing but action and CGI. And while it definitely has both of these elements it also has some great humor and pretty good acting as well. Along with that, Gwyneth Paltrow (as ""Pepper Potts"") and Leslie Bibb (""Christine Everhart"") also add some rather nice scenery. In short, this turned out to be an extremely pleasant surprise for me and I heartedly recommend this movie for all audiences. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
