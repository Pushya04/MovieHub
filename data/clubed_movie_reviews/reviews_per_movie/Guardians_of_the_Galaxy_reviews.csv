Guardians of Galaxy,"One of the funniest Marvel films is a comedy movie with distinction. A simple story. All the heroes of the film were excellent, especially Drax, Rocket, Groot, and Alcmestri among the heroes of the film was excellent. The music scene was great, especially Come And Get Your Love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"FUNNY, FULL OF HEART AND VISUALLY DAZZLING","Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy is a smart, funny, bright, weird and exciting movie.
It's a dazzling spectacle of gloriously bizarre entertainment. It boasts of a talented cast, an awesome soundtrack and great special effects.
Guardians feels at once both epic and intimate. James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy's one of Marvel's best films to date.

One of the best mcu films,It is a very fun and entertaining film. The story and screenplay is amazing. The direction by James Gunn is awesome. The CGI and visual effects of the film are outstanding. The film is one of the best MCU films humor wise. The performances of the cast are great. All the main characters are very likable. Definitely a must watch even if you aren't a superhero movie lover.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of my fav movie,"I don't know how marvel did that but man this movie was something, TBH I wasn't sure if that movie will success because It sounded like silly for me when I heard about talking raccoon and tree, suddenly they became one of my favorite characters in the MCU , Sorry marvel I was wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, Exciting and Soulfull","First off I just wanted to say how amazing this movie is. Everything is perfect from the soundtrack, colors, characters, visuals, storyline and tone. This movie is funny but can be serious when it needs to be, the characters have actual personalities and they grow as well. The soundtrack fits and is absolutely perfect, the color scheme completely matches the tone of the movie and the storyline connects and makes sense. My only problem is probably the villain, he could come off as cliche but he wasn't that bad and was an alright villain. 9/10, definitely recommend, you don't even have to do like marvel to like this movie it's just so fun!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Resurrection of forgotten heroes!,"The biggest appeal of this movie, well there isn't one. There is multiple...the colours, the music, the action and the comedy all combine to create an epic and crazily fun superhero flick. The characters are really well written and all have great chemistry with on another. Along with the dialogue this allows the characters to be quite funny and have some really strong one-liners. The villain isn't terrible either but nothing special, he's pretty much just a strong guy that works for an even stronger guy. The plot is excellent, everything fits together well and moves at a good pace which means the film is very rewatchable. The action and special effects are obviously amazing, it is a high budget marvel movie after all, what do you expect? The soundtrack tho! So good, it pairs excellently with the humour and is brilliantly placed and timed with each scene. Even the actual movie theme(not the MUSIC music) is terrifically triumphant. Coming back to the characters, what makes them so special is that each one of them has a blatantly obvious flaw that means they all have competition with each other and gives so many options when it comes to humour and overall scenes and plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Visually Stunning Galaxy,"With each new film they release, Marvel outdo themselves time after time, from 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and now to this amazing and irreverent superhero space opera packed full of humour and action in a visually stunning galaxy. Admittedly, I have slowly become more and more bored with superhero films since the high point of DC's 'The Dark Knight' and Marvel's 'Avengers', however 'Guardians' was something that was truly different, something that truly blew me away and has, as a result, become what is arguably my favourite Marvel film. Previous Marvel films have tried too hard to place humour in situations that didn't require it, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' however employs it frequently and due to the constant stream of jokes it works perfectly. Chris Pratt is by far one of Marvel's best casting choices since Robert Downey Jr. as 'Iron Man', even beyond this the other acting bodies were cast perfectly. The visual effects are utterly stunning and the battle scenes are epic, 'Guardians' is a truly amazing and thrilling superhero flick full of visual splendour.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""The Avengers"" of space","The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.This popular 2014 film was based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). The movie details how these characters meet and become the Guardians of the Galaxy as they square off against Ronan (Lee Pace), Nebula (Karen Gillan) and the intimidating Thanos (Josh Brolin). Michael Rooker is also on hand as Yondu, the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from earth when he was a boy.I'm only familiar with the 70's team, which included Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax, as well as the villains Thanatos and Ronan. It was fun seeing these characters come to life on the big screen. The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious-albeit-still-amusing tone of ""Thor"" and ""Thor 2.""Despite that cavil, I liked the way these independent, misfit anti-heroes slowly learn to gel as a team and even care for each other as the story progresses. Their initial selfish goals morph into a noble universal cause. Gamora is my favorite character, followed by Drax, Rocket and Groot. The sinister Thanos -- Jim Starlin's knock-off of Jack Kirby's Darkseid -- is excellently depicted in his brief appearance.The film runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Pelvic sorcery saves the galaxy,"Like a lot of other people, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. To say it exceeded my expectations would be an understatement. It's a clever and fresh gem in the stable of Marvel films. One of the best they've put out so far. The script is full of funny lines but it's also got lots of good character stuff with earned emotional moments. The action and effects are nice. The cast is great, including those just doing voices. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job blending the comic relief with the superhero. The soundtrack of old pop songs is terrific and integrated into the plot perfectly. The homages to Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and more are fun. Which is the simplest and best word to describe this movie: fun. You'll have a blast watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Extremely over-rated,"I seem to be the only one that found this movie to childish, i think that it was a real big shame that they tried to make the movie so that children were allowed to watch it. For example, not a single human dies during the movie, Starlord just uses his electric shock thing when he fires at humans. And the movie was to ""un-serious"", there were jokes every minute which made it impossible to watch the movie at the cinema because everyone just laughed like hell when there was a small joke that actually wasn't funny at all, well some jokes were a little funny but none of them made me laugh. I may sound like a horrible person for doing this but the only time i laughed was at the beginning of the movie when (SPOILER ALERT) starlord's mom was lying sick in the hospital, me and my friend started laughing uncontrollably and i don't even know why. I guess that we started laughing because we knew that you aren't supposed to laugh to those things. Everyone stared at us... Anyways the movie also had lots of predictibale moments and some parts of it was a little clichè, (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT) and the end battle that they made you look forward to was the most anti climax end to a movie i have ever seen, they killed the main villain so quick. Overall the effects and animated things in the movie were extremely good, the setting was good, the jokes were al little entertaining but there were way too many jokes in the movie and there was a lack of death and gore, the the movie was way too short and the characters didn't have time to develop, and the plot was way to predictable and cliché. You didn't see any blood or gore during the movie at all which made the movie way to comedic. I would prefer the movie to be more serious and ""grown up"". I would give it 6/10 but that is for people over 11 y.o, for a child this movie would be perfect, from the perspective of a child i would have given it 9.5/10. And if they had made it less childish i would switch the scores so that it was 9.5/10 for people over 11 and 6/10 for children. I hope that the sequel will be more grown up. (The sequel's plot is also very predictable, if you have seen the first one you will know exactly what will happen in the second one.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
the Rolling Stones of outer space,"So Guardians of the Galaxy is finally out and how is it?....it matches every expectation you had about it. Essentially, it is an absurdly fun, cheesy, old-fashioned space adventure with a superhero edge. For those of you who didn't know, the Guardians are pretty much the polar opposite of the Avengers - they're loud, brash, free-spirited, and most of all.....human....or as human as you can be being 4 aliens and 1 human. Unlike the Avengers, they don't play nice when it comes to saving the galaxy.This movie has so much going for it that you can't really explain it in one paragraph but all you need to know is that the humour is great, the action is non-stop, the drama is riveting and genuinely heartwarming, the soundtrack rocks and unlike most superhero teams - everyone of the guardians are 100% awesome in their own way.I won't spoil the plot for you but i will say that what makes Guardians work so well is that it has a genuinely good-natured, back to basics, rock n' roll approach that has swagger and style aplenty. Despite their late entry into the Marvel franchise, rest assured that the guardians are here stay and will be defending a galaxy near you soon.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Surprisingly Awesome,"Overall, the movie just...works. The cast was great, the soundtracks were invigorating, the plot was perfect! The movie may not tell us about the origin of each of the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy, it was still capable of showing us the personality of each character, with tidbits of their own histories, while still moving forward towards how they came together as a team. This is certainly one of my favorites!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
There is a lot to like,"When planning how I was going watch all these MCU films, this is one I earmarked as being one I thought I'd enjoy - not based on anything of note, I knew very little, but from the passing screenshots and such I had seen it seemed like one I'd enjoy. I'm happy to say I certainly did!'Guardians of the Galaxy' is so enjoyable. It's 121 minutes of pure entertainment. It does, at least to me, have a different feel to it when compared to the nine preceding MCU films. That's not a negative for either this or those earlier productions, it just felt different to me.I particularly enjoyed the cast, which features - as is customary at this point - a load of well known names. Chris Pratt is, probably, the perfect choice for Peter, he carries the role extremely well - his humour sticks out, but he also performs the more serious stuff nicely.Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker are all thoroughly enjoyable too. Vin Diesel (kinda?) appears to portray Groot, which pleases me as someone who is a big fan of 'Fast & Furious'. There are a few others in there, including Djimon Hounsou and Benicio del Toro. Terrific cast!There is a lot to like here. I look forward to seeing the follow-ups to it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Generally funny and entertaining, helping it get over the occasional more serious hump","A lot of articles have been written about just how many comic-book hero movies there are in the market and planned for the coming years; they talk about viewer fatigue and market saturation and other such terms. They perhaps have a point but it is hard to really pay it much mind when the genre produces films which are fun and entertaining. With its massive success and the fact that it comes with association to already successful franchises, Guardians of the Galaxy perhaps looks like an easy film, but I do wonder how much people were taking a risk when they greenlit a sci-fi film based on an pretty much unknown comic book series, with a lot of things that could potentially have been really silly; seeing Howard the Duck in here is also a reminder of how something that is quite cool in theory can fail to connect to the audience.What makes it work though is that it is really light fun, easy to get lost in because you are laughing or smiling for the majority of it. It is at its best when the main characters are allowed to do their thing, with the best laughs coming from the banter between them (who would have thought that wrestler Bautista would have such great comic timing). The silliness is kept at bay by how tightly funny it is; it is sharp, daft, cool and engaging. The actors do well, with Pratt being charming fun, Saldana being more than just a figure, Cooper having a lot of presence with his voice, Bautista getting lots of laughs with his straight delivery, while Vin Diesel (who must have wondering if they were making fun of him with this casting) produces one of the most lovable characters with only a few lines of dialogue.While the cast have good timing, it should also be said that the film does too – for example cutting away briefly during an action sequence for one line to get a good laugh. The film unfortunately is not quite as strong when it has more serious or narrative driven moments. The opening of the film is a good example of this, but it is just as relevant during more intense moments or serious 'franchise' moments, because it still needs to be a film. The mix just about works, and the laughs, fun and cool silliness carry it across moments where it has none of this.It is not a work of art, and it is not as remarkable or brilliant as some would have you believe, but it is still very entertaining. In a genre filled with action-packed but overly serious films, or films that are just silly in a bad way, it is quite refreshing to be able to watch such a film, laugh all the way through it and come out having enjoyed it a lot for how well it balances, judges and delivers the humor consistently.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Flaws but Decent on Action and Plot,"Guardians of the Galaxy starring Chris Pratt as Peter Quill proves to be the ideal leading man, carrying the bulk of the film and making the cocky, self-centered Quill likable enough to garner our sympathies and get us to root for his redemption without dulling the guy's edge. Saldana is the perfect foil for him, cutting Quill down to size before falling for him. It's Diesel and Cooper who steal the majority of the spotlight, however; Rocket and Groot are fascinating and wonderfully realized creations, and the two actors do a superb job of acting through the CGI ""makeup"" to make them stand out as flesh and blood people. Cooper's approach to the killer raccoon plumbs new levels of sarcasm. Bautista also surprises; Drax is written as an alien whose people take everything literally, setting up some choice gags that the former MMA fighter-turned- thespian delivers with perfect timing and the deadest of deadpan deliveries. In the end the film has been praised and the hype has matched the praise, however the film struggles mid way and becomes a decent action film. Perhaps a second and more viewing would be necessary.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Stunning Surprise,"Guardians of the Galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie. If there's anything I can say, it's that it is the best superhero movie I have seen. Not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. It also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness.The film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves locked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a gun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who just happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at portraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every character in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket Raccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even Batista!For those that want specifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines were compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well done, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely worry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go see this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Please !,"this movie is so overrated, I said my peace, and don't care what other people say. There are no strong performances by any of the cast. Why was Bradley cooper in this movie. Plot was the worst of any marvel movie to date, including Daredevil. Okay that was mean it was better than Daredevil. But i think the worst thing about this movie is how so many people are willing to sacrifice themselves proving how good this was. lines and lines of hate rants to people who are just voicing their opinion. Not everyone has to like it. Also it is worth noting that the villain in this film Ronan was very cartoonist and generic. nothing against Marvel in this point, James Gunn has a history of this with his movies like Slither, and super. Not a bad director, but has a lot of development to experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A sprawling space opera full of humor and action.,"I remember sitting in Hall H at Comic-Con two years ago, when Marvel first announced Guardians of the Galaxy. This came on the heels of the title reveals for Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World, and my initial reaction was one of utter confusion. What the hell was Guardians of the Galaxy? I was completely unfamiliar with the source material, and upon learning that the team featured a gun-wielding raccoon and a fighting tree creature whose could only speak a single phrase, I was even more puzzled.Fast forward to Comic-Con 2013, when James Gunn appeared onstage in Hall H to showcase the first trailer for the film. It was so unlike anything Marvel had ever done before, so far outside the box that I immediately fell in love with it and couldn't wait to see more. Although that first trailer was well-received by the Comic-Con audience, the general public seemed to be scratching their heads in much the same way that I had when the film was first announced. Marvel fans would love this, no doubt, but could this bizarre little sci-fi romp with a cast of unknown characters actually work?The answer is a resounding ""yes,"" as Guardians of the Galaxy is not only an exceptionally well-made comic-book film, but an exceptionally well- made film, period. It's a sprawling space opera with a host of memorable characters, a joyous sci-fi romp through beautifully realized worlds, wildly inventive action sequences, and an almost nonstop barrage of humor and fun. The protagonists are a bizarre assembly of losers and misfits, with the CG-created Rocket and Groot providing some of the most emotional and human moments of the film, and it's all brilliant. Marvel should be applauded for allowing Gunn the opportunity to realize his vision, because rest assured, this film wouldn't have been nearly as good with someone else at the helm.Guardians of the Galaxy has a distinct personality that sets it apart from other Marvel offerings, yet there are enough recognizable elements to remind audiences that it exists in the same world. Clocking in at just under two hours, the film maintains an impressively well-balanced pace, avoiding the problem of over-inflation that many superhero films fall victim to. I can't think of a single moment when I wasn't completely enthralled with everything that happens on screen, and as soon as the credits began to roll I was ready to watch it all over again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I was smiling almost all the way through,"Expectations: surpassed - and they were pretty damn high to begin with.Excitement: met - after watching the teasers, the clips, and after Captain America the Winter soldier I was crossing my fingers Marvel were on a roll.Face: still trying to recover - you know when you go to the cinema to see a comedy ( a film designed to make you laugh ) and you feel like an idiot for paying for the ticket as you were forcing most of the laughter in the company of your friends? This is a film that it's genuinely easy to laugh about:The humour is so subtle because the characters are so subtle - they're not too animated, they're not too stereotypical and they are NOT what we've come to expect from traditional superheroes and THAT'S WHY THIS FILM WORKS SO WELL! Regardless if you're a Marvel fan or simply a fan of movies in general this is an experience you will welcome as it's new and refreshing to a sci-fi genre which really needed something new and refreshing and with great performances, stunning visuals and a barrel of laughs mixed with the right amount of action this was a real treat to watch.Thank you Marvel Studios.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"James Gunn, a crazy genius.","I honestly believe Guardians of the Galaxy would never have worked without James Gunn. I have to reluctantly admit that Joss Whedon put it the best when he said: ""James Gunn is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart.""The casting was fantastic. Each of the major actors fit their roles like a glove.And it's another example of how music elevates a movie. GoG is he first MCU movie to actually have real songs (nostalgic 70's music) played throughout, setting the tone in the first 30 seconds with the melancholic I'm Not In Love by 10CC.But what really sets this apart from all the others MCU movies before this is the mastery of the humor. I think this is the first Marvel movie that I busted my gut a bazillion times while watching. Nearly everything that comes out of Drax's mouth and so many quotable quotes it would fill up a cassette tape.It is so apropos that James Gunn was tapped to reboot Suicide Squad. I hope his R rated version kills at the box office and makes Kevin Feige reconsider his stupid ""only PG-13"" for MCU movies (except Deadpool 3) rule.""We are Groot.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A New Hope,"I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job. DC are still trying hard to get Justice League going, Marvel just made a film with a talking tree and Raccoon and it was AWESOME!!!Not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout. Probably my top Marvel film yet, it has the fresh new feeling the first Iron Man had with all the action and humour of The Avengers. 10 stars from me, even if your not a comic book or sci-fi fan, this movie has something for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Overrated?,"I saw this movie the other day, and I liked it...it was pretty fun, but as I walked out I said to myself, ""why is this SO popular?"" I don't think this would be even a quarter as popular as it is if it were not a Marvel movie. I think people see the Marvel logo and rush to see it. I have good friends that saw it that don't like science fiction at all. It was a good movie but it's wasn't that great...I personally thought Gamora was awful, while Drax was surprisingly really great!What do I base my opinion on that this is only big because it's Marvel? Serenity/Firefly....almost the same thing, yet Serenity didn't make hardly anything. I wish movies could be judged based on their stand alone quality, and not just people that live and die by Marvel. I did enjoy the darker side of the movie, it didn't feel like the typical Marvel movie which can get kind of tiring with all the puns, and kiddy humor.Did anyone else feel the same? Just ask themselves why this is doing AS well as it is? I am a DC girl, but I enjoy both. My favorite is Superman, and my second favorite is Captain America",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Beautiful Space Fantasy,"It's no surprise that when Marvel's latest movie was released many, many people (the non comics reading kind, mainly) said ""Who?"" The comic itself has never been what you call top tier, with various incarnations having been around for decades, although the film is based on the team created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning in 2008, now being serviced by top writer Brian Bendis.Marvel certainly have made sure the Guardians have plenty of publicity, turning a bunch of also rans into a must see event and even having the confidence to proclaim ""The Guardians Of The Galaxy Will Return"" at the end of the movie. This is a company with the utmost confidence in their product, and after seeing it it's very easy to understand why.First and foremost, Guardians... is fun. After a truly heartbreaking beginning everything goes a bit daft, mixing swashbuckling sci fi action with larger than life characters, and whilst at first you may be a little puzzled, it all streamlines into a simple plot soon enough. Basically, Guardians leader Peter Quill (known mainly to only himself as Star Lord) has a plot device, and other people also want the plot device. He forms an alliance with a very disparate bunch of people who each have their own reason for helping him. To go into more detail really isn't that necessary, as all it will involve is laying out a roster of names and personal grievances, and you'll get all that when you watch the film, because if you're reading this review I will lay odds you're going to see it.The movie looks beautiful throughout, probably thanks to the thousand or so ""Digital Artists"" who take up a large part of the end credits. Ship design is fantastic, with many looking like they were pulled direct from a Chris Foss art book, and if you know Foss you'll know this is a high compliment. Yeah, the bad guys have dull, dark vessels with inadequate lighting (surely evil needs to see as well?) but the good guys have some sexy vessels indeed. Sound wise, it may seem odd that a 2014 state of the art sci fi movie will have a 1970's chart soundtrack, but the inclusion of The Runaways, Rupert Holmes and, of course, Blue Swede's ""Hooked On A Feeling"" is completely explained and rather poignant. It would be nice, too, if kids start downloading some of this awesome old stuff and finally start listening to real music (so speaks an old fart).So in a nutshell this is a very good movie. It's packed with fun and enjoyable characters, but also has it's fair share of down beats and dead beats. Top honours are fought out for between Chris Pratt, excellent and ridiculously likable as Peter Quill, and the brilliant Rocket Raccoon, a purely CGI character stuffed with attitude and some great one liners. The other main characters all do well, however, with even big bag Ronan (no, not the Boyzone one, mores the pity) being well served and very well played with menace aforethought by Lee Pace.One thing people want to know about Marvel films is what's the after credits scene like? Well, without being spoilery, I'll say two things: one, it's NOT a big reveal or anything like that, but two, it's really funny if you have a knowledge of a certain old Marvel character. Oh yeah, and you get to play everyone's favourite game in the movie - 'Spot Stan Lee'. It just wouldn't be the same without him mugging it up somewhere.In closing, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is right up there with the rest of Marvel's cinematic output, making a clear mark by being totally different to anything else we've so far seen. It's Fun with a capital 'F', and engaging throughout. Some of the violence may be a bit much for smaller kids, and there's a bit of moderately fruity language (is 'dick' fruity still? I fall behind sometimes). That said, kids who don't mind a walking tree impaling people or a raccoon murderising people with a kick ass gun will have a blast. Big, beautiful and bad ass, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" is definitely the feel good fantasy of 2014, as evidenced by the grin still stuck to my face. All together now...

A Colourful Cosmic Adventure with Heart,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired July 21, 2014. It has a runtime of two hours. Guardians of the Galaxy was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by James Gunn. It was also created by Nicole Perlman. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Some of the Characters were created by Bill Mantlo, Keith Giffen, Jim Starlin, Steve Englehart, Steve Gan, Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik.Summary: In a universe teetering on the brink of chaos, a ragtag group of intergalactic misfits comes together to form an unlikely alliance.Review: -I found the storyline to be both engaging and fast-paced, which kept me thoroughly entertained while immersing viewers in new worlds and characters within the MCU. I found the casting to be good; the actors were well-matched to their roles, and their performances felt genuine within the film's context. I really appreciated the scene following the opening; I thought that it was a wonderful way to transition the film after the poignant beginning. The film's blend of action and comedy was particularly enjoyable; the clever dialogue and humorous scenarios provided a refreshing levity amidst its more serious moments. I appreciated how the movie delved into themes of friendship, loyalty, and the concept of found family. The interactions among the diverse group of characters beautifully illustrated how individuals from vastly different backgrounds can unite to forge meaningful relationships. I loved that the film featured classic hits from the '70s and '80s. This nostalgic soundtrack not only enhances the emotional resonance of the film but also introduces younger audiences to music from earlier decades, significantly contributing to its overall charm. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. However, I felt a bit disappointed that translations were not provided for dialogue spoken in other languages.I appreciated the film's cinematography, I liked the film's use of wide shots to establish settings and highlight the vastness of space and alien worlds, allowing viewers to understand the scale of these environments. For example, wide shots effectively showcase spacecraft in relation to their surroundings. Medium shots focus on characters while providing context about their environment, particularly during scenes with the Guardians that reveal their relationships. Close-ups are used strategically during key dialogues and action sequences to emphasize characters' emotions. Over-the-shoulder shots enhance conversations by immersing viewers in the dialogue while maintaining spatial awareness. The film employs tracking shots to fluidly follow characters through various environments, enhancing the dynamism of action sequences. Aerial shots capture large-scale battles and events, while Dutch angles introduce tension and chaos by tilting the camera. Point-of-view (POV) shots immerse viewers in characters' experiences during critical moments, such as Rocket's battle preparations and Star-Lord's perilous navigation. Establishing shots effectively introduce new locations before shifting to closer coverage.I appreciated the use of CGI in the film, which significantly contributed to crafting a rich and immersive universe that felt both vast and intricately detailed. The vibrant colour palette, paired with imaginative alien designs and environments, captured considerable attention. For example, the portrayal of planets such as Xandar and Knowhere featured elaborate details that enriched the storytelling experience. The character design, especially for Rocket Raccoon and Groot, was brought to life through advanced motion capture technology. This seamless integration of CGI with live-action performances resulted in a convincing representation of these fantastical characters. The visual effects team employed cutting-edge techniques to create realistic textures and movements for both characters and their surroundings. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. In the film, we transition between locations, and I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.-I enjoyed meeting the characters, each of whom possessed unique backgrounds and personalities. Gamora was depicted as a strong and capable warrior, challenging the stereotypes often associated with female characters in action films at the time of the movie's release. Characters like Groot and Rocket offer representation for non-human figures who remain relatable despite their alien origins. The film effectively subverts traditional superhero tropes by showcasing flawed heroes who do not fit the mold of typical paragons of virtue. Each character confronts personal struggles and moral complexities, making them more relatable to audiences who value intricate storytelling. This diversity enriches representation within the superhero genre.-Personally I felt that the movie could have benefited from being slightly shorter, as it seemed a bit lengthy. However, I really enjoyed the ending and appreciated the extra scene after the credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.8 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Bold, brave and beautifully weird.","You might expect a movie studio at the top of its game to play it safe rather than strike out in new, bizarre directions. Certainly, it's hard to imagine any other studio giving the greenlight to Guardians Of The Galaxy - a huge blockbuster movie based on a title unfamiliar to anyone who isn't a comics aficionado, starring a relatively unknown actor playing a character most people have never heard of. And yet, Marvel scores once again with its willingness to head off the beaten track. GUARDIANS is a fun, fizzy delight, even as it mines some surprising depths of emotion from its ragtag group of anti-heroes.Peter Quill (Pratt) - a human abducted from Earth as a child - has grown up into an intergalactic thief who has no idea what he's getting into when he takes possession of a mysterious Orb. Little does he know that Ronan (Pace) - a genocidal Kree radical - will do just about anything to get his hands on said Orb, including sending alien assassin Gamora (Saldana) after it. Gamora, as it turns out, has an agenda of her own. Trapped in an intergalactic prison (long story), Peter and Gamora are forced into an uneasy alliance with three other misfits: a brainy, sarcastic raccoon-like creature named Rocket (voiced by Cooper), a giant tree by the name of Groot (Diesel), and the vengeance-minded Drax The Destroyer (Bautista).The truth is that there's almost too much going on in GUARDIANS. Not only do we meet a host of characters we've never met before, on a raft of new planets teeming with brightly coloured life and detail, we're also introduced to several plot lines all stuffed somewhat awkwardly into the film. We have Ronan's planet-destroying aspirations, which are somehow bound up with the evil plans of Thanos - that creepy purple- skinned dude who popped up at the end of The Avengers. Peter's kidnappers turned surrogate 'family' are also on the trail of the Orb, turning up at moments both enormously convenient and inconvenient to the plot. It all makes sense in the end, but until it all clicks into place, it can make for a rushed, unsettling experience.But, despite its occasionally unwieldy script, GUARDIANS triumphs because of the gang of scruffy losers (a term that will take on a different, more heartfelt meaning during the film) at its heart. Director James Gunn, who co-wrote the script, clearly feels a strong affinity for each one of these outcasts, all of whom are easily outlaws in some (if not all) parts of the solar system, each one battling - at least initially - to save his or her own skin rather than to save the world. It's fascinating to watch the five members of this unlikely group slowly banter, bicker and batter their way into becoming a team.Most joyfully of all, Gunn never loses sight of the prickly, selfish side of his characters. He gives them plenty of rich, emotional moments - whether it's Peter and Gamora bonding over the loss of their parents, or Rocket's ability to read a whole range of meaning into Groot's extremely limited vocabulary ('I am Groot') - but never allows the film to descend into dangerously sentimental territory.In fact, Gunn pumps up proceedings with a healthy, hearty dose of humour. Films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) have always been more tongue-in-cheek than the likes of the considerably more dour Dark Knight franchise, but GUARDIANS is a heady trip of a different order. It practically delights in bursts of odd, subversive comedy, and actually dares to punctuate its most epic face-off with a sly homage to, of all things, Footloose.Pratt - so winning in TV's Parks And Recreation - holds the emotional core of the film together. He exudes an easy, rakish charm that makes Peter both dashingly arrogant and achingly vulnerable. He's matched very well by Saldana, who is clearly delighting in the opportunity to play the world-weary, no-nonsense Gamora - bred into a killer, born a fighter. The rest of the cast does justice, too, to the film's cheerful swing from drama to comedy and back again: Bautista brings unexpected pathos to Drax's occasionally comical determination to avenge his family against Ronan, while Cooper sounds completely unlike himself - in a very good way - as a creature who hides a world of hurt beneath his mouthy exterior. Even Diesel manages to find a great deal of depth in a CGI character who only communicates via the same languid burst of three words.If anything, GUARDIANS is let down by a trio of not particularly threatening villains. Pace snarls and spits in heavy make-up, but can't quite rustle up much in the way of nuance or genuine menace. Ronan is a one-note madman, with so little in the way of backstory that he automatically becomes less interesting. Thanos, too, now voiced and performed in motion-capture by Brolin, doesn't get much to do beyond lounge on his space throne. Only Gillan's cyborg Nebula manages a smidgen of complexity; even then, she struggles to be half as fascinating as her conflicted ""sister"", Gamora.Before the film was even released in cinemas, Marvel announced that a sequel would be coming in 2017. It's a no-brainer as to why. The film is smart, funny and quite wonderful on its own merits. But, even more crucially, GUARDIANS is a gamble that pays off handsomely for Marvel. It opens up the MCU in, quite literally, all directions. Don't be surprised if you see our more earth-bound heroes heading into space sooner rather than later. The film also adds a new cast of lovable rogues to the MCU's roster of characters: a gang who, one might say, are actually all the more heroic for being people who would ordinarily be running in the opposite direction from any galaxy-guarding duties. Frankly, we can't wait to see what they get up to next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Really good,"Great expectations before the film, definitely, and they really paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best Marvel films to date, and a really good sci-fi at that too. The film is strong on so many levels, outstanding characters, great worlds, is emotional and humorous.Peter Quill, or Star Lord as he likes to call himself, is a quick-witted man of Earth thrown into the far reaches of galaxy, who has stolen an artifact that everyone seems to want. By accident he stumbles upon four other characters, Gamora the assassin, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the enhanced raccoon and Groot the humanoid tree, and the five of them form an unlikely team. The characters are really well presented, their emotional core is strong and back stories engaging. In short, they're interesting and easy to like. All of them have great moments and keep us wanting for more and more. Rocket, in particular, steals the show with his anger management problems and bright one-liners. It was great to see a group of people each with their own agenda come together, this dynamic worked really well. Star-Lord carried a lot of this weight, and was very sympathetic.The film doesn't take itself very seriously, which was refreshing to see after also great yet darker themes of Thor and Captain America 2's. Guardians has a lot of laughs, witty dialogue, characters rub off on each other (and the audience), writing is perfect. The film is so entertaining, non-stop adventure but also knows when to balance with more dramatic themes. Scenery and worlds are spectacular, visual effects top notch. As a reader of the Guardians comics it was great to see some smaller motifs thrown in that may not be necessarily caught by regular viewers, but which the comic book readers will definitely be thankful for too.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy was an awesome watch. Amazing characters, vivid cinematography, great dialogue, lots of humor, soundtrack was nice, story exciting. This wonderful adventure and its captivating characters will be in mind for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date,"(Rating: 12A, 121 mins) Written by Zen TerrelongeStarring – Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Vin DieselIf you've seen the trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy, you'd be within your rights to think Marvel Studio execs have been hitting the bottle hard or taking LSD.The film revolves around a group of dysfunctional but goodhearted criminals – think Robin Hood's Merry Men of the future – comprising human thief Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Pratt), green assassin Gamora (Saldana), talking raccoon Rocket (Cooper), knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), and walking tree Groot (Diesel).Like the Avengers, the Guardians get off to a false start but soon unite over a common cause, namely, the galaxy being obliterated by genocidal maniac, Ronan – not Keating – the Accuser.Ah yes, the old, let's-exterminate-everyone-for-the-mistakes-of-their-forefathers ploy.But unlike Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy oozes offbeat originality and frankly, it's the most unique and delightful film Marvel has created to date.It's a hell of an achievement given the extensive movie library the company is building up and when you consider the characters aren't household names like 'big three' Iron Man, Thor and Captain America, but Marvel seems well aware of that fact with the final production risky to say the least.The film opens in 1988, which is when Quill is abducted from Earth, and 26 years later we see he's become a crooked intergalactic outlaw with a taste for all things shiny, valuable and not his.Given the distinct decade in which he was taken, his cassette player and mixtape of 70s and 80s tracks are laced throughout the film, which creates a quirky yet grounded quality in the midst of all of the dazzling interstellar warfare that takes place along the way.In addition to the soundtrack, jokes and comedy have never been more of a feature in a Marvel film – perhaps Iron Man 3 was the closest – as gags are thrown into the unlikeliest of scenarios to lessen the tension, and I would imagine, to really differentiate itself from Avengers Assemble, Star Wars and Star Trek, which by comparison are left looking very sombre.That said, if you were going to compare Pratt's Quill to someone, the character is quite reminiscent of Chris Pine's Captain James Kirk – smart, womanising, reckless leaders, who eventually find their feet.The editing is supreme and makes each bit of dialogue super-sharp and tight, so when the infamous five are bickering or talking generally, the repartee all feels really clean and natural without being awkward or forced.Thor can be stubborn, Iron Man can be arrogant and Captain America is considered too stiff, but all of the Guardians bring even more wildly different qualities to the table and offer some diversity that doesn't ever grate or bore, which wouldn't have been possible without such excellent casting.Meanwhile, the film is very much in the here and now, with Quill's backstory the only one that truly gets a look-in, which creates a sense of intrigue about his colleagues who only have their pasts hinted at, meaning sequel fodder.There's just no way of knowing where you're going and tonally the movie delivers a piece of everything and it's done big and without hesitation.Guardians may have been a gamble, but I'm Grooting for it to Rocket to the top.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best superhero movie I've ever seen,"I know, I know. This will incontrovertibly attract a lot of hate from die-hard Dark Knight fans, but guess what? I'm one of those who thinks Nolan is the epitome of how to make a perfect superhero spectacle.Or at least, I was until tonight.This film will blow your mind. Quite literally, it is jam-packed with edge-of-your-seat action thrills and pure comedic gold. Don't be expecting a moody companion piece like that of Nolan's trilogy, or Man of Steel. It keeps more in touch with Avengers, although it's a lot funnier and really builds upon the upcoming Infinity Gauntlet arc.The actors are incredible, matching the character developments, the dialogue and action sequences are spectacular and the visual effects should surely earn a nod come Oscar time, as I'd personally put them on par with those seen in the recent Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. The run length compliments the well-scripted pacing of the movie itself, whilst plenty of interesting secondary characters litter Guardians with an ensemble cast that has exceeded anything yet seen in the Marvel/DC movie worlds. I don't pertain to the DC versus Marvel argument, but this masterpiece alone has certainly put Marvel on the front foot in terms of cinema outings, far surpassing the very enjoyable Man of Steel and, I believe, edging out Nolan's trilogy and then some.I thoroughly recommend this for any with a borderline sci-fi/superhero love, and advise you to remain for the tantalising post-credits scene, although many of the non-comic fans might not get the references.Easily a perfect ten out of ten for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun but nothing special,"I was very excited to see this movie. I love sci-fi and super hero movies and considering the glut of them out there, this one was sure to top them all. The good thing is that this movie does not require you to know anything about the back story, the characters, or even what the heck you're getting into other than it's a sci-fi super hero fantasy world. It reminded me of a Firefly meets Indiana Jones combination.The problem I ran into is that it was quite formulaic, quite a bit predictable and overall tried a bit too hard to be funny at times. I'm a big sci-fi geek and am able to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment but the character makeup made them look, well, made up, like I was watching a play as opposed to a feature film. Maybe the fidelity of films are getting so high that it's difficult to mask the makeup, but it just seemed like too much of a distraction to me.In no way am I saying this movie is bad. It's very good. Just not great. Maybe if I was fan of the characters I would have enjoyed it more, but overall I couldn't see it as the smash hit 10/10 everyone is giving it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
'Guardians' is a joyous mash-up of action and heart.,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a motley crew of bickering, bumbling mercenaries driven by self-interest. The film's a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery. James Gunn directed with an effortlessly light touch by low-budget maestro of genre films such as 2006's Slither and 2010's Super. Marvel's fizzy franchise kickoff has tongue-in-cheek B-movie vibe that's more Starcrash than Star Wars. Guardians of the Galaxy feels more like an unofficial sequel to The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension than a Marvel product.The genius of Gunn's superhero send-up is its cheeky, anything-goes absurdity. I've been pretty mixed on Marvel movies over the years - some have dazzled me, others have left me depressed. But Guardians is the first one that feels excitingly unpredictable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Please don't feel like you HAVE to laugh.,"There's a moment in Guardians of the Galaxy when Rocket, the film's talking raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), is accused of faking his laugh; coincidentally, there were quite a few people in the cinema I went to who I could have hurled the same accusation at. Yes, GOTG features a couple of genuinely funny moments, but it also has more than its fair share of gags that fall flat and certainly do not warrant the kind of belly laughs that I could hear (probably coming from deluded Marvel fan-boys).However, even with its frequently-less-than-hilarious comedic moments, this big-budget dollop of sci-fi comic book silliness still manages to be quite a lot of mindless popcorn fun, delivering enough weird and wonderful characters, fantastic worlds, spectacular action set-pieces and impressive special effects wizardry to guarantee a reasonably fun time. Director James Gunn's eclectic and vibrant universe is brimming with such imagination and visual splendour, all accompanied by a poptastic '70s/'80s soundtrack, that the film proves a treat for the senses despite its obvious shortcomings elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
a galaxy full of fun,"On Earth 1988, Peter Quill loses his mother and is taken by a spaceship. Twenty Six years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is caught trying to steal an orb but he manages to escape Korath. The Krees have signed a peace treaty with Nova Prime which is opposed by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan needs the orb to satisfy Thanos who promises to destroy Xandar. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) goes to track down Peter and the orb. Also trying to capture Peter are Rocket and Groot. All four are imprisoned in the Kyln. They escape with the overly literal Drax who has a vendetta against Ronan.This is a rip-roaring fun space opera. Chris Pratt is at the top of his game. This is a bright, wild, crazy ride. There is a lot of Marvel lore to go through for the uninitiated. That's probably my main concern about this movie. The 70s soundtrack is a terrific touch and the humor is infectious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The usual style over substance blockbuster,"The latest blockbuster is out and it delivers in what most blockbusters strive for, style over substance.Very high production values, good score, tight pacing that moves along are unfortunately marred by predictable plot, too many cheap one liners and generally poor dialog. Humour is mostly hit and miss, and is at times just plain dumb..to the point that it seemed intentional. Characters are as expected one dimensional, and hopefully the inevitable sequel will spend a bit more time on their backgrounds.The real downer was the 3D effects or the lack of them, honestly it felt like 3D was just tagged on to the title and many times i pulled off my glasses just to check if there was any 3D effect present at all. Like a good deal of 3D movies out there, its just a nice excuse for studios to rip us out of a few more bucks.If you didn't find the trailers for this movie funny, save yourself a few bucks and wait for a home release.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best the MCU has to offer,"Arguably one of the most unique and powerful films in the MCU or superhero genre in general. Writer & director James Gunn makes this film special. His writing is makes the film special. He makes you cry for a tree, that how well written and fleshed out the character are. The jokes land and the action slaps. The writing also compliments the soundtrack. The music gives the film a very distinct voice. It also hits all the right notes whether it's for comedic effect or a dramatic moment. The star power is this space adventure is immaculate with the cast made up of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldaña, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Lee Pace, John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, and Michael Rooker. The cast is incredible in their respective roles. The cinematography is incredible. The practical effects are amazing and the CGI look amazing. Groot and Rocket look incredible and don't stand out against real set and actors. The makeup and designs look unique and the pacing is really good.

*A Cosmic Gem*,"!! Possible Spoilers!!*Guardians of the Galaxy* is a dazzling cosmic adventure that defies expectations. Director James Gunn assembles a ragtag group of misfits and transforms them into beloved heroes. Chris Pratt's Star-Lord is the perfect blend of charm and leadership, while Zoe Saldana's Gamora, Dave Bautista's Drax, Bradley Cooper's Rocket, and Vin Diesel's Groot provide a hilarious and heartwarming ensemble.The film's blend of action, humor, and heart is unparalleled. Gunn's masterful storytelling creates a world that is both familiar and utterly original. The soundtrack is an inspired choice, perfectly capturing the film's retro-futuristic vibe.The film's humor is its secret weapon. Gunn's impeccable comedic timing and witty dialogue elevate the characters and create unforgettable moments. The dynamic between the Guardians is a masterclass in ensemble comedy, with each character contributing their unique brand of humor. From Drax's literal-minded quips to Rocket's cynical sarcasm, the film delivers laugh-out-loud moments throughout.Beyond the laughs and action, *Guardians of the Galaxy* explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and redemption. The characters' personal journeys are as compelling as the overarching plot.This film is a testament to the power of great storytelling and character development. It's a must-see for fans of the superhero genre and anyone looking for a fun and unforgettable cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great space adventure,"Good lord, I did not expect this movie to be as good as it was. Where as I usually prefer the more mature and serious MCU movies, this is a wonderful exception. It's funny, it's lighthearted and it's imaginative. That does not mean it's lacking good characters. Each of the Guardians have their own struggles and quirks, while also being very likeable and funny. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where the characters just talk, which shows just how good the chemistry between them are. The plot is fairly simple, yet engaging, and the pacing is really good. The action is well made, the emotional moments are good, the climax feels pretty climactic. I do have a few issues though. Firstly, while the villain seems to have a reason for his actions, he's still very one-dimentional and boring thematically. I also got a little tired of the ""end of the world"" trope which seems to be in most superhero films these days, even though this movie handled it better than most other movies I've seen it in. The comedy was also a little too silly for my liking, but it wasn't a big deal. These flaws don'r ruin the movie in the slighest though, as this is a fun, exciting and engaging experience that I highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A refreshing and amusing take on the superhero genre.,"I'm quite a casual fan of Marvel comics and their movies, so I didn't know much about Guardians of the Galaxy going in nor was I expecting much.The blend of action and humour was great. The tone of the film, which I think is balanced very well, was perfectly set in the opening sequence. The comedy especially was actually funny. I think this is largely down to the fact that the characters were so thoroughly well established, with each character having decent screen time. None of them felt underdeveloped and you felt connected to all of the main cast.By and large the acting was very good, stand out being Chris Pratt. A very strong performance as well as delivering on the comedy. The movie is really hinged on him as a central protagonist, and he did a great job of leading the narrative as well as standing out as a character in his own right. Even former wrestler Dave Bautista did a good job. He didn't exactly have a huge range to deal with, but he delivered the serious parts and he was also pretty funny. The writers definitely played to his strengths which showed.The writing in general was very good. It is a well structured film, and is kept moving along at a reasonable pace. The dialogue is expertly written, with great gags and jokes delivered in great timing.The cinematography and visual fx were fantastic. It's a very good looking film, easy to watch and choreographed well. It had a great blend of sci-fi almost Spielberg-esque visuals, which I think gives the film a distinctive look from the other Marvel movies. The CGI was generally very good. Groot and Rocket especially looked fantastic. The only downside here was you can tell that the large portion of time was spent on the main characters CGI (and rightly so), but it means that tertiary CG characters tended to be a bit lacking and not look up to standard.Unfortunately I felt Lee Pace's performance as main villain 'Ronan' to be quite one dimensional and wooden. He shouted a lot, and put on a deep voice, but what presence was built up around his character I felt fell flat when he actually started speaking.Also, his character motive was basically him being a religious fanatic. While being topical, I felt that his core motivations was quite a simplified notion of ""West vs East"" as apparent in the two warring cultures of the Kree Empire vs the Xandarians, to the point where I felt it was exploitative of post 9/11 anxieties and leaning towards patronizing.Overall though, a very entertaining and most importantly funny movie. Quite different from any other modern Marvel movie, which is a good thing. Recently I've found that some of the post Avengers Marvel releases (with the exception of Days of Future Past) to be feeling quite stale. This film has definitely got a unique and distinct personality which I think sets it apart from the rest, in a good way.I have to say now though that it is probably in the top three Marvel movies alongside 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' and 'The Avengers'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Lukewarm and formulaic - but funny.,"I have had a few days to ponder the film ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and what makes it so popular is probably its greatest sin; the film is too cautious and accessible. Now that being said, one should never expect a subversive, though-provoking film for the $170M price tag that Guardians had. However, the film was constructed to please as wide an audience as possible. What that means for the audience is that cinema lovers will be disappointed as it fails to offer anything fresh or new, marvel purists will be disappointed because the film fails to capture the comic effectively, and general audiences will be disappointed because they were served up another, formulaic, apologetic film, with too many uninteresting villains, nonsensical plot points to hit the buttons needed (do we really need to know WHY WHEN and HOW they are called the Guardians of the Galaxy) side characters and cameos that are completely unnecessary other than to say ""Hey! John C Reilly is in this!"" and 80s music included for no particular reason other than to please the nostalgia of those that grew up with this music (after all, thats all comic book films are, nostalgia). Ultimately the film suffers from the fact that most audience members do not know these characters. That isn't a bad thing. We don't need this film to be the first act only.That being said, the film is worth a watch. The writing was clever and quite funny during multiples scenes so that even the most critical viewer can't help but chuckle. Will you laugh? Yes. Will you be entertained? Yes. Will you remember this film one year from now? That remains to be seen, but the staying power of this film is very low.Because of the above reasons i give the film a 6/10 rating. I would recommend seeing it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel's most absurd to date,"Honestly, I thought this movie was one of the most overrated movies of 2014. All you hear is how ""perfect"" it is, and how it's ""Marvel's best."" If what you desire is a mediocre, silly science fiction film, this is well-worth your money. While this movie may have heart, and great special effects, it is simply not enough to compensate for it's unnatural, forced comedic script, and it's ""Look how unique I am"" aura. The story alone would only suffice as decent at best. Yes, it is extremely unique in the realm of Marvel production, but Marvel was never geared toward humor as it was geared toward compelling adventure and dramatic turmoil. Nearly every joke in this movie only distracts the audience from a potentially praise- worthy quality. Frankly, this film is too silly to take seriously. Its only redeeming factors are its special effects and it's undeniably aberrant features. This is simply not Marvel's best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not your original Marvel experience,"For me the summary title is a good thing... I went to this movie with my brother (The comic book fan) as a non-comic book fan, thinking this will be another CGI-Bor-Fest, just like captain what's-his-face or the last iron man. Thankfully I was wrong within the first ten minutes, when the movie went from space-craft action straight into comedic fun, which set a precedence for intrigue-ness throughout the movie. It seemed to have this balance throughout the film, which I felt kind of related to other comic related movies like kick-ass. Just when you thought ""the movie couldn't be funny during this scene"", it goes and surprises you with a drunken escapade between the main cast. I Really do recommend to all stereotypes and especially those who sit on the fence with all marvel movies as I feel this may have broken the mould.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvelous Recognition,"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the least known comic books of Marvel. The only reason why the whole world, aside of the fans of the source material, are going to see this because it's a Marvel production, but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world, nobody knew who Rocket Racoon and Groot were before the film was announced, nobody heard of Starlord before Chris Pratt was attached to the project, and most people hardly knew what it is actually about. While many are still seeking for a Doctor Strange or an Ant-Man movie, we should first get to know something that haven't got enough attention before. And wondrously, these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own, but also to the fantasy/adventure genre and its old classic form, which easily delivers the sheer fun. But even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds, the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama. That is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster.It is certainly a space adventure, it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action, but the big stuff aren't the only highlight of the movie. The film would mostly focus on its characters, nearly all of them may be aliens, but their pathos and personalities are down-to-earth. How the team was formed is the same way how The Avengers did. They aren't nice to each other, but they had to get along so they may save the world... or galaxy. But here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride. How they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations. The exposition is so relied on the dialogue, but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline. The film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship, turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits. The film also has a big love for the seventies music, and it smartly uses it for Peter Quill's last earthly thing he'll ever possess in his otherworldly life.These parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film, but that doesn't always mean it's a bad thing. This is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technical/style abilities. But then, it doesn't have any problem with the action, except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever there's a humor in it, the consistency goes back on track. It's simple fun, sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesn't have to be over-serious to be outright compelling, but it also does have some drama, while it doesn't entirely embraces its sadness, it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually. The actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters.The plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable, but Guardians of the Galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones who've never heard of it. Since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans (let's have to be honest about this), this idea may not always be taken seriously, especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon, but here it is: Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie that isn't meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that Marvel ever produced since Iron Man. Is it a bold choice for them? Probably, but it's really not hard having self-awareness. The triumph of the film is reliving the classic, somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal, even when they are not as familiar as many of Marvel's heroes. In the end, it's just pure fun, the flaws are there but at some point it doesn't matter. Every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster, taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully explore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Amazing!,"Words cannot explain the thoughts I have on this movie. Unlike the new X-Men, I think the more you think about it, the more you like it, although both movies were equally good. Guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie. I may even see it again! I have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you, it was very true to the characters, and let me say, I had doubts about Vin Diesel's talent between Groot's small role in speech, but now I don't think anybody else could have matched how well he performed. Marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with it's movies, however I highly doubt that and I cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by Marvel.Roll on Josh Brolin and his take on Thanos!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply Marvel-lous,"Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply MarvellousYes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action.Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"" and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events.Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions-""Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it"" - Peter QuillPlayed in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills.""I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance"" - GomoraActed by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord.""Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it""- Drax, the DestroyerPlayed by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family.""Ain't no thing like me, except me""- Rocket RaccoonCouldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team.""I am Groot"" - GrootPerhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection.Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien.""We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle""The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class.The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted ""save the universe"" romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone.Cannot recommend enough- 11/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Average with few funny moments,"I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy as I had to see for myself what the big fuss about this movie was. I'm not a comic book fan and do not have any background idea about the characters before, however super hero movies are one of my favorite genres to watch.Let's start with the positives: - Chris Pratt was amazing in the lead role: charismatic, funny, and a joy to watch. - Amazing music and soundtrack during and after the film. - Good CGINow for the negatives: - Not much of a story and zero character development. You have the feeling that the characters just want to be friends and they come off as needy. - Too much action is happening all around that it becomes a mess, similar to the transformers movies. - The villain Ronan is so boring and predictable. They need a great villain like Loki from Thor. - Drax and Gamora are disappointments in the film. They don't seem like a big deal and Drax sends most of the time getting his ass kicked instead of being a destroyer.Overall I give the movie a 6 over 10. Don't expect too much and just enjoy the ride. It's watchable but definitely not as good as the reviews you will see on this site.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Can be the best Marvel movie ever made than The Avengers,"This movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, is a Marvel movie about 5 space criminals who works together in order to stop Ronan the Accuser in destroying the entire galaxy. These comics were only known by few people. It became famous when the actors were announced to play each of their characters. It became more famous when the trailer and the movie was released. The movie was liked by everyone and this movie is very excellent. You will enjoy this movie for sure. Unlike other Marvel movies, there were jump scenes unlike here, there wasn't any. And this movie is also a funny movie and even the after end credit scenes. Don't miss all the fun in Guardians of the Galaxy!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Amazing....If you're 15 and have A.D.H.D,"To be fair, Marvel announced many moons ago that it would be taking ""liberty"" with the stories it gives a green light to be made into film. That is all well and good, because the characters in this film are as pointed out elsewhere ""not well known"". Indeed I do not think that many in the movie going audience will be, aside from the old school comic fans.That being said, let me address my qualms with this film. I hate to be ""that guy"" here but I love film as most of you do, so lets have at it shall we? This film was far to quickly paced for all that it hoped to encompass. It felt like one giant set-up scene for comic relief which it used in grandiose fashion as it replayed the same set-up formula over and over. There were some splendid shots in this film completely ruined for me at least by the entry of yet more misplaced comedy. There was little if no serious context in the film at all, a fact for which I am disappointed. No amount of cgi can make up for the abuse of a film element that plays on ad-nauseam until no hope remains for anything serious enough from the film finally makes it to the audience to salvage an otherwise good idea.It may be fresh as far as Marvel movies are concerned, but that is really no feat in itself is it? How long have they been playing the same worn out record? OH! they were bought by Disney, that's right! I almost forgot about that depressing fact. No hope for originality. I was not overly impressed by this film. It was pretty, It was colorful, but I felt it failed the characters involved by being too corny to accurately portray them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Groot is cute!,"One of the greatest Marvel movies, if not the greatest! Guardians of the Galaxy cleverly mixes comedy and superhero action and makes something extremely awesome, the relationships/friendships between all of these characters feels real, and Groot, oh my god! I drew so much fan art for Groot, he is the greatest character in the entire movie and I absolutely love him. Chris Pratt also delivers an excellent performance as Star Lord and his mask is pretty cool as well. Overall, I have barely any issues with this movie that are severe, all of the characters have great depth and amazing performances. I cannot wait to see what James Gunn does with 'The Suicide Squad' in 2021, because it looks like he really knows what he is doing with the superhero genre.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the greatest films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and possibly one of the greatest of the decade. This movie looks extremely good on the big screen and blu-ray, if you come across the blu-ray for this film, I highly recommend that you buy it because the effects are very impressive and some of the best I have seen in any other movie that has come out this decade. I will put out my greatest superhero films of the decade list out on IMDB very soon, expect Deadpool to be number one, because... SPOILERS: it is.Grade: A+",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Worth seeing...but #37?,"Currently, about a week after its debut, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is ranked #37 on IMDb. I assume that by the time you read my review it will have dropped in the rankings--mostly because the most rabid fans were probably the first to see and review it and the rest of us folks will be getting to it a bit later. This is often the case with big blockbuster films--though with an overall score of about 8.7, it's bound to stay well within IMDb's top 250. As for me, I really enjoyed the movie but cannot agree that the film is THAT good. Excellent yes....#37...nah.The best thing going for ""Guardians"" is that with the huge glut of super-hero films during the last decade or so, this one manages to stand apart--something that cannot be said of most of the films. There is just a certain sameness that make me less than thrilled with all the comic book hero films. But a few, like this film and ""Scott Pilgrim"" manage to seem different enough to merit your rushing to see them. So, of course, rush to see this oneSo how is it different? Well, there are MANY ways. Chris Pratt (Peter Quill) is NOT your typical super-hero. He is NOT a disaffected millionaire or guy bitten by a spider or a super-being from outer space- -he's actually pretty ordinary in most ways. But, like his character on ""Parks and Recreation"", Pratt is a bit of a goof-ball--a dopey but likable guy who manages to do well despite himself. This is kind of cute--but fortunately the film is NOT just about a dopey goof-ball but he's assisted by a strange group of new-found friends with strange abilities. Another way this is VERY different is that almost the entire film takes place in outer space. While ""Thor"" and ""Superman"" have their brief moments in space, ""Guardians"" is almost completely there--and as such has a HUGE reliance on special effects and CGI. It is a SUPER- expensive film because of this and its all-star cast--coming in at about $170,000,000--which is greater than the gross national product of many nations!!! So, although the film has earned over $100,000,000. it has a long way to go to earn back its costs--though I am pretty sure this will soon be the case. As for these special effects, they are beautiful and the film has such an other-worldly look as it jumps from one weird planet to another. So, the film is absolutely jam-packed with eye candy. Finally, the dialog (mostly from Pratt but also due a lot to his new friend, a VERY sentient raccoon) is amazingly strange. Often crude, it sounds much like the dialog was spiced up a bit here and there by 13 year-olds. While I usually don't like this, it DOES make the film very different.So what's not to like? Well, not much. However, because the story has so much action and CGI, you do sacrifice a bit when it comes to plot, back story of many of the characters and you might just feel a bit overwhelmed. Still, it's the sort of overwhelmed I don't mind feeling from time to time.By the way, if you do see the film, you'll certainly enjoy the obligatory Stan Lee cameo--it's one of the better ones I can recall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
We believe in MARVEL,"We all had a pretty good idea on what this movies was going to deliver we had seen its trailer. The only question was how? Also there was a question if they are risking too much by suddenly introducing an all new MARVEL film, amidst of The Avengers franchise that was going on well. We also had our doubts if they are making things too complicated by connecting it to The Avengers in the future. Well, Guardians of the Galaxy manages to stick to your seats and keep faith in Marvel. Again.As the name suggests, this story is all about Galaxy and so many planets that you find it difficult to remember (Earth reference coming very rarely). As seen in the earlier reference of Thor the Dark World post credit scene, this movie is about one of those collectible objects(The Orb) that the collector is collecting. The fight for this leads to the meeting of Gamora (Saldana) and Peter Quill (Pratt) whom are joined by the bounty hunters Rocket (Bradley Cooper voicing one of the hilarious character of 2014) and Groot (Diesel). Then the story becomes more complicated with more people (or should I say Aliens?) wanting The Orb and their evil intentions. Drax The Destroyer (Bautista) joins the party and the all time quarrelling enemies become friends and call themselves of Guardians of the Galaxy. About the story I don't have to reveal many details here because there are so many other aspects in the movie which not only keep you on your toes but also has you in splits.A movie which is mostly dependent on CGI and green screen as there is hardly any part shot on earth has a tough ask on its hands to balance its main plot and also not confuse the audience with too many characters and planets/galaxies or any similar objects like that. At the beginning I thought things were getting a bit out of hand, but James Gunn manages to keep the humor afloat so that you don't complicate things too much. The characters are really well written and I think this movies going to be career changing feat for most of the actors. Chris Pratt looks like everyman's hero by playing quirky character as Peter Quill. Zoe Saldana is as sexier in green as she was in blue (Avatar). Though the Bradley Cooper's voice as Rocket is bit digitally modified it's one of the most intimidating character that you will ever see and more than half of the humor in the film is this character's contribution. Also, I salute the CGI team for bringing so many emotions into the Rocket character. You feel it's almost next to you. Vin Diesel as Groot doesn't have much to speak but the character is written very well. The surprise for me was Dave Bautista as Drax, I didn't expect much from him due to his WWE background, but he has performed equally well in both comic and emotional scenes. I expected more form Benicio Del Torro as Tanveer Tivan the collector but he has a little role here. There are other interesting characters played by Lee Pace (the main antagonist), John C Reilly, Karen Gillan and Glenn Close add to the strength of the cast.Creating a franchise movie with new characters and not so famous stars as protagonists is a challenging task. James Gunn has handled it really well. He doesn't bore the audience and also makes them feel involved as if the characters are already 2 or 3 movies old. A very special mention to the CGI and the Visual Effects team and also to every guy/girl who has made technical contribution to this movie. This movie is completely dependent on it. Yes, there will be a sequel and before ending this I quote Peter Quill from the movie, ""You said it, b*tch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Anti-Heroes Don't Strike a Chord,"I watched this movie for one main reason: it was a Marvel production. Marvel has been hitting home run after home run so I figured that this movie would be no different. Well, it was.Guardians of the Galaxy was very foreign to me. Unlike most of Marvel's previous releases, I knew nothing about this comic or its characters. And with comic book movies being so epic nowadays this movie had some hard acts to follow.The Guardians of the Galaxy are five anti-heroes that have been thrown together and are working to a common goal for different reasons. Each member is different in just about every way imaginable, they're not even all the same species. Starlord (Chris Pratt) is a mouthy arrogant human. The name, that he gave himself, says it all. Groot (Vin Diesel) is a tree that can grow its parts at will. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is Kree (I believe) and has been raised to be a killing machine. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is a loud mouth raccoon with a penchant for guns. Drax (Dave Bautista) is a muscular something. They were a team in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts because neither of them alone could accomplish much alone. The different characters were not superheroey enough nor intriguing enough for me.That's probably where I feel the movie fell short. I was mildly interested in the characters (Rocket more than the rest) and I was mildly interested in the story. The action and special effects were on par with today's standards, as they should have been, but the rest of the movie was rather flat. Simply put, the movie didn't draw me in.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Whackos of the Galaxy,"What happens when Marvel pulls out five relatively unknown characters of its own, who have a terrible chemistry with each other, and decides to make a movie out of the mess?The result is surprisingly good.Guardians of the Galaxy starts out as an unholy alliance of five unlikely companions: a space rogue (Indiana Jones + Han Solo much?), a righteous assassin, an annoying tech-whiz raccoon, a humanoid tree, and a thespian prisoner on a vendetta, all of whom pursue their own more or less selfish goals. Without revealing much, they are joined together by the mysterious Orb, a crucial device for the plot.The movie is packed with chaotic and continuous action. No slow sections mid-movie, no meaningless pieces of dialog. Everything is so well- knitted in its weirdness that I'm beginning to consider the whole even greater than immediately after the show. It's fascinating to follow how the different personas co-operate despite their differences, and the leading actors thrive in their roles, doing amazing work! In addition, for an action movie, the plot has some very touching moments during which I had to fight not to shed some manly tears in the theater.The space is beautiful, and so is this movie. One breathtaking vista after another, visual orgasms will be guaranteed.When looking for flaws on purpose, the biggest con throughout the movie might be the overuse of the jokes and one-liners, some good, some not. However, they are a part of the spirit of the work. Furthermore, I'm sure that the 1970's soundtrack will divide opinions. I'm not particularly fond of it, on the one hand, the songs felt dime a dozen and alien as I didn't grow up with them nor knew them save one, why not use some other tracks? Either the movie was targeted to people over 30, or the authors wanted to use their favorite songs. Oh, one last thing! Did the Dark Aster really have to be so ridiculously gigantic?There's a squirrel with a big gun. He's the sole thing I remember about the flick's poster, and later he turned out to be a genetically enhanced raccoon. Anyways, he gave me the impression that this was going to be a tongue-in-cheek version of the Avengers, which was partially true. Massively superior, Guardians of the Galaxy is an idiosyncratic masterpiece amongst the blockbuster movies of Hollywood.All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy turns out to be unexpectedly funny and warm adventure that has all the rights for its cliffhanger ending and oh, we will be waiting for that sequel!Rating: 4,5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"All style, no substance, but reasonably entertaining","All style, no substance, but reasonably entertaining.This movie, like many of today, revolves almost entirely around CGI, and outdoing everything that came before it in that regard. Plot is basic, and quite unoriginal, borrowing a lot from previous well- known sci fi movies and series. Dialogue is clichéd and tailored to kids. So many dad jokes...Performances are so-so, probably due to the lame script and having a director who only knows how to direct graphic designers, rather than actors...No, it is really about the CGI and that is done really well. Plus, the pace is good, and despite the unoriginality, the story does keep you engaged most of the time.Certainly no Citizen Kane, but it's okay.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Here comes the Marvel picture phase II,"Leaving the Avengers behind, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY heralds the 2nd phase in the Marvel's silver screen expedition as IRON MAN (2008, 8/10) kick-started the 1st phase. But who is James Gunn? whose director résumé only encompasses the gooey horror SLITHER (2006) and a superhero indie SUPER (2010).Watched it in 3D, the film is a hyper-diverting adventurer amalgamated with slick action set pieces, legit humor and emotion and spectacular visual impact, the chemistry among its quintet coterie is potently pleasing, the comic timing is on the nose, and the most euphonious trait is its 70s-retro soundtrack, which is a killing nostrum to identify itself among Marvel's other imposing juggernauts.It is hard not to compare this to the STAR WARS series, an inter-galactic combat assembling unlikely heroes (various species) to prevent an evil (and dark elfish) super-villain, Ronan the Accuser (Pace), whose intent is to acquire a mighty orb (the McGuffin) to rule (or destroy) the universe. As the first chapter, naturally, it turns out that Ronan is merely a minion, there is much more overpowering force behind.The team includes Peter Quill (Pratt), aka. Starlord, a 30 something human; Gamora (Saldana), a green-colored assassin trained by Thanos (an uncredited cameo by Josh Brolin); Rocket, a cybernetic raccoon (voiced by Bradley) and his best friend Groot, a creature with the appearance of a walking tree and limited vocabularies (the viral I'm Groot! voiced by Diesel), and Drax the Destroyer, a red-tattooed brawny muscle (Bautista). The film is at the top of its game when the 5 gather together, bickering and jesting, they never take this saving-the-universe deal too serious, unless things deteriorate into the moment when self-sacrifice is exigently needed, surprisingly Rocket and Groot are granted much more humanity than their human-shaped comrades. Even in the crucial showdown scenes, when Starlord and Ronan stand face to face, a playful stunt conveniently eases audience from the edge of the seat, if the characters themselves don't engage in the plot, why should we the rubbernecks?Bad-drafted villain is always a frailty in Marvel's kingdom, Ronan is so plainly written, the supposed career boost of Lee Pace is still unaccomplished, so is Hounsou's Korath, while Gamora's vicious sister Nebula (Gillan) is in no better condition, but at least her storyline will continue. Yondu Udonta (Rooker) is between friend or foe, whose sentient arrow is the wow factor one wishes it will keep shooting in the next installment. Benicio Del Toro as the Collector and Glenn Close as Nova Prime, both have meager screen time, no chance to run the show.Aimed to nostalgia and accompanies Starlord's Han Solo carefree flair, the mix-tape hits from 70s are unexpectedly well maneuvered, devoid of a present-day background, it is a smart move, and more poignantly, the obsolete Walkman emanates a strong connection between a guilty son and his deceased mother, no upbeat rhythm can beat that! No wonder its soundtrack is already a No.1 selling album in USA.In conclusion, the film is an above-average marvel production, great job for Gunn and his team, establishes a ragbag of lovable roles besides the Avengers assembly, and it has the prospects to be the STAR WARS of this generation, intriguingly, the rebooted Star Wars sequel is also heading towards us, soon we will find which one is the bona fide winner. But one must confess, Marvel does have an upper hand with the ultra-success of this picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hugely overrated,"The movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those. Huge mistake.To say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.The story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.Visual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the only positive thing that I can say about the movie.The theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.The only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and sock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

One of Marvel's Best,"I don't know who is making the final script decisions at Marvel these days, but I'm found the last two films (Captain America: Winter Soldier, and now Guardians of the Galaxy) to be exceptionally entertaining.To be honest, after the disappointment of the most recent Iron Man and Thor films, I was beginning to feel as if the Marvel superhero flicks may have run their course, i.e. that they were beginning to fall into that lacklustre phase where the creative team is just going through the motions to collect on an easy payday.I also hate when movies rely far too much on special effects and big budgets, instead of those increasingly rare qualities of good characters, solid plots, and great writing.That's where Guardians of the Galaxy really shines. Yes, I like the big screen sci-fi settings and slick gadgets or impressive superpowers just as much as the next guy. But I'll take emotional engagement over that any day of the week. Make me care enough about the characters to tense up in my seat when they're in danger, to genuinely like them for their unique characteristics, to want to be there in that theatre with them and feeling a bit of a letdown when the movie ends - that's what I love about great movies. Anything short of that, no matter how glitzy, just isn't worth it.I also love good humour in between all that tense action, and this is an area where I think Marvel really shines. I laughed as much as I tensed throughout this movie. To be honest, that's what made me like the main characters as a team so much - their banter was hilarious.True, the plot of this movie is not particularly unique. At its core, its a good guys vs bad guys superhero flick. It's hard to find a truly new story in that dynamic. But as with Jame Cameron films like Avatar, what I like is when the plot is solid enough - when it has no glaring holes - that it doesn't distract you from all the good stuff.All in all, I have to say this: if you're average movie-goer like myself, go see this film. It's one of those rare times you'll feel like you actually got your money's worth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A Familiar Yet Refreshing Experience! Witty and Intelligent, Maybe Marve's Best!","'Guardians of the Galaxy' is not just another sci-fi movie, it's refreshing, enjoyable and giddy, and probably the best of its genre among summer blockbusters this year. The writers of this movie are witty enough to make sure that its cliché-sounding plot won't be as tiring as it rings the audience ears.The movie follows a band of misfits who are assembled to fight for the galaxy and save it from the hands of evil warlords aiming to take total control of the cosmos.While it follows a familiar and maybe tiring tale, a plethora of explosive elements made this movie a refreshing and enjoyable experience. Its biggest advantage lays on its comic tone, thanks to Chris Pratt's smashing take on Peter Quill, he's obviously one of the central elements of this movie. He is joined by equally interesting, and mostly funny, Groot (Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zaldana), Drax (Batista) and Rocket (Cooper) and some other stand out supports, in their thrilling adventure for universal domination. This one proves to provide endless humor, but it has heartwrenching tales to tell too, most of which relatable. There may be an over-stuffing of visuals and that tends to drown the humor and drama but overall, 'Guardians of the Galaxy', is undoubtedly one of the biggest movie event of the year, a pleasurable fun vaunting a stellar ensemble of casts, head-bopping and insanely good soundtracks and a surfeit of reminiscent anthems from the past decades. This might be the best Marvel hero movie to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Whilst extremely fun, this one has been way over hyped","For one to not find Guardians of the Galaxy fun they would have to be some type of Grinch, for James Gunn's loud, colorful and at most times unashamedly odd Marvel movie has an appeal in most areas you look, and despite slight moments of darkness has a mantra for entertainment over seriousness that allows the film to overcome its generic nature that has been strangely overlooked by the public yet is quite prevalent throughout the film.Guardians is going to go down as one of those odd movie cases where one can't help but feel people were far to lavish in their praise for a movie that at its core is built around the tried and true formulas of a rag tag bunch of mismatched antihero's banding together to stop the big bad nasty from destroying the universe. Director Gunn has done a seriously good cover up job of this by instilling an often ingenious and witty script into proceedings that, as mentioned previously, demands fun to be had by an audience member willing to jump in the journey and forget that what they are actually seeing is something that is not entirely as unique as one would think. It's a risky story no doubt thanks to the set of oddball characters at its center and it's a credit to Gunn that he manages to be so successful with the elements at his disposal.Without doubt, one thing that Guardians does better above all else is create a set of space hero's that look to be one of the most memorable and adored set of trouble makers this side the Millennium Falcons crew. Long held back by supporting turns the group is charismatically led by Chris Pratt as Han SoI mean Peter Quill/Star Lord. Pratt is an anchoring presence in the film and excels as expected at his comedic timing and as the wise cracking adventurer, but to say Pratt is alone in the charm stakes would be a lie, as the film also excels at perhaps it's hardest task which was to create a not-only believable but lovable duo in the form of genetically altered raccoon Rocket and his walking tree sidekick Groot. These two creations would've been a consistent worry on Marvel's and Gunn's mind, as getting them wrong would've plagued the picture beyond redemption, but the work of quality CGI creativity and the voice acting of Cooper and the unsung mo-cap work of Vin Diesel is that of the highest order, so much so that the two nigh on run away with the film. To a lesser extent Zoe Saldana and ex-wrestler Dave Butista provide solid, if a little more as-per-usual support as female heroine Gamora and angry man mountain Drax the Destroyer respectively, but no amount of good work by this group can overcome the film's Achilles heel (even while slightly petty for such a fun film) which is a weak overall story arc and even weaker villains.Focused too much on the 5 Guardians, there was arguably a lack of similar effort in the creation of the film's big bad Ronan the Accuser and actor Lee Pace, who feel like an afterthought in a tale that needed to amount to more in order to be worthy of the now ardent praise poured on it by audiences and many critics. It's not to say Pace is bad, but Ronan is severely undercooked and a culmination of his efforts in a far from satisfactory final act leave a diminished mark on a movie that should've prided itself on going for the unpredictable or for going all out. One feels that it all ends with a whimper and not with a bang, despite a late saving-grace effort by our favorite tree and a dancing hero.Without question, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, enjoyable ride that sadly lacks certain thrills and sense of adventure due to a story that didn't develop around the characters that come into a life of their own. It was a risk by Marvel (this feels a lot more edgy than your average Marvel piece, sexual innuendo included) to even commission this material to the big screen and it's a risk that has worked (especially in a financial sense), and Gunn seems like the perfect fit as director. Both however need to significantly step up their game in the story stakes next time, and aim for not only fun but a more original and unpredictable story to go along with its unique and now much loved character set.

Guardians of the Galaxy Imax 3D experience,"No story spoilers, just a quick message to you that you must watch this movie.I watched the trailers so many times i have lost count. Really had high expectations and they really delivered, Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel film yet. If you liked Avengers, you will like this even more. So happy this movie came.3D is not usually my choice of spending money, but this was totally worth it. This movie is just made for Imax, with 3D as a desert. The acting is superb from the main characters, soundtrack, editing and cinematography are also excellent. This is the type of movie that makes you beg for the sequel. I am probably going to watch it 2 or 3 more times.I wont say anything about story or the characters, just go and be surprised how the movie sucks you in its awesome world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Style over substance - space edition,"Right after his mother dies of cancer, a little boy is abducted by an alien spacecraft. And so begins the story of Peter Quill, or Star-Lord, who will travel to unimaginable places, will find the most unlikely friends in the most unlikely situations and will save the galaxy from the ruthless space maniac along the way.The humankind has always had a soft spot for the adventure movies. The far-and-away lands, hidden treasures, exotic beauties, deadly perils and of course the fearless heroes - what could be more fun to watch on screen? Add ""space"" to it - with multiple planets, crazy spaceships, bizarre alien creatures and literally limitless freedom - and the audience will simply be lying in orgasmic convulsions asking for more. It's actually funny that two of the most iconic and cult adventure franchises of the last 40 years, Indiana Jones and Star Wars, are created by the same person, and that Indy and his space cowboy twin brother Han Solo are portrayed by the same person. Now that duo probably knows everything that there is to know about the genre.Guardians of the Galaxy is probably the first movie i've seen that delivers that feeling of a space rodeo, something we first experienced thanks to the original Star Wars trilogy. And that really is something to value if you are into this sort of things. The locations, characters and names change with a speed of antelope stampede, plot twists and turns like a giant python around its victim, and the only good thing you can do to yourself is to stop trying to rationalize what you see and just enjoy the show. Pew-pew, ka-boom, yeehaw!Unfortunately, if you are older than 10 years, don't have ADHD or just have a brain that's not easily switched off, you'll notice, to some degree of regret, that the abundance of style this movie boasts covers a serious shortage of an actual substance. The whole idea of a mighty artifact being sought after by some of the baddest and meanest of the guys in the galaxy, only to be found by a small-time treasure hunter who doesn't even know what it is, just makes no sense. Exactly like the motives of the other characters, who switch from ""shoot first, ask questions later"" to ""best buddies ever"" in a split-second. The biggest and the most plot-important things happen mostly due to luck, stupidity, recklessness or a combination of those, as if you're simply not allowed to think straight in this world. For instance, two planets just signed an important peace treaty - but their leaders clearly don't give a damn about being friendly and respectful to each other, as if they are old buddies who can f**k with each other verbally with no consequence. And one of those leaders is an evil woman from 101 Dalmatians. Yeah, sure, give me a break.Treating GotG seriously would only inflict brain damage on you, so i can hardly analyze this movie as a whole. Probably, it doesn't even want to be treated that way. Instead of trying to give a solid impression, it breaks itself into a multitude of small episodes where the little things like a dude dancing around an abandoned planet listening to a cassette player and kicking alien lizards, a ship flying over some space station with the 80's pop hit playing on background, or a walking tree that probably escaped from the Lord of the Rings production pretending to be Eywa and launching some luminous spores, can do the trick.In these little moments and the crude but harmless banter that usually accompanies them lies the true power of this movie. The bad thing is that besides them, and some pretty decent CGI, GotG can hardly offer you anything else. The good thing is, it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it. So if this space adventure is your kind of game, do hop in!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

One of the Best Sci-Fi of this Year,"In 1988, on Earth, the boy Peter Quill is abducted by a spacecraft after losing his mother. In 2014, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), a.k.a. Star Lord, is a ravager searching a valuable orb on the surface of the dead planet Morag. When Peter finds the orb, he is hunted down by the Kree warship The Dark Aster of the powerful Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) but he flees. Peter also double crosses his partner Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) that puts a reward on him.Peter Quill arrives on the Xandar city Nova Empire and is chased by Ronan's warrior Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and by the bounty hunters Rocket and The Groot. They are arrested by the police officer Corpsman Dey (John C. Reilly) and his men and sent to the prison The Kyln, where they befriend the strong Drax (Dave Bautista). Soon they learn that Gamora wants to betray Ronan and sell the orb to a dealer for a huge amount while Drax wants to kill Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. They plot a plan to escape from The Kyln to sell the orb and split the money. But soon they also learn that the orb keeps the infinity stone that gives immensurable destructive power to the owner. They self-proclaim Guardians of the Galaxy and decide to deliver the orb to the leader Nova Prime (Glenn Close) to keep it safe from Ronan. But they are hunted down by Ronan and his right-arm Nebula (Karen Gillan) that want to destroy Xandar and also by Yondu Udonta and the Ravagers that want to sell the infinity stone to make lots of money. Who will keep the powerful orb?""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is certainly one of the best sci-fi of this year. The story is a rip-off Star Wars but full of action and very funny, in a perfect combination of action and comedy. The characters are charismatic and the cast has great names – the only remark is the name of Vin Diesel highlighted in the credits that lure the audience since his character has limited lines (""I am Groot""; ""We Are Groot"" once and a couple of grumbles. The special effects are top-notch and the music score with songs from the 80's is remarkable.

Marvel's Space Opera,"I think it was a surprise to no one that Marvel's next big movie would be a good and profitable film considering the amazing track record of the past 10 superhero movies produced by their studio. Even as the first trailers began to grace movie theaters, fans and casual moviegoers were eager to see this film about a group of characters that even die-hard Marvel fans themselves had little knowledge of. Unlike other characters such as Thor, Capt. America, and Ironman the cosmic superhero team known as the Guardians of the Galaxy have very little notoriety, which presented a huge gamble for Marvel to bring to life. In fact, when one of the first trailers appeared I remember my father turned to me and asked, ""What's with the giant tree man, the raccoon, green lady, and the Han Solo knockoff?"" Nevertheless, Marvel not only adapted this comic series into a great movie but perhaps the best movie in their entire roster and by far the best summer film this year at a time where a great summer blockbuster was desperately needed. It resemble the classic action comedy from the 80s and early 90s with likable characters, great comedic timing, and action sequences that are fun and extremely entertaining in a way that remind me of the Indiana Jones series.Our Cosmic adventure follows Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star-Lord), a thief and outlaw abducted from Earth as a child, who finds and steals a mysterious orb which he intends to sell. Unbeknownst to him this orb is also wanted by a radical madman called Ronan the Accuser, who seeks the powerful artifact hidden within the orb in order to eradicate an entire planet to which he has sworn to destroy. As Peter tries to sell the orb he encounters the cybernetically enhanced assassin Gamora and bounty hunters Rocket and Groot who are all promptly arrested and sent to prison for previous crimes. While in prison they meet Drax the Destroyer, a brutish juggernaut who wants revenge against Ronan and his associates for the death of his family. Together they break out of prison with the intent to sell the orb for a vast amount of money and keep it out of the hands of Ronan and the even more powerful tyrant known as Thanos. From there they uncover the mystery behind the orb's true purpose and prevent Ronan from using its power to kill an entire planet full of innocent people.Unlike other movies which would take a situation like this seriously and with some sense of urgency, the characters in Guardians seem to show little concern or reference to the whole saving the world aspect that you expect to form the basis of every superhero movie. That's not to say that the characters or the writers themselves don't care about what is happening and what is at stake but rather they focus more on the quirky Cheers quality fun-time atmosphere the film creates. This can mostly be demonstrated in Chris Pratt's portrayal as Quill, who has a very laid- back attitude towards everything with a rather mocking cool guy persona which is how a child of the 80s may have believed a cool space superhero would have been like.Speaking of characters, everything single one of them is memorable, interesting, and well portrayed by their actors which by itself is the main selling point of this movie. I have already mentioned Chris Pratt amazing job as the lead, but Zoe Saldana as Gamora is by far one of the best female action heroine in any action movie since Black Widow and has a very commanding presence throughout the entire film. By far one of the biggest surprises is Batista's portrayal of Drax. Never has a wrestler turned actor so much believability and charisma since The Rock delivering both laughs and incredibly entertaining action sequences. However, not one performance can live up to the two characters that completely steal the entire show, Rocket and Groot voice by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Yes, the talking tree and the raccoon are by far the most entertaining and likable characters you'll find in pretty much any movie out there today and you often find yourself begging for another scene featuring them. They are also two of the funniest characters in the entire picture behaving like the classic straight and funny man routine of Abbott and Costello fame but twice as fun. Even though Groot pretty much only says the words ""I am Groot"", which you would figure could get quite annoying and repetitive, becomes funnier every time he says it.Aside from these characters the visual and special effects that are brought to the screen not only allow for some amazing eye candy and interesting creature design that brings the world to life. Everything seemed to have a purpose and meaning for their existence which makes you want to learn more about these environments and the history behind them.Music-wise this is one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film in a long time thanks especially to Star-Lord's awesome mix filled with classic songs from the late 60s to the 70s and some early 80s. Not only are they fun but they fit quite well with the comedic and quirky atmosphere of the movie.Bottom line, if you have not seen this movie you're doing yourself a disservice and if you've reading this review stop now, buy a ticket, and see this movie if you have not already. It's funny, exciting, and you may even find yourself seeing it three or four times if not more just to experience it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This is really Groot!,"Obviously as the ratings show the general consensus is that this is a good movie. But even so, this will not be everyones cup of tea. Some will not even be into the Star-Lord (or is written as one word?). When you have Bradley Cooper, but have him only in a talking role (he's the raccoon), then it shows you have real faith in the material. Actually the director of Slither shows off he can handle bigger stuff.There is a lot going for the movie (be it the cast, might be the best movie Bautista has done and will be in for a while) and if you love Science Fiction, this might not have sounded like a shoo-in, I myself never thought I'd like this movie so much. But how could I think Marvel could go wrong? I don't know, but of course they didn't. They choose their directors wisely and their cast wisely too. Chris Pratt is someone you might have seen in many comedies before, all with small budgets or him in a supporting role (as in Delivery Man, a remake of a french movie with Vince Vaughn being top billed) .. things are about to be changed! People will know his name (his real one ... maybe also Star-Lord).There are so many little jokes in here, that it's not possible to list them all. On another note: As with every Marvel movie there is a stinger (scene) at the end of the movie, involving a character I never expected to see. A real treat, even though I have no clue if this is foreshadowing or just a joke. Whatever the case, sit through it and watch! :o)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Almost on par with the Avengers,"James Gunn is the guy to keep an eye on. His work on Super was already pretty good, but what he did with Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing. Sure it's not a Shakespearean drama, but still, he found the sweet spot between visual effects, action, humor, drama and capturing the source material. For me it was a highly entertaining movie that's almost on par with the Avengers. If they had made the transition between rag tag team to a united group a bit better and they had found a way to avoid the usual cheesiness then I would have given it a 10 and called it genius and the best Marvel movie yet. For now it's a close 2nd. The best part of it was that it didn't take itself too seriously, used an unconventional music score and went down the comedy road where Pratt, Coopers voice and Groots animation really excelled. Also kudos to James for getting quite a few of his usual actors into the movie - especially Nathan Fillion, his brother Sean, Rooker, Seth Green (Kevin Bacon wasn't far away either) - the cameos they had were quite enjoyable.Bottom line: if you liked previous Marvel movies then the chance is high that you're going to love this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

For me though, it was just too scatterbrained to really connect with.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A star studded cast provides a secure balance to the entertainment, with acting you've come to expect from a handful of the very best in the business.If you love Sci Fi, adore the seemingly endless array of futuristic gadgets, weapons and beings, while firmly grasping a reality check with retro objects such as the ever prominent 'walkman' then this film will not disappoint.Another highlight is definitely the soundtrack, whereby a multitude of well known songs are used in, some a little odd at first, though they do grow on you and are totally fitting.If I could, I'd rate this 11 out of 10, enjoy...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not the best Marvel film ever, but still a decent superhero film","Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, entertaining, spectacular sci-fi action comedy adventure. However, despite the rave reviews from the critics and mainstream audience, I just don't think the film actually lives up to the hype and expectations to be a great one. Let me explain why.The story is mainly about a band of interstellar thieves, thugs and assassins - Star lord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax, got caught up in a huge galactic threat when one of them retrieved a highly-desired mysterious orb from a desolated planet. These individuals eventually decided to work together as a team and become heroes along the way to stop the threat.Before this, the Guardians Of The Galaxy consists of characters not known by many, even among the Marvel fan base. It's officially the first Marvel film that ventures into space, introducing the general audience to the expansive intergalactic worlds in the Marvel Cinematic Universe...with an entirely new team and not the previously established Avengers. It brings the audience to a whole new unseen world, featuring a multitude of alien species with distinctive personalities and abilities, with addition of exciting spaceship battles and chases as well.The visuals are spectacular and the action scenes were great. Many of the 1960s/1970s pop classics that forms the soundtrack blends in quite nicely with the film. Each Guardian have their own kick-ass, cool or funny character moments in the film. The action scenes between Drax and Ronan or Korath, Gamora and Nebula, Star Lord and the Sakaaran army are really well done. But, among the Guardians, it is actually a giant walking tree and a talking raccoon that stole the spotlight compared with the others! When Groot extends his arm and pierces through a few Sakaaran army soldiers and repeatedly slams them against the walls is both shocking and awesome.The 'We are Groot' scene or Rocket's expression when Drax tries to comfort him by gently petting his head are beautifully done and emotional at the same time.All the Marvel films, since Iron Man, did a great job of making fun at itself by injecting decent amount of humour and witty lines into the story, keeping the audience laughing along the way. This worked out fine...the engaging sense of humour actually helps to balance out the drama and action to make the films fun and entertaining to watch. But this time, they went overboard with it. Guardians of the Galaxy is so overly playful with itself that it has gotten too self-absorbed with its humour. It felt cartoony at times and lacks the seriousness it needs to be an epic film. It's been shown that billions of lives are at stake and even the galaxy is under serious threat. How do you even care what's at stake when the film doesn't take itself seriously when it should? (Moreover, some of the jokes presented in the film didn't work for me at all)The film has too many new characters and most of them only make brief appearances...there's a lot of new unfamiliar places or locations which are previously unheard of without proper explanation. There's no character depth for each of the Guardians, you don't feel like you know them much by the end of the film as their backstories were only briefly touched upon. Gamora, also known as the galaxy's deadliest assassin or the Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy, trained by Thanos, gets easily beaten by others? The romance of Gamora with Star lord feels forced as well. I was also slightly disappointed that Thanos only make a brief cameo appearance...I expected more of his involvement in the film. It didn't create any strong lasting impression for the characters, much like Captain America: The First Avenger and Iron Man did for their main characters. The pacing doesn't flow well as the story never slows down and there's too many things to cover in the film.There's so many small fine details that the general audience (those who are unfamiliar with the Marvel Universe) most likely won't know or understand: No one knows who Tivan/The Collector actually is or the Yaka arrow that Yondu carries around with him...the film didn't clearly explains what the infinity stones represents (mind, power, reality, space, soul, time), no mention of the Infinity Gauntlet, who is the giant figure that uses the Power stone, etc. Most of these details should be explained in this film instead of relying on the next sequel to do the job.Like all the previous Marvel films (except Thor, who has Loki), Guardians of the Galaxy lacks a memorable and compelling villain for the story. There's a lack of character development for Ronan The Accuser. Ronan's lieutenants, Korath and Nebula (also Thanos' adopted daughter), bring nothing to the table...we don't know them much at all. For those who are expecting a great epic teamwork battle in the finale will be disappointed. Why would a villain who hates an entire race and planet, tries to avenge his father's and ancestor's deaths could be easily distracted? 'What are you doing?' I find myself having the same response as Ronan, questioning the director's decision for making Star lord pulling such a ridiculous act on screen. Come on, you have a villain who's in possession of the Power stone and this is what you can do with the character?Like I mentioned earlier in the review, the film was fun and entertaining, but it was too much that nothing feels serious anymore. It's certainly not the best Marvel film ever. In my opinion, X-Men: Days of Future Past still remains as the best Marvel film of the year.Rating: 7.5/10Note: The post-credit scene was quite disappointing and not worth the wait. They supposed to add something that raises the expectations for future films but they didn't. That sucks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Bradley cooper as the raccoon, Rocket, was really unfunny and unconvincing; so were the other cast. the storyline left loopholes everywhere and strangely left me with many questions and feeling ever so under-entertained.For a marvel fan with x-men and iron men series doing so well and so well made, this was such a huge disappointment.The Gunns are too overestimated and i don't recommend this as a must watch in 2014 sci-fi blockbusters.almost as bad as the Transformers age of extinction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unique Masterpiece!!!,"This movie cemented the hype around the MCU. And the ironic thing is that this movie had no hype at all when it was coming out. The comic characters aren't popular, and it seemed like an absurd movie with a racoon, a tree, and aliens. However, James Gunn is a creative genius, and this movie is great. His taste in music is great as well, so great to the point where my dad actually enjoys these movies, and he doesn't enjoy any superhero movies. This movie is the perfect blend of humor, stakes, and heartfelt moments between characters that have nothing in common. Chris Pratt action career took off here and he is a great lead. Saldana plays Gamora with multiple levels too her character. Even though it's CGI racoon. Bradly cooper and Sean Gunn's Rocket will become an iconic character by the end of these three movies. Vin Diesel is being payed to say Groot. Is it worth it? Probably as Groot has some of the best moments in this movie. Bautista is great humor presence, but also has a great serious scene when he talks about his rage covering what he has lost. Opening scene is iconic. Rooker is great as blue alien Yondu. Visuals and CGI in this movie are incredible. I remember seeing this in theater and instantly loving it. Crazy that a movie that was supposed to flop become the highest grossing movie of 2014.

Gunn knew that Marvel needed a reboot of originality, colorfulness, and artistry of filmmaking and the fact that it wasn't to be taken too serious. The way the cinematographer and James captured every single color of the landscape, and the characters; it was just spectacular. It was a great story, filled with colorful, complex characters, and great art/set direction.

"Proof that not all superhero films need to be ""gritty and realistic""","Guardians of the Galaxy (a delightful mash between the Star Wars prequels and the Mass Effect game series) managed to actually be non-generic in the sea of mediocrity that Marvel keeps churning out. A very welcome reminder that some comic book movies can still be charming and funny. For that alone I was willing to forgive its flaws. Zany, colourful, and full of humour and heart, I rewatched it on a plane having lost much of my will to live after the excruciatingly moralistic A Most Violent Year. Suffice to say, it kept me going.When Hollywood decides to get a huge multi-million dollar space opera going, I bet Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel and Chris Pratt pre-2014 weren't high on their list. But I could not imagine this movie without any one of the five leads. Chris Pratt infuses Star Lord with such a delightful quirkiness that he's completely irresistible. I never find myself rooting for the main male lead in ensemble teams like this, but Quill is just so darn fun to watch. When he's not hurling one liners at his teammates, he's jamming to probably the catchiest darn soundtrack of all time (more on that later). I hated Saldana's fake green makeup, but she's a great actress and a terrific foil especially for Pratt. They have unbelievable chemistry, which I hope they continue to tease and resist Bonesing the Brennan/Donnaing the Josh/Becketting the Castle (you know, when they put people with great chemistry together and then you get bored of it?)Dave Bautista is not a great actor, but Gunn knew that and used him well. There's one or two moments where I thought Bautista killed it with comedic timing, and his confrontation with Ronin was actually very well done. Gunn directs the hell out of Bautista, who hurls himself at Ronin in rage and grief and is completely outclassed. Its a really well done sequence, because I could feel Drax's frustration. Cooper and Diesel do great voice work for their characters. Lee Pace is a serviceable villain - once again his makeup is pretty stupid, but I thought his speaking voice fit the part really well and he is a commanding presence on screen. Michael Rooker I've loved ever since first hearing his voice on COD Black Ops 2, and he stole every scene he was in.One thing that really irritated me was the film completely wasting John C. Reilly, Benicio del Toro, Djimoun Hounsou and Glenn Close. Between the four of them, they have EIGHT Oscar NOMINATIONS and in Guardians of the Galaxy, probably about eight minutes of combined screen time. Glenn Close is one of the finest actresses of all time, and she is stuck in a nothing role that could've gone to literally anyone. By locking her into this stupid role, she now has no other potential place in the MCU. What a disgrace.Guardians is visually dazzling, with the regions of Xandar and No Where created superbly. I was really torn on the makeup - I hated the full body pink/green that they gave to some aliens, but the body transformations of Bautista and del Toro alone made the Academy Award nomination worthy. The entire ride is heaps of fun, directed beautifully by Gunn (he captures some really emotional scenes very well, and the action set pieces are even better). And the soundtrack. That soundtrack.I needed to vent about some minor issues because they were so stupid that they took me out of the movie. - We open on a scene straight out of Terms of Endearment, with Peter unable to say goodbye to his dying mother. I loved this scene, and it was really well directed, right up until the SUDDENLY ALIENS ending. Seriously, what was that? They couldn't think of a better way to do it? I know both aspects of that were necessary, but the scene was so awkward. - I also take major issue with Peter's light ball somehow becoming capable of vaporising two enemy soldiers. Seriously. Its his light source, and by breaking it he obliterates them like the Nuke in Terminator 2 did to the world. If its capable of that, why are you carrying it around to flippantly! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS WAS STUPID? - Guardians takes major liberty with the whole vaccum of space fact. At several points, Peter and others are exposed to the vaccum of space, and by holding their breath they survive. Yeah, no.But hey, who cares. Guardians is charming as hell. If I had been a Sim watching baby Groot dance at the end of the movie, I would have gained three happiness points.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

They've managed to keep their form with Guardians of the Galaxy, but in a very very bad way this time. Is this a TV movie? No. It's a high profile space movie. Then why does it feel like a TV movie? Because every single thing in this cinema is a STEREOTYPE in one way or another.I've enjoyed few of individual moments.

Each characters encounter problems, tragedies, challenges and power that they are forced to use if necessary. Enjoyable aspect of the film was the way they deliver the funny lines. Acting was so real that I almost forgot that some of them were aliens, creatures and the music is unbelievably good. Film was a good length: not excessively long but long enough to tell the story. Another great aspect of the film was the special effects, particularly with regards to all the scenes featuring the advanced weapons and air combat. This movie was also different from the rest because it had more story concerning the characters ' lost loves. The way they interact to each other is very very funny. It was so cool to actually fell like you were there. Overall, this was, in my opinion, the BEST SCI FI FILM yet and portrays the fantastical story of marvels, super heroes extremely well. The fast-paced nature of the film, team cooperation, comedic and well written script. It will leave you feeling good, happy and a sense of being helpful to anyone. You will fall in love in each guardians. This movie is truly a great one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Over-hyped Way Too much,"The movie has hyped up too much as a spectacular and marvel best film . The film stars Chris Pratt as Quill, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Batista as Drax the destroyer, Vin Diesel as Groot and Bradley Cooper as Rocket. The five characters meet in prison, breakout then try to protect the Galaxy by stopping Ronan from using the orb to destroy it while forming a new fond friendship. The problem i had with the movie was that character development was weak and the only interesting characters were rocket and quill the rest were kinda useless. Secondly the plot was simplistic and unoriginal and just excuse to show off visual effects. So in all my option is guardians of the galaxy is an OK movie that is enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"An unusually Marvel-lous blend of zany humour, quirky characters and thrilling action that makes for a hugely enjoyable dose of summer entertainment","Notwithstanding the heart-tugging prologue which sees a young Peter Quill saying his tearful goodbye to his dying mother in a hospital room, it is manifestly clear from the opening strains of that 1970s Redbone classic 'Come and Get Your Love' that Marvel's latest cinematic addition 'Guardians of the Galaxy' just wants to have some fun. Yes, immediately after that prologue, we catch up with our anti-hero - a thieving Ravager, a self-styled Starlord, and a general intergalactic do-no- gooder - skipping along to that song while venturing his way into a cave on an abandoned planet to retrieve a much-sought after silver orb.In case it isn't already apparent from the trailer, that is the first of many 1970s pop classics that form about half of the soundtrack of the movie, and which Peter carries around in a mix-tape with his trusty Walkman. That artistic choice isn't self-evident; although these characters were already known as a team of misfit heroes from their introduction into the Marvel universe back in 1969, it did not come with the same cheeky comic tone which James Gunn has taken to the material. Indeed, the galaxy may be at stake, but the fact that its fate lies in the hands of a talking raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a tall talking tree named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a massively muscled angry guy named Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), a green- skinned female assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Peter (Chris Pratt) means that it is a good thing this Marvel picture doesn't try to sell it straight.In fact, it easily stands out from the rest of the more recognisable Marvel properties by simply being more playful than any of the rest. Peter is a sweet rogue played by Pratt with wily mischief. Drax is delightfully hypermuscled and hyperliteral - his rejoinder when being accused by Rocket that metaphors ""fly over his head"" is an absolute hoot. Gamora is kick-ass cool. Groot is lovably monosyllabic. And the one who often steals the show is the irascible foul-mouthed raccoon whom Groot provides the muscle for, Rocket, who is also streetwise, smart and suffers from an existential crisis. They aren't exactly first-choice to save the Earth-like planet Xandar from the warmongering baddie Ronan (Lee Pace), who wants the orb for his patron Thanos on the deal that the latter would help destroy Xandar - and both Xandar's Nova Corps officer (John C. Reilly) and head honcho Nova Prime (Glenn Close) pretty much make that clear.But it is precisely their misfit nature that makes it all the more enjoyable. Whether escaping from Xandar's space prison known as the Kiln or from the cheekily-titled planet of Nowhere on which Benicio del Toro's The Collector resides, the ragtag gang always have a witty quip to spare, and the cast's delivery of Gunn's cleverly-scripted repartee is spot-on. There is also plenty of situational and physical humour in the numerous action scenes that follow our heroes along their space adventure - and fanboys will have a field day picking out Gunn's homage to classic sci-fi fare like 'Star Wars' in addition to thoroughly lapping up the pop-culture irony.Gunn's casting here is flawless. None of the actors in the ensemble call attention to their own individual characters; instead, they play off each other with offbeat chemistry and perfect timing. In particular, Cooper is almost unrecognisable as the voice of Rocket, capturing perfectly his character's blend of brashness, intelligence and angst in a delivery brimming with panache. They easily overshadow the other villainous sorts who pop up every now and then to wreck destruction - including Ronan's lieutenant Korath (Djimon Hounsou) and Thanos' disillusioned daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan) - who unfortunately turn out just as nondescript as the villains in the Marvel movies so far.That fault is not so much the actors as that of Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman. If something had to give in order to make way for that self-aware smart-assery, it turned out to be both plot and character. Put aside the visual dazzle, and there's no doubt the narrative is about as straightforward as it gets. There is no treachery, no double- crossing, just plain good and bad defined right from the point that the characters make their entrance. Same goes for the characters, which aren't afforded much time for any backstory (save for that prologue we mentioned at the start) in between dodging bullets and blowing up stuff. As far as origin movies are concerned, this hardly makes the impression the way 'Captain America: The First Avenger' and 'Iron Man' did for their respective characters.Those unfamiliar with Marvel lore will also find themselves grasping to understand how the entire universe comes together - for starters, you may wish to take note that the orb is so prized because it belongs in the same league as the Tesseract in 'The Avengers' movie. But if you find yourself lost amidst the mythology, you'll probably still find yourself lost in a giddy spirit of amusement. It's zany fun to say the least, with a perfectly pitched bunch of memorable characters, irreverent humour and some truly eye-popping CGI wizardry. Gunn relentlessly guns at everything that is fun and pleasing, no matter that they may seem absurd - and you know what, 'Guardians' is all the better for it",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A sublime assault on the senses, easily the biggest hit of the summer","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1988, the young Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has just seen his mother die of cancer and, after rushing out the hospital in a flurry of tears, finds himself abducted in to space. Twenty six years later, he's a space hopping, inter-galactic misfit, with a penchant for '70s soul and Motown and is in possession of a special orb, which is wanted by a distant relation of Jim Carrey's The Mask named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who is planning to use it to betray her maniacal ruler Ronan (Lee Pace) who is planning to overtake the universe. But the orb is also wanted by desperate duo Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a rather monosyllabic talking tree. However, it turns out none of them are entitled to it and they all find themselves thrown in to the jail house, where they cross paths with the strong, silent Drax (Dave Bautista) who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Together, they must unite together as one and stop his diabolical plan in it's tracks.Guardians of the Galaxy has undoubtedly been the box office hit of the summer. So much so, that even I, on the last day of it's release, have taken a trip out to give it a glance. While the fanfares had died down slightly, it's interesting to chart how over the course of two months, this grandiose offering has taken the film world by storm, a risky venture as well, in as much as there are no established Marvel characters in the lead roles. But simply from the publicity poster, it inflames the senses, with it's dazzling, colourful array of characters and effects. And this would be a real case of reliably judging a book by it's cover, since the film delivers what it promises, a jaw dropping visual spectacle in every sense of the word.Like the previous Marvel encounter, Avenger's Assemble, this doesn't make the mistake of becoming all style over substance, keeping the film flowing with an easy going humour throughout the film that is resplendent with the characters. Pratt's lead is a naturally buffoonish guy through-out the film, who has a wise cracking personality to match, while Cooper's talking raccoon is unavoidably crazy by it's very nature. As for Groot, he's voiced by Diesel, who just says the same line over and over again, which would probably suit his acting ability in more parts where he just appears as himself, although his character here, in the end reel (and throughout really), provides the film with it's more emotional, touching element. These characters are juxtaposed through-out with the more dynamic, forceful character's, in the shape of Saldana's lizard skinned female heroine and Bautista's hard, no nonsense presence. That's not to mention a supporting cast including the likes of Michael Rooker, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro.Word of mouth, at least in part, must spread to make something a hit, and in Guardians case it's that it ticks all the right boxes and there's something to appeal to everyone, a lot of effort has been put in to every part of it and it pays off brilliantly. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Good Movie, but these 8.9 ratings are INSANE","Look, this movie is a good movie, there is no doubt about it. But an 8.9? It's not close. I'm horribly confused at why this movie is getting an 8.9/10. It's a mix between action and comedy. The action is good but not amazing, the comedy is funny at times but isn't really great. The plot is about a bunch of guys trying to save a crystal ball (i.e. story is okay but nothing ground breaking). In sum= it's a kinda funny/kinda cool action movie with an average plot. That's it, this isn't an AMAZING movie, it just isn't. I'm kind of left scratching my head at the reviews on this one.

Don't expect anything more than cool special effects and awesome soundtrack,"This feature is worth a movie ticket. In fact, it is the kind of film that I'd rather watch at the movie theater over owning a Blu-Ray copy. Cutting edge visual effects that only the latest Hollywood big budget can provide combined with a very nostalgic, tasteful and unorthodox soundtrack (with stuff like ""Hooked on a Feeling"" and ""Cherry Bomb""). Plus, it is a nice little adventure, humorous and action packed while still being family suited.That is all... Do not be fooled by these sensationalist overrated reviews from fanatics and comic enthusiasts. This is very far from being an epic (a new Star Wars, as some of the most blindly exhilarated have stated).1. There are so many clichés that my wife rolled her eyes most of the entire time. The seemingly heartless bounty hunter accompanied by a scary/gentle beast that communicates through indistinguishable groans (did Vin Diesel get paid for that? cause he even shows up in the credits for this crap) that only his best friend can, somehow, translate to the audience through redundantly answering the beast's concerns (and no, I'm not talking about Han Solo and Chewbacca); the tough butt girl assassin that primarily shows no interest in the lead teen-like goofy heroic character; no point in mentioning everything, just be prepared to nothing new or authentic.2. The entire time, it seemed like the film was making a desperate attempt to be very very funny, failing miserably. I did laugh or smiled sometimes, but some jokes were just embarrassingly poor. This is the type of humor that will just make the targeted audience (teens) laugh. I guess Marvel fans will really appreciate it, though. Anyone growing up reading Marvel comics knows that a humor is present even during the most dramatic moments, and I commend the attempt to portray the same aspect in the movie adaptations.3. I'm not sure if it was just bad casting or poor directing, but the characters are everything but charismatic. Especially the leading role. You see kids fighting for their turn to be Jack Sparrow, Iron Man or Maximus while playing, but I doubt you'll see anyone fighting to be Peter Quill. I'd be surprised if anyone even remembers his name. Nearly 2 hours was enough to get sick of almost every character, from hero to villain, so I'm hoping they never make a sequel.My 7 is because, all in all, this is pretty good for a super hero movie. It will make you smile and have fun, at the least. Disregard, though, all the 10's and the currently inflated rating (common while the box office commotion lasts) and lower your expectations, if you are a reasonable person.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Marvel does it again !!!,"After a plethora of Marvel movies out this year, GOTG is another hit for the Marvel universe. Now, mind you this is coming from a completely unbiased viewer as I had absolutely no idea what GOTG was or about until I saw the film. I went in with absolutely no presumptions or expectations of how the movie would compare to the actual comics/cartoon and I was utterly entertained.So far I am choosing this as a front runner for winning best visual effects for this years Oscars, yes, that's how good the graphics are throughout the film. The movie has more computer generated reality than actual people or places and every bit of it is done spectacularly. Along with the intense visuals, GOTG has its share of well timed humor (just enough, most action/superhero flicks looking for comedic relief tend to go overboard) a subtle romantic angle, and exciting action sequences.The most surprising of the cast was 'Dave Bautista' (he plays 'Drax the Destroyer'); believe me, I had my doubts as will most people, did a phenomenal job who I think will shock everyone at how well he plays the character. 'Groot' and 'Rocket' were perfectly made and voiced; probably the most entertaining/lovable of the ensemble.While in my opinion the cast and the visuals were the strongest points of the film, the only let down was the story; which was very clichéd. A menacing villain and the almost unstoppable hero(s) with the latter coming out on top like always still remains to be the perfect formula.Regardless, this is a MUST SEE FILM !!!p.s 'i am Groot'",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A fun, solid effort - but not without its flaws.","So, with trepidation, I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy on Saturday night. It actually turned out pretty well. I thought the humor was going to be overdone, and indeed by the end of the film several jokes were falling flat. On the plus side, the pace was very fast, the soundtrack was ""ahem"" awesome, the FX were top notch and it featured the best filthy Jackson Pollock joke ever.Chris Pratt as Star-Lord is OK with the humorous scenes, but when that wore thin there wasn't much left to expect from him. He's just not a very good actor when you're looking for depth.The Drax character was performed very well by Dave Bautista (better known as Batista from the WWE). The writing could have been better though, as the dialogue sometimes felt forced in an attempt to define his race's particular mode of expression. It reminded me at times of the Star Trek: TNG episode ""Darmok."" But again, Bautista did a fine job.Gamora was the biggest disappointment. Her character was ruined by non- committal, lazy writing. She's one of the biggest bad-asses in the Galaxy, and yet she is often portrayed as a damsel in distress – then suddenly an unstoppable fighter, then a damaged girl with daddy issues, then a victim, then a poor waif who must resist Star-Lord's advances – when in fact (if we were being faithful to the character) she would have screwed his brains out, injuring him in the process. You DO NOT F%$K with Gamora!Rocket was great. They didn't over-think it, and just let Rocket be Rocket. Bradley Cooper did a great voice-over job.Groot is Groot. Like Rocket, they just went with it. Thankfully they didn't overdo the ""I am Groot"" shtick. It was just enough to balance the annoying with the funny.Ronan the Accuser was done well. He's even more severe than he is in the book, playing him up like a religious zealot.There are plenty of Easter eggs to look for, especially in The Collector's base of operations. There's an absolutely fantastic appearance by Thanos, and as usual make sure you stay through the credits for a surprise cameo from an obscure and subversive Marvel character!Even with its faults, GOTG is a fun ride and I am relieved to be able to recommend it wholeheartedly!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Just once in a while, it would be nice if the explosions stopped and those characters could have a conversation with each other about, I don't know, life, the universe, and everything, but no, these are action characters and they develop though intense, crazy, death-defying action.That little quibble aside, the film was a lot of fun, with plenty of amusing snappy dialogue, interesting and quirky characters with trademark Marvel personality flaws. It also has a wonderful soundtrack for which I am the target audience; if you were around at any time in the seventies and had the radio on, you'll love it. It's nice to know that new generations are being introduced to that fabulous music for perhaps the first time.

Vastly Overrated,"I'm wondering, after seeing the reviews for this movie on IMDb, if this was the same movie I saw at the pictures a few weeks ago, because it absolutely boggles my mind how people can give this movie a 10/10 rating.Now, when I saw it I wasn't particularly disappointed, as I came in expecting a light-hearted childish story that passed the time, and that is exactly what it was, and I didn't feel ripped off for paying to go and see it. I really regarded it as a superhero B Movie with a big budget. It was fun but wasn't memorable at all, and there was nothing in the movie that made me really think or challenge my perspective on a particular topic, which is what I expect from a movie which is deemed by the public to be a classic.But this entirely wasn't the case. The plot line was simple, there was little to no character development or any notable acting performances, and the humour was completely childish and only really funny for someone aged 11 or under. There was no wit, satire, intelligence or anything really interesting in the movie and it was all set in your average Hollywood feel-good family fun movie template, which really doesn't appeal to mature tastes in cinema.Now, I have to say I'm not a big superhero movie fan and I'd never buy a DVD for a superhero movie, but even for a superhero movie this one wasn't even that good. In my book it was about the same quality as another superhero I recently saw, which was The Amazing Spiderman 2, which is rated about 6 or 7. Personally I can't tell how this movie is any better or worse than that movie, after all, both were cliché feel-good films with a very simple plot.I have to admit I wouldn't have even bothered writing a review for this movie had it not been for the ridiculously high rating it received on IMDb. Its 8.6 out of 10 at the minute. 8.6? That puts it ahead of absolute classics such as Django Unchained, Full Metal Jacket and Taxi Driver. How on earth this movie can be considered better than those movies is utterly unthinkable. They aren't even in the same league. This movie is several leagues below that.I hope that the rating has subsequently gone down to somewhere between 6 and 7 if you're reading this in the not-so distant future, because that's where this B Movie with a big budget really belongs.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""I'll die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy""","Star Wars for today's generation. And maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that I haven't experienced in cinema for a long time. Marvel has outdone themselves once again. Marvel and Disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but I haven't been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year.This origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene, then the tone changes into this Indiana Jones in Space adventure, then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film. When it needs to be emotional it is, when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you haven't seen before. Everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain. He isn't very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details. Plus Ronan The Accuser serves just as build-up for a much greater threat.Every character steals every scene they are in. There is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite. Chris Pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to Marvel and his charm and likability. Before he served as a professional goof ball but I don't think that will be the case anymore. He shows such a wide range -switching from comedy into action/adventure or a quick-witted scoundrel. Zoe Saldana has established herself a long time as the go-to-action actress and once she shows why she has earned that. She can be sexy, funny and kick ass all in one moment. Dave Bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film. Bradley Cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the Rocket Racoon and he has created not another CG animated character but a character from flesh, blood and fur. His cynical, gun-toting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as I have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine. Groot, a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team.James Gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with. In every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film, all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here. The film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately. It's that kind of a movie.This is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the Star Wars generation talks about that experience today. The whole Marvel Cinematic Universe is a history in the making which I am sure will be talking about for a long time. The choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the Dawn of the Planet of the Apes . But if you want a self-referential light-hearted fun go see the Guardians of the Galaxy. It is one of the best films you will be able to see this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Better than the Avengers,"For the first time in a long time, I have watched a movie and was really entertained.Guardians of the Galaxy beats the One-Comic-Relief, Overdramatic, Rehashed Action Movie format by a long shot. One more movie with the punchy sidekick, only there for the laughs as he accompanies the vanilla Boy Scout main man, and I will Hulk-smash the disc. It's either LOL Larry or Love Interest Lucy in these films.Many Group of Heroes (Avengers) movies fare no better, featuring literally thawed-over, stereotypical characters from older films in name or in spirit about to blast the baddies with the newest tech of the times. Yawn. Thankfully, the Guardians have actual odd and not contrived odd personalities. So does the movie. Oldies music infiltrates the film instead of overdramatic trumpet flourishes, the theme takes place in space instead of downtown Big American City (like Star Trek), and graphics are stellar. Punny, huh? Watch it on a big television screen.Yeah the Guardians film was funnier than most intentional comedies, but it had a heart. Bad guys without friends they may pretend to be, but the Guardians show that they care for each other and for other people, even if they don't say it. Insanely likable characters. Loyalties are a bit confusing at first, but it will be apparent after awhile, unlike some films, where it's painfully clear who's aligned with who from the title sequence.Also, the number of quotable lines within this action film is incredible, rare from a movie with a talking animal character, I know.Halfway through the movie, I wondered when the movie would be over. Except this time, I was hoping that it wouldn't ever end.Do yourself a big favor, crawl if you must to your local movie rental location, and watch this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel's Greatest Accomplishment,"This is the most surprising movies I have ever seen in multiple ways. Not that I thought it was going to be bad. James Gunn was already one of my favorite Writer/Directors of all time. He made quite a few cult classics including one of my favorite movies, Super, which really took me away. Once I knew that James Gunn was directing this, I was skeptical. Having seen his independent films, I knew that him directing a Hollywood movie would either be one of the greatest films of all time, or a complete flop. I was very relieved coming out of the theater that it was the first one. Or I would've been if I hadn't been laughing my *** off at the easter egg.Another reason that I was surprised is that this is a Rocket Raccoon movie. Rocket Raccoon was probably created when someone at Hollywood got high and doodled a Raccoon with a jet pack on. Not to say the comics were bad, it's just that now, Rocket Raccoon is better than The Avengers. And that's saying a lot.The casting, action, comedy, and CGI are all superbly done. There's a ton of comedy, which is made better by the fact that it is good comedy. There's truly stunning special effects, but not too much that this turns into a Michael Bay movie. The action is everything anyone wants from an amazing space opera, but they don't get carried away and end up with a sci-fi Expendables. And everyone plays their various characters incredibly well, even Vin Diesel, who literally only says ""I am Groot"" about fifty times.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone, even people who don't like science fiction or super heroes. This is even family-friendly, and has enough 70's and 80's references to make anyone from that time nostalgic. Any age, any personality, this is the perfect movie for anyone to watch. Good job, Marvel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I regret not watching it earlier,"Let me just start off by saying that I am generally not very picky with giving a 10, I am not saving it for some 12 Years A Slave kind of movie because it would be unfair to group all movies together, each has its own genre and should be rated according to the movies in its genre. So I rated it according to the movies in this genre (Superhero-action) as oppose to the 'all movies I've watched in my life' .So this was a movie I was not excited to see at all. All that came to mind was the lousy old days when my father would make me watch Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy, and for some odd reason, I just assumed it would be the same thing. And god, Chris Pratt ? Seriously ? But when the movie came out, I was in the UK and I heard some of my friends who watched it say that it was too American and bad. So it just assumed it would be one of those movies that try too hard to be different but they fail so miserably. Then I heard that it was doing so well in the box office and I thought hey I should at least check it out. I finally got a chance to watch this movie last week (I know, so late). So I entered this movie having only watched the trailer and heard how much it earned, and that was all I knew about it, so it was a surprise to know that it was a Marvel movie. Here's my sort of brief review of -Movie introduction: So right off the bat, the movie grabs you and makes you 'tear up', even though you have literally known the characters for two or three minutes. Then the next six minutes or so, it all changes and starts with a pleasant song that brings a smile to your face.Characters: The movie then started to introduce various characters with some pretty cool makeup and holy guacamole those graphics were almost as good as Avatar. But there was much more to the characters than their looks, they each had compelling story lines and backgrounds that were not a snooze fest, you actually felt bad for these characters and did at some point feel their pain and most definitely their excitement and bad-ass moments, you'd be like Oh Yeah you about to get SMOKED - BOOOOYAAAAAH.Music: So anyway, the movie kept surprising me with its choice of music, each was carefully picked and oh so divine. I haven't listened to such a great play-list in years. From the Pina Colada song to I Want You Back, they all brought back so many great memories. And I'm pretty sure than any person with a decent taste in movies/music must have heard of at least 30% of those songs because they are gold.Actors : I was least excited to watch Chris Pratt in the movie because I didn't think I would take him seriously but I was wrong. Yes I can't see him acting in a drama but he kicked some serious butt in this film. His body transformation was the most surprising (and pleasant). He acted really great and not once did I think that he was trying too had or even be someone else, he really became Peter Quill and I am so happy that they cast him. As for Zoe, mama mia ! Who knew these girl was such a bad-ass ! Generelly, i superhero movies, the girl is always wearing super tight or revealing clothes (which I don't really mind) and keeps pouting and talking slow and seductive and keep doing this thing with her eyes and her body.. I can almost never see past the fact that they are in this movie just for the eyes. But she was not ! not once did I feel that she was trying to be sexy, which I loved, because she came out looking like a complete bad-ass. More actresses should learn from her: don't try to be sexy, just be your awesome self. The other actors of course also did a wonderful job but Groot and his Racoon (I'm sorry I forgot his name) were animated to there's not much acting there, but even their acting was superb.Graphics: AS GOOD AS IT GETS. I got to watch it in 3D and the most amazing scenes were the ones with Groot. To me, the scenes where Groot was featured were the most magical, and that beats some sick shots of the galaxy.No doubt has this movie raised the bar for superhero movies in terms of graphics.Plot: So the movie does its best to make everything clear by letting the characters reveal the plot by either their cations or words. To me, it was not very confusing especially having no prior knowledge to Guardians Of The Galaxy or any Avengers hero 's story. But my brother watched it me, and he did have enough information to keep talking to me and saying Oh Look Here Is This Guy from Thor, Here Is This Guy From The Next Avengers.. bla bla. So you will definitely understand 98% of the movie, its only that 2% that people with prior knowledge would know.To sum up, this is by far the BEST Marvel film I've watched (discounting X-Men if you'll count it) and only the Third best superhero film I've ever watched (the first being The Dark Knight then X-Men). Everything in this movie was perfect, the action, the music, the graphics, the actors, the storyline, the comedy.. It was all just perfect.I highly recommend you watching it, and while this is not particularly a children's movie, you can take a child older than 10 to watch it because its not bloody or violent, its just too slow- paced for children to understand.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Good Time But Overrated,"Guardians of the Galaxy was an entertaining and funny entry into Marvel's Phase 2 of its cinematic universe. It contained some pretty awesome set pieces and some incredible animation, but suffers from a decent villain, jokes that missed, and a predictable plot.Following the story primarily of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a.k.a ""StarLord,"" you are introduced into a whole new region of Marvel's world. After stumbling upon an orb, multiple different factions set out after StarLord to retrieve it. Along the way, he encounters four other fugitives that include Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), and Groot (Vin Diesel). These five characters encompass what is the titular Guardians of the Galaxy. Opposing them is the agent of Thanos, Ronan (Lee Pace) who needs the orb for his master plan.Story-wise, the movie does everything you expect it to do (as with other Marvel movies.) By the halfway point, I could guess the rest of the movie and was mostly accurate. One thing the movie does achieve story- wise though is that for the most part, the movie accomplishes what Marvel's phase one did for the Avengers in just this movie; all the characters get good screen time and are expanded upon to make interesting and unique protagonists.Each ""Guardian"" of the Galaxy is acted extremely well. Chris Pratt handles the leading role with ease providing sarcasm and emotion. Zoe Saldana as Gamora does a good job showing the pain and conflict in Gamora. Dave Bautista as Drax is one of the pleasant surprises in this film. Being a former WWE member, he does a good job as the very literal brute. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon is a scene-stealer, playing the hyper-active test subject. He delivers most of this movie's comedic elements as well as its cheesiness. Vin Diesel as Groot does very well for what little he says (""I am Groot"".) Finally however, the movie's main villain Ronan (Lee Pace) does his job of being the movie's antagonist but never does he feel menacing; he is functional but that is all.The action scenes are executed awesomely, containing exciting moments as well as a rip-off of a certain Avengers scene. The movie is heavily based on CGI animation with many shots that had my jaw-dropping at how realistic it looked.In my opinion though, Guardians of the Galaxy I believe is overrated. Although the movie overall isn't bad, it is not as incredible as made out to be. Firstly, as stated, the villain. Ronan as opposed to say Loki, from Avengers, a very similar movie, does not compare; Ronan lacks the depth and complexity (as well as the portrayal) for what this movie is being considered to be. Secondly, one of the factions has a stereotypical, over the top leader named Yondu portrayed by Michael Rooker. Admittedly, he did have one cool action scene but as a character alone, he came off as annoying and one-dimensional. Finally, two lesser characters who are Nebula (Karen Gillian) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou), have the same problem as Yondu. While not stereotypical, they're overacted and cringe-worthy when on screen. For this movie to be so praised it would need better supporting performances than what is already in the movie.In conclusion, I enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy but do not deem it as amazing as many others on IMDb believe.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Sci-fi, comics, heroes, action and fun... A pleasant surprise....","Got to hold my hands up here! When I first saw the poster and saw the name of the film, I groaned thinking this was going to be something akin to the straight to video sci-fi stuff from the eighties (just updated). Keesh and cheap, but I was wrong. This is wonderful.We have here an original enough story of a motley crew who together end up being out to stop the destruction of some intergalactic worlds. We have a man from the 80s, a lovely kick-ass lady, a genetically modified raccoon, a big alien strong man a walking tree! It's different but trust me the humour flows, the characters are heart-warming, the story is fun and the action is well paced.Various good stars in this but they are either secondary or in some other form (for example the raccoon). It all just works! You wouldn't think it would but it really does.Wonderful stuff, already looking forward to more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Overrated film,"This film was like the story of "" The Emperor's New Clothes"", where the con artists create an invisible suit and just to fit in everyone in the village inducing the king say they like the suit.Parts of the film were enjoyable and the film BUT this film is not better than the 2001: A Space Odyssey, Bicycle Thief, Rashamon, Toy Story, Chinatown, Up, Pan's Labyrinth, The Hunt, Ikuru, Good Will Hunting, Blade Runner, Rebecca, Casino, V for Vendetta, Fargo, Trainspotting, Into the wild, Dial M for Murder, The Sixth Sense, The Thing, No Country for Old Men, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Incendies, Network, Diabolique, There Will Be Blood, Amores Perros, The Wizard of Oz, Million Dollar Baby, The Avengers, he Bourne Ultimatum, Strangers on a Train, Twelve Monkeys, Notorious, The King's Speech, The Terminator, Rocky, Dog Day Afternoon, Monsters, Inc., Memories of Murder, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Die Hard, etc",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
GOTG: The Next Star Wars,"Many went into this film with high expectations and hype that was unprecedented, much like the somewhat disappointing Godzilla (2014) from earlier this year. Not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the Guardians of the Galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public. This film did not disappoint in any way. It is by far the greatest Marvel film ever made, downing the Avengers and Days of Future Past.I went into this movie with a feeling that I don't usually get with a film. I knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and I was not let down. From the very opening scene to the ending credits, there was not even a second of boredom. To say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus. This film was exhilarating. Never have I seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish.As for the technical aspects, this film has the best CGI I have ever seen. Not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy. The CGI will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009's Avatar. I felt as though I could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships. The score of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography. There were emotional scenes that were played so well with the score that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison. Every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking. I saw so many things that I have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding. The acting was very well done by all of the cast members. There may not be any Oscar buzz for the cast, but that doesn't mean that they weren't perfect for their roles. Chris Pratt was genius as Star Lord, Bautista was hilarious as Drax, the Destroyer and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel did great jobs for voice acting, both being highlights for the film.As far as writing, this movie did something truly unique. it focused on all of the Guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives, though Star Lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons. All of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that I forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie. The humor is not dirty (for the most part) and is not slap stick and tiresome. Every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically. The dialogue was simply that well written.Every aspect of this film was great. Obviously, it isn't a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about. It entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film. Films now rely so heavily on art and the director's ideas of ""uniqueness"" that most films are only appreciated by certain groups. Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater.While watching this movie at the opening Friday, I couldn't help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next Star Wars. It has the same chemistry and formula but, in my own opinion, it exceeds the original Star Wars. It is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well.It is rare that I say this, but this film will make you cry, make you laugh, make you excited, make you fearful, etc. It is every genre and yet no genre. Guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest Sci Fi films ever. James Gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in Movie 43, but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior. This film resurrects the original intention and purpose of film: to entertain. I believe it will be the next Star Wars and spawn many more films to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Frigginn Epic!!!,"From the trailer, I wasn't expecting a very 'amazing' film compared to the other Marvel films... but boy was I wrong! This film has literally everything: comedy, tragedy, action, epicness etc. I have never written a review for a film before and if this movie made me write one? Well I think that speaks for itself. One aspect that I love about this film is that the comedy isn't forced or desperate - it's perfect! There are moments when you'll definitely have tears of laughter! With films nowadays, I always feel that perhaps they had too much story and less action or visa versa. But this had the perfect balance which made it that much more better. I can honestly say that this is probably the best, if not, one of the best films of the year so far - the rating just confirms how amazing it is. This is one of the highest rated films! Only 0.2 below The Godfather... Surely that's enough to convince you to watch it! MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Film Like None Other,"Marvel has hit the ball again out the park with another great hit adding to the line of the successful films in their current cinematic run. Guardians of The Galaxy is different, fresh, and a brand new take on the superhero genre. It focuses on a team of misfits who would have to set aside their own differences to save the galaxy, and I know this plot may sound generic but with the amazing story and the nice touch of humour throughout it's a guaranteed fun ride all the way. One of the best characters to look out for is Bradley Cooper as Rocket, a raccoon with a dangerous attitude. Even Chris Pratt who plays Star-Lord gave a surprisingly great performance. All around this film is excellent and if your a Marvel fan bonus as there is tons of Easter Eggs and a certain galactic titan that makes a surprise appearance in the middle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel Studios' Biggest Gamble To Date... That Pays Off Tremendously Well.,"From the studio that brought us Iron Man, Captain America, Thor & The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy arrives as Marvel Studios' biggest gamble to date and yet the risk pays off tremendously well as this crazy mixture of an oddball cast & an eccentric crew strikes gold for the studio in both critical & commercial departments and succeeds as an immensely enjoyable, extremely entertaining & most satisfying Marvel piece since The Avengers.Set in a galaxy far far away, Guardian of the Galaxy concerns a notorious scavenger who finds himself as the main target of a manhunt after stealing a mysterious orb and is put in prison along with a deadly assassin, a genetically-engineered raccoon & a tree-like humanoid where they encounter a brute looking for vengeance. As an uneasy alliance form between these extra- terrestrial misfits, they learn to work together as a team & try to save the world when a greater threat arises.There is so much in here that could've so easily gone wrong and there's no denying that many eyebrows were raised when James Gunn was brought in to direct this high-budget space epic. But he has directed this picture with such precision craftsmanship that it feels like a work of an auteur & the remarkable use of humour infused into its blockbuster elements only makes the experience all the more amusing, enriching & delightfully engaging.Coming to its technical aspects, every single filmmaking department works in near-perfect harmony with the other in a manner that only elevates its overall story & characters to new heights. Set pieces are impressive to look at, make-up adds a dimension of its own to its characters, its homage to many space classics is tastefully carried out, cinematography makes dynamic use of camera without ever getting carried away, editing is tight, VFX is seamless & the selection of songs is near-perfect.The cast is as eccentric & diverse as the characters present in the film with Chris Pratt (Peter Quill), Zoe Saldana (Gamora), Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot) & Bradley Cooper (Rocket) playing the role of Guardians and each of them deliver excellent performances with Groot & Rocket leaving the most lasting impression. Also chipping in with fine doses are Lee Pace (Ronan), Michael Rooker (Yondu) & Karen Gillian (Nebula), with brief appearance from Benicio del Toro & John C. Reilly also adding more flavours to the film.On an overall scale, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most exquisitely balanced cinematic offerings of 2014 that promises a lot of fun from start to finish and seamlessly delivers it in an endlessly entertaining & immensely rewarding manner. Ingeniously directed, wonderfully light- hearted, fluidly photographed, skilfully edited, splendidly performed & featuring dazzling visuals, Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the ballsiest big-budget production to surface on the silver screen since James Cameron's Avatar.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Adds Humour To Heroism. ♦ 73%,"Come on now, we all know (and pretend that we don't) that all superhero movies are alike. But we still go and see them and come out of the hall enthralled by the visual effects, stunts, 3D, et cetera. So let me not focus on the story here, but the things that entertained me.To start with, I'm in complete awe with Chris Pratt. His brief dance performance is what kick-starts the films and continues to keep us hooked with his character, the main hero. Next, I found myself laughing and grinning all the way through 2 hours because of the large amounts of humor that this film succeeds in executing. Every single sequence is painted with a comic tint, thanks to Cooper, Bautista and others. I have no reason to blame the cast, nor the production unit.Here in India, there were few cuts that annoyed me but I believe we were spared more than we were in The Wolf of Wall Street.While I thought that the CGI was a tad premature at some parts, the story is narrated quite nicely. The action sequences are not much of a surprise as it showcases the futuristic gadgets and stuff. There aren't any twists that could have saved the second half from being a little itchy.Coming to the best part: the soundtrack. The Pina Colada song never felt so good before and it was also years since I heard that. Right kind of music used at perfect times throughout the film. Vin Diesel's Groot voice needs a pat in the back.Guardians of the Galaxy succeeds in holding the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it conveys few implications here: that tree life is so much more significant than we think. It touches topics like space and gravity and galaxies and science and stuff superficially, although stops right there when it introduces typical superhero formula of an ancient ball that has some celestial power and the heroes and the villains are behind it. Blah blah blah.BOTTOM LINE: A typical superhero film, embezzled with good humor, great music and an unconventional character ensemble. A raccoon plays a superhero, what more do you ask?Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not a Groot film - but not bad either,"I admit to having a very negative view of both Marvel and DC movie properties of late. These seem to range from the massively over-recycled fayre of Batman, Superman and Spiderman to dredging out the most marginal characters from the back of the metaphorical kitchen cupboard. I fully expected Guardians of the Galaxy to fall into the latter category, like a forgotten 1992 bottle of Five Spice. Also, with very few exceptions, these fan-boy films have been plot and character light and, in all cases, they have been so drenched in CGI and dizzyingly fast-cut fight scenes that I have lost both patience and interest in them well before their flabby running times are up. As such, I went into this film with my ""1 star"" button at the ready.And - with that background understood - I was pleasantly surprised.Chris Pratt (too new an actor to safely have ""Movie 43"" on his resume) plays Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord) who is abducted from Earth by aliens as a young boy and turns up, 26 years later, as a Han Solo-style freewheeler looking to make a fast buck where he can.The truly tortuous plot revolves around a metal orb that Quill obtains for a collector, without realising the true power of what lies within. Also wanting to possess the orb is the evil Krill warlord Ronan, who wants it for trade with the even more evil Thanos in exchange for Thanos destroying the planet of Xandar. Xandar is ruled over by Nova Prime, a dialled in performance from Glenn Close. A couple of hot girls are involved in the pursuit - Nebula (an almost unrecognisable Karen Gillan from Dr Who) and Gamora (a more recognisable Zoe Saldana), and one or both of them might have been daughters of Thanos: I'm really not sure, it was all very confusing! Throw into the mix a vengeful wrestler type dude called Drax (Dave Bautista) and couple of bounty hunters (a CGI raccoon-like creature called Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper but it could have been anyone, and an Ent-like tree creature with a limited vocabulary called Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel (ditto)) and the course is set for a climactic showdown above and on the surface of Xandar.Yes, everything IS drenched in CGI. Yes, the numerous (and often very violent) fight scenes are dizzyingly fast-cut. Yes, the laws of physics and medicine go out the window. And yes, various bodies survive a range of unsurvivable injuries. But what lifts this film into the bearable is the sense of humour it is infused with. For reasons made obvious in the opening scene, Quill is very attached to a Sony Walkman and a mix tape of 'oldies but goodies' pervades the soundtrack to great comic effect. The opening scene with Quill as an adult sees him stretch the neck of some alien reptile creature but then karaoke disco dance with the creature as his microphone. Very funny.By the way, there are a few entertaining cameo performances involved: Stan Lee makes his usual Marvel appearance, as a ladies man on Xandar; Benicio del Toro makes a brief appearance as ""The Collector""; John C Reilly is a Xandar security guy; and - best of all - stay for the end of the titles, where a true superhero of the past turns up, for which he should have been higher billed! The director James Gunn (a relatively big-screen newcomer, also tarnished with ""Movie 43"" but also the darkly comic Kick-Ass-like ""Super"") co-wrote the movie and clearly knew what mood he was trying to deliver. This is played more for the laughs than for the tension, and is a much better film as a result. The editing and special effects are excellent (""You'll believe a raccoon can machine gun"" could be the by-line) and the running time of 2 hours doesn't make the film overly outstay its welcome. Quill makes a very likable rogue with Chris Pratt (set to appear in next year's Jurrassic World) clearly a name to watch.So, in summary, its not really my cup of tea and my rating probably rather unfairly reflects that, but with a record breaking opening week of $162M (on a $170M budget!) who really cares what I think! It's not bloody Shakespeare; but it could have been a lot worse.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"".

A Star Wars for today,"It was strange how much I ended up enjoying this movie. The first time I saw the trailer I was not terrible impressed and it seemed cliché and tacky (Especially the music).As a longtime fan and collector of marvel comics I felt obliged to go see the movie on the opening night and so I did... The movie had everything you could want in a film; space opera, comedy, explosions and even Michael Rooker as blue space alien with a magical stick!The casting was amazing, the writing was excellent and the CGI and special effects were the best I've ever seen. I have no doubt that this movie will be considered the next Star Wars (The original one, not the Jar Jar Binks version) in a decade or so from now.At the end of the film everyone clapped (Except me because I'm cool) and even my girlfriend seemed to have enjoyed it (And she hates everything). I actually felt sad leaving the cinema because I enjoyed the film so much I didn't want it to end. If it isn't a better movie than than the Avengers, it is definitely on par with it.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it now. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Nothing I say will change anyone's mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was.,"""I have lived most of my like surrounded by my enemies, I will be grateful to die among my friends."" Peter Quill (Pratt) is a space scavenger who has just found an artifact that is being sought by some very dangerous men. Immediately after taking it he is captured and is thrown together with an evil mercenary Gamora (Saldana), a brute bent on revenge, a fast talking raccoon, and a tree. When the true nature of the artifact is found out the group must find a way to work together to save a planet. First off I have to start by saying once again that I am not a big fan of comic book movies. I didn't see this in the theatre but the only thing I have heard since then is how great this was. Every single person that saw this told me how good it was. I head the ""best superhero movie ever"" over and over so the expectations were a little higher than normal for this. I don't know if it was the expectations or that I am tired of comic book movies but I was disappointed in this and wasn't all that impressed. I thought the best part was the soundtrack and the raccoon. This is a movie that is almost critic proof since it seems that any super hero movie makes a billion dollars so really nothing I say will change anyone's mind but I have to say I wasn't amazed by this like everyone else was. Overall, I'm sure I am one of the only ones to say this but I didn't really like this. I give it a B-.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As usual.,"You know that feeling, when you for example taste a good quality product and it for sure should be awesome, but it lacks something. That is precisely how I feel about this movie. You have awesome effects, great camera angles and from time to time a joke that can get a chuckle or two. Although, this humor is not my cup of tee, but I can understand why people can get behind it. But there is an inconsistent world, shallow villain, undeveloped characters, plot full of Clichés, etc.So why do I even bother? It is after all, a movie for a younger audience so one should not expect a masterly portrayed characters and thought-provoking plot. The thing is, that the overwhelming majority of todays cinema is consumed by this kind of filmmaking. But again, this is easily understandable. People want to run from the real world into fake one, where rules does not apply and everything turns good at the end. Have we become mentally weak, that we can't handle the movie that is more serious than a cartoon? The audience won't ever visit the cinemas after they shed a tear there or had themselves pondering over movie they just saw? Than again, it is a comic book movie and it does the job. It just feels that every movie today is some sort of a comic book movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the best that a scifi/action films could offer! // instagram: moviesmaniac,"From James Gunn, director of Slither and Super comes a whole new epic action galaxy hero universe, Guardians of the Galaxy.

The characters here are also very likable and very engaging to watch with their humors and hearts. The film also has so many catchy soundtrack moment that it could almost become a musical film but anyway the songs are great and really live up to the mood/tone of the scenes.

Blech!,"I'll start by saying upfront I was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie.Being a primarily Marvel comic book reader and TV show/cartoon viewer since the mid-70s, I'm don't care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book. So yes, I started watching with a bias but three successive clichés in the first 15 minutes were immediate ""strike outs"" for me.01. the ""dancing to soundtrack while you work"" scene 02. perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03. the ""hey, that's my property you're impounding ...give it back!"" scene...Never mind, the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an CGI space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a CGI walking talking catchphrase spewing tree, or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack, etc...(yawn). I think you get the point.IMO, the best comic book movie, thus far, is Watchmen and I don't even read or care for DC comics.

Best Marvel Film to Date.,"The Galaxy's un-mightiest heroes unite in cosmic bliss to create a unique, funny and heartfelt superhero movie and the best Marvel film to date.Marvel is finally expanding its already colossal film empire into space. A risky move given their safe track record. Even with lesser known heroes, Guardians is at the pinnacle of hype and I'm glad to say it paid off. A new world apparently without sarcasm and irony and full of literal meanings. Guardians is filled with funny scenes, making it unlike any tentpole superhero movie seen before. However, the trailers and previews did a lot to reduce the impact of certain dialogue, which obviously is not the fault of the production. Guardians is funny nonetheless and its self referential style keeps us entertained: ""We are Kevin Bacon"" is an actual quote. Seriously.What makes Guardians unique is James Gunn being at the helm. This is not a director that has been phoned in. The arbiters of the Marvel Universe, Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige, are recruiting directors that need more recognition. ""Super"" is one of my favourite films, and it's unique likability translates perfectly into the Marvel Universe.We knew this from the trailers and from the mouth of James Gunn, but the soundtrack is awesome; filled with classics from the 70s and 80s that many identify with. But even with this light hearted inclusion, there is layer to it, a minute origin story that gives great character development. All protagonists have a story that I actually care about. These are damaged characters with heart and soul. I wanted to get to know them and I wanted them to succeed. Groot only has a three word vocabulary, but he had more personality in one hefty trunk leg than the entire well spoken body of Superman, and to be fair, much more than Thor or Steve Rogers.Tyler Bates' score works well with out heroes. A good job, given that some of it was composed before the film began production. Rarely does a director film to the score, but it works and fits in well with the soundtrack.For me, 3D has always been a gimmick. Nothing more than a fruitless attempt to squeeze paying customers out of a little more cash. Guardians on the other hand fully embraces the third dimension, keeping the audience immersed in space. James Gunn said that he was much more involved in the 3D conversion and it shows. Having to shift your gaze to focus on a piece of space rock before your eyes is an amazing experience. To add, in conjunction with IMAX, the entire mise en scene feels real and you can observe a varying depth of field. Movies like Guardians is why IMAX and 3D was created.When Marvel announced that Cap 3 would compete against Man of Steel's sequel, I was rather disappointed. It felt that they were getting too big for their boots. A large degree of Marvel movies, for me, are typically average, but with this release I hope that Marvel is finally creating great movies, rather than simple fillers. It also further proves that DC needs to lighten up and quit being so dark and depressing. Cinema is an escape, a 2 hour chance to connect and enjoy. Guardians of the Galaxy is testament to this. It gives pure entertainment, but balances with interesting characters, all the while supporting the over arcing themes of the comics. A great Marvel product, an even better movie and I can't wait for Phase 3 to get started.Action: 5 Score: 4 Soundtrack: 5 Direction: 4 Acting: 4 Story: 4 Screenplay: 4 Watch Again?

A Mediocre Gift in Gold Wrapping Paper/The Case When IMDb Users Get it Wrong,"As usual, I headed to IMDb before renting this movie. I didn't even bother reading the reviews since it received the outstanding score of 8.3. I was reassured that I would be getting a great movie when the girl at the store said she absolutely loved it and watched it ""everyday."" Maybe she was a big fan beforehand? Anyway, I placed serious doubt as to whether this could actually be that great of a movie and was sad to see that I was right.Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG) is a movie that has been done many, many times before it. You might even say that it is a bunch of pieces from different movies combined into one title. Those who think they are going to get something unique and interesting are in for a shock because this movie does not have a single original idea of its own. In fact, imagine a plot that you would tell a young child in order to keep him/her from getting confused and this is exactly what you're going to get.The characters will come across as very familiar because they've all been done too many times before, but these characters do worse because they lack authenticity. For example, the Ravagers are supposed to be a group of smugglers and thieves, but you never really get the sense that these guys are true representatives of their profession. The only character who manages to stand out is Groot because he adds a little variety to the movie by not being so painfully predictable, but do not expect to hear much from this character throughout the entire movie. As far as the other characters go, there is next to zero character development, and there are times when characters fail to give you a sense that you are in a certain environment, especially the ones that are supposed to be hostile.The true highlight of the movie is how good it looks. The makeup artists did an outstanding job. There are also some very good looking scenes in the movie. Next, the jokes also help improve the quality of the movie but they are often simple and sometimes irrelevant. The action is just OK. Last, the music that Star-Lord likes to play helps but feels awkward at times and never really finds a scene where it actually belongs.In conclusion, GOTG looks right but does mostly everything wrong. This is a movie you watch when you are bored and do not want to be challenged to think. If this is the case for you, a single rental might be worth it. If you want a solidly good movie, you will be sadly disappointed. This movie comes nowhere close to great, highly rated movies such as Forest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption, Gladiator, Fight Club, and Pan's Labyrinth and shouldn't be rated so close to them. There are equalizers who will give the movie a single star to see its overall rating go down, but I won't go that route, although I would like to in this particular instance. GOTG is a soft 6.3 and probably rates a little higher if you like eye candy and simple jokes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My favourite Marvel film so far.,"From start to finish I had nothing but fun with Guardians of the Galaxy. It has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time; part of me cannot wait for the sequel just so I get to hear 'Awesome Mix Vol 2'.I can honestly say that I did not hate any of the characters, which is very rare for me as their is usually at least one character that I just cannot bear to watch. Every character served their purpose and seemed necessary.As soon as Guardians of the Galaxy becomes available on DVD I am sure it will very rarely see the inside of it's case whilst in my house.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A fun movie, but not the hit people claim it to be.","Sure, the movie made the numbers. But is that the proof for a good movie? I don't think so. What we have here, is superhero movie number..... (lost count). Movies such as Spider-Man, X-Men etc. are for everybody, and especially people who read the comics 10...20 years ago. So it's not just about being good, but about recognizing things from a long time ago, pleased with wonderful cameo's and teasers for more to come.But especially this movie, it lost the touch we got with the first Spider-Man, Cap. America and Iron Man. Those movies, even with effects, were subtle to a point and had at least SOME character development. The people were interesting with AND without mask.But in GotG we don't get better effects, but more effects. We don't get better characters, but more characters. We certainly didn't get better acting. What do you expect when a lead part is given to a wrestler? The acting was bad. It was acceptable, because it came with humor and good timing. But humor in that way should be scarce. Instead, we now got it for 2 hours. Humor, shooting, yelling, laughing. So many characters that it felt rushed, at the cost of likable characters and development.I hope in time people will see this movie for what it is. Popcorn entertainment with above average effects and below average acting. Because if not, it means the end of good movies and the welcoming of more Transformer (kind of) movies thanks to people who vote 10 just for the sake of it.This movie should get a 6,5 or a 7. Nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Entertainment at its best!,"Now I did go to this movie expecting to be entertained. But what i didnot expect was to actually end up getting tears in my eyes and get hysterical. Not many new movies have done that recently. This movie DELIVERS entertainment in a bombshell. It will get you smiling ear to ear just as about as soon as it starts, why?. Well the choice of background scores they chose is why and how perfect they sync with the scenes. Chris Pratt did a fantastic job as Starlord and definitely got me to look into the character as i wasn't aware of it before. The story was nothing extraordinary like many of the superhero movies out there, it was just about interesting. But the characters are what pull it off, Rocket Raccoon has definitely become the most badass raccoon out there considering not many are there. But it definitely packs a punch giving a run for the money to many of the characters for ""the most favorite comic character"" in the marvel universe or DC universe for sorts.In short, this movie is solely an entertainment power-bag with a decent story that would just suffice to get you watching it over and over again N times and crack you up every single time thus making it a probable future comic classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The galaxy needs protection and these heroes are perfect,"In 1988 a young Peter Quill is by his dying mothers bedside, the last thing she wants to do before she passes on is give her child a final gift and say her goodbyes, but the emotion running through Peter is so strong and surreal his mother's dying wish to just hold his hand is never met. So as some kind of talisman the gift Peter receives is shoved into his backpack and never opened. Emotions run high as his mother's last breath leaves her body and young Peter runs out of the hospital and into an open field where he is suddenly beamed up and onto a spacecraft. Jump forward 26 years and a few galaxy's away and the young Peter Quill now known as Starlord as he likes to call himself is on an adventure of relic hunting, he picks up a strange orb which we discover is a treasure he has been commissioned to find and comes with a very lucrative reward attached. Starlord takes the orb back to the buyer who has offered the cash prize but once the buyer learns that Starlord was actually approached Ronan a madman who is intent on destroying the planet they stand on the deal is quickly shutdown and nothing is exchanged but a few awkward words. Starlord is then met by Gomora the assassin a stolen daughter of Thanos now working alongside Ronan who attempts to steal the orb away. Rocket a bounty hunter raccoon who can talk and who has been genetically modified to be a kind of gun tooting engineer and his bodyguard Groot a humanoid tree learn that Starlord has a bounty and attempt to go after it. Soon after the four characters are picked up and thrown into prison on an inescapable compound where the four meet Drax the destroyer a warrior who had his family slain by Ronan and wants nothing more than revenge. The five decide to team up and escape the prison to then go on and sell the orb to ""the collector"" a man who does exactly what his name states; he collects things. The group eventually learn that what lies within the orb can wipe out the universe and do whatever they can to ensure not Ronan nor Thanos the warlord Ronan works for do not get their hands on the orb. I cannot tell you how much I loved this film, I loved it from start to finish. I loved how it opened with such a powerful image and I loved how it ended with one much the same. It was funny, but not just funny ha-ha, it was hilarious, some of the dialogue was so natural in its delivery it all worked so well. The film never takes itself seriously unlike a few other films released it's just great fun. The CGI and visual effects are inspiring, the score is gorgeous and the 70's soundtrack worked so well with the entire film. There wasn't much you couldn't hate in this film. The characters were so real and believable (well as much as possible anyway) The cast were fabulous, I loved every one of them the standouts for me though were Ronan in my opinion one of the best bad guys to ever be given life! And Rocket, a Racoon with anger management issues is brilliant. Then of course Starlord who just holds everything together. Directed by James Gunn who is relatively an unknown he also helped write the script, I now believe he has a huge career ahead of him. Starting Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Starlord, Zoe Saldana as Gomora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Deisel as the voice of Groot, Dave Bautista as Drax, Lee Pace as Ronan, Michael Rooker as Yondu, Karen Gillan as Nebula and a handful of other quite well-known names made for an amazing cast. So now onto what I would have liked to see differently, the only thing I really hope they do is some origin films, nothing else, for once I didn't care there were no back stories on who these people were or where they actually came from but I would love to eventually see origin stories for each and every one of them. Guardians of the Galaxy is the must see film of the year for me so far, so go out and see it on the big screen before it finishes!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Action Movie of 2014,"This is definitely the best superhero movie to ever come out so far. This movie had fun characters, hilarious humor, amazing action and special effects and the perfect plot to go with the story line. It was different and had its own very unique concept. I loved the villains in the movie and iv'e really become a huge fan of rocket raccoon after seeing the movie. The movie had pretty much everything it needed including drama, suspense, humor, crime, and action in the right order. This movie is indeed a new age classic marvel superhero film and i am really excited to see how the movie follows the other marvel films. I enjoyed this movie a lot and i think it was better than the avengers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
it is so nice film,"I entitle my review A New Hope as I walk out of the cinema feeling like I have just watched the Star Wars of our generation!As a huge Marvel fan (both comics and film) I was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of Guardians and what a perfect cast to play them. The biggest surprise for me was Dave Bautista who I thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for Drax. Chris Pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes.CGI in this film was super, there's nothing I hate more than too much CGI in a film but it was so good in Guardians that I was completely lost in it. Never have a seen space look so good, the battles were incredible and Groot and Rocket never looked out of place (aside from being a tree and raccoon).Gunn is the perfect director for this, his tone, his balance of comedy, action and emotion blended perfectly and directing GOTG would have been no easy job.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Raccoon steals the show,"Set in the future, The Guardians of the Galaxy is a wild ride. A set of misfits come together by a series of random actions that sets then up to save the balance of the powers to be. They strongly work on making everything right in the fight for domination of the universe. At times the dialogue is a bit mind numbing but the mix cast of unlikely figures is fun to watch. This marvel comic release comes out with a large amount of fanfare. The set design on the digital platform is beautifully laid out. The raccoon is the ring leader and the brains of the operation. It is a different mix of comic characters. The effects were top notch and have a realistic feel. It is a thrill to see and how the creativity of digital media moves the story along.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A touch of Serenity,"Usually I will go to see movies that I've anticipated for some time. Although Guardians was on my radar, I wasn't sure it was worthy of a cinema visit until I read the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. The running time races by as the Marvel mayhem continues and the story pings from set piece to set piece. The welcome addition here is the humour, reminiscent of that other Marvel auteur Joss Whedon and his pinnacle of sci-fi, Firefly. The story threads link to a worthy final battle and at the end there are enough loose threads left to make you want to fast forward to 2017. One of the few films I've seen where I would gladly go straight back in and watch again, go see for a great evening's entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It reminded me of too many movies.,"Guardians of the Galaxy had some cool action scenes and laughs, but felt too familiar to other superhero movies and space movies. I didn't care for the story or most of the characters except Groot and the raccoon. Although, they still felt like comic sidekicks like other movies. The story was the same repetitive concept of a device that is used to destroy the world and gets stolen from the villains like the evil ring in LOTR. It didn't feel like it's own superhero movie. When I watch those kinds of movies, I usually love them because they feel like their own story/world, but this felt like all of those movies combined.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"I'm Distracting you, ya big TurdBlossom!","This was simply fun, no other way to describe it. This is a Comic Book movie the way they should all be made. It's the ""Star Wars: A Hew Hope"" type of thing.Most moviegoers today did not see the original ""Star Wars"" as it was called in 1977, and moreover they did not see it up to 20 times in the theater like just about everyone did back then. In fact, there were no multiplex theater complexes, movie-going was much more of an event.By today's standards, it's impossible to create a movie that will have the same impact. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ran for most of a year when it came out. But Star Wars? The Original Star Wars ran for almost 2 years straight, the line to get in was constantly over 100 people long.So when I say, this movie gets that feeling back, it does - Maybe not the same reaction. It is very rare that a movie runs for a year these days, so if a movie runs 4 to 5 months, it is considered excellent.But I started hearing very good things about this for months until I was able to see it. It looks good, the music brings back memories, and at the most important spot in the movie, they play ""The Runaways"" version of ""Cherry Bomb"".Vinny Diesel really does not need to say much beyond ""I am Groot"", after a while, you know what he means. But the guy who stands out here is of course Dave Bautista, who was also in ""Riddick"" as what Riddick calls ""A Big Jamoke"". Here, he's the the big Jamoke who takes everything literally. His performance is one of the best things here.Each of the main characters has that one quirk that makes them interesting, or, irritating.I can see tendrils of story leading into The Avengers and the first Captain America installment, look for The Cosmic Cube. There are several great character actors- ""The Collector"" (Benicio Del Toro), Michael Rooker (Yondu), Djimon Hounsou as Korath, John C Reilly as a Nova Cop, even Glenn Close as Nova Prime. Christopher Fairbank, ""The Broker"".Lee Pace (Thranduil from The Hobbit series) is a great Ronan. and we finally get to see that ""Skrull"" who was shown briefly at the end of ""The Avengers"" - It was ""Thanos"", voiced at least by Josh Brolin.I have the first edition of this comic in my comic bin, sadly I have never read it. Of course this is rife with CGI, but it's a comic book movie, and CGI is, or could be used as comic art of sorts. I wonder how much this story follows anything from that one comic? The cinematography is very much like recreated comic book frames.It's not just about CGI, it is using it cleverly, which this does. This film could not have been made without it.Zoe Saldana is great in green, but the big mystery of the day is ""who is Starlord's dad""? According to Yondu, ""The Guy was a Jerk"".Hopefully we'll find out, in a sequel that's as cool as this one. And remember, Nebula (Karen Gillan) is still floating around somewhere sans hand, did she go back to her daddy?The bad reviews and votes: I found several verbatim 1 stars in here, repeated over and over as I went through the pages chronologically.

A Hilarious Paint by numbers Superhero movie!,"One would argue that Hollywood is saturated with comic-book movies these days. I wouldn't complain though coz some of the best Hollywood blockbusters came to life from their comic book counterparts. The Dark Knight, Avengers, Sin City, 300 to name a few. But at the same time it does a tad bit tiring when studios like Marvel, Warner Bros and 21st Century Fox dishes out a dozen of these so called superhero movies with 'save the world from the bad guy' premise. Lets keep aside DC for the time being coz it gave us THE best superhero movie of all time, The Dark Knight. Yea, I am a DC fanboy, throw eggs at me, I don't care. Lets talk about Marvel who's on a winning streak since Iron Man, setting up their Phases flawlessly. The Avengers was no doubt, one of the best comic book movies ever made but you gotta agree, some of the Phase One movies that the studio churned out to fill in till the finale just felt like..wellfillers.It bewildered me why Marvel was making a movie on some lesser known galactic superheroes while they could have easily pulled off a Nova Corps, Alpha Flight or an Excalibur movie, hell they could have even gone for X-Factor. While I am fairly positive the aforementioned still might be in the pipeline I frankly thought that Guardians Of The Galaxy would be a quick cashing in before the behemoth release, Avengers Age of Ultron. My skepticism hit the roof when I learnt that James Gunn was directing the movie. No offence, I like the guys' movies, be it the darkly comic, Super or the disgustingly humorous Slither but Gunn isn't what I would call fit for a superhero movie. Turned out I was wrong and his weird humor and direction earned him my respect and admiration for making an Awesome Anti-Avengers movie.Thanks to no Worldwide release I had to wait out a week rummaging through the internet avoiding stumbling upon a Guardians of the Galaxy review/spoiler. But then again I wouldn't lie, storywise Guardians of the Galaxy is a paint by numbers save-the-world story and wouldn't have made a difference even if I had stumbled on some spoilers. But its those these dysfunctional crooks that make magic out of it. This group of outlaws comprising of Starlord, Gamora, Rocket, Groot and Drax is everything you've never expected in a superhero movie and when they team up, it works perfectly. Don't go in expecting an Avengers-esque movie coz you'll be let down coz Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers are tonally poles apart, almost. Thanks to James Gunn, the movie promises chuck loads of his signature humour and chockful of action. Amidst all the ruckus you'd almost forget the fact the antagonist is the least bit intimidating, oh yea that's flaw you are likely to look past.I had not thought once, when I'd seen Chris Pratt getting his teeth bashed out by James McAvoy in Wanted, that he'd end up as a main lead in a major studios' production. Chris Pratt was just amazing as Peter Quill aka Star Lord, his comic prowess stood out till end. When I asked one of my friends if he'd liked to go for Guardians of The Galaxy he scoffed saying ""I am not going for movie which has a talking squirrel"", I sincerely sympathize with the fellow for addressing so, one of best characters in the movie, Rocket the Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. Vin Diesels' Groot was adorable and having just 2 lines through out the movie didn't hurt at all, instead you'll saying it yourself post watching the movie. Zoe Saldana played Gamora and it would have helped to fill in her backstory just a bit more. While I initially questioned Dave Bautista's acting skills, I'd say he did his part well. Surprisingly the leads' packed the same kinda charm the Avengers had on its plate.I tapped my foot every time those soundtracks kicked in. I have a thing for old school music and Guardians of The Galaxy's soundtrack is most definitely my cup of tea. It includes Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling which had been a favorite since the Ally McBeal days, plus Redbone's Come and Get Your Love, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, 10cc's I'm Not in Love are some of the frequent tracks in my usual playlist.Marvel sure had balls to make a movie on these less notable heroes and an unconventional director and the fact it worked out well amuses me more. Guardians of The Galaxy might not be as epic as The Avengers, but its a surefire entertainer and no comic-book movie fan would say NO to it. I am sure this would have boosted Guardian of The Galaxy comics sales, not to mention filling up Kevin Feige's pockets, but as long as Marvel churns out movies like this, count me in.PS: James Gunn's weird sense of humour came into play once again when the post credit sequence popped up, though take it with just a pinch of salt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Short and sweet,Great film i am a bit of a fan boy but even my wife loved this movie. I think the fact that is lesser known allows for a wider audience to come in and enjoy just as a sci-fi action comedy. The comedic timing in this film was perfect. The way the characters play off each other easily makes this the best ensemble cast marvel has put together. The character development was well done. Guardians gave enough to support the story but left much to be desired for the subsequent sequels. Guardians also totes the best soundtrack for any marvel film. While it focuses on some the most popular pop records from years past the score was also done very well. For all of the none comic book movie fans go see this film you will be throughly entertained.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"not the best, but maybe the most entertaining movie","You can always nitpick, Guardians lacks depth, it is very colorful, there could be better character development, but while you watch this movie, you will be entertained. And you will be entertained in a way that you might have not been entertained before.Make no mistake, this is an action packed movie full of space opera (spaceships battling), fantasy (talking Racoons) and cute trees fighting for the greater good. So if you like movies about the real world, this is not for you. But you might have guessed it when you have seen that this movie is from Marvel.But for all others, this movie is highly, highly recommended. It mixes hilarious jokes, great action and fight scenes with memorable characters in such a great way, that you might wonder why not every movie is so entertaining and so funny. This movie felt like 30 minutes, it was over way too fast. And it leaves you in your seat, starting to count the days for the sequel.Rocket Racoon might be the most hilarious and lovable character ever created in fantasy. Every line of this little guy leaves behind a thunder of laughter.I don't know if it is better than Avengers and to be honest, I don't want to be the judge. Some will like it more, some will like it less. And my guess is, if I have seen this movie several times, I might see some faults in it. But until this day, I start counting twice, one time for the days till the sequel finally hits the screen and the other time for the BluRay release.If you have not seen this movie yet, I envy you, because you are about to be blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Expectations Exceeded,"I went into this films with sky high expectations as both a fan of the DnA run on the comic and Gunns previous work as a director (Slither is awesome).The ting that baffles me most is that, as a fan of the comic, I should be pretty ticked off by the film as they have changed many things from the source material. Drax has a completely different back story and personality, Ronan is just a ""bad"" guy, Nova corpse can't fly etc etc.The thing is the film was just too much fun for me to care about those things. Everyone is saying its like ""star wars"" or ""raiders"" etc, in my humble opinion they're wrong. For me it reminds me much more like Ghostbusters than anything else. Not just because its more blatant in it's humor (although it is), it's because its about a group of dropouts and losers who are way out their depth saving the world/galaxy.The film truly rocks! From the great visuals, to the cool story, to the action set pieces, to the emotional scenes, to banter, right through this fully realized universe that Gunn has created.If I had one nit to pick I do think that Ronan is slightly under served due to the film having so much to do as a first outing like introduce an entire galaxy as well as a whole team of heroes. It would have been nice to have more of the history of the Xandar/Kree war to add more weight to Ronans actions but the rest of the film is that good its easy to ignore that small fault. Hopefully now they have already done most of the set up work they can flesh the other aspects out more in future Guardians filmsHowever the biggest and most pleasant surprise of all for me was Drax. Like I said earlier, he is the character that has been altered the most, he is also played by a professional wrestler (who haven't had the best track record for producing acting talent) and in the heaviest make up out the bunch. I thought he was going to either suck or be the weakest link by a long shot but no, he flat out gets some of the biggest laughs in the film and some of the most touching scenes too, no spoilers but there's a bit with him and rocket towards the end that made my ""hay fever"" play up.Going to see it again on Wednesday and cant wait for July 2017 so we can do this all over again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Typical sci-fi fare. Nothing special.,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" certainly does not warrant the 8.5 rating it currently enjoys on IMDb. The screenplay follows the same pattern we have seen a thousand times now.I was under the impression this was a sort of comedy, and looked forward to seeing an original concept. But unfortunately this movie isn't very funny at all. At least not any more so than other Marvel films.This movie relies very heavily on CGI. Some of the visuals are stunning. The style borrows from movies such as the Star Wars prequels and The Fifth Element.Frankly it was hard to understand exactly what was going on. Some dude with a two-syllable name has a beef with some other two-syllable dude. My overall impression is that of an average action-packed film without a lot of intelligence.As for the stellar ratings by other reviewers, I can only guess it's from a younger generation which has been brainwashed into mistaking Hollywood hand-fed consumerist horsesh1t for art.

The design overall is very good, the effects also and unlike some I liked Chris Pratt and the Ronan actor. But the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon character's grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes.The film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste.

Guardians of the Galaxy more than delivers! Holy damn.,"One of the most entertaining and crowd-pleasing movies ever made. I just got out of an advance screening with my friend and we both can agree that it is brilliant. The humor is there, the action, the story, the acting, the freaking cinematography! This film is a joy to look at. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack! It's magnificent, and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. I was upset at the end, however, because it ended.

The film was action packed and had emotional scenes which were portrayed well. The visual effects are really good, but the dialogue isn't... really is a shame as this film had so much potential.

Did I miss something?,"Everyone said this movie was fantastic. As a big superhero and Marvel fan, I obviously went and saw it. I'm not so sure I saw the same movie as everyone else who loved it. I'll start with the exposition. Peter Quill, a young boy on Earth witnesses his mother die. OK. This was clearly supposed to make me sad. Let's face it, though, every superhero has lost one or both parents. Plus,I didn't know anything about this character so it was hard for me to care about him. It was supposed to be dramatic and intense, but it was just a big pile of meh.But that's OK! Because now we get into the meat of the story. Peter is all grown up and played by Chris Pratt and he's... a thief? OK. I can cheer for thieves, I guess. I like the Italian Job. But I'm a little confused that the other thief (Some blue alien whose name I forget two seconds after they say it) who was his partner and got ripped off is not supposed to be cheered for. He doesn't seem much worse than Quill to me. What, we hate him because he is blue? Oh, sure, he turns out a lot worse at the end, but come on. Up until that point the protagonist is just as bad, if not worse, than him. Speaking of questionable morals, how about Bradley Cooper's Rocket? Only motivated by money. He's only on the good guy team because he can make a truckload of cash. I struggled to cheer for him. Also, I am a huge Batista fan, and was excited to see him in this one. Disappointed. His character has no reason to be there. He doesn't contribute anything to the story except make things harder for everyone else and get his butt kicked a few times. I was hoping the WWE star would show us his physical prowess by actually WINNING a fight here and there. The only physical prowess he shows is LOOKING really big and intimidating. Speaking of looks, this movie is very pretty. I will concede that. Excellent CGI. But in today's age of Avatar and Gravity, I just can't be impressed too much by CGI anymore. It doesn't have the same effect in the modern age of movies. Overall, this movie is OK. It holds up with other Marvel titles and I'm sure as the characters are explored a little more, I'll find more joy in it. But frankly, I was pumped for this movie and let down. And I really TRIED to enjoy. I found myself forcing myself to laugh at Bradley Cooper's remarks and attempting to feel sorry for the tragedies the various characters went through, but I really just couldn't care about the characters. I don't know these people. They aren't Iron Man, Hulk, or Captain America. They are... Starlord, Queen Ghidorah(?), Raccoon dude, Groot (You are forced to remember that one), and unintelligent beefcake alien. They don't fight Loki, they fight some cowboy alien and some blue dude with an infinity stone (OK...). Thanos is there too. He's also important. I guess. Meh.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Overrated,"To start with, the film has excellent visual effects and the action sequences were very good. The production design kind of looked like the 60s, but that's not really a problem. I felt like there was nothing really new here, the same story-lines are repeated in these Marvel films, so it does not have a lot to make it unique or so different from other Sci-Fi films, and it is really strange to me how so many people loved it. Also, apart from Groot (who was just awesome), I did not find any of the other characters very likable, especially Chris Pratt. Zoe Saldana was the clichéd bad-ass action heroine who is more serious than the goofy male hero.However, the story was gripping a lot of the time, and I have to repeat how amazing the visual effects were; it was just visually dazzling. But I also had a problem with how bad the skin makeup looked on the colorful characters (Zoe Saldana, her sister, the villain and others). All in all, the film was fun to watch and has great visuals, but I found it overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Haters gonna hate but...,"All right! There is a lot of haters but whatever. This is the very first ""superfolks"" movie I have actually enjoyed. The reason? The characters, who are mostly ""gray"". They are not good guys but not the bad guys either.The first half of the movie is actually the best. A group of rogues, lost folks, betrayers, head hunters, desperados. I liked the racoonish character most. He is just so amazing! Do not expect anything deep or clever, but this movie is just as clever and as fun as it is possible for mainstream comic show.This movie is not amazing in the sense of the ""great art cinema"", but it is powerful, emotional, fun and clever. And the message is perfect: You may be ""an a-hole, but not 100% d-ick"". Yes, most of us are not ""100% d-icks"". Even those who are pretty bad are still capable to do great things.""So what should do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?"" - Oh yes, I love these characters from this gray area. They are as close to life as possible. Most of us are ""gray"", we are A great show!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great,"Interestingly, it was the beginning of the film where the action plays Peter Quill Classic music with chant: D /. The film was well balanced between Action scenes at her funny.Then there Groot who always say ""I'm Groot"". I think Vin Diesel would feel bored with the only sound filling it alone. But, that's what makes this film funny.I just realized that this film is actually linked from Avenger & Thor The Dark World, because confirmed so far are only three: Tesseract (The Avengers), Aether (Thor: The Dark World), and Orb (GotG). Maybe one of them sticks Loki is using that in The Avengers, but there has been no further confirmation.It seems from all the Marvel movies, I'm more interested in this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Why I liked it,"I am so burnt out on back stories it's ridiculous. Spoiler alert Hollywood; most of us already knew that Peter Parker was bite by a special spider. We already know that when Bruce Banner gets mad he turns into the Hulk... so now... just show us the Hulk!Guardians is a comic book movie that has the characters wearing there super hero costumes for the entire movie. Not Peter Parker wearing a hoodie in the rain thinking of his relationship woes.The one of the rules for something to qualify as ""epic"" is that it has to start in the middle of the action. Guardians did this; a one minute seen about a boy being pulled from his planet after a tragedy and then BOOM, we have our lead character IN COSTUME and having an adventure. within the first half hour the whole team is together (not necessarily getting along yet)kicking ass and taking names!To me, one quality that an action movie needs to qualify as a good action movie is that the plot needs to move in accordance with the action sequences. Guardians does this. Because Star Lord stole the orb and fought the villains they followed him. Because they all fought over the orb in the middle of the city they were taken to prison. The results of the battle determine the next plot point.Plus, it was fun! All the characters had decent screen time, they all interacted with each other, they all had good battles.Two numbers I track with comic book movies are: How many minutes were spent in actually in an action sequence (car chases and suspenseful happenings count) And how many minutes were the super heroes actually in costume.With guardians you could tell the cast and crew were all very excited to make the movie as great as possible, and it shows through. Of course there is always room for improvement. But who cares.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A True Classic!,"WARNING- This review is made from the opinions of a person who has never fully seen a superhero movie.Guardians of the Galaxy has a simple plot yet it is so versatile. For people who have never read the comics, all you need to know is that the five bickering good guys join together to stop the bad guy from getting the 'special object' that can end the world. Sounds like a typical PG movie, eh? WRONG.The characters are lovable, the acting is great, the music is AMAZING, the action scenes are great, the CGI is great, EVERYTHING IS GREAT!The movie is amazing but only has two flaws. The movie doesn't really explore locations and it feels like we didn't go anywhere by the end and the main villain is just 'okay'. This movie is by far the best of the year and will be remembered for a long time. P.S Gamora is by far one of my favorite villains in years, her actress is amazing! She should have a spin-off!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not quite the hype,"I had high hopes for this movie, not knowing much about this lesser known comic series, and hearing all the early reviews.I will say, it's squarely aimed at younger teens. The humor, while there, isn't very witty and rather obvious, stuff that would have made me chuckle when I was a little kid, but now? No. This was disappointing as most of the other Marvel films often had a lot of clever adult wit to them. The plot is also very basic, and just isn't very inventive.The action is all very PG-rated stuff too. Much as there was all sorts of things going on, you weren't worried about any of the characters at all, nor in how the story would turn out.Groot turns out to be ridiculously overpowering and he eliminates a lot of the perceived danger to the other characters. He quite literally smashes something like 30 guys all at once.The main villain is as cardboard as you can get. I can't even remember his name, or what his motives were. He was just like the bad guy from THOR Dark World. Just kinda 'there', with another big scary looking ship.Rocket Racoon, while expertly crafted in CGI, his voice acting was just terrible. In fact, everything about him was very wooden. I had thought that a Racoon whose been experimented on with cybernetics and such and with a penchant for heavy caliber weapons and street slang would be funny, but its obvious that his character is just trying too hard to BE that diminutive overachiever... His dialog really needed a better voice actor who sounded more like the character should, and with some sharper lines....I just don't know with this movie. It just doesn't rank very well compared to most of Marvel's other outings. It has all the splash and dash 'appearance' of those films, but lacked the adult angle that the others have had. The last thing I expected was such a child oriented film. I guess the good news is, I can show this to my son a lot earlier than the other films due to their content.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A thoroughly entertaining movie,"I'm not going to write a thousand words like some people seem to have done. I figure folks want to know quickly if they're going to enjoy something!1. Great music, especially if you grew up in the 70s and 80s. 2. Beautiful animation - these folks are getting really good at this. 3. It's funny, especially pretty much everything that comes out of the raccoon's mouth. 4. A not too silly storyline, I wasn't bored and didn't feel the need to roll my eyes too much. 5. Enjoyable villains, especially the blue guy Yondu, played by Michael Rooker who was Merle Dixon in Walking Dead.Overall this was a creative story with charismatic characters and if you're a parent wondering if you'll be bored taking your young teens to it, don't worry, you won't. It's also not horribly violent - violence is sort of cartoonish and not at all gory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Entertaining movie, a good watch","I grew up in the 80's and 90's reading comics....a LOT of comics. I must admit that I never really got into the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series. However I was really familiar with one of the main characters in particular......you old school comic book fans might remember the original Drax.1. Drax was green 2. Drax could fly 3. Drax had superhuman strength 4. Drax could shoot power blastsSo after watching the movie I was pretty confused. I had to read Drax's wikipedia page to find out they changed his character completely in 2004. I gotta say Marvel, this newer no-powers having, knife wielding, semi-psycho Drax....is rather pathetic/boring compared to the original.So, after I got over the shock of the ""new Drax"" I enjoyed this movie immensely. The CGI is fantastically done, especially the space battles. The characters and the dialog were engaging and I found myself really taking a liking to Groot. I look forward to seeing what they do in Part 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel finally made a great movie.,"Marvel has a reputation for being the best of the best at summer blockbusters. This film is no exception. It's going to make A LOT of money. And for the first time in quite a few years, a Marvel film actually deserves it. Following Peter Quill or Star Lord played by Chris Pratt. The not so notorious outlaw. As he is sent to retrieve a odd orb from a desolate planet. Turns out quite a few others are also after the orb. This leads to the meeting of the other guardians of the galaxy. Rocket played by Bradly cooper a genetically modified raccoon meant to be comedy relief , Gamora Zoe Saldana a vicious warrior, Drax Dave Bautista a deranged killer, and Groot Vin Diesel a practically invisible tree. The visuals are unmatched just like any marvel movie. As they should be since 2 of the leads are completely CGI. Besides the jaw dropping visuals the characters here are equally well done. We learn deep and engaging things about each one which will make you fall in love with them. Usually a film with this many main characters some are forgotten or the bonds between them and the others are thin. But Gaurdians does a brilliant job of developing strong bonds between each character individually. While the leads are extremely well done the villain is once again forgotten. Marvel has a tough time making a villain that is unforgettable. While Locke is the closest they've gotten its just not enough. Ronan played by Lee pace was under done. Although he had more motive then most of marvels villains he is still quite forgettable. Another forgettable aspect is the story. All though intriguing and mysterious. It is quite predictable right from the start. The orb that everyone is after seems stupid and useless. But you cant help but think of why everyone wants it. Once you figure out what is and does THEN the story falls prey to Marvels usual ridiculousness and predictability. Even tho the over the top ending feels more coherent then any other Marvel flick.All in all Guardians of the Galaxy is a well crafted summer blockbuster filled with heart, great characters, amazing VFX, and an ending that wraps things up nicely. Even tho it has a predictable story the only real weak link is the under done villain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Most Amazing Marvel Movie Yet!,"Guardians of the Galaxy 10/102 Straight hours of pure perfection! Guardians of the Galaxy was, how to put his...the Greatest Marvel Movie Yet! It's definitely my favorite Marvel movie for sure!Characters - The Characters in this movie are absolutely lovable and great. Chris Pratt as Star Lord. Chris I swear is the next big Hollywood star I guarantee it. He was in the LEGO movie and now this. He's also going to be in Jurassic World. Chris plays a thief and he is flawless in the movie. Gamora was a good character to. She's a Assassin and a fierce warrior. Drax's character was OK but I liked him. He played a really fearsome warrior. Rocket! Oh my god Rocket stole the show. Rocket is so awesome on screen all the time and also sometimes so adorable. You can not hate Rocket, he is just pure awesome. Groot was a very lovable character too, he was very heart-warming and powerful in this movie. The only character I do have a bone to pick with is Ronan. He honestly was kind of a lame looking villain, but he really didn't bother me during this movie.Plot - The plot worked out pretty well. The length of this movie was perfect and everything that happens in this movie entertains you. There is no break from pure fun in this movie throughout the movie you are going to smile.Comedy - My god this movie was hilarious. This movie has humor shot through the movie at perfect times. You will laugh a lot in his movie and that's a really good thing.Emotional Stuff? - This movie actually had a lot of heart and emotional scenes on it. Like a lot. I didn't except it but it happen. And it's good emotion it's emotion that makes you feel good. I haven't seen a Marvel movie with so much emotion. This is what makes this movie so much more unique than other Marvel movies.Action Sequences - the movies action scenes were just fun. Just fun. You will watch this movie having the time of your life with these awesome action scenes. The movies fight scenes are really interesting and some of the violence and destruction that happens in the movie looks super cool.Effects - The movie's space effects are so cool. There's a lot of really good cgi that actually made the film look beautiful. Every shot from the movie is a poster you could hang on your wall. Fantastic effects!Pros -Great Cast Hilarious Humor Plotted Out Well Beautiful Effects Great Action Sequences The Good Tyoe of Emotional SequencesCons -None! Heck yah!Overall - so overall...go watch Guardians. N I'm serious get off of your laptop or whatever your using to read is review and just go buy tickets to see Guardians of the Galaxy, because Guardians of the Galaxy deserves a 10/10 from me and a (A+) Guardians of the Galaxy is the summer movie you'll be loving the most!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A triumph of original sci-fi with a giant dose of humour..,"'Guardians of the Galaxy' – 8.5 out of 10 Reviewed by Matthew French.Things looked a bit shaky for Marvel Studios for a while there with 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor: The Dark World' both being something of a let down. Then along came the excellent 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' to remind us Super Hero movie nerds that the folks in charge of this most excellent film franchise had their heads firmly screwed on.Still, there's no doubt that making 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was something of a gamble. Going with a movie about a relatively unknown group of space traveling vigilantes was definitely not the safe option. I can gladly report that the gamble has well and truly paid off. This is a movie that has the winning combination of being fresh and original while still carrying the laugh out loud sense of humour and spectacular action sequences which have become the hallmark of the Marvel cinematic universe. It is to 2014 what 'Iron Man' was to 2008. From the genuinely heart breaking opening through to the after credits scene it is a triumph of original cinema.The story revolves around Peter Quill, the self-proclaimed 'Star Lord'. Quill (who is excellently portrayed by Chris Pratt) was abducted by aliens as a child and brought up by a band of space pirates. By acquiring a priceless treasure (which turns out to be one of the all- powerful Infinity Stones) Quill finds himself on the wrong side of the Galactic law enforcement and seemingly all of the universe's shadier characters, not to mention, in the middle of an interstellar war. Joining him along the way are a motley group of misfits, all with their own agendas, comprised of 'Rocket' a genetically engineered Racoon, his bodyguard 'Groot' a super strong walking tree, 'Gamora' a master assassin and easily the hottest green chick in movie history, and 'Drax –the Destroyer' a homicidal psychopath on a mission for revenge.The cast all do a fantastic job. Chris Pratt delivers a performance which may go down as being as iconic as Robert Downey Jr's 'Iron Man'. He is perfect as the wise-cracking, womanising, half human lead role. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel do a great job as the voices of 'Rocket' and 'Groot'. Zoe Saldana is believable as 'Gamora', daughter of 'Thanos' (the big purple guy from the after credits scene in 'The Avengers'). And WWE wrestler Dave Bautista just about steals the show as the maniacal, and very literal 'Drax'.The interactions between this unlikely troupe provide many a laugh. For example:Rocket: (about Drax) ""He takes everything literally. Metaphors go over his head"".Drax: ""NOTHING goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.""If the primary objective of a movie is to provide enjoyment, than this should be considered an instant classic. It is just about the ideal mix of action, sci-fi, and comedy. Sure, it has its faults, but given the source material that is perfectly forgivable.Go and see it.'Guardians of the Galaxy' – 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the best Marvel movies to date!,"This is definitely a must-see. The plot may be a bit generic and not very compelling, but the main point of this movie was to introduce us to some of the most interesting characters in recent memory. The acting is superb almost all around, and the comedy is genius, with most material hitting the mark. Of course there are also some action sequences. Not the best I've seen, but they get a pass. One of the best things about this movie: the oldies soundtrack; from the offset, the old songs are used stylistically to great effect, making it seem as if they were made specifically for use in the movie.If I had to make any complaints, it would be that I wish the main character's back-story had been explored more. I realize they're setting up for future entries, but I can't help but feel cheated out of a necessary origin story. And of course, I wish the plot had been more thought out instead of the cliché ""bad guy wants to take over the universe without much motivation.""Despite those minor gripes, I can't recommend this movie enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Hands down the worst movie in the MCU,"Oh dear, where to even begin. This movie was so bad and the score that it currently has so ridiculous, that it made me register on IMDb after 6 years of lurking.Superhero movies. Movies aimed at man-children, children, and nerds. You could call me the latter, superhero movies being my filthiest sin.But what's worse than a superhero movie? A superhero movie dressed up in failing comedy, that's what. There were so many awkward and embarrassing moments in this movie that I just stopped watching altogether around the 1 hour mark, and skipped in 20 minute intervals forward. And guess what? Didn't miss a single thing in regards to the so called plot. It was that predictable.The acting was the worst I've ever seen in a superhero movie, even worse than the Transformers. Yeah. CGI up the cloaca in everything, I swear this movie spent 95% of it's production time on green blankets. Pacing was off, the main antagonist was an awful, overacting big mussel guy. The forced romance was bad, as always in superhero movies.I bet most of you watched this because you were promised Thanos. Guess what? He didn't do jack stercus in this piece of dirt. I guess you'll have to wait for Age of Ultron, although if you've gotten the hint so far, you won't see Thanos doing anything there either.Only people who rate this above 5/10 are Marvel shills, man-children who have never delved deeper into cinema than what Hollywood spouts out few times in a summer, and small children aged 12 to 18.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An Entertaining 2 Hours!,"The 10th Movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe upon it's announcement was considered a risk. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is not the among the most popular of Marvel Comics, and is or should I say - was mostly unknown amongst the General Public.To Date, for the Previous 8 MCU Movies, there are some I love, some that I like and or find entertaining - not 1 Dud amongst them. Guardians continues that streak.The movie begins, with a young Peter Quill, played following the opening sequence as adult by Chris Pratt, being abducted as boy in 1988, by a Space Ship, immediately after a personal loss. Fast Forward 26 Years - Quill is now an outlaw in another Galaxy, giving himself the personal moniker ""Starlord"". He ends up hooking up with the 4 fellow outlaws/orphans - Green skinned ""Gamora"", played by Zoe Saldana, who is adoptive daughter of ""Thanos"", voiced by James Brolin (Last seen post credits in ""The Avengers""), ""Rocket"" a talking Raccoon, voiced by Brad Cooper & his partner in crime ""Groot"" – A Tree Creature, voiced, and motion captured by Vin Diesel, and The Gray and Red Skinned ""Drax The Destroyer"", played by Dave Bautista of WWE Fame.I expected a lot of Humor going in, and I was not disappointed. It's the movie's strongest trait. Pratt's character, when he was abducted, was left a mix tape of 70's Hit Songs. That and some 80's references he makes, help define the movie's personality, coupled with downright hilarious and or quirky humor from Rocket and the other characters. As you may have heard,regardless of what he means to say, Groot simply says, ""I am Groot"", as he his has vocal issues, explained briefly by Rocket. This gag if you define it as such, is not overused, and is used very effectively! As per the title, the 5 must band together to save the Day,At times, I feel the Dramatic Quotient of the movie could have been better, and sometimes during the first part the movie, you might feel things are rushed along, but in the end – you are entertained for 2 Hours.

Why so much fuss around this movie?,"I have to admit, after reading so many reviews saying how awesome and iconic this movie was, i was a bit disappointed. Yes, it is a great movie, with plenty of action and fighting scenes, but i do feel there is a lack of personality among the characters. If you compare this movie to some truly iconic sci-fi movies like star wars, star trek or alien you realize there is a lack of human emotion in how the characters develop along the movie. Maybe due to my high expectations i laid to believe this would be an iconic movie. Like.. a ""New Hope"" of this era. I need to watch it a couple more times. Is there something i missed, i wonder. Also, i felt there was something missing, like a plot twist. Something to keep us glued to the screen until the last minute.

"It won't blow you away, but Guardians was a great time at the movies","This was a pleasant surprise and I actually enjoyed this quite a bit (a lot more than I expected). After not being particularly intrigued by the trailer, I decided to see it after the warm reception it's received. This ensemble cast of misfits actually works fairly well together and Chris Pratt (Parks and Recreation, The Lego Movie) is perfectly cast as Star-Lord, the reluctant and awkwardly funny hero.It follows the usual Marvel summer formula to a T: The plot is fairly straight forward (if not predictable), there's eye popping special effects, futuristic outer space battle sequences (the 3D version is actually worth seeing as it was well done) and of course, it wraps up neatly to set up the sequel. But I think what sets this apart is that there was *plenty of humour* (I found myself laughing quite a bit) as the dialogue is really cleverly written and loaded with well placed 80s pop culture references. I also really enjoyed the CGI characters Grott and Rocket (voiced by Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper respectively) as they were memorable, unique and at times, even endearing.I will say I wasn't blown away however and the plot didn't quite all make sense at some points. It doesn't reach the climactic heights of X- Men: Days of Future Past nor does it have the emotional impact of Dawn of The Planet of The Apes (the best film of the year). But it excels at what it was intended to be: a very entertaining, fun Marvel action film that doesn't take itself too seriously. I've seen enough to be interested in this series going forward and I did not expect that, so kudos to the director James Gunn. I think another part of it's appeal is that it provides one last fun summer blockbuster in a time of the season that's usually barren for enjoyable movies. So I say go in with reasonable expectations and you'll enjoy this end of summer treat!If you enjoyed my review, let's keep in touch!

It's not as if I took the film seriously either. I really enjoyed the ludicrous Lucy, despite its numerous flaws. Surely I can't be the only one who didn't like this film?

8/10,"A great sci-fi adventure, a marvelous piece of entertainment, a fantastic, sky-above-average summer movie, yet a mildly disappointing comic-book adaptation. Lets get one thing out of the way: there is no way in which I will judge this movie without thinking as the comic-book nerd I am, in particular the cosmic-comic-book nerd. I have been reading comic books ever since I had the ability to read, before that my dad would read them to me. For all my life I have loved Marvel Comics and loved the most the Marvel cosmic comics, they are some of the best fiction ever invented, so forgive me if I will complain about things that only 0.1% of the population cares about.Before going off and raving about how good the filmaking in this movie is, despite some minor flaws: uneven first act, 10 minutes too much in length and underwhelming villains, I want to address why this movie didn't make a higher grade for me. You see, looking at this movie as it is, it could have very, very easily been a 9 (or more) for me, but I was repeatedly taken out of it because of a problematic adaptation of the source material. I'm not saying that the film butchered 100% of the comics, what I'm saying is that it butchered a good 15-20% of the core mythology of the universe. And I would be perfectly OK with that! I have been time and time again in the past years because I understood the necessity of the changes. And that is the key point. The changes made were simply put, useless and foolish. This is the second time in my life I get angry because of comic book movie changes, so don't take me like the marvel fan-boy whining idiot, because I am a film-nerd too. The reason why these changes bothered me so much is because they could have been changed in a one hour re-write and made the movie excellent, but they are not there. But making Ronan the character he is was a mistake, totally changed who he truly is. The marvel cosmic array of villains is so vast no one can remember them all and out of all of them they changed one of the most iconic and complex ones and made him a throw-away idiot without clear motivations. The whole Ronan-Xandar thing was about of nowhere too. Don't even get me started on the Kree and Nova Corps representation that was so, so, so disappointing. I feel like all of the changes were made for pure fan service-name recognition, but still were totally unnecessary. If you want to use the nova corps, use them, but do them right, don't make them this bunch of throw away soldiers with John C.Reily in the middle in a totally useless and stupid role. It simply is a partial disappointment for a lifetime comic book fan like me.But enough of that. Still I am very happy with the movie and hope that with the future they will correct their few mistakes. They certainly establish enough ground for it. The cast is simply amazing. Chris Pratt is perfect and Zoe Saldana and Bautista are perfect for what they're given, there characters are a little under-represented, but amazingly performed and depicted on screen. Rocket and Groot are 100% successful in their transition and probably the best part of the movie, plus their CGI is totally flawless. The action scenes are breathtakingly stunning and the effects amazing. Moreover the movie is really, really funny and adds up to a massively entertaining time at the cinema. The production value is very satisfying, the pacing perfect, the score and the soundtrack are flattering, I thought the main theme of the score was brilliant. Plus, the fan service was really very good, yes it failed in a few things pointed above, but it succeeded in many others.Overall, I really, really liked the movie and I am looking forward to seeing it again in theaters and possibly change my mind over some things, but most of all I can't wait to see where they will take the story from here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Great Watch! 9/10,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie! The director mixed up the comedy with intense action, just right and the individual characters all brought a different flavour to this well made movie. The script is very well written and the action scenes are impressive. Personally, the thing that surprised me was how funny the movie was. I really wasn't expecting there to be so much wit in a movie in this genre. That is what makes the movie original and a joy to watch, especially the soundtrack which cracked me up. The tree and the raccoon were brilliant and I loved the little bonus scene at the end. Anyway, I can't wait to see the sequel and I hope that they bring back the original characters who made this epic film so great. Brilliant!Round-Up: Chris Pratt, who has starred in movies like the Five-Year Engagement, 10 Years and the Delivery Man, was a great choice by the director. His comedic style of acting really works and he's a great leader to such a versatile crew. When I saw that Dave Bautista was in the film, I really wasn't expecting that much from his usual terrible acting, but he was surprisingly, a brilliant addition to this crazy bunch. Zoe Saldana has made some excellent choices in her career. Not only has she starred in the biggest film ever, she has also had major roles in the new Star Trek and Colombian. With some brief scenes with Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro, this movie has really been thought through properly and it has to be one of my favourites for this year.Budget: $170million Worldwide Gross: $771million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their comedic space movies about a man called Quill who steals the Orb and tries to protect it from getting in the wrong hands, with the help of his new found friends. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply Awesome!,"Guardians of the Galaxy definitely surprised me by its awesomeness. Loved this movie and it is easily one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen this year and this year has had some awesome movies.The movie is great fun to watch. All five of the Guardians (Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Groot and Rocket) are awesome to watch and all of them have their moments. Their back-stories are also interesting despite wanting to know more in the case of a couple of them. Although there is plenty of humour and jokes, none of it feels overdone. There are also great action scenes and emotional moments without clashing with the fun side of the movie.Although the plot and villains were nothing outstanding, it was good enough not to ruin the movie as it was great fun watching the five heroes meeting and getting to know each other and becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy.Would definitely recommend watching this. It's great fun and the time just flew by watching it. It's a great space adventure/comedy/action movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Very entertaining and funny, great main characters, and awesome story only lacks in the villains and the final fight","When I first heard of this movie, I wasn't really interested, I had never heard of these guys(save Rocket Raccoon), but then the trailers came out and boom, instantly excited. This movie was a bit of a gamble for Marvel, because not many people are familiar with these characters, but it's a good thing they went through with it. Guardians of the Galaxy is very good. It is so many things, action-packed, hilarious, exciting and in some parts heartfelt.Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill, the self-proclaimed Star Lord, an intergalactic thief who hails from Earth and was abducted by a group called The Ravagers as a kid. Pratt is hilarious in this movie, his comedic timing is perfect, he's also very good in the more intense moments involving his character. Through a series of awesome events, Quill is forced to form an alliance with four other characters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a smokin' hot assassin with a complex past, Drax (Dave Bautista), a guy who is looking to avenge his family, Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically altered raccoon who is the biggest badass ever, and his friend Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), an awesome talking, walking tree who is only capable of saying ""I am Groot"".The other Guardians are amazing as well, they deserve all the praise they have received. Everyone is perfect in their roles, and they all have their moments, Zoe Saldana was great, Dave Bautista was awesome, he totally had the physical part, but he nailed the dramatic scenes as well (plus he's hilarious), Vin Diesel didn't have much to do, but his presence was very likable, he's like the Chewbacca of the movie, and Bradley Cooper, wow, he was absolutely perfect as Rocket, he was very funny, and had lots of cool lines, but he did a great job in his dramatic scenes. The Guardians are all well characterized and investing.Every technical part of this movie is great, the soundtrack is very fun, it's filled with a bunch of quirky, upbeat 70s-80s songs, like Hooked on a Feeling, Cherrybomb, and other great songs. The special effects are amazing, Rocket and Groot look so real, the guns are awesome, all the ships look incredible, and there are some action scenes that are the coolest I've seen this year, particularly the scene where they meet for the first time.The movie's script is very good, it's so funny that I think it's just as much a comedy as an action-adventure. But it's not just fun and games, the movie also handled dramatic scenes very well, a great way James Gunn had of keeping the movie balanced.The only issues I had with this movie were the villains, all of them are one dimensional with bad reasons behind their actions. Also the way the final confrontation with Ronan ends didn't seem plausible, comparing it with the rest of the information that the movie gives us.Other than that, Guardians of The Galaxy is a fantastic movie, it is incredibly entertaining throughout its 2-hour run-time. There's rarely a dull moment in it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wow. Just wow...,"For some reason I never gotten around to watching ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" before late in 2016, because I had expected it to be yet another mass-produced Marvel superhero movie. That, and plus it has Vin Diesel in it, which is always a no-no for me.However, it would turn out that I had really been missing out on something great and entertaining here. And it turned out that this was actually the best Marvel movie to date. I was especially pleased with this not being another pointless superhero movie, which I associate Marvel with.I am not going to delve into details with the storyline here. Just a quick summary. A band of ragtag spacers come together as their fates intertwine and must band together in order to save the entire galaxy.What worked in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for me was a couple of things. The storyline for starters, because this was really an entertaining movie from start to end, and it was a story that you could submerge yourself into, because there were so many aspects to it, that there was just something for just about everyone. But also because of the special effects; wow! I was blown away by the special effects, especially because it was so realistic and so vivid; lots of color and vibrant things on the screen throughout the movie. Which leads me to the characters, which were very interesting, well some more so than others.I really enjoyed the Rocket character (voiced by Bradley Cooper), he was really a blast. Pardon the pun! He had so much charm and wits, and he was just a delight to watch as he unfolded on the screen. And close after him were Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) and Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana). I can't really claim to be overly impressed or entertained by the Drax character (played by Dave Bautista) and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). But hey, all a matter of individual preference.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" really was a genuinely entertaining movie in every aspect, and it is a movie that you can watch more than just a single time. That, in itself, is some noteworthy accomplishment, especially since many newer movies fail to accomplish that.I was more than impressed with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and I am not shy to admit that I had really been missing out on a grand adventure. If you haven't seen ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" yet, then strap in, and prepare to blast into the vast galaxy. I promise you that you will be in for one heck of a ride...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Quirky, funny and lovable, ""Guardians"" pulls of being geeky and cool","After years of success bringing earthbound superheroes to the big screen, Marvel Studios opened eyes when it first endeavored to make a film out of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" If Iron Man was once considered an obscure Marvel hero, these guys were total D-league. Yet surprising to no one, the studio's creative process has yielded another hit, even with this ragtag group and set in a galaxy far, far away.Although an ensemble superhero film, Peter Quill a.k.a. ""Star Lord"" is the clear main character of ""Guardians,"" a human boy abducted by alien mercenaries as a child who has become an adult skilled in scouring the universe for items of value and turning a profit. When he snatches a prized orb, however, he discovers it isn't just some average bounty; Kree warlord Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) wants it badly and sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an assassin and daughter of the titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. On the planet Xandar, Star Lord and Gamora get tangled with bounty hunters Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically engineered raccoon and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a tree-like humanoid, and they all find themselves imprisoned by Xandar's Nova Corps, where they soon unite in common cause – getting a huge payday for the orb.Sounds like overblown science fiction, but ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is far from it thanks to director and writer James Gunn (""Super,"" ""Slither""), who, with co-writer Nicole Perlman, utilizes humor as a way to ground the film in something universal (in the non-sci fi sense of the word). The tone of the movie is irreverent and silly, fitting for such the ""rag-tag group of heroes"" motif and unusual for the genre, which tends to overestimate the average audience's interest in alien species and the names of planets.Start with the ""Indiana Jones""-style opening, which is a fairly common technique. Following a brief prologue with young Peter Quill watching his sick mother die, we next see him landing on a strange planet and using some of his gadgetry to search for the orb in a mysterious cave. But then, he puts on his Walkman and headphones (his only belongings from Earth) and ""Come and Get Your Love"" plays over the title sequence, which features Pratt boogying his way to the orb – an unusual twist on a normally serious-toned genre to say the least.Humor is truly the movie's backbone, and the script takes a page from ""The Avengers"" in terms of playing up the dynamic of the various personalities in the group. The difference here is these characters don't just have egos, they have unusual quirks. Quill is a stubborn dancing fool; Rocket a cynic with a quick temper and a complex; Groot a powerful simpleton with a soft heart; and Drax (Dave Bautista) a vengeful literalist. This lovable cast of despicable characters, together with jokes based on ""Earthly"" references, and the humor exudes a freshness and fun seen in few action movies, let alone space operas.Also compared to other ""space operas,"" ""Guardians"" doesn't downplay the sci fi elements or dismiss the movie/comic nerd's interest in the geekier aspects of the film; it complements them. They serve as context pieces rather than focal points of the story. The imaginative art direction abounds in each and every digital set piece, but no time gets wasted on explaining any of it. You don't have to understand the complex history of the Kree and the Xandarians, for example, to appreciate or take interest in the plot, but if you look and listen close enough, you'll get a taste of it. All compliments to Gunn, and to Marvel for backing another small-budget filmmaker on a film of tremendous scale.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" could fairly be hailed as the first great alien-filled interplanetary sci-fi movie since ""Star Wars."" As outrageous an assertion as that sounds, when you look at films such as the ""Riddick"" series, ""John Carter,"" or ""Green Lantern,"" it's not such a reach. It also doesn't lack for heart and cares deeply about its characters, which should strengthen the comparison. Only the ""Star Trek"" reboot seems to have done something similar, but that had a pre-established brand – ""Guardians"" has a just a handful of Marvel Comics readers.The likely box office success of ""Guardians"" compared to some of those aforementioned films, for example, speaks volumes to the way that Marvel Studios has gone about its business. Just compare this film to the studio's last, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" – night and day, but both outstanding movies. The fact that the minds and string-pullers behind both movies are the same is astounding, but edge to ""Guardians"" for being the riskier of the two. The intergalactic components of the Marvel comic universe are now completely available in the cinematic one, when for many years it was largely seen as a pipe dream to sink money into a ""Star Wars""-like project and expect a worthwhile return on investment.Although it makes its mark more with humor than science fiction, fans should be grateful for the doors ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" could open for the genre. At the very least, it will make for one wickedly awesome (and hilarious) cross-over with the Avengers in a few years.~Steven C Thanks for reading!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fairly Well Done,"The Graphics were amazing as expected, and the acting was fairly good. The one thing I was disappointed with was the character and story development, the storyline seemed like it was written as if we already knew the plot and characters, which I suppose some might have, seeing as it was a comic book series before it was a movie. The comedy aspect to this movie was really well written which makes up for the rushed development of the story. This was an interesting movie for marvel to put out, seeing as it was not following Marvels recent theme of super hero movies such as ""Iron Man"" ""Thor"" ""Captain America"" and so on. I Highly recommend seeing this action packed marvel production. Over all it was a very well done movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice!","First things first, I do think this is the Marvel (Studios) movie that focuses the most on the characters; on The Avengers you know that Thor and Hulk could solo the chitauri, but here you know how much they need each other both to fulfill missions and to support as friends. You buy how they grow from reluctant sort of mercenaries/bounty-hunters to really good friend, almost family. They all feel like they belong in the movie and they all get characters arcs (though Star-Lord's gets kinda lost in the plot until the very end), which are subtle, but (and especially referring to Rocket here) very Star Wars-y, particularly Han Solo's in Episode IV. This is fine by the way; Star Wars is one of my favorite movies of all time.The story is surprisingly solid and the movie absolutely knows what it is since the beginning. It's a goofy, fun, action-packed, character- driven space adventure with some emotional moments here and there.Characters:-Peter Quill/Star-Lord: I thought he was good as a protagonist, he was relatable, clearly taking inspiration from legendary characters such as Indiana Jones, Han Solo (back to Star Wars), Marty McFly, etc. and at the same he feels very unique because of the 80's child inside of him. Some of the humor provided by him is a little forced and out of place, but when it works, it really works. Chris Pratt becomes Star-Lord effortlessly and with this movie will easily become the Harrison Ford/Arnold Schwarzenegger of this decade, with all kinds of movies wanting him as a lead in many movies.-Gamora: My least favorite character to be honest; Gamora worked as a strong independent female at first but often had lines such as Captain America's fish-out-of-water humor in The Avengers that made her seem really stupid (as they did to Cap, in my opinion).-Drax: Man, did Dave Bautista surprised me. I liked the character of Drax a lot more than I thought I would; he's not just the muscle, he's also big part of the heart and charm of the film. One of the funniest moments of the film to me was his ''Nothing goes over my head...'' line, which, among many others, was greatly delivered on this role that is sure to make this former wrestler as popular as the Rock (Dwayne Johnson).-Rocket Raccoon: Alright, before watching the film, I thought he was going to be an annoying comedic relief with no use whatsoever in the plot and I wouldn't care about him (*cough* Darcy Lewis *cough*), but he ended up being possibly my favorite character in the film. The first time he shows up he is in fact very Han Solo-ish, a reluctant guy who just wants the money and has a friend with limited vocabulary. However, as the story moved forward, I realized he had a screen presence that I haven't seen in CGI characters his size (Caesar and Gollum may be exceptions, but other than that) and then he has an emotional moment that is also in a way expanding his origin, and in that moment I really felt sympathy for that guy. By far my favorite character, very reminiscent of why we like Han Solo so much.-Groot: Rocket may have been my favorite character, but Groot was definitely the first one for whom I really cared about. Seeing Groot being torn apart by Gamora while he has such an innocent facial expression gave that moment a lot of relevance to me; Groot quickly shows he's the most noble of the group and possibly the most supportive. Going back to saying he was like Chewbacca, I do think this shows just how much you can make us care about a character that doesn't even talk that much. Second favorite of the team.The action is really good; once again, reminds of Star Wars a lot. The visual effects are amazing; if the film doesn't get nominated for an Oscar for them, I will give up even more on them. I forgot Rocket and Groot were CG characters in some moments.There is emotion and it works, yes, and again, there's surprising dimension to Rocket's character (but don't get preachy; that still doesn't mean you can compare this supporting, mostly comic relief-ish character to Wonder Woman).My reservations:-Comedy: Again, I like to have fun in movies and this one succeeds at that, but some times the movie feels a little needy when it comes to humor. The film wants you to laugh and cuts many dramatic/climactic moments for unnecessary humor. That's not to say there weren't funny moments; there WERE, but some that attempted to failed miserably.-The villain: Once again, Marvel Studios shows how their weakest aspect is to write villains. No personality, back-story is pretty forgettable, and he just feels really out of place being all serious in the middle of this goofy world.By Marvel Cinematic Universe standards, it's around 8.5-9/10. By superhero movie standards, it's around 7.5-8. Overall, I will give it an 8/10Overall, I think the strongest part of the film is the character interactions and they make the film, at least to me, more re-watchable than every other film I've seen this year, even X-Men and Apes, which I thought were better movies.If you want a fun film to watch this summer, Marvel's action-packed adventure space opera Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely the right choice.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Entertaining but CGI heavy,"A boy is abducted and as an adult is required to work with a group of criminals to stop a fanatical warrior from taking control of the universe.Opening with a grim death scene on earth the film moves across the galaxy to hi-jinx chases and showdowns. James Gunn offers solid entertainment that links to the current Marvel film universe (one of the infinity stones appear). Although very CGI heavy (which will date quickly) it is compensated its likable characters, humour and fast pace action. Tonally its mash up of Star Wars, Thor and Iron Man 1-3 to name a few.The lead cast are on fine form, there's cheek Chris Pratt but more notable are Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket. Vin Diesel given his not existent lines seems a waste however the Groot as character and his interactions are great. The characters (created by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett) are not a stereotype as most films of the genre and there are a few memorable setups. It's pure pop corn comic fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Was very disappointed with this movie,"Based on the incredible review I read here, I had high hopes for this movie, instead I was very disappointed when I watched it.Although I am not a fan of movies based on comics, but we have seen some great super heroes and comics movies that were really entertaining and had great visual effects . but from what I saw, this movie did not reach a level to give it this much rating.Story it self was really predictable and boring, effects were OK but not amazing, it didn't reach other comics movie level, nor was it interesting or funny.I was honestly waiting for it to be over.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A rather unusual but fun superhero flick. ""I am Groot!""","Frankly, I'm still a little surprised they made a movie out of this team since the Guardians are not as big as Spider-Man or the Avengers and are only just starting to gain some popularity. But, for a film that has a talking raccoon and a tree man that only says three words, this movie managed to be a great new installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a set-up to what appears to be the famous Infinity Gauntlet story arc for what may be Avengers 3. Anyway, the is Guardians of the Galaxy.Plot: Peter Jason Quill a.k.a. Star Lord is an intergalactic outlaw who finds himself in a heap of trouble when he steals an unknown object of unimaginable power from an old temple with the Kree radical Ronin the Accuser having his eyes on it. Wanted by this villain and the law (the Nova Corps) alike, this unlikely hero gains some unlikely allies to combat this threat, which consists of a skilled assassin named Gamora, a berserker out for revenge called Drax the Destroyer, Rocket the ill-tempered genetically-altered raccoon and his tree-like companion Groot. With the odds and checkered pasts stacked against them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy conquer a madman out for unlimited power?With such a bizarre concept and team, I initially wondered if people would even gravitate towards this movie, especially since the Guardians aren't as iconic as Hulk or Iron Man, but, to my surprise, it was well-received and I can see why. The story is actually pretty interesting and takes advantage of exploring this vast universe full of interesting creatures, technology, and even worlds. The action scenes are pretty awesome, well-choreographed with each character showing off his/her skills and abilities and beating the living crap out of each other. It especially gets intense during the big climax of the film with so much being at stake, on par with the final battle of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". The special effects are also good, with an amazing mix of both CGI and practical effects. There's also a surprising amount of comedy, which for the most part is bound to make you laugh throughout the whole film, especially the post-credit scene which only comic book fans will get. I also gotta give creds to the music, a mix of classic 80s songs with some pretty epic original music.Now for the characters, who, by the way, are casted quite nicely. Star Lord is the kind of guy who has lost his way and needed some kind of crisis and a bunch of new friends to get him of the right path. Knowing that he has no powers, his greatest asset is arguably his wit as he can come up with the craziest idea and make it seem like he could really pull it off, that and his awesome gadgets. Gamora is sexy but also has an interesting depth to her, especially when you learn about her nice back story. Drax is fun, a guy of simple taste, a thrill for action, and a humorous lack of understanding of metaphors. Rocket Raccoon, a fan favorite, may seem like the dumbest idea for a Marvel character but his rough personality combined with his skill with guns and ships make him a delight to watch. Seriously, this little guy can threaten you and you would believe him. By far the best character, in my opinion, is Groot. He has an impressive set of powers that can give almost anyone a run for their money, but he also has a big heart (and puppy dog eyes), which leads to some of the most heart-warming moments you'll find in this film. An excellent performance from Vin Diesel.As for the villain, Ronin is the typical fanatic, but he at least has some sense of menace to him and he is a formidable enemy to the Guardians, plus his fanaticism is thankfully downplayed to an extent so he becomes more tolerable. A decent villain, though he's no Loki.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is a refreshing entry to the superhero genre with its action, story, characters, effects, and comedy. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're into superheroes or a good old-fashioned space adventures, so check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"They're not chosen ones, accidentally messed up ones.","I read comics and manga only that published in the newspapers and weekly magazine, other than that I am not into the comic books. So I must admit that I never heard before 'Guardians of the Galaxy' till this project start to commence. That means I had no expectations, I mean the expectation was nil. Especially after seeing the trailers and teasers I was totally repelled away to see strange characters like a tree, raccoon and other colorful skin tone human like creatures. Frankly, I thought it would end up badly as 'Green Lantern' did. I discarded my negative thoughts and decided to go after all I am a movie fanatic and that's what I do. I can say all these things were in my advantage when I went to sit in the cinema hall like an empty minded. The opening credits began to roll, me too slowly started to dissolve with the movie. It was not even 5 minutes passed, but I was into it. In the end, I was very impressed like never before and how much? That's what I am going to explain in the below paragraphs.''I am Groot.''First, I never heard this director, kind of new in town (to me). When I checked his filmography I came to know that I loved his movie 'Super'. What a breakthrough he got from this movie to enter into the big director's league list. He's also going to make a sequel for this as well and that is the real test to prove he's not just lucky to get away with this movie. Because many has predicted it won't stand tall in the box office. But what I witnessed was exactly opposite. The responsibility has become so heavier.Secondly, its a another 3M or MMM. Don't get confused, I was saying Marvel's Marvelous Magic. Other side Disney and Pixer are battling each others in animation field to dominate. In superhero themes, is there anyone to challenge Marvel? It is like one man's pride walk on the streets of Hollywood. Recently I said in the 'Need for Speed' review that EA joined something like the same, but a unique league to transform their games into the feature films. Whatever they do, it is our gain for sure. It was Marvel's sixth movie series from 'comic-to-movie' conversion, after Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, including The Avengers.A story of a boy called Peter Quill, who was taken away from his home planet, Earth by the space pirates. 20 years later he becomes a skilled thief and calls himself Star-lord. As usual in one of his missions he meets some strange guys who are after the orb he stole from an isolated planet. Soon he realizes it is a bigger issue once he come to know what does orb do. Unexpectedly a five member team forms. They decide to work towards one purpose, but the thing is they are mismatched in everyway. That leads each others to get misunderstand, misuse and failures, in one word to say the losers. After the series of screw-up how they unite against the strongest villain in the galaxy Ronan was told before it wraps up with a grand final fight.Yeah, I know the story was very simple. Men after the object that gives the power and strength is what's commonly known theme nowadays. But the beautiful cast and performances, including astonishing visuals will definitely change the viewer's perspective. It is going to be a game changer for the Chris Pratt's career. Like always Zoe Saldana had been excellent and sexy under the alien skin avatar. Vin Diesel had the least display of all the lead characters, especially with his one and only dialogue that repeats all the time. The character Rocket was another impressive, voice rendered by Bradley Cooper. Me too, to call him a raccoon kind of feel it is a racism remark. LOL. Definitely it is one of the top in the list of non-human or graphical character in a live-shot movie appearance. I think it was one of the biggest role ever Dave Bautista did. He was equally great to all the above, I stated. The cast was really a big, only those I mentioned in the above lines were having major portions in this installment. So expecting the others' time will come in the follow-up movies.''We are the bunch of jackass standing in the circle.''Like I said the story was not the problem here because it was presented with plenty of fresh humor. Don't expect it like a serious movie with a serious mission that takes place travelling all around the galaxy in a spaceship. Especially it was far better than 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. It is what stands in the line after the movies 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek' etc but filled with lots of fun. There was a scene in the end that comes before the credits, just for the fun and the post credit scene was resembled to what 'Pacific Rim' had one.The visuals were very pleasing, it goes straight to the list of mine 'stunning digital 3D movies'. It got many long focus shots with sometime aerial views which give opportunity for the viewers to enjoy the inside deep depth. And the close-up shots with a very few pop-outs. So I am saying this movie is a must watch in the digital 3D version. Overall, it was a great first movie in the franchise, that concentrated only the adventures which presented in a good pace. It also had a few minor flaws and leaves questions about the things that are not explained like Nova corps, the boy's background, especially about his parents and all. So expecting the sequel would cover up those.

"Easily one of Marvels Best Movies yet,","Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. This movie is easily some of Marvels best work yet, it is hilarious, action packed and also, at times, very sweet. The soundtrack is probably one of the finest I've seen in any movie, it had me humming along to several different songs throughout.The only thing I think this movie is missing is a love story, I know it's cliché but they do usually serve as a great contribution to the plot, particularly with superhero movies, and it serves as great character development. Something was teased between Star Lord and Gamora, but it was never developed or fleshed out any further, could be a good one to establish more in the sequel.Chris Pratt is outstanding as Peter Quill, it seemed like he was stuck playing supporting characters in comedies for the rest of his career, but that is all going to change after this. Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista also deliver great performances, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel's voice work as Rocket and Groot was stellar and the film would not have been half as good without them.James Gunn, a relatively unknown director, got to make this movie, Marvel took a chance on him and it ended up working perfectly, I hope he returns to direct the sequels this movie deserves, I want to see more from these characters. Guardians of the Galaxy is very unique, funny and at times quite emotional, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi.After the discovery of a powerful orb, Peter Quill must team up with four other outlaws to protect it from getting in to the wrong hands.Best Performance: Chris Pratt",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Really good movie.,"Excellent movie. This is by far, the best Marvel Superhero film. The casting choices are perfect! Can't think of any actors who could play the characters on the movie. Even if you're not a comic book fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie.The mixture of comedy and action is perfect! All of their jokes are funny and witty! kudos to the writers!I would like to praise the make up team of GOTG. Awesome job there.To the special effects team who made Groot and Rocket come to life. Really great job!GOTG is highly entertaining. Best watched with family and friends! To be honest, I nearly cried after watching the movie.Hats off to you sir James Gunn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Only popcorn good,"After seeing the amazing reviews for Guardians of the Galaxy I was expecting a movie that would completely blow my mind. I went in with high expectations and left feeling less than impressed. Visuals and music were great, but everything else was only so so at best. Each character lacked development, especially the main villain, the jokes weren't clever (amusing but not clever), action was nothing new, the plot was predictable, and the ending was all so cheesy. I can see why the general audience would like it because it seems designed to cater to a wide variety of audiences, the Marvel method as it were. I'm not picking at it because it's Marvel, in fact I think Days of Future Past deserved much more critical acclaim than Guardians did. All I can say is, if you go see it or buy it, you will have a good time; does it deserve to be on IMDb 250? Probably not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An Intergalactic Adventure,"When I first saw the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy, I didn't know what I was watching. As you can tell, I'm not a comic book geek, so I didn't know who the Guardians of the Galaxy were. When Guardians of the Galaxy's reviews were first posted online, I was shocked. I thought that it could be Marvel's first flop. But was I wrong. I convinced my father and a good friend (who wanted to see Hercules) to see it with me. It's hard to say what genre to classify Guardians of the Galaxy, because like it's other Marvel counterparts, it has great action, yet, it has a great sense of wit and humor. Guardians of the Galaxy blends action, adventure, and humor into a great movie. From the beginning, Guardians of the Galaxy has you hooked. Though it's story is cliché, it's characters make up for that. Each of them have their own personality. They're each so different, that they go together perfectly, and the part I see that not many seem to notice, is that they contradict each other. Drax (Dave Bautista), a huge warrior out for vengeance against the main antagonist, contradicts Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a deadly assassin who is was raised by the antagonist. Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper), a ""shoot first ask questions later"" mercenary bounty hunter raccoon, is truly the star of the show, and he contradicts Groot (Vin Diesel), a peaceful humanoid-like tree. And then there's Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), the leader of the group, who is depicted as (at least according to him) a legendary outlaw, out seek treasure. The beginning of the movie sports a very Raiders of the Lost Ark feeling, with Peter Quill (Star-Lord) landing on the abandoned, rocky planet of Morag, to seek out his share of treasure. Little does he know it will lead him on an inter-galactic adventure across the galaxy. What I really enjoyed was it's connection to Star Wars. It felt similar, yet unique. Star-Lord is reminiscent of the personality of Han Solo yet the role of Luke Skywalker. Rocket Raccoon is a funny, radical Han Solo, and his partner-in-crime, Groot, is a peaceful yet powerful being, who only speaks one line. Sounds like Chewbacca, right? Even it's antagonist, Ronan, reminds you of and overly evil Darth Vader, who serves his master. I'll leave that part for you to find out. It probably won't be the next Star Wars (My favorite movies of all time), but it is a fresh, new, take on the sci-fi genre. It also features tons of '70's and '80's pop culture references, due to that being the time Star-Lord grew up on Earth, such as it's catchy theme song, ""Put Down the Feeling"". In conclusion, if you were to summarize Guardians of the Galaxy in three words, you could say it's like the Avengers in Space, but it topples the 2012 Blockbuster hit due to its humor, action, and the creation of this magnificent, jaw-dropping galaxy. I would say, that without a doubt, Guardians of the Galaxy has the greatest CGI and computer effects I have ever seen in a film. I thoroughly enjoyed Guardians of the Galaxy, and I can say without a doubt that it is the best Marvel movie that I have seen, and definitely the riskiest, but it all paid off. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great movie, and I recommend everyone who wants a light-hearted space film to go see it. James Gunn (Director) has made it funny and witty, and it doesn't bore you, like a lot of action movies being released now a days *cough* Transformers *cough*.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Pretty much what I expected,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie and heard the music attached to it, I told myself;""This better not be in the movie"". Unfortunately it was, as well as many more songs from the 70's.Although I do understand the reason for this (Peter Quill's sole attachment to Earth and to his mother), this music was totally inappropriate for the movie we were watching. And what about all that dancing? Didn't they learn from Spiderman 3?Putting that aside, why did all the aliens living thousands of light years away, speak with an Earth vernacular?I was looking forward to seeing Xandar, the world of the Nova Centurions, but it was a let down. The Nova Corp did not look very formidable.And what about the Collector? He's supposed to be an Elder of the Universe, a cosmic being of immense power, and he just lets his place get thrashed.No, this movie was a great disappointment. I'm a big fan of Marvel Comics but I was expecting a great film, not a comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not Bunch of A-Holes,"I was not actually a hardcore fan of comics, though i know some stuffs about superheroes that an average human being does not know. With GotG though, I know little about the character's origin but i think my main concern about the movie is that given the fact that they're all bunch of misfits, liars, thieves and thugs. I think that in the movie they have given their trust to each other that easily for a small span of time. I mean of course this was just a movie and movies usually runs from 1 to 2 hours only. So what the do I expect? but I guess my point is that I did not see that deeper connection or bond within the characters.Overall though, I think that this movie is all fun and mayhem and oldies but goodies music. It was less explosive than The Avengers but it was still good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A misstep from Marvel.,"I must be missing a gene or something as I found very little to enjoy here. Perhaps this is a question of personal taste, however I believe in playing it straight when it comes to fantasy-there's just a lack of realness to any of this. No attempts are made to justify/ground any aspect of the world or characters we're seeing.I disliked the general visual direction and oddball tone personally. Everything felt like surface detail, an unbelievable world akin to a Bucky O' Hare cartoon. The villain disappears off the page too. A few funny moments here and there, but I'm fairly sure I'm down a few brain cells after seeing this utter dreck. Outside of the Avengers and possibly Captain America 3, I fear it's all downhill from here with Marvel movies.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Disjointed but Entertaining Space Romp,"Marvel films have crispness, like a newly opened can of tennis balls. GotG may be its freshest, leaning heavily on Whedon's Avengers to create a cowboy-space opera strongly hearkening ""Firefly"". The effects are impressive and humor is sidesplitting. Unfortunately, Gunn seems more concerned with being cool than coherent. For all its originality, GotG falls prey to the treaded and dreaded ground of melodrama and over-extended action sequences, made more apparent because of how good it is otherwise. Despite the sloppiness, the positives mostly win out.The plot is extremely convoluted. Essentially there is a mysteriously powerful object that some bad people want, and a band of misfit anti-heroes must keep it from them. Fortunately the actual film experience is better than the story. Whenever our five heroes are together, it's truly magical. Pratt charms by delivering great dialogue, Saldana continues her queendom of scifi franchises (this, Avatar, Star Trek), and Batista is surprisingly hilarious. Most notably, Diesel and Cooper as Groot and Rocket have the kind of comedic chemistry we haven't seen in the Marvel universe yet. The team aspects are a blast, even if they are a bit unbelievably familial.GotG is Marvel's first comedy, full of pop culture references, trope disassembling and a hilariously effective soundtrack. Its comedy is its jewel. However, when it falls into the rote destruction porn ending, indistinct action and short moments of sentimentality, I can't help but wish it would've kept its tongue more firmly in its cheek. Maybe I'm just suffering from blockbuster fatigue. At least GotG offers more than the normal summertime fare.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I enjoyed this movie so much,"I've been anticipating this movie for some time. From the previews it looked fun, sci-fi, action, the good stuff. I'm happy to report that it was real sci-fi, had a lot of funny moments, and the action was great.The story isn't huge. It kinda reminded me of Star Wars with the face on the big screen partly veiled as the big evil guy, then him having an evil front man who does all the actual stuff. Then there was the usual personal tragedy bits, etc. I didn't expect the movie to invent the wheel though. The story itself was entertaining enough to keep me interested until the end. In fact, there was an episode I wasn't expecting, and the whole bit with the escape was really great. However, the ""out in space"" scene was very awkward and forced. It came out of left field, and felt like a clumsy solution to a problem in the story. I watched it in IMAX, so the 3D came in wonderfully. I enjoyed the different worlds and environments we got to see. By the way, I want to move to Xandar. That place looked gorgeous. The planets were different enough to make me want to explore them all. Okay, except for the one with all the men with makeshift knives. The spaceships looked unique too, and you could feel that there was more behind it. I want to read more of this world now, because it looks rich and exciting.The characters were interesting. They were a bit unlike the usual heroes that they were a makeshift group. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) obviously has some back story going on that will unfold in future editions. It seems obligatory to make trilogies nowadays, so we may be looking at something like that. Hey, I'll watch two more movies like this one any day! The acting itself was really good, Chris became Peter in a believable way. So much so, that I couldn't remember that I've seen the guy in Bride Wars, when I've watched that movie at least 6 times. It's my go-to movie for ""girly, light-hearted fun with cocktails"". Gamora (Zoe Saldana) was probably my least favourite one of the lead. She just didn't feel real enough. Sure, we got to know a bit about her backstory and all that, but it was very cliché. I wanted to know more about her connection to the big bad. Not that Zoe did a bad job with her. She seems to be the resident sci-fi girl now. She was really great. I just think the writing let her down. Like she was the female in the boys club who is obviously meant to be the romantic interest to the lead guy. I usually don't bring my feminism into the reviews, but they could have really done better by her. I can't even say that male writers didn't know what to do with a woman, because the movie had a female writer as well. I hope that in the future they'll do better. Rocket and Grot are also reminiscent of Star Wars. They are a lot like R2-D2 and C-3PO. The comic duo that has one that talks a lot, the other hardly ever does, one is crafty, the other one not so much. However, I did like Rocket, and Grot at the end was so cute. It helped that I happen to love that Jackson 5 song myself. Drax (Dave Bautista) I didn't really like. He was the source of some really great humour, but he was annoying sometimes in his idiocy. Though I did love the pattern on his skin. As a huge Doctor Who fan, I also have to mention Nebula (Karen Gillian). She's evil, but I liked her. She also looked pretty cool all blue like that. I thought her character wouldn't have much of a role. She really didn't, but more scenes than I thought she would. Therefore, other fans can relax.Overall, really great movie. A lot of fun, great sci-fi environments, promising main character. If you love sci-fi, you really have to watch it, even if you're not into superhero movies. This really is more like a sci-fi movie than a superhero movies. I gave it 10 stars, because I want the sequel to come out like... yesterday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Lots of fun and excitement in this galaxy,"Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' as amazing as the IMDb rating (which this reviewer learned long ago is not something that should be taken to heart) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The 70s soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at ('Guardians of the Galaxy' is far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction is here as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was written too, the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart with a genuinely emotional opening.The story is non-stop energy and compelling, with a nice balance of comedy, drama and section. It is not perfect, and is one of the film's weaker points, with a been-there-done-that feel, a couple of overly-sentimental moments and a couple of randomly placed moments that were not needed at all and just took away from the flow and tone of the scene (Chris Pratt's dance).The characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character and Groot is quite adorable and amusing, but Rocket the Racoon doesn't just threaten to steal the show, to me Rocket actually does steal the show. The one exception really is the very bland and barely developed villain Ronan.Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side (though that was a little too hastily introduced) and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocky. Lee Pace tries but struggles to bring any menace or dimension to Ronan, can't say I blame him as anybody given the role if written in the way it was here would have struggled to bring believability to it.All in all, not perfect and not quite as great as all that but exciting, well-made and lots of fun, really enjoyed it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good Marvel,"Wathced this blockbuster yesterday and i got what i expected.A lot of jokes, all the time, and a action-filled adventure. Coupled with the ""earthly"" soundtrack it was a pleasant ride.Some issues with the story and it's obsessive need to joke everywhere, even when there was slaughter going on. I guess it's the new normal... not my cup of tea tough. The humor was fitting in some places but over the top in others and excessive in some. The stereotypes was another minus.

Pure sci-fi popcorn fun,"(67%) A vastly watchable, very fun, witty, fully fledged sci-fi action comedy with a great nostalgic soundtrack (even if old cassettes in reality sound a lot more fuzzy). The confidence shown by Marvel is commendable as the very pretty visuals must have cost a very pretty penny, and considering I've never even heard of the comic books before then the studio executives must have big cojones to green-light a relatively obscure series. The unending sharp sense of humour works well, and the writing in general is better than most with stuff always happening without it ever feeling like too much. It may just be a big flashy popcorn movie, but it's a fine exciting example of the breed making this a worthy one to watch at the cinema, with strong hope of more goodness yet to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
We're in good hands. I think.,"Peter(Pratt, playing it like a mix between Han Solo and Marty McFly, likable from the get-go) steals a coveted orb, and intends to nab the reward, until he eventually realizes that it's too powerful, and has to be kept out of the hands of religious fanatic Ronan(Pace, terrifying, psychotic, driven), or he will commit genocide.Our unlikely and reluctant hero meets others like him(they fight at their first encounter), and these scoundrels(there weren't enough of those in the franchise) form an uneasy alliance, gradually connecting with each other and becoming selfless and heroic. Bounty hunters Rocket(Cooper, angry, bitter, smart), a cyborg raccoon(!) and Groot(Vincent eh, or: Diesel, putting a lot of emotion into three words, naïve, enthusiastic, a big lug with a huge heart), a giant, sentient tree(did I mention this came out of the Silver Age? It's a Saturday Morning Cartoon every step of the way, and gloriously so). Assassin Gamora(Saldana, sultry, deadly, moral) trying to break away from adoptive father Thanos(Brolin, with all the gravitas that requires with only a short appearance, he's not the main villain see above he makes a real impression), and ""sister"" Nebula(Gillan, sadistic because of her intense jealousy borne from their sibling rivalry), who hunts her down. And Drax(Bautista, who does remarkably well for little experience everyone, character and actor, is solid), essentially Conan(the barbarian, not the O'Brien) of space, who wants revenge on the bad guy for his murdered family... or possibly aforementioned, since she worked with himThere are too many elements in this(groups, people, allegiances, motivations), and the scope and abilities of some of them is a little difficult to get a proper grasp on, but once you let it sit, probably after the end credits(which you must stay through!), it does all come together. Somehow it splits the focus and time fairly equally between them, if it only hints at, and doesn't explore. This is amazing from start to finish. Everyone has something to bring to it, in action, drama, humor, etc. This is a stand-alone that takes place in the same universe as the Avengers films, and you can go into this with no knowledge of those, or the comics it emulates and is based on. This takes inspiration from Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and lives up to the standards set by those classics.There is some violence(it doesn't push the PG-13 as much as other recent entries in the genre) and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys big, fun Summer blockbusters. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Funnier than I thought!,"While I would normally not go watch a film like this my children forced it on me. I was surprised by the quality of not only the script but the CGI. The actors were funny and well developed. Each had a story and the movie went back and forth between humor and specific topics like death,birth, friendship and trust. Like I said, it's just best to look at Guardians of the Galaxy from a larger viewpoint and call it one of the most entertaining, fun, thrilling, heartfelt and happy pictures I've seen.The movie brings together a small collection of strange, disparate heroes/anti-heroes from the world of Marvel Comics who unite as a team and stop a dangerous enemy from killing a world. Going deeper, however, it's a story about five lost-but-adventurous souls who have experienced tremendous loss in their lives and begin to discover a way to start putting all of the pieces back together.I would recommend catching it on DVD, Netflix or where ever.

"Just when I was starting to get sick of Marvel movies, they change the game (somewhat, and successfully).","Directed by James Gunn
Screenplay James Gunn, Nicole Perlman
Starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Djimon HounsouThe Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun ride, if nothing else. Yes, it comes from the Marvel stable, so you can expect it to be full of banter and bickering among its protagonists. Yes, it is setting up a franchise, and/or adding to the overarching story the MCU is setting up, so you know there will be a studio-mandated climax and a cameo from at least one Infinity Stone. Yet it feels fresh because of the risk Marvel has taken by producing this movie with a bunch of relatively unknown comic book characters.I am a comic geek. Yet I had no idea who these people were. In fact, until the success of the Avengers, I considered even Iron Man and Captain America as second tier heroes in Marvel comics. The trailers didn't help either, as I saw the usual trope of a ragtag team of misfits coming together, led by a well-intentioned man-child, supported by a dumb thug, a faux-feminist tough girl and two animated characters. Yet, this film was enjoyable, and most of it is down to the direction of Gunn and the excellent casting choices.Chris Pratt, who we know as the chubby, funny well-meaning dumb kid Andy from Parks and Recreation (what a character he was), plays a movie version of the same, but has been given a muscled-up transformation. He brings a playful charisma and proven comedic talent to the role of Peter Quill, simultaneously the straight arrow and the goofy sidekick. Zoe Saldana seems to have made a career out of playing alien characters with paint drawn on them. She plays Gamora, the tough girl protagonist and possible love-interest to Quill. There is a super-intelligent, genetically engineered raccoon named Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, and a genial tree called Groot voiced by Vin Diesel in his best work ever. The find of the movie is Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, who shows off his comedic chops while also suggesting a complex emotional being underneath. The antagonists are unfortunately pale personas. The talented Lee Pace is wasted as Ronan the Accuser, who is actually a pretty complex character in the comics, reduced to villain plot device in this movie. Djimon Hounsou and Josh Brolin play even more thinly drawn characters, although their screen time is much restricted to be of any utility. Glenn Close, John C. Reilly and Benicio del Toro make extended cameos in another instance of Marvel casting great performers and giving them nothing to work with.Quill is an orphan abducted from the earth by aliens when he was a kid after his mother passed away, and has been raised by his captors, a bunch of space outlaws. The movie has a Firefly-feel to it, yet this space adventure keeps things grounded by involving many settings that we earthlings can comprehend. The brightly lit space days in similar movies are replaced here by multicoloured cities with interesting but humanoid aliens, grimy prisons and kinky-looking spacecrafts. The characters come together in search of an Infinity Stone, and like in most movies involving a McGuffin; just enough time is spent on it to not bore us to death. The character interactions and the soundtracks are what keep us invested in the movie, in spite of the thinly drawn characters. Perhaps they shall address it in the sequels. After all, Marvel never stops with just one film. In James Gunn's, they do have a capable director who is a geek himself, and treats the characters with respect.VERDICTA definite popcorn movie. Very enjoyable. Watch it with Americans in their 30s, they will lap the whole thing up.6.5/10STRAY OBSERVATIONSKaren Gillan, who was terrific in Doctor Who as Amy Pond, plays Nebula.

Most entertaining movie in years,"The Guardians of the Galaxy is just pure entertainment. The film mixes science-fiction, adventure and comedy in the right dose and concentration. It has great tempo, unforgettable well-developed characters you like or hate immediately and great music. The production is amazing: the special effects, architectural designs, ambiance, dresses, makeup, sound, and overall design are fantastic. However, that would be irrelevant if the script, the dialogues and the acting weren't good, but they are excellent.One of the things that contributes to the success of the film is how well the actors are cast for their respective characters, and how good he actors are in their roles. I loved Pratt as Peter Quill (a witty mix of Indiana Jones and Han Solo with whom I fell in love immediately) Diesel as the magical Groot (I would have never thought that I would like Diesel on anything), and Lee Pace as the super-villain Ronan (truly the best acting in the film). However, Cooper does one of his best jobs as an actor dubbing the very funny sarcastic grumpy but loyal Rocket, Saldana shines as the kick-ass sexy fighter Gamora, and Bautista is really charming as the word-literal sensitive brute Drax. To be fair, all actors, even the supporting ones, do a great job. This is a chorus movie in which everyone sings well and does what is supposed to do at the right time the right way.Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the most entertaining amusing unpretentious enjoyable films I've seen in the last years. Of course the movie is light, there is not philosophical approach to anything, there is not subtext, but the movie does to perfection what intends to do -- it does entertain you for over two hours and makes you forget that you are human and live in the real world.

Yeah, the CGI was great and the humor well-placed, but for all the noise there was little if any suspense. My wife and I were whispering what the next scene would be and generally guessed right.

Guardians of the Galaxy,"Guardians of the Galaxy, directed by James Gunn, is one of the best comic book movies ever made, while also being yet another model film of the MCU.

He crafted a mainly comedy based tone, that was well balanced, taking some of the edge off of the darker phase two, while also incorporating a fantastic emotional and grounded tone. These concepts and tones could've easily been taken in the wrong direction, because of how cheesy everything looks on paper, but due to Gunn's brisk pace, and constant excitement, The Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely works! I don't know if I can technically call this a negative of the film, but I just needed more of everyone; not to say everyone was underdeveloped, there was just so much more potential with these amazing characters, I just wanted more! One of the only negatives I have to say about the story, is the fact that the premise itself isn't the most original, while setting up for expositions; other than that, James Gunn did a fantastic job having the characters move the story.The characters were the absolute selling point of the film. Marvel has this thing where they take these lowkey characters, and turn them into everyone's favorite superheroes. This perfectly imperfect cast just meshed so well together, creating amazing chemistry, and genuine tention and banter. James Gunn and the creative team did a great job with establishing each original character, giving everyone some depth, while allowing them to have a few great character moments. The creative team did the best they could fleshing everyone out, because if they tried to flesh everyone out equally, this film could've easily hit the four hour+ mark. Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Starlord, is easily the most focused character out of the bunch, but I was perfectly okay with that, because he brings so much heart, charisma, wit, charm, and humor to the character, while having a fantastic delivery to all of his lines. Even though Chris Pratt can be a little over the top, he is such an easy character to get invested in, because of his damaged back story. Chris Pratt gives a great performance, proving he can be that guy in the leading role, and why he belongs in the MCU. Zoe Saldana as Gamora also puts on a great performance! Her back story is probably the most fleshed out, and impactful to the big picture, leaving her character to be the most grounded out of them all. She brings a lot of wit to the film, while also having great layers to her character. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon is my favorite character out of this favorable bunch. For a side character, he out shines the leads on a few occasions, bringing the best sense of humor out of the whole MCU, while adding in his outside of the box wit. He compliments the group extremely well, carrying a lot of weight throughout the film. The biggest surprise of the film, was Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer! He, by far, has the best delivery of the film, bringing a tremendous amount of heart and humor to his character. Even though Drax isn't the most fleshed out character, not having a whole lot to do, you can't help but care for this guy, due to his extreme likability. With Vin Diesel as Groot, not having much to do or say at all, he just has that likability to carry him through this film with no issues. Michael Rooker as Yondu is one of the few characters that's from the comics, and he serves his purpose well. He puts on a super fun performance, carrying decent weight throughout the film. Lee Pace as Ronan tries his best, but the way his character was written, left him to be one dimensional, underdeveloped, and forgettable. I wish his character was more fleshed out because, even though he didn't have the most original motive, he had the potential to be a halfway decent villain.The screenplay by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman, was just a blast of fun! This is, without a doubt, the MCU's funniest film, with the perfect balance of cohesive jokes, that hit every single time! If they would've gave a little more to a few characters, there isn't much else that can hold this film back.The action of the film was present for a great deal of the time. Every single sequence had it's own appeal, being well crafted and shot, with almost seamless effects.The best part of this film, without any question, is the soundtrack and score. James Gunn and Tyler Bates did not need to give us this amazing 80s soundtrack, backed up with this original score, but they did... and they did that for us. Without the score and music, this is a completely different film, that just wouldn't be able to top off each scene.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy deserves to be in everyone's top 5 of the MCU! With all of the greatness this movie has, it outweighs the negatives tremendously!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Incredible awesome animation and,"Marvel brought to us this latest superhero movie -- Guardians of the GalaxyGOTG is a superhero ensemble movie with a great cast of Bradley, Zoe, Vin Diesel(who's damn funny as Groot) and Batista(From WWE) makes his proper successful debut as Drax...and there's Chris Pratt(from Parks and Recreation) who gives an incredibly comical and heroic performance as a lead(where was he hiding his talent) It's a fun adventure in the space which will keep you stuck to your seats till the very end. It's an action+comedy movie with great fight scenes and moments you'll die laughing at Bradley's jokes and GROOT :PAs you already know....The ends are always the best.Marvel brought comedy into superhero action movies unlike The Dark Knight series which are quite serious...though I wouldn't want to compare the both.Though this movie has new superheroes who are actually losers and good for nothing... it is an awesome movie. In a way, all of us at a point of time in our lives too think of ourselves as losers...so we all could connect to that and later on achieve the impossible. The avengers were already famous and had the hype too. But, this movie with complete newbie characters still is equally good as Avengers.I'm sure you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I Fooled Around and Fell in Love with this movie,"Featuring a small-screen actor playing an unfamiliar character from a relatively obscure comic series, Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun, smart movie that proves that superhumans aren't necessarily the driving force behind the immense success of the comic book movie phenomenon. The storyline is as simple as could be: Chris Pratt's Peter Quill has a thing, everyone else wants the thing, hijinks ensue. This structural simplicity allows breakout director James Gunn to stuff Guardians full of crowd-pleasing characters, new and fantastic locations, and the promise of a successful new Marvel franchise.Marvel certainly took a risk in making this movie; the obscure source comic provides nowhere near the amount of draw as successors such as Iron Man and Captain America. The company also stepped away from the somber tones of its recent movies; the lighthearted film is carried by a goofy, irreverent main character, who at one point refers to the main antagonist as a ""turd blossom."" Unlike many of his comic-book protagonist peers, Peter Quill is extremely believable, in large part because he is so undeniably human. With no super serum or super-computer enabled suit of armor, the character has nothing to hide behind. This human vulnerability makes him extremely attractive to audiences who are used to a sea of superhuman protagonists; Quill is no different than we are, and we love him for it.As endearing as Quill's humanity is, Guardians makes sure that its nonhuman protagonists find their way into the audience's heart as well. This movie bravely takes on the challenge of introducing an entirely new cast of characters, and succeeds tremendously. All five Guardians are superbly casted, written, and acted; all members of the ensemble are given sufficient backstory and characterization to save them from relegation to sidekick status. In this movie, the ever-popular ""band of misfits"" concept manages to come across as a group of equals, rather than a group of misfits walking in the shadow of the protagonist. Digital effects are used to their highest potential, with two of the most lovable characters created out of CGI and motion-capture techniques.Guardians of the Galaxy shies away from heavy social commentary, preferring instead to remain a lighthearted, entertaining summer blockbuster. There is no ambiguity as to who is the villain, or whether the protagonists motives are truly good. Guardians is a movie about a bunch of dorks saving the earth from a really bad guy. The main conflict is simple and easily digested, which actually works in the movie's favor. That is not to say that this film is brainless fluff; Guardians features characters who are relatable, likable, and most important, interesting. Unfortunately, several of the villains were underutilized. Karen Gillan's Nebula has mountains of unrealized potential, while Thanos, the most interesting villain, has the least screen time. This underutilization most likely results from the filmmakers' focus on making audiences fall in love with the characters who will make it into later movies.Despite that small setback, Guardians of the Galaxy absolutely achieves what it sets out to do: introduce a new franchise with lovable protagonists, a fun and simple storyline, and a whole galaxy ready for exploration. The old-school soundtrack is superb; integrated into the storyline as a mixtape given to Peter Quill by his mother, it brings levity when needed while constantly reminding the audience of Quill's humanity. The CGI is well- executed, as are the post-production 3D effects. Most importantly, it is the likable characters and their chemistry as the Guardians that leave me hooked on a feeling, high on believing that this franchise is destined for great things.Rating: 9/10 stars (Tenth star pending better utilization of the fantastic villains the filmmakers have at their disposal)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Engaging,"This certainly looked like a different sort of superhero blockbuster. In that way, it's disappointing that it's really not that different from most of them. The performances are really fine, and Chris pratt makes for an instantly likable, instantly charming hero, one that doesn't try too hard or even at all to make us like him, and yet he does. That all really lies on Pratt. Saldana is strong, as she always is in these sort of roles (first blue, now green, we can just wait for her to portray a red and yellow character). So yeah, ultimately not as memorable or as great as I wanted, but still really good, fine work. Also, Bradley Cooper is a joy to watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
pleasant surprise,"I first read about this Movie in one of those free Magazines you get in Theatres in Sweden and I remember thinking: ""what the hell is this? A cartoon or perhaps a spoof on Avengers?"" Then I saw the trailer and studied the cast, hmm...Dave Bautista...in a quite big part in a Movie like this...In the end I felt it is either going to be a downer or pretty good...Plot: oddballs and outcasts come together to save the galaxy, and so they must keep a ancient and powerful weapon from a bloodthirsty villain seeking revenge.Guardians of the Galaxy, a sci-fi action Comedy - yes, it tentacles into many genres and surprisingly it works. It is mostly a sci-fi and then split evenly between Comedy and action, a bit like Lethal Weapon (except the sci-fi part).It Clocks in at 121 minutes and it holds many different settings and stories, almost each one could be a separate Movie. One would like to Think that such a Movie cannot work, but it does. The different settings merge together just fine and do not become the least episodic like, say, Terminator 2, which I love but none the less is very episodic and just loosely connected by the characters ""driving"" to the next scene. Or why not the Da Vinci Code, where Hanks just seek out clues one after the other.The plot is very basic and is certainly not the strong Point of the Movie. No, instead it relies on scenographic detail, characters and the high quality of the acting. The surroundings/scenography are very good, and this is important in sci-fi Movies, especially those set in space/other type of World. The only really bad thing is the CGI work on Thanos, the CGI is really bad and very cartoonish.What surprised me the most was the solid acting, which does not include Chris Pratt. I would not say he was miscast nor being bad, just boring. Lucky for him, he is surrounded by more experienced actors like Zoe Zaldana, Benicio del Toro, Michael Rooker, Glenn Close, John C. Reilly. I have Always liked Rooker, especially in roles where the character is bit crazy, like in the 6th Day. In Guardians of the Galaxy he owns. But the one who surprised and impressed on me the most is Dave Bautista. I haven't seen all his work, but until now I have just liked him, but mostly seen him as a brute or a Sidekick. But here he manages to deliver his lines convincingly, after all he is a ""Walking thesaurus"". He also succeeds in showing off a comic side. After Riddick and Guardians of the Galaxy I can see him getting good roles, but perhaps not rise as high as Dwayne Johnson.You don't see this kind of Movie often so it is difficult to say who would like this Movie. But if you like sci-fi, space, Star Trek-esque, Comedy, action and is looking for something ""easy"" to Watch, meaning, something that does not require a lot of thinking, Guardians of the Galaxy is for you.I give it 7 out of 10 simply because it is entertaining, fun and well executed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Probably the Best Movie of Phase Two,"First off, I don't know how a movie can make me cry over a tree. That just goes to show how fantastic the storytelling and characterization in this movie is. And it doesn't hurt that it's also hilarious and light-hearted, not to say there isn't any drama in this movie, because there is.

8.8 really ??,"The movie is OK, 6.5- 7 should have been OK but 8.8 rating is really to high. When I went to see the movie my expectation was too high because IMDb has given 8.8 rating but now I have lose faith on IMDb rating. First half was not that good but second half was better. It looks like the director was trying to pack everything under 2 hours, their were lots of character but not much time on screen for them. The comic scenes were good but it looks like some laughter scenes were forcefully put which anyone can observe. The character of Rocket was awesome as it was the only thing that was holding the movie together. And nowadays it is a trend in Hollywood to leave a option for a sequel.

Fun Popcorn Movie from Marvel and James Gunn,"This is one that when I first saw it, I was excited as everyone seemed to be having a good time with it. Jaime had actually seen this one ahead of us doing a rewatch so that made it interesting as well. What I will say to start out then, we both had a good time here.We are getting a fun origin story for this group, Guardians of the Galaxy. We see that Peter Quill aka Starlord (Chris Pratt) stealing an orb and this puts a bunch of events in motion that will cause him to meet Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Groot (Vin Diseal), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Drax (Dave Bautista). They will go against Ronan (Lee Pace) who is a minion in the start of Thanos (Josh Brolin).As I was saying, I have a blast with this movie. We have interesting and fun characters that look like they're having a good time. The movie gives us different worlds. James Gunn just knows how to capture the spirit to make this superhero movie work. We get interesting weapons, characters, villains and a soundtrack that brings it all together.

Pro Reviewers...?,"I look through some of the metacritic reviews and they leave me wondering what a person has to do, what degrees or credentials are needed, to be a pro reviewer.I was no fan boy going into GotG, it was never on my shopping list back when I was reading comics. But I found this movie to be fun, entertaining, and engrossing in the sense that I was enthralled with watching the characters interact. I personally thought that for a first GotG movie it worked in good character background and development, and loved that there were those moments where you either laugh out loud or nods your head in a sudden glimpse of understanding about why they do what they do.That said, what I don't get is why some reviewers fail to even do a google search on what the comics were about before writing their review, or heaven forbid, before viewing the movie so as to understand it in context.Instead I see hugely negative reviews, no not all the reviews but quite a few, by people who are clearly ignorant of what they are even watching. I get that they want to be heard, but trashing a movie which is clearly a hit in order to draw people to your article to find out why you hated it, is frankly childish and purely self-serving. No one says that as a reviewer you must like a movie, if it is not a movie you liked or a genre you appreciate, it might be best to clarify that. If I see a movie I don't like and I tell a friend about it, I always clarify the reasons why rather than simply trashing the writers/directors/actors/etc.Perhaps I am wrong in my assessment. I don't expect everyone to love this movie as much as I did. However, I do expect professionals to provide me with clear and solid reasons for not liking it. Even if it is just to say that it wasn't their kind of movie or they dislike comic movies or they dislike sci-fi.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great movie,"This movie surprised me I didn't think it would be as good as it was and the adult humor was very nice i haven't seen that in a Marvel/Disney movie yet. Chris Pratt was great in the role of Star Lord, but great casting all around. Visually the movie also great, even in 3D. I'm glad that this movie did well because I think that Chris Pratt is a very underrated actor. I think the sequel will do better then this movie now that they got the origin story out of the way. Just like Captain America the movie was great but the second installment was even better due to the character growth. As long as them just keep the cast small with the 5 main characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hooligans make the best heroes,"The newest addition to Marvel's movie universe, Guardians of the Galaxy is about unlikely group of space ruffians with questionable motives brought together to be the protectors the galaxy.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a ravager who steals an orb for an unknown buyer when the market calls. The evil Ronan seeks the orb for an unknown menacing purpose and sends his assassin Gamora to retrieve it. Zoe Saldana, who plays Gamora, is once again no longer flesh toned, but lucky for her she makes green look great too! Bounty hunters Rocket and Groot, brain and brawn respectively, who attempt to capture Quill for his bounty and get entangled in the orb's fate. Lastly there is Drax, a nippleless massive brute of a man donned in red tattoos and apparently allergic to shirts, along for the ride while seeking revenge and retribution. Dave Bautista, of WWE stardom, is a gem of a casting as Drax and the source of many a laugh and my favorite of the guardians.At first, the film works feverishly but clumsily to lay the foundation for the plot and rest of the movie. Perhaps with more care, and a few more edits in the script, the introductions would have been a bit more nuanced and maximized the effectiveness of each scene. The beginning was a bit slow moving, the action scenes were expected and, at this point in the game, cliché. Once the five guardians and hooligans team up though, it's just pure entertainment with solid action scenes. There were definitely some plateaus and lulls during the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy (GotG) but in the end it was just plain fun, funny and ultimately very enjoyable with good unique jokes and interesting characters.Special effects guys earn their paycheck once again - in space there is a lot of body paint and prostheses, even on extras. It is weird to think how far we've come with CGI, I was never distracted and it seems like the FX team didn't spare any minutiae. But with two main characters, Rocket and Groot voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, being completely computer generated, every mouth movement, every hair follicle, every detail was on point and my figurative hat goes off to the entire team who worked on GotG.Guardians of the Galaxy seemed poised to lay the groundwork for an even better plot in the future - like it was a part one of a series. Don't get me wrong, it was great, entertaining and everything you want from a movie-theater-movie-experience, but I kept feeling like it could be excellent with a bit more time invested to soften the hard edges of the script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Grossly overrated,"I'm really confused at the glowing reviews of this movie. Dull characters. Dull story. Just dumb. I practically fell asleep. Considering I'm a huge fan of James Gunn since his Troma writing days (and to show I'm a fan, anyone else notice Lloyd Kaufmann's cameo?). This one almost put me to sleep. And for those who've claimed it was laugh out loud funny and the audience was behind it 100%...a few chuckles here and there, but the audience I saw it with, walked away confused.There is going to come to light that the majority of the reviewers were paid sponsors of this movie. Something fishy about it all.Anyways, Chris Pratt is good in the role. He is pretty good at playing the 80's character turned into the future, and still retains a 80's face. Rocket (voiced by Brad Cooper) is funny when he needs to be, but is a one-trick-one-line pony. Groot and Zoe Saldana's character are cardboard. Boring stupid forced Shakespearean relationship between sisters. And blah blah blah. Dull is the word. I'm honestly shocked so many people glowed about it. Something is clearly not right.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Deserves most of its praise,"Marvels latest action movie seems to have surprised everyone with its freshness, and all i'm going to add is, that it deserves most of its praise.I don't know if its maybe because these characters have a no doubt smaller fan-base than anything else Marvel has brought to the screen before. But its hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this one. As long as you know the movie features the most bizarre line-up of heroic characters ever collected together (Which you've probably already seen in the trailer) you should be happy with its sci-fi action, as it practically pokes fun at itself for what it is the whole way through.There are a couple of cheesy moments, but overall this risky comic book adaption is made enjoyable by its stupid humour, unique atmosphere, and most of its special effects. Though they haven't quite mastered that distracting talking raccoon thing thats in the movie yet.

alien females acting too much like women on earth,"i love science fiction movies and i love 70's music too.but mixing those 2 elements here just doesn't work.it somehow makes it feel even less real.and for science fiction movies you want that real element.this movie seems more cartoon like and and adding the 70's music and humor and alien women acting like women on earth makes it even more corny and less authentic as a science fiction movie.not to mention seeing a raccoon in space.the list goes on and on.i think another reason for the 70's music is to appeal to the adults,because this movie is something the kids will probably enjoy.so to get adults to like it put in some old music.keep in mind this is coming from a guy who hates new music and only listens to 60's and 70's music.but like i said mixing that in a science fiction movie like this takes away the real element.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not terrible, but extremely overrated.","I can understand why so many people watched this film since it is a big budget Marvel film. But I really don't understand why everyone thinks this was so great. The plot lacked complexity; the whole plot seemed to be about a few freaks teaming up for almost no reason and then fighting the much stronger villain. The characters were pretty bland and boring, well, except maybe Rocket. I usually like Marvel movies but I was quite disappointed by this one. On a more positive note, the there were some pretty funny moments, and some pretty great special effects. Acting was decent. Overall, this movie is definitely not as good as other superhero films such as The Dark Knight or The Avengers, but sure as heck is not as terrible as Howard the Duck or Catwoman.

"Jolly good fun, but where does it go?","There are two ways to approach a film based on a comic book, as others have doubtless remarked. You're familiar with the source material or you're not; I'm in the latter camp where GOTG is concerned.I generally like comic book movies though, so I approached it willing to be entertained but accepting that I might not quite understand the full context for the story. Ready to judge the film and its story on its own merits, in other words.The plot, in outline: after learning the power of a precious artefact he has stolen, Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) pulls together a band of misfits to prevent it being used for evil, so saving the galaxy.The film is certainly entertaining. A witty script, intense action scenes, and pretty visual effects grab hold of your attention and keep it. The retro soundtrack is also undeniably great.I have two quibbles. Firstly, in the film's mid-point, the story lags a little in favour of action set pieces. I found myself thinking ""This is very amusing, but what does it mean?"" more than once. Secondly, the character of Gomora (Zoe Saldana), supposedly an extremely able and dangerous assassin, is in one situation unable to overpower a couple of mooks. It makes no sense, and I found it made Gomora to a less powerful, less active character--rather a shame.On the whole, however, the characters develop convincingly throughout the film. Add to that the action, the visual finery, and the 80s soundtrack and you've got yourself two hours of retro sci-fi fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hooked on a Feeling,"After watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy' there is a good chance that you too, will be hooked on a feeling. With good performances all around the board and some fantastic action sequences this had all the makings of a great sci-fi/comic book movie. However its the fantastically witty dialogue and well fleshed out characters that makes this the most enjoyable film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This film demonstrates that superhero team-up movies don't require 2+ hour movies to serve as a back story for each character as each character's background is summed up in a few lines of dialogue here and there, with the exception of Peter Quill who gets more time to build up his back-story as he is essentially the main character.The film also has a much stronger villain than in most other Marvel movies as Ronan the Accuser's motives are well justified and he has just enough screen time to let the audience see just how bad-ass he really is. He has a sort of Darth Vader-esque feel to him as even though he is bad-ass the audience knows early in the film that there is a bigger, even more bad-ass villain lying in wait for his opportunity.Another high point of the film is the fantastic sound track. Featuring some classic pop tunes which will delight the older audience as well as encourage the younger audience to seek out some of the artists used in the soundtrack. The audience gets to hear this soundtrack through Peter Quill's music player. This music player serves almost as another character as it is there all throughout the film.All in all its a fantastically fun film for any age, except the youngest of children with great characters, a bad-ass villain, very nostalgic soundtrack, and most importantly heart, and a lot of it. Guardians of the Galaxy certainly feels like a Moon-age Day-dream",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"An Entertaining, Well-Developed Sci-Fi Action Comedy","Since it was my birthday recently and I had collected 4 pairs of Harkins movie passes, I decided to go see Guardians of the Galaxy. Guardians is the story of Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt), a good-hearted rogue who has spent most of his life as a 'junker' - finding and selling items throughout the galaxy. His life takes a sudden turn when he happens upon an immensely powerful object sought by Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), an egocentric maniac with a chip on his shoulder. As Ronan seeks to use this object to conquer the galaxy, a rag-tag group of criminals and misfits - led by Peter Quill - band together to fight their common enemy.Guardians stars a cast as eclectic as the roles they are playing. We certainly have a few recognizable names with Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (a.k.a. Star Lord), Zoe Saldana playing the green-skinned assassin Gamora, and even Glenn Close as the leader of one of the many planets visited during the film. In some superb supporting roles, we have Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer, Bradley Cooper voicing the trigger-happy Rocket Raccoon and none other than Vin Diesel providing exciting dialogue (""I am Groot"" - repeated throughout the movie) for the sentient tree Groot.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this film given it is such a departure from previous Marvel movies. While there are definitely humorous elements throughout previous Marvel films (such as Iron Man, The Avengers, etc.), I wouldn't qualify them as Action Comedies. Guardians, on the other hand, could almost be considered a superbly entertaining (while occasionally irreverent) comedy that happens to be stuffed full of action. Don't get me wrong, if you want to see lots of explosions, fist fights, starships and shootouts, you'll be pleased with this film, but there is also plenty of clever humor and character development.I tip my hat to James Gunn and team who managed to not take themselves too seriously (I mean, honestly, we're dealing with a talking raccoon and a sentient tree), but still produce a film with believable, lovable characters. There are definitely serious moments but, rather than feel out of place, they help to balance the film out in a way that feels natural and necessary.It's hard to say what the highlight of the film is for me but, if I have to choose, I'll say Chris Pratt as Star Lord. His comedic, normal guy approach to the character makes him exceptionally relatable and plays to his strengths as both an actor and a person. The running joke about how he wants to be called 'Star Lord' is a great example of how the filmmakers aren't afraid to poke fun at their own character. Rather than critique the movie for being ""unrealistic"" or ""too silly,"" we were laughing along with them and left the theater quoting jokes and checking IMDb for the sequel's release date.If you're looking for an entertaining, well-developed sci-fi action comedy, then check out Guardians of the Galaxy. I highly recommend it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awkward at Best,"I knew from seeing commercials that I wouldn't like Guardians. Right from the get go, I knew the humor would be awkward and cheesy.Deciding to give it a chance anyway based on the glowing reviews both on IMDb and from professional film critics, I thought what the heck. Maybe it's better than I initially thought.In short, no it was just as I expected. There are some moments that make this movie tolerable, such Groot, the comic relief (really? Vin Diesel got featured in this movie just say ""I AM GROOT"" about 50 times?) and the feisty, talking raccoon (whose cheesy Jackass one liners almost got the best of him). Also, the soundtrack to the film is amazing - can't beat upbeat 80's music. Some of the comic dialogue was also amusing.But what brings this film rating down for me is the overuse of clichés. In the deeper Marvel films, the villains are far better developed. Ronan was evil just for the sake of being evil - a 10 year old kid could come up with a better villain than him, just bluntly trying to destroy everything for no particular reason.True, one gets the feeling that the film doesn't take itself seriously - and although some may take that as a very positive point, for me it means I don't take this movie seriously either.

Fine job Dave.Finally i give 8 out of 10..the second best super hero movie is still avengers...Don't worry avenger fans.....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Balanced,"I loved every second of this movie. Basically:  It was so well-directed. Everything seemed to fit in place.  The amount of action and comedy was equal. Like, when you were watching the movie, you could tell that an action scene was serious, but at the same time (usually because of Rocket or ""Star-Lord"") it was also funny.  All the people who voiced or played the characters were just PERFECT and spot on. Especially Chris Pratt, that guy is just so friggin' adorable and endearing. And Rocket? Don't even get me started on him; he is just downright AWESOME. His sarcasm and bluntness literally made my day!!!  My most favorite thing about this movie: it didn't relate to superheroes. I mean, maybe it did a bit, but it's not about the superheroes, ya know what I mean? If I'd known how awesome GotG was gonna be, I probably wouldn't have watched all those other Marvel movies that were released this year in theaters. I would have just rented them, but hey, because I watched them in theaters, I know which movie is the best (hint: I AM GROOT). The post-credits scene though lemme just say, What the duck?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Now this is a comic book movie,"When my wife and I returned home after seeing Guardians of the Galaxy, I logged into IMDb and gave it a 9 (there are only a handful of films that I've given a 10). It's a thoroughly entertaining film, and with an MPAA rating of PG-13, you could take your teenagers with you and not be embarrassed.It's a fun movie to watch, with a fine ensemble cast led by Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star Lord). It's all action, but there's plenty of humor too. Guardians owes its lineage to a long line of sci fi and action films, including Star Wars, Raiders, and LOTR, just to name a few. Peter Quill is another Han Solo, and the tree-like Groot is very reminiscent of the Ents in LOTR. And the whole movie revolves around a mysterious powerful object that everyone wants and some will kill for (the plot for all the Indiana Jones films). Partway into the movie, our group of misfits has gotten together: Peter Quill; Gamora, who's betrayed her boss Ronan, a Kree who is planning to use a mysterious sphere to destroy civilized planets in the galaxy; Rocket the genetically altered raccoon; Groot, a tree-like creature with a very limited vocabulary; and Drax, a convict in the prison that the group breaks out of. They proceed to battle the bad guys in a series of confrontations leading to the climactic showdown between Quill and Ronan.The action was pretty much nonstop for the two hours the film ran, and most scenes featured heavy CGI, but it was very well done. The score was also well done and included a number of hit songs from the 1970s and 1980s. In the movie, Quill's dying mother had given him a cassette tape with the songs, which were her favorites when she was younger.Sequels? Oh yeah, for sure. There were some unanswered questions to be explored, number one being: Who is Peter Quill's father? And what will happen with the powerful sphere that Quill has? And there are backstories on the other Guardians to be told. No, we haven't seen the last of our band of Guardians.Tip: Don't leave when the credits start to roll. Stick around for a mini-scene that comes after the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"I'm having a blast watching this (and, I'm NOT a comic book person)","Guardians of The Galaxy.I'm nit a comic book reader (I do like graphic novels, i.e., Sandman, Alan Moore, etc), and, considering I work in this business, I rarely - if ever go see movies.I just heard about this (ok, a bit late), and saw the terrific reviews its got, so, I figured: ""why not give it a try?I""m only about 30 minutes in, but, I'm having such fun watching it, I know already; I don't like this film, I LOVE this film!Not only is it well-acted, but, one of my big problems with American films, is they're really made for mass distribution, which means dialogue is not important - visuals, and action are, as it's the easiest to translate, and understand.What this means to me, is I can watch a film for only a very brief time, and tell you what the entire plot is, and - I can pretty much spout the dialogue without even having read it, or hearing it.That's why I rarely watch (modern American) films.Guardians of The Galaxy is such a wonderful breath of fresh air.Not only is it well-written, it,s got a great sense of humour, with many jokes being bandied about - some, being visual, and in the background, so, like the old, great Warner Brothers cartoons, viewers of all types - from kids, to teens, to adults can all watch it, but, pick up different strings of the multi-layers of humour.The characters all are well-defined (I love Rocket and Groot), and give a big applause to all the actors, both those who are on-screen, as well as those who acted with only their voice, and letting the terrific animation bring their characters - a frakkin' tree, and a raccoon (amongst others) - to life.I thank the reviewers, here, who made me a believer, and I highly recommend Guardians of The Galaxy.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Best Marvel Movie Yet!,"James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet. I challenge anyone who would place Iron Man or The Avengers over this action-packed and thoroughly entertaining picture that is the definitive summer blockbuster. It's just f**king awesome! (pardon my French)Hilarious, innovative, and just super fun. I can't recall enjoying a movie this much, right along with a crowd, in quite some time. The less you know about the film and these characters, the better. I'm from a world of movie-watching but not so much on the comic book reading front. My knowledge of superheroes comes from watching Saturday morning cartoons. Like many movie lovers, probably one of the few that will actually admit it, I never heard of the ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" I had no idea who they were and what they did. This may have made the experience even more enjoyable. There a bunch of funny characters. I'll just say that.There's a moment that overcomes me in the middle of Guardians. Chris Pratt is walking across the screen, after just delivering about a dozen hardcore laughs that literally had me in tears; he's just about gained a theater full of new loyal fans, and Gunn decides to give him a money shot for all the ladies. He walks across the screen in his underwear, sweaty and doused in yellow paint, and heavily panting. I couldn't believe this is the same guy from NBC's ""Park and Recreation,"" Bride Wars, and Her. He's come into his own, and has fully become a movie star, with talent to boot. His work as ""Peter Quell"" trumps anything done by Robert Downey, Jr. in the Iron Man films. I'd go as far to say that he should heavily be considered a candidate for a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor (Comedy or Musical). Pratt is the new boy toy for every action figure having kid, and every horny Mom that pretends they hate ""these kinds of movies.""Coming into another big franchise following Star Trek and Avatar, Zoe Saldana moves quietly throughout the film as an unstoppable force as ""Gamora."" Kick-ass fight sequences, and an interesting enough story that should feel satisfying for even the most hardened movie snobs. Dave Bautista wrecks through the film as ""Drax"" and even develops his own character ticks and beats that help him stand out considerably.As the voice of ""Rocket,"" Bradley Cooper infuses a dynamic and comical performance that stands as one of the actor's best outings. All I could think of during the film was this is one of the many reasons the Academy needs a Digital and Voice Acting category. Something as lively and priceless as Cooper's voice work deserves some type of recognition. The same can go for Vin Diesel as Groot, though he lacks the speaking volumes to warrant consideration. I thoroughly enjoyed their relationship and dynamic and it's something that plays out completely well on-screen.Obviously, the film has faults. It's very heavy-handed on the whole ""we are one, we are friends"" message. It actually starts to beat us over the head with it at times. The film also defies all the logic of physics. There are times that even for a superhero film, you have to raise your eyebrow. There's also not really any importance placed on the villain, and I'm not entirely sure I could recite his ultimate plan. This is no fault of Lee Pace as ""Ronan"" - just an uninteresting story arc.Guardians of the Galaxy is the ultimate summer flick. Something that's just plain stupid fun for you and the whole family. Geeks will bow, audiences will cheer, and the film will secure itself as a new and enlightened franchise for years to come. Gunn's admiration for films like Independence Day, Star Wars, and Top Gun are on full display. There are even instances where I thought of Boogie Nights and Running with Scissors. It's a blend of every clever nuance and thing you love about the movies rolled into one spectacular experience. It's delicious in nearly every way.Dear younger generation, you have been given your ""Star Wars."" Go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not just the best movie of the summer, quite possibly the best movie of the year","This is the first time I've written a review in my 15 years of being a member on here, but this is the movie that has inspired me to write my first user review.I will admit, I had little interest in seeing this movie when it was first announced. I thought that it would just be a B-level Marvel movie that Disney was making in order to milk the Marvel cash cow for all it was worth. Boy was I wrong. I tend to be very hard to please when it comes to movies but this one had me smiling the whole 2 hours and wanting more.James Gunn has accomplished with this film what many comic book movie directors and to a lesser extent all directors fail at---He made a fun and entertaining movie for everyone and isn't that what it's supposed to be about? No brooding superheroes and unnecessary melodrama here. He made a movie that is fun and entertaining all the way through. Zach Snyder take note.I've watched and read everyone talking about how the box office is down this summer, but let this movie be a lesson to all filmmakers. If you make a movie that is fun and entertaining for all, they will come, and come back again. This movie will easily make $450 million plus at the box office on the strength of word of mouth and repeat attendance.The casting is superb, and this is the film that has transformed Chris Pratt into an instant movie star. The rest of the cast have excellent chemistry and you get the impression that they must have had a blast making this film. Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and even Dave Bautista are excellent in their respective parts. Michael Rooker and Benicio Del Toro are especially noteworthy in small supporting roles.The music also plays a major role in the film, the song choices and their placement in the film by James Gunn are perfect for the tone of this movie. The opening sequence showing Peter Quill as a child, that merges into Quill as an adult singing and dancing to ""Come and Get Your Love"" has you hooked and doesn't let go.This is quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made, and I can't wait to see what James Gunn has in store for the sequel in 2017.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So Marvel made a comedy,"The best word to describe Guardians of the Galaxy is entertaining. Not overwhelmingly so, but it had some really good moments. I understand that the current hype surrounding Marvel movies has lead to inflated reviews, but don't be fooled. This is just a recycling of the same effects, costumes, jokes, and thin plot lines from the previous movies. This can not really be called a superhero movie, so much as a comedy. Every other line was a joke, usually a cheesy one liner, and it was filled with that typical Marvel humor. You know, characters get in a big fight, they knock out the bad guy, everyone is breathing heavily and the room is quiet, and then one character says something cheesy and the whole audience laughs. They hit the ball out of the park on a few jokes, but I managed to stay pretty straight faced for most of the film. I understand the love for superheroes that currently exists, but this movie was nothing more than a very average feel good comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
same old junk,"visually this movie was amazing. The little raccoon guy and groot looked very real and i laughed a few times. It was interesting for the movie score they used of all these 1970s-ish funk tunes when the guy put his Walkman on.BUT............We get a ""Star"" studded cast of C and D list actors/actresses oh and Vin diesel we're in for a treat he should go back to racing cars in the fast and the furious franchise. Sure Tom Cruise or someone every drooling idiot knows has to be in a movie to be good. BUT It's too long the story is the same old crap year after year as if we're renting our movie tickets. Seriously why not be the bad guy and destroy a galaxy or two and watch him slaughter a bunch of people and focus on that.I wouldn't give this movie past a 4 star. It doesn't deserve the current 8.9 though. 5 is watchable and if it wasn't for who I went with I would have walked out. I barely watch TV so this is an honest without any brainwashing hype review.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What we all wished the Star Wars prequels were,"I can't say enough about this movie. Would give it 11 stars if possible.After you get past the opening 10 minutes of sentimental dreck (which really is not bad), the rest of the movie never stops exceeding expectations.When I was 9 I saw Star Wars in the theater with my father, I knew nothing about it except that there were lines all summer at every movie theater where it was showing. I remember being mesmerized and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time. This is the first movie experience since then that I felt that way about.See it in the theater, you will be transported back to when you were a kid at the movies and everything was simpler. When it was over, I immediately wanted to go see it again.This is no super-hero movie, it is much, much more. The action is there, but this is more than an action movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Possibly best movie of the year,"Like many I was not very familiar with the character or the story line of guardians. However going into the movie I was very excited. From the opening scene until the end credits I could not take my eyes off the screen. Not only was the action terrific but the genius placement of comedy and drama throughout was absolutely outstanding. Chris Pratt delivers an amazing performance, Zoe Saldana is great as gamora, and Bradley cooper vin diesel and Dave Bautista did a marvelous job of creating chemistry between the characters and drawing the audience in. The only thing I was missing from this movie is the villain, in my opinion, was not very fleshed out. Although it was a great arc and the actor did a great job with what he was given I would have liked to see more from the villain. I knew this movie was great when my girlfriend (who is not a big comic person) said ""that was a great friggin movie"".

The Star Wars of this generation... the good one with Han Solo.,"Guardians of the Galaxy is when all stars, strange in shape they may be, align so neatly that one will be laughing gleefully, developing fondness for the characters and wondering what is that familiar song that fits so damn well with this scene. Incredibly witty yet scruffy with amazing style that doesn't follow any superhero formula, it is near impossible to dislike Guardians of the Galaxy. Classic soundtracks oddly fit the cosmic saga, giving it grounded and slightly nostalgic feeling. This may very well be the Star Wars of this generation.This adventure of ragged uncommon crew has a unique light tone, almost resembling morning children cartoon or video game. The humor is spot-on, cleverly written and personalized the characters better than dull gloomy distress most fantasy movies opt for. While the dysfunctional team has its issues, they are delivered with ease, discarding any cumbersome drama and replacing them with accessible comedy.Chris Pratt is an excellent choice for Peter Quill. He is a good example of ruffian with somewhat noble heart, and Chris Pratt hasn't been too fixed on a protagonist image. It works well since Pratt could be your usual hero, but more importantly he brings great unsuspected humor. His character serves as anchor for humanity, because even though the tale happens in gigantic other realm, Quill is often shown as mere human and this aspect will definitely resonate with the audience.Zoe Saldana as Gamora is now green skinned. After Avatar and Star Trek it's safe to say that she possesses the exotic alien look. As a veteran of sci-fi genre, she carries herself comfortably and quite believably as action persona. Her character is indeed a peculiar love interest for Quill, but deep down it's more a search for companionship rather than romance. Dave Bautista as Drak hasn't got much experience in acting yet, still this character suits him and with a compliment of good cast, he probably has the better role any pro wrestlers have had in recent time.Groot and Rocket are both CGI. Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper, is the heart of the movie. He's a strange mix of raccoon and mercenary, a bit broken and still eloquently funny. Vin Diesel voices Groot, ironic that most of his roles are tough guys but as a gullible and vocabulary challenged tree that he delivers his better work. Aside from these two, CGI also covers the vistas and expected laser shooting futuristic action.Design for the setting is great, often depicting places like those in video games. The splendor of debris and explosive accompanies the movie, it's undeniably a good spectacle and top tier for blockbuster. The director James Gunn delivers a good continuation of scenes, humorous line and constant pace. Soundtracks from classic 80s music is gold, the contrast works much better than any techno tune could possible do.Guardians of Galaxy is a rare movie that keeps its audience fully entertained, it doesn't let up, if fact it gets better as it progresses. It's a heartfelt and genuine effort to connect with audience. When it ends, it gives a warm fuzzy feeling as one leaves the cinema. It is no less than an utter cinematic achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An enjoyable film,"This film tells the story of how several individuals of different races in the galaxy team up to save the galaxy from destruction by an evil villain.The great thing about films is that anything can become reality, and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" makes good use of this rule. We have people of red, blue and green skins respectively, a talking tree (albeit a limited vocabulary) and a talking raccoon. It has comedic moments, especially delivered by Vin Diesel who is not usually funny. The action is great, augmented by the amazing special effects. I was so impressed by the formation of planes against the Dark Aster that I felt tingles down my spine. Emotional moments are delivered by the first scene, and the final scene which references the first scene. There are all the elements for ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" to be a successful blockbuster, and I enjoyed watching it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Guardian of the Galaxy is just another Marvel movie you expected it to be , it's explosive and fun but nothing new to deliver","So Guardian of the Galaxy is another Marvel movies that try to introduce us to the new dimension new aspect of Marvel Universe and characters.If you expected it to be explosive and just beautiful CG everywhere you'll get it but the problem for me is almost everything in this movie is just so repetitive the characters that just almost one-dimensional black and white , the plot that just offers nothing new at all even if you don't see this movie , i'm sure you probably can expected how it going to end and the villain is just terrible he just doing nothing the entire movie.I think the director of this movie James Gunn is just trying too hard to make jokes and makes the movie fun to watch like he threw jokes almost every 5 second but the problem is a lot of them is not funny and the amount of jokes in this movie is just too much and it's annoying me.I mean i don't expect a Oscar worthy screen writing from Marvel movies but i think James Gunn he's just not experience enough to hold the entire movie by himself , everything in this movie is just fell mediocre the plot , the characters even the action scene.In the end Guardian of the Galaxy is a pretty mediocre movie it's offers nothing new but if you want to have some fun then go for it !",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An absolutely stunning and exhilarating ride!,"I have never grinned for the entire length of a movie before I watched Guardians!OK, I admit it!

It is joyful because it deserves to be part of the Marvel universe and it respect the Marvel universe and it's source material.Can people that are unfamiliar with the Marvel universe enjoy this film? I presume so, however the more important question is how can anyone not be familiar with the Marvel universe, give the parade of pure-awesome films that Marvel has created since Iron Man?If you want to see a film, go and watch this one.

Brief overview of Guardian of the Galaxies,"Over the summer I had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie, Guardians of the Galaxy. When I first saw the commercial, all I could think was this looks silly and then I saw the fact it was part of the Marvel series and I was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters. It did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the Marvel movie series but I did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it. Overall, the movie was humorous, very entertaining, and in my opinion, a great addition to the Marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes. Throughout the movie, the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie. There were parts of the movie I just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable. I mean, the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test. Another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie. The biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face. In the movie, the main leader of the Guardian of the Galaxies, Star-Lord, he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days. Overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as Rocket and Groot. Apart of the movie that I really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the Guardians of the Galaxies. Probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole Marvel aspect. Marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another Marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story. I know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing I did, ""Who on earth are the Guardians of the Galaxies?"" Most people know who Spiderman, Ironman, or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books, you would most likely have no clue who the Guardians of the Galaxies are. Throughout the movie though, I believe the writer did a good job in tying in the Marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other Marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together, The Avengers. Going off the MPAA rating of the movie, PG-13, seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling. However, I do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides, what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say, ""I am Groot"". Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again. Marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor, the acting, the action, the soundtrack and in the end, I walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the Guardians of the Galaxies in future Marvel movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy-A Great Movie!,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a well-written cinematic, futuristic ride! The plot of the movie held me captive, including the movement of the script. The costumes and expressions of the actors were well received by the audience. I also enjoyed the incorporation of songs of the seventies and eighties as theme songs for this movie. The battle between the protagonist and antagonist was well received. I also enjoyed the sense of multiculturalism incorporated in the film. There is a need for the use of ALL races and nationalities in film today, and it looks like Hollywood is moving in this 'positive' direction, sharing the wealth. With this movie, there was never a dull moment from start to finish. Background imagery was superb, placing the viewer directly in each scene. All of it was believable.

'Guardians Of The Galaxy' most pure fun blockbuster since first 'Iron Man',"Summer blockbusters haven't been much fun this year. Sure, we've had giant robots, action galore and some edge of our seat moments, but from the xenophobia of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" to the daddy issues and nuclear nightmares of ""Godzilla"" the season's tent pole movies have been a bit gloomy.""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" the new Marvel adventure, is a tonic for the troops. An old-fashioned space opera, it's a wild ride and the most pure fun blockbuster since the first ""Iron Man"" movie.It's filled with one-liners, sight gags and funny moments that play off the more standard blockbuster-style action and battle scenes. Pratt has an offhand delivery that recalls Harrison Ford in Han Solo mode, Cooper does wisecracks like a skilled Catskills comic and there's Baby Groot to up the cute factor. There are characters with funny names, warring cultures and treaties to be enforced and broken. The exposition gets in the way of the story sometimes, but only occasionally. Director James Gunn doles out the information with spoonfuls of humor and action to keep things interesting.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is clearly expected to be the beginning of a franchise. Near the end of the film Star-Lord says, ""What shall we do now? Something good? Something bad? Bit of both?"" and while that kind of presumptuous writing usually annoys me, in this case I wouldn't mind seeing what they get up to next time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

It has a perfect blend of action and comedy, CGI is very well done too. Story and characters are most important thing to me in any movie. Now story in this movie is not something special, but characters are just amazing. I fell in love with raccoon and now its one of my favorite characters ever. I am not really big fan of comics, hell only comic i ever read was some issue of Hellblazer, but this made me want to educate myself a bit about world of this movie(Which i am probably not going to do).

Did I miss something???,"All the great reviews of this film, ""the best"", 4 stars, Robert Downey Jr. proclaims this as the best Marvel movie of all time. I went to this movie knowing from the previews that it was a spoof, yet as the film began it starts with a painfully realistic downer moment. From that point on it seemed that the movie didn't know what direction it wanted to go. The performances were all disjointed and the writing was some of the worst ever, yes, it's a super hero fantasy but even a little logic goes a long way. I seriously wanted to walk out after half an hour. Horrible directing and for all the fuss made about Chris Pratt, he failed to make an impact. The movie came down to too many special effects, green screen and of course, wise cracks and dialog that seemed way out of place, on top of that, the most overrated villain since Loki from ""Thor"". I will never watch this film again. Been there done that, nothing new for the genre in spite of all the accolades from critics. I must have missed something.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Just not that good,"There was a lot to like in this film, but ultimately it failed to connect with me... Which is a shame, because I really really really wanted to like it. It had some interesting characters, funny interactions, and sweet effects, but ultimately failed to bring everything together in a way which made the sum meaningful.After my wife and I left the theater I was almost embarrassed to ask her what she thought--because I was afraid she was going to say what I was already feeling myself... and that after I pushed her to see the movie when she was decidedly ""meh"" after seeing the trailer. Neither of us really cared for it, and both of us were disappointed. We both walked away thinking, so this is why it doesn't make sense to go see movies in the theater anymore. You drop a lot of money to see big budget extravaganza's which ultimately fail to satisfy. It just felt like a movie which only played lip service to the characters, and dwelled on the action. For me, a lot of action has no meaning without a lot of character substance. And it's a bad sign if I find myself more interested in the ""bad guy"" winning and destroying planets, and being generally evil, than I am in the ""good guys"" saving the day. This was totally the case here. I didn't really care if the good guys won or the bad guy won.I hear they're already making a sequel. My wife and I have been burned by the first one and have little interest in more of the same.

You surely know Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, but it's high time you are introduced to Peter Quill, Rocket Raccoon, Gamora, Groot and Drax. Instead of dark, gloomy and super-serious, these guys aren't just funny ... they are actually FUN!The plot is admittedly a bit simple. Everyone involved is basically chasing a ball (the orb) around the galaxy. Instead of good guys vs bad guys, it's actually kinda bad guys vs really bad guys. See, the heroes of our story are for the most part criminals themselves. The main difference is, they aren't after intergalactic super power and mega destruction like Ronan (Lee Pace). Ronan makes for a pretty menacing villain, especially with a voice that shook the theatre!The band of misfits thrown together by circumstance actually provide much entertainment. Chris Pratt (""Parks and Recreation"") is the self-nicknamed Star-Lord, better known as Peter Quill. The film begins in 1988 as Quill's mother dies and he is abducted by aliens. His criminal activity has him crossing paths with Gamora, a green assassin played by Zoe Saldana; Rocket, a brilliant, wise-cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; Rocket's bodyguard Groot, an unusually mobile and talented tree voiced by Vin Diesel; and the hulking, knife-wielding Drax the Destroyer who is bent on revenge, and played by WWE star Dave ""The Animal"" Bautista. It's a rag-tag group of heroes unlike anything you have seen before.Despite the lack of familiarity with these characters most viewers will bring, writer/director James Gunn (Slither) works wonders in having us quickly connect and even groot ... err, I mean ... root for these guys. Quill's possession of a Sony Walkman to play his mother's mix tape from the 1970's and 80's gives the film a very different flavor, as the familiar songs pop up at just the right time.Pratt does an admirable job in the lead, and though compared to the GQ Tony Stark/Iron Man he is more Mad Magazine, his Quill is funny and easy to like. The best comparison I have for Quill is Han Solo, and for the film I would say it hearkens back to 1978's Superman ... both very high compliments. It's also the first time I have been completely caught off guard and laughed outloud at a Jackson Pollock reference.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So-so on all levels,"I just got back from seeing _Guardians of the Galaxy_. Despite overall positive reviews and stellar recommendations from people whose opinions I value and trust, I found it only so-so at best. The humor was sophomoric—which I expected—but what I didn't expect was how boring it was. To be effective, humor relies on the element of surprise, and with only one or two exceptions, all the jokes were so blatantly broadcast that there was no opportunity to inject the unexpected.In addition, despite a good cast, the acting was flat and one-dimensional. Michael Rooker (Yondu) put in the best show of any of them, and he was really just a blue Merle from the AMC series _The Walking Dead_. Apparently, the director's idea of instilling dramatic tension is to shout, in a rather flat manner. The characters, protagonists and villains, were all overly familiar stereotypes, and there wasn't a single moment in the development of the plot that was not predictable.I am, frankly, surprised at the reviews this is getting. I was expecting a silly, rollicking space opera and instead got a noisy, explosion-ridden pastiche that bordered on tedium. Evidently, a lot of people are more easily pleased than I.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians entertaining the galaxy.,"Wow, what a great one, time for a review. This movie is fantastic! What is so good about it, you ask?Simply put, everything about it is just absolutely well made. Sounds like a bland comment? ""It is well made, so what?"" you say? Well I really can't find anything to complain about here, and when you think about it, that is not something you can say about many movies. It is quite an achievement. (Even in the fantastic ""Gravity"" for example you can find some illogical stuff to complain about such as the ""unnecessary stupid sacrifice"".) In ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" you will see characters caring for each other without it feeling fake and without the need of using implausible heroic sacrifices. (Do not want to compare this movie with ""Gravity"" though with respect to which was better, totally different types of movies and both great in their own way.) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is just a fun ride that you will enjoy from start to finish.You like gripping and fun action scenes, which don't seem ridiculous or illogical? Check. Awesome visuals? Check. Cool main characters? Check. They are original, interesting, hilarious and you may even find yourself caring for some of them. ;) The acting is top-notch and makes the characters absolutely believable. Humor? Check! The jokes worked very well for me, even better than in The Avengers and that movie had its funny moments. Emotional moments that do not feel cliché or overdone? Check! Solid script? Yep, no major plot-holes and entertaining dialogues and cool one-liners. The pacing? Awesome! The movie keeps you interested all the time, without making you feel overwhelmed by it at any moment. The soundtrack? Cool and original for this type of movie.Anything missing? Yes, something to complain about. Well if you want to find something I guess could argue that it tells quite a straightforward story which is not very unique. Alright, but the whole thing is presented in such a cool and original way, I don't think anybody will mind.So after all this excessive praise, could this become my all time favorite movie? Probably not, but having said that, there are not many movies that entertained me as much as this one and I can genuinely say that I enjoyed every single aspect of it.Do yourself a favor and go and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply Awesome,"The film has surpassed my expectation, it has taken all that Marvel has learnt since 2008 and expressed it through this unique, funny and emotionally touching epic. The Avengers took 5 films to build up our relationships and connections to the characters, and we knew what to expect from them during the film, however in Guardians of the Galaxy the director has set the characters up with back stories and then made a connection between all 5 individually in the space of 128 minutes.The film explores, drama, romance and comedy and has funny highs, and heart touching lows. The villains weren't the focus, as this movie was all about the guardians, but we still felt the presence of evil in the background, and for all those who follow the Marvel cinematic universe, this film was a further boost for what could be the ending of the biggest movie event in history, it gives us a hint and what is to come, and hopefully we won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Outstanding,"6 August 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Guardians of The Galaxy. Marvellous Marvel at their very best. This film brought together the biggest bunch of misfits you could possibly imagine and made them gel as a team. Against the backdrop of special effects amongst whole new worlds these characters, who didn't really fit in anywhere, were fighting to save the entire Galaxy, and a more mismatched group you could not imagine, but it worked right down to the Raccoon with attitude and the vocally challenged tree. Full of one liners and visual jokes, the audience were chuckling throughout and I came away from this film with a smile on my face. Absolutely awesome in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
For what it is it is really really good,"I laughed a lot, liked all the characters, kept thinking about it for hours, all good so far. As someone who thinks Comic Movies are generally overrated (Yes, also the Nolan Batman Movies), i really enjoyed seeing this one, especially loving the raccoon. So, IMHO one of the best Comic Movies so farm, as it has laughs and heart and not just CGI. I still hope there is a directors cut on its way as some plot twists really lack explaining. The script is, how shall i put it, a bit clumsy.Why I give it a 6 out of 10, you ask your self? Because 10 is for all time Classics, not everything you got to like! There is a 10 point scale for a reason, learn to distinguish and not only give either 10 points or 1!!!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
very enjoyable,"This was not the movie i went out to see yesterday. I was more in the mood to watch < Porco Rosso > in a small cinema. But because my friend messed up the dates, we ended up seeing this film.I did not expect much, because those hero movies are not my type much; but was positively surprised.While the story is quite forgettable or stereotypical, the characters were likable. The movie was well paced and i cannot say that i did not enjoy it.It is a typical popcorn movie where you can turn off your braincells...at least when you are not into the comic stuff, i guess - because my friend and various other people in the cinema seemed to see a lot more in the characters than i did.However from the point of view of someone who usually avoids action movies and hero movies - it is a good 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, funny, fantastic. Marvel's best to date? Bring on the sequel!","I'm bored of superhero films. There are so many of them and so little that is original within them. I loved what Nolan did with his near-perfect Dark Knight reboot, I've thoroughly enjoyed the Iron Man series thus far, the third installment being a particular high, and Andrew Garfield succeeded in making The Amazing Spider-Man his own. Beyond that? I've almost stopped bothering. Ho hum.And then came Guardians of the Galaxy.I knew nothing about this series of comic books. I hadn't read them. I hadn't even heard of them. The trailer amused me, the concept intrigued me and last night James Gunn's third full feature as director added the sweetest cherry to a very fine cake of a day. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 can't come soon enough for me!Guardians of the Galaxy opens with the young Peter Quill watching his mother die of cancer before escaping the morbid hospital scene only to be whisked into space by aliens. Fast-forward a few years and the adult Quill (Chris Pratt) aka Star Lord steals a mysterious orb much to the chagrin of Korath (Djimon Hounsou). Quill finds himself the subject of a manhunt and is thrown together with a tree (Groot - Vin Diesel), a green girl (Gamora – Zoe Saldana), an oaf who takes everything literally (Drax – Dave Bautista) and a Racoon (Rocket – Bradley Cooper). Together they form the Guardians of the Galaxy as they bid to evade Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), stay alive and, oh, save the universe.Guardians of the Galaxy is silly, funny, rapidly paced and an absolute ball. Gunn's writing and direction are filled with energy so that, whilst there is a formula to the proceedings, it is thoroughly enjoyable and demands a second trip to see it in the next week or so. I'll even forgive him for his segment in the execrable Movie 43.There is little need for thought and no effort required for emotional attachment to the characters; they are so beautifully written that one engages with them from the off and delights in every second spent in their company. Guardians of the Galaxy is an exciting, enticing and very funny. The standing jokes are not over-egged and on the occasions where one can guess the outcome of a particular mishap, the result is entirely satisfying.The costumes, production design and CGI meld seamlessly to make Guardians of the Galaxy as visually pleasing as it is exciting. Everywhere there is colour, shape and sparkle and when we reach the domain of The Collector (Benicio del Toro) it is such a visual feast of quirks, curios and filmic references that the lack of a pause button in the cinema is a frustration. As for Glenn Close's Nova Prime, she might easily have stepped out of The Hunger Games' District 1.Fabulous! Fun, funny and fantastic. It's rare that I say this, but bring on the sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Incredibly awful,"Yeah, go and believe all the user reviews for this movie, and go the theater and waste the price of admission, whatever it is. Or, give me the benefit of the doubt, and trust what I am saying when I tell you that this movie stinks to high heaven. The CGI is top notch, but it ends there, and CGI by itself does not a movie make. There has to be a story, and this movie does not have any semblance of a story, at least not one that anyone could possibly follow or make any sense of, or one that, if published as a book, any sane and intelligent person would ever bother to read. The story told by a movie has to be good enough such that, if published as a book, it would be entertaining enough that people would bother to read it. This movie is nonstop action and fighting. In order to tell a story, it has to slow down a little here and there, but this movie never slows down at all. There is an orb, everyone wants it, and everyone fights over it. This really is all that there is to the story. I hated it so much that I wanted to walk out, but stayed, thinking that eventually it would have to get better, but it never did. This movie must have cost a lot to make, but the money they spent, however much it was, was spent manufacturing compost.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy is the best Marvel movie yet!,"Disclaimer: I am a HUGE Marvel fan! Guardians of the Galaxy straight up delivers in more categories than any Marvel movie yet. Not only does it hit deliver great CGI, story, and comedy, but it provides more CGI, story and comedy than any Marvel Studios movie yet. While many can claim that the movie had ""childish"" jokes or terrible villains. I will just say that consider the risk that Marvel Studios took by putting out this movie that really is unlike any superhero movie yet, and look how they have made household names out of a practically unknown comic book. Guardians of the Galaxy appeals to a diverse set of interest, and that is why I say it is a must see for anyone and I mean anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A little too chaotic for its own good, but thoroughly charming.","If you weren't sure by now, Marvel pretty much rule the roost of Hollywood and will most likely continue to do so for a little while longer. Their popularity is on a Spielbergian level of absurd. They're developing movies for kids that haven't even been born yet. Talk about a captive audience. I'm pretty mild on Marvel. While The Avengers was a jolly good (if throwaway) time, their movies aren't always as satisfying. Outside of the first Iron Man film, there's little else that sufficiently ticks enough boxes. Even at their most acclaimed with this year's Captain America followup The Winter Soldier it didn't break their mould of bad habits with misjudged melodrama, clunky humour, contrivances and dull villains. Now comes the seed of a new franchise, one admittedly more risky than the others that had brand awareness even for those who never read comic books. Maybe it works better because Guardians of the Galaxy is closest to J.J. Abrams' Star Trek than Thor, and not just because of Zoe Saldana.It is quite nice to see a film go old school with its effects. Yes, there are CGI backgrounds and CGI characters littered everywhere, but the majority of Guardians' production are real sets and real people under heavy makeup. I can see that being the charm for many people regarding this film, one that's only on Earth for a 5 minute prologue. Personally, and this goes for Star Wars and so on, I struggle to get lost in suspension of belief that everything resembles Earth and humans, it just seems overly limited to me. It's a minor distraction that just holds me back from sci-fi, even if it's as silly and camp as this. It's a real shame that Guardians is by the tales of MacGuffin city with a meaningless dry plot that propels characters into who cares and why not. If only it could've been sprinkled with a touch more its charm so this plot could've been secondary because, and everyone knows, the film is at its best when it showcases its sense of humour and camaraderie. You can tell the actors and director James Gunn, whose roots are in oddball comedies, just love riffing off each other, subverting odd clichés they're bored of conforming to.Outside of the irresistibly charming Starlord, played by rising star Chris Pratt who's found the uncanny ability to ground any movie no matter where it's set, be it the galaxy, the not-too- distance future or Legoland, I was pleasantly surprised as to which characters stuck out for me. Drax and Gamora, with their brute but sensitive personalities are much more interesting than the destined to be fan favourites CGI stars Rocket and Groot, who pander to the audience more than anything, leaving gaps for laughter like it's a sitcom. However, their losses and backstories are quite touching at times, but it's difficult to not feel like their forged friendships are forced by the obligation to have them antagonise each other then bond over common goals. It's not very convincing but they just want to slink into it regardless. Guardians can be an entertaining film and it's more or less as good as a Marvel movie can be with all its inevitable fill-in-the- blanks tedium and tonal imbalance to try to please all, but it's simply too chaotic and overzealous for its own good. I'm going to say I'm bowing out of Marvel now but I said that for the last two movies. At least its soundtrack will introduce a lot of young fans to great music.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Good film, bit cheesy but worth watching","This film has all the same problems that a lot of Disney films have: I'm not just talking about the family friendliness of them and the inevitable cheese that brings; they also seem to have problems with their values. They always feel 'old-fashioned' like they haven't realised that the world is changing and we don't expect to see men behaving like stereotypical 'gentlemen' or 'players who meet their soul mate and change their ways'. We don't need to see the woman be saved by the man and the protagonists don't have to be white (or brown but covered with green paint). I just think that Disney need to get in touch with today's reality.Also, the CGI was fairly bad in a lot of places and the story and script were very predictable most of the time.So it seems that when you have a cheesy, predictable, old-fashioned and clichéd story to tell, the answer these days is to make sure it's funny.Which brings me to why I've given this a 7 and why I would recommend watching it: it's genuinely funny! I laughed out loud a fair few times and I was never bored.There's no real character development, most of the characters are one-dimensional but it's fun!

I was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer.Now having seen it: what an awful movie – although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstrings-tugging opening in the hospital, it rapidly becomes the same old shoot 'em up that you have seen innumerable times.The good guy, is a bad guy only doing good to clear his name or there is something in it for him. The bad guy gets stupid henchman to go after him. the Fights are super boring and very badly edited, and the story falls apart on itself over and over again.When you pay people a very high salary for being script supervisor and not even to mention script writers, you would think the story would be some what interesting or relatively good. No, this film was very weak.The only plus side to the whole film was the nostalgic music that kept on playing through the movie. That's it.The bad guy was weak and never truly explained, the really bad guy didn't care that he was betrayed, the good guy never got his revenge, or really did anything of importance in the film.

Overrated and loaded with lame attempts at comedy,"Disappointing would be a massive understatement for this turkey. Chris Pratt falls flat in his attempt at movie stardom.

The CGI is heavy handed and distracting, this film is the cinematic equivalent of Kim Kardashian: desperate for attention, and utterly empty on the inside. Setting this epic lack of substance to the hits of yesteryear only highlights how desperate the Marvel hacks are to conjure up some sort of hipster factor. Sadly, Zoe Saldana (in green face) is wasted as the token female character in this excruciating hot dog fest.

What a wonderful movie 10/10,"Guardians of the Galaxy touched my heart. Both movies are exceptional in their own way. They're apart from marvel superhero movies. What I mean is even if it wasn't a marvel movie I'd recommend that to everybody who loves to have a good time while watching a movie of that quality. At first I was skeptical about superhero movies with galaxy adventures, but when I was forced to watch it to prepare for avenger movies I was surprised. It catches you from the first seconds when Quill starts to dance to the the classical pop hit ' come and get your love '.Usually it's my habit to talk about the cinematography and the acting which was a great experience. A very quality motion picture movie. The plot is so magical all of them have so much in common and you feel for them cause all of them had calamities. The character developing is wonderful. I don't wanna spoil to much so I don't go farther into detail.A little note for my personal self: I'm also happy for Dave Bautista, cause I grew up as a teenager watching him at WWE. To see him breakthrough with this role is amazing. I'm so proud of him. He fits his role so perfect.The plot is awesome and entertaining and never loses its pace. It also connects directly to the following big movies ( if you know what I mean ).Can't tell anything bad about the costumes and makeup or shall I say makeover ?! So good !!The music is totally my taste. I love different kind of musics and I grew up with pop and rock. So to see them bring up some classic pop hits back is wonderful. It automatically puts you onto a positive vibe. That's my experience. Always got love for these kinda movies. I watched both movies for the second time yesterday.

Thankfully when the movie actually got going it was really good, anyway all that said this movie is definitely worth watching and shouldn't be missed, especially if you like nostalgia as epic is the only word in my opinion to describe the awesomeness of the nostalgic sound track which accompanies this movie.

It's a funny, action packed thrill ride from beginning to end with arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time. This film is masterfully done and has us not only connect with the characters in a few hours, but really feel like they're family by the end; which is really hard to do in the limited time of a film.

A Change Up in the MCU,"Guardians of the Galaxy works as a superhero team movie though there was no solo movies beforehand. The characters were developed in a way where their story and overall character is based on the interactions between each other. The movie is definitely a revolution in Marvel. It brings lesser known characters that was barely known before getting their movie. Its success can be the inspiration for the creation of Moon Knight and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. There's various jokes throughout, more so than any MCU movie released up to that point. It goes more cosmic as well (like if you didn't already guess from the title). It is more into the music than anything else MCU. It definitely influenced the MCU in various ways which its success encouraged them to do more obscure characters, put more music, and put more jokes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Amazing,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rockets onto the screen with an 8/10 rating, firmly nestled in the ""Loved it"" category. This intergalactic adventure is a spectacular blend of heart and humor, propelled by a charismatic ensemble cast that brings their characters to life with irresistible charm.

A standout feature is the eclectic and nostalgic soundtrack, which serves as the film's heartbeat, reinforcing the message that music has the power to connect us across the cosmos. As the Guardians grapple with their complex pasts and form an unlikely family, the film's underlying theme of found connections and second chances resonates deeply.

"Marvel superhero garbage meets STAR WARS on drugs, or worse","Why so many liked it and why it was a box office success is well beyond me. This movie got nothing but an nonstop CGI orgy with pale actors acting badly, a laughable ""story"" and everything else to do their worst. It's a miracle I finished watching, wanted to stop after 30 minutes. Unfortunately it only got worse...Humor? Groot please! YAWN!!! Poor dialouges, even bad language and the usual violence and special effetcs - nothing will surprise you. But hey, why not? A movie by braindeads for braindeads sound like a big win/win situation. Let's make the most (money) of it now!I will definitely not watch any more Marvel and any more of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY sequels including spin offs which might appear out of nowhere. Which is very likely due to UNDESERVED success, and for the fact that Marvel can't stop milking the cash cow, so they simple have to make more movies out of every tiny bit of their Marvel universium and its dozens of characters. And then more sequels of course, with like none has a bit of originality, everything has been there already, no matter how much more CGI they use.So yes, this is only for teens. So teens, listen: stop supporting this madness and rely on other action/scifi, ones made with love, with art, with less than 95% CGI. Marvel will just make you stupid, but since you're in your teens, you simply don't know better. Not your fault, but please:look for new horizons! Thank you!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
These meager pleasures are swallowed up,"The term 'superhero fatigue' has been floating around for a while now and you've either got it or it's gonna be setting in soon. The fact is that in the last decade (give or take) there's been an influx of people with powers dominating our cinema screens and ever since Robert Downey Jr. made Tony Stark a pop-culture legend, Marvel Studios has been the main offender; pumping out sequels and prequels of guys with hammers and anger issues and spangle outfits. Their crown jewel, The Avengers, put the whole gang in one big flying fortress and then burned down the box-office to the tune of around a billion and a half in ticket sales. As well as the Disney/Marvel juggernaut, Sony has Spidey and the five movies he's starred in, Fox has the X-Men and around a half-dozen movies of varying quality and Warner Brothers has Batman, a phenomenon unto himself with Superman occasionally showing up in various combinations of performer and tone. Safe to say, people in capes are no longer the exception, they're the norm when it comes to picking a movie for the weekend. And with Marvel's newest cab off the rank, Guardians of the Galaxy has set its sights on a pretty risky set of characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Its funny, witty, heartfelt and something the entire family can enjoy. It's a cast of characters that are real, down to earth and completely relatable.

Overproduced Fanfiction,"The First paragraph of this review consists of exposition. If a potential reader wishes to read about my opinion on the movie, skipping to the second paragraph is advisable. It's been about two years since I saw this movie at the cinema - something is compelled me to organize my thoughts and write this now. Why? I'm not entirely sure, I guess ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" was always kind of an enigma to me. How could a movie so inept in everything it tries to do be so praised? It's not your typical Michael Bay-esque Hollywood cookie-cutter garbage, so It's success can't be attributed to following the same, overused, cliché-infested formulas. It could be that I am insane in my own specific way, but outside of production value I found no redeeming qualities here. I know the movie is an adaptation (of sorts) of a comic book series. My knowledge of comics is incredibly limited, so I'm judging this thing on it's own merits.""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" reminded me of one of those sci-fi stories I would come up with when I was 10-13 years old. It was a favorite pastime of mine, coming up with characters, who were blatant rip-offs of others from franchises I enjoyed at the time, putting them in nonsensical situations (of course, to 12 year old me it all made perfect sense) and just admiring my creation as any narcissistic child would. Of course, my stories didn't have movie adaptations with astronomical budgets.I compared ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" to a child's sci-fi story because of it's complete lack of direction - too many plot lines (more akin to plot doodles) that are individually unrefined and irrelevant to the overall story, which somehow manages to be even more undefinable. It's like a space opera chopped up and stitched together in some horribly messed up jigsaw puzzle. Now, some movies thrive on a lack of continuity and direction (Tarantino practically mastered that form of film-making), but this specimen is different. Again, it's as if the script was written by a child and the whole thing was directed by some individual who somehow had the skill of a top-notch director, but again possessed the mindset of a 12 year old.What's even more surreal about the whole thing is that it feels incredibly solid - it's not ""The Room"" where every seen is irrelevant, because of the writer/director's sheer incompetence. Somehow, ""Guardians..."" holds itself together quite well, again everything else is top notch: Excellent CGI, detailed land/spacescapes (albeit of unoriginal, uninspired design) and pretty good acting with some minor exceptions. As I said before, this movie doesn't play out like a typical Hollywood schlockfest would - there are too many plot lines and too much time is devoted to character development - if this was typical garbage, we would have had a lot more action scenes and female characters in suggestive positions. All these attempts at complexity feel sincere, again, it's like a child trying to do his best, but they have no purpose. To illustrate: why should it matter that the green chick and the blue chick (sorry, too lazy to look up names) are sisters - it could matter, but the movie makes no attempt to give some importance to this statement, they share some scenes, the talk about about each other, they fight, but nothing really comes out of it. It's the same with every single plot point you can think of. The Villain? Well, he's pale blue and angry and he has this massive spaceship fortress and wants to rule/destroy (not sure) the universe, but wait it turns out he's not the main villain, there's another guy and he's even...yeah a 12 year old might buy into this being legit character development, but I've grown far too old and cynical.In the end, ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" feels like it starts from nowhere, goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. A very empty, yet confusing (albeit visually spectacular) experience. But all the glitter in the world can't make this shine. Sorry.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy,"This was a very strong Marvel movie. Going into it, I knew it would be good, but I didn't know it would be this good. This was nothing like the other Marvel movies. This one involved and entire new team of superheroes, it took place in space not in the way the Thor movies did, it was an action comedy instead of the usual Marvel genre, and there was a soundtrack made up of real songs from the 70s and 80s. I loved all the actors and the roles they played, I thought all the casting decisions were perfect, they all played their roles perfectly. I also liked how this movie took place in space, and not like the Thor movies. This one they were actually in space traveling to different planets. I liked that because it was a very nice change of scenery in the marvel universe. This movie provided s lot of great laughs. I loved how Marvel finally made an action comedy. The thing that really worked to make this movie funny with this group of characters was how dysfunctional they were together, also how stupid Drax was, and how naive Groot was was perfect and hilarious. All these actors had great chemistry together resulting in a hilarious movie. The final thing I liked was the soundtrack. I wasn't born in the 70s or 80s, but I liked the songs they used. I really liked how James Gunn was able to incorporate them directly in with the movie.This movie was great, definitely in the top five of Marvel movies so far. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it, you don't even have to watch any of the other movies, this one is completely standalone from the rest of the universe. They do eventually cross over in 2018 in Avengers: Infinity War, but until then, you are fine.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Incredible, one of MCU's best","The Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the greatest scifi movie franchises, and this one might be when the series arguably hit its peak (tied with The Avengers).Having very much the feeling of the original Star Wars movie, it stars some very colourful and unique characters, providing some incredibly well-written banter inbetween and in an age before Star Wars returned, it felt maybe the closest to the trilogy since 1983.The score is amazing, emphazising on music even more than previous films in the franchise, and there's an extra focus on the comedic aspect, which works really well here. It might be the first true attempt by the franchise to tackle some pretty obscure characters.The effects are overall mind-blowing, the cinematography and action scenes incredible and the villains memorable. It also builds up what is to come in great fashion.Overall, a true testament to the greatness of this movie franchise - which only continues to amaze!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This bubblegum sci-fi comedy with an anarchic feel has edge, zip and zest. There is a wisp of Star Wars: A New Hope in the ether and a healthy dose of wink-to-audience wit.

"'Guardians' go big, not home","2014 was a crowded year for superhero films, and James Gunn's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' emerged as the highest-grossing of them all. The unconventional film follows a bunch of intergalactic misfits who are forced to band together in order to survive a villainous pursuit of a weapon of mass destruction in the form of an orb.While 'Guardians' is a member of the Marvel family, it definitely is not your uncle's superhero movie. It might just be your grandfather's, though, based on the soundtrack of psychedelic 60's and 70's tunes that permeate the scenes of spacecraft, aliens and lasers - which makes for a creative juxtaposition. But perhaps the best part of the film is the camaraderie that develops between everyone - from Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the rag- tag bunch of Drax, Rocket and Groot (Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, respectively). It's great to see everyone's relationships change over the course of the film, as circumstances more or less bring them together.'Guardians' is not a groundbreaking film, per se, but it is different enough from our standard fare that it has a sense of originality, which works to its advantage. The dialogue is smart, funny and not totally idiotic, as it easily could have been. Even the special effects are what you would expect from a big budget blockbuster, so there are no real weak spots in what is an otherwise run-of-the- mill action-packed extravaganza.True - there are plenty of seemingly similar films out there to watch, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an example of how to offer up something that can satisfy a diverse audience and appeal to all age groups while still being pretty entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Now it's time to rate this movie.,"Actually I am giving this movie a 8.7 however it cannot be scored in that way.When Ragnarok got a 9 at the time it newly released, I was once pretty puzzled why the new haircut Thor can easily get the score so high?? That movie definitely copies certain degree of sense of humor from Guardians of the Galaxy (GG) but no way beyond ( plz don't say it didn't), but people rated GG at 8!! Now after a long while people finally start to rectify the rating for Ragnarok to 7.9, umm... fair enough. Because I'll certainly doubt IMDB rating system forever if R keeps its rating higher than GG.I have to say that the OST in GG is already worth an 8. Personally I've been listening since I watched it for the first time. Is that album epic?! I mean when he whole tone of marvel goes rather modern(Ironman) or boring historic(Thor), the director of GG showed you another possibility of Marvel movie- nostalgias 1970/1980s fun! While you watch those hilarious Garbage of the Galaxy, oh no, Guardians of the Galaxy, didn't you feel it is such a different kind of show way for Marvel? Talented, creative, and fresh!!!While, though now the rating is 8.1 here, I still wanna say thank you to the director that he chose such a unique way to show Marvel comics. Though the GG2 isn't as good as GG1, I'll still be a solid supporter for this series. And I'll buy the album for sure :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Total Waste of Time--Ripoffs of Star Wars are Abundant!,"This movie just sucked. It was so damn juvenile that, as an adult, I felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school. There's a main underlying premise, but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end, and the damn thing is about 2 hours long.Chris Pratt's character was a rip-off Han Solo but extremely laid-back to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche, bro-surfer attitude, Zoe Saldana's character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part, and that damn raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper was more annoying than Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars! This movie rips off Star Wars in many way, down to the retro-like scifi look of the movie. Half, and I mean it seemed like half...it was that boring, the movie took place in a prison, and nothing really happened besides their dumb escape...trust me it was stupid how they escaped.This movie is like watching an incoherent child's illogical dream. It is an orgy of impossible, child-like fantasy. There is nothing in it that made sense, and there is nothing that engaged the viewer. The antagonist is invincible, but wait no he's not...the protagonist is a fragile human, but wait no he's not...It's probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history.

"A Fun, Refreshing Sci-Fi Action Flick","First, the negative:The plot is definitely not original. It's the same Marvel movie formula--quirky heroes work together to find an extremely powerful thing before the villain(s) get to it first.And then there's the sports movie plot--a group of mismatched misfits must set aside their differences and become a team before whatever happens.And speaking of teamwork, the ending is so cheesy that it feels out of place. It involves the Guardians working together, which is fine, but the way it was done is something out of a kids movie (not that the rest of the movie is sophisticated, but it's still somewhat odd).Ronan the Accuser, the movie's main villain, is dull. Very dull. I guess that's the point. Maybe the movie wants a villain who is serious to serve as a counterbalance to the heroes.Now, the positive:The Guardians as characters and the way those characters interact with each other greatly helps the movie elevate from a 4/10 to a 7/10. Most movies about a band of misfits give the characters shallow, insincere traits. Each of the Guardians are actual people with different personalities from different backgrounds.

A great spin off of the MCU with a fresh set of characters and an original story,"Guardians of the Galaxy stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradly Cooper, and Vin Diesel as they form together to defeat the terrible Ronan who is trying to destroy the universe with an infinity stone. And this movie is nearly flawless and stands up to even The Avengers with its team forming comic book mashup.Now legendary writer and director James Gunn wrote this fantastic script that fits every actor perfectly. With Quill being so sarcastic yet heroic in this film in all the wrong ways. Drax with his lack of understanding metaphors and is great comedy of stating everything as bluntly as possible. Rocket with his hilarious sarcasm and big mouth with his amazing jokes about his height and species. And of course groot being the most lovable character in the MCU to date with his small vocabulary and big heart. And even with the writing the smaller characters and with its perfect balance of comedy to story telling makes the script a very enjoyable part of the film.Directing wise Gunn did an amazing job with the direction making this film feel so far away from the MCU but so relevant and relatable and familiar at the same time. Having some fantastic scenes like the final battle scene and the jail scene makes this film so memorable and fun and makes you guessing till the end on what will happen.The acting all around is amazing as well. Pratt as star Lord is one of the best casting since Robert Downing Jr. As iron man. And with the equally great voice acting by Cooper and Diesel makes it almost forgettable that they voiced them. And with the amazing make up on Rooker, Baitista, and Saldana makes them recognisable and makes them as characters fun and fills the screen with joy.This movie is a great film to add to the MCU and one of the most memorable for its lines and scenes with fantastic characters and a great plot.Guardians of the Galaxy gets a 9.25/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This is one of best looking sci-fi films ever made in my opinion & IT'S definitely one of Marvels most fun & entertaining films.
The tone is fun, humorous & exciting but still with plenty of danger for our odd crew of space heroes. The characters are such a fun & an odd mix & it all works perfectly.

One Cool odd-ball crew of Space warriors for one big fun adventure with outstanding special effects & a well crafted story & some of the most beautiful sets & backgrounds I've ever seen in a sci-fi flick!!!

I am Groot,"I am Groot... That means i love this film.Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel latest film in its cinematic universe which is currently in Phase 2, this film is the next Marvel film since Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which was great and i'm happy to say this film is even better.When Guardians of the Galaxy was announced a few years, i was one of the many that had no idea who these characters were and i was very surprised at Marvel for taking such a gamble on a film, but it definitely payed off. Image and video hosting by TinyPic The film is about Peter Quill (A.K.A Starlord) a human who is a child when he gets abducted by a spaceship, the film then cuts to 26 years later and Quill grows up into a egotistical, playboy, outlaw, who is only in it for himself and would betray anyone for a certain price. Quill founds an orb after a great first scene of Quill dancing around listening to his Walkman (which is a highlight of the film), Quill realizes everyone wants this orb he has required and tries to use it for his own self. On his journey he meets his eventual teammates; Gamora, a famous assassin and daughter to one of the deadliest people in the universe, Drax the Destroyer, a warrior who is set on vengeance to the one who killed his family, Rocket Raccoon, a loud mouthed Raccoon who is also a bounty hunter and his friend Groot, a humanoid tree, who can only say the words ""I Am Groot"" The explanation of these characters sounds ridiculous and they are, i think that's why they work so great as a team of screen, they are all rejects put together make a strong team.Guardians of the Galaxy is interesting because its tone is everywhere, but it works, from one laugh out loud moment to a quiet sincere moment and it all works which is a real testament to the actors on screen and the director, James Gunn.James Gunn does a great job at establishing these brand new worlds we have never been to before, from the wasteland planets to the beautiful Xandar.The film has a interesting story, full of galactic conquests, betrayal and villains, but James Gunn chose to focus on The Guardians in this first film and i think that was the right idea, i was worried going in that all 5 Guardians wouldn't be full developed by the end of the film, but i was wrong all 5 come out at the end of the film as fully fledged characters thankfully that's with help of course from the actors portraying the characters; Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill and plays the cocky playboy very well, and was very well cast, Pratt being a comedic actor worked perfectly because this film is really funny and he is a big reason why. Gamora is played by Zoe Saldana, who seems to always played primary colored characters! She plays the sexy assassins very well, having to act serious and dead- eyed for a lot of the film but can also be cute when least expected. Rocket Raccoon is voiced by Bradley Cooper and when cast i thought that was a strange pairing but it worked well in the film, Cooper played the Raccoon very cocky and funny and in interviews so he was trying to do a homage to Joe Pesci, which is apparent when seeing the film. Vin Diesel voices the humanoid Tree, Groot, and was the perfect casting, Groot can only say three words yet can put so much emotion in those three words that you always know what he is really saying when he says the words, they must of thought of Vin Diesel because of the film The Iron Giant in which he does the same kind of performance. Rounding out the main characters is, Drax the Destroyer, who is played by Dave Bautista, i was worried that he was going be the weak link in the cast but i was totally wrong, Bautista plays Drax very well, acting deadpan and having great comedic delivery which i really didn't expect.Because the film was so focused they didn't spend too much time with the villains of the piece which i think worked in their favor, Ronan the Accusor played by Lee Pace, is a very cool and meanacing looking character but he is very deep as well as his sidekick Nebula played by Karen Gillan, Ronan wants to get revenge, that is all, but that is all that is needed, for the film to have a baddie that the Guardians can defeat and i think it worked very well. The supporting cast also did their thing featuring such actors as Glenn Close, Michael Rooker and John C. Reilly but the standout to me was Benicio del Toro, who plays the Collector, a Liberace type character who as his name says collects interesting things.Another interesting film about the film is that it hardly is connected to the other Marvel films except for two small things, the infinity gems and Thanos and they are not big parts of the film, it is really focusing on the Guardians and the universe and doesn't feel like a sequel to The Avengers and doesn't feel like an advert for the second Avengers film.The soundtrack for the film is one of the best soundtracks i have heard in film, through the plot device of Quill's Walkman it allows the film to have 80's songs playing all throughout this futuristic film which is such a juxtaposition and shouldn't fit the film yet it does perfectly.But the reason i think the film really excels is because of James Gunn, the film still has Gunn's eccentrics that are in all his films and this is his best film yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Popcorn-Entertainment at its Best.,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a buoyant and joyful roller-coaster ride through a colorful, fantastically imaginative world somewhere on the verge between Sciencefiction and Fantasy only surpassed by ""Avatar"" in it's artistic abundance - and while missing James Cameron's sense for great dramaturgical peaks on a deeply emotional level that make you suffer with the protagonists, it in exchange comes up with a more or less great sense of humor.Certainly not every punchline hits its target, however, there are some really, really funny scenes full of self-irony. The main protagonists, the heroes, who are refreshingly different from the typical superhero characters Marvel has to offer, since they all carry the image of being outlaws beyond ordinary social conventions, somehow succeed in managing the balancing act between silliness and seriousness, harmonizing well together and even providing one or two goose-bump moments towards the end.The plot itself is not very elaborated and feels shallow at times, too much resembling other Marvel movies in its structural build up. More bravado and originality on part of the script authors would have given this in all other respects astonishing motion picture not only more substance and depth but also something that stays with you long after the curtain has fallen and the impressions of the visual effects have faded away. The good thing about the story is that it is fast-paced and does not need three hours to be told.Also remarkable is the - for such a genre - rather unusual soundtrack consisting of famous pop songs of the 1960's-80's, it contributes much to the positive vibe of the movie since it is played throughout the movie, even serving as a plot device.The 13 years old comic fan boy/girl will cheer at this, a more mature viewer can certainly appreciate the satirical quality and epic action scenes.Very entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Still one of the best MCU movies!,"After all these years and all the MCU content we have gotten, this still remains as one of the best movies!There is just so much to love about this movie, from the characters to the engenius use of music, to the fact that it is one the few MCU movies that is actually funny and not painfully cringe! The humor is well placed and never overstays its welcome!The movie also perfectly balances light hearted moments with more emotional and mature ones! The character are of course what carries this movie and they all balances each other very well! An odd but perfect team!Even if you are not familiar with the MCU you can still watch this movie, and that might be why it works so well!It is impossible to hate!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Just what I needed,"Normally in superhero movies, especially in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is often a certain way that CGI is handled. In the beginning there has to be an introduction that will either show something/someone important that the hero is going to need, or it is going to be something/someone that will come useful in the end. Then in the middle of the movie the superhero is using his/her powers to either test them out or to fight a bad guy (mostly for losing so that it can pay off in the end). And then there is a big CGI fight in the end. That's it. The rest of the movie is just spent talking, doing side quests and occasional comic relief.I had come to observe this when I was bingewatching all the MCU movies after the release of Infinity War. I wanted to watch all the movies so that I could catch up with everyone in time to watch Endgame. And seeing all the previous movies - all 3 Iron Man's, both the Thor's and Captain America's, The Incredible Hulk - they were becoming too predictable because of the pattern that they were following. But then this came. And it was filled to the brim with unique visuals and dazzling CGI. I went crazy over it within the first ten minutes. This entire thing was so interesting to watch, the characters were so much fun, it was like this thing itself could be a separate franchise.Normally in any film whenever there are more than 4 main characters I'm not able to remember all the names. It's easy to remember in games, shows or books since they are long enough to get me to memorise the names. But a movie, especially a sci-fi one, is barely two hours long. And after that everything is done. And yet not only did I remember the names of all the characters in the movie, I also remember how they were introduced. This movie has something of a charm to it. And that's what makes it so watchable. The only problem I have with it is that, well, it does become cringy at times, especially during the character introductions. I do understand that was done because it's a kids' movie, but it's not a ""just for kids"" movie. The sense of humour could have been a little better.I really wish there was a spin-off series dedicated just to GotG. It's an entire world within itself, filled to the brim with lores. It's kinda sad that it needs to be in pace with the rest of MCU, because this is the one franchise with the maximum amount of potential. Thanos was only one of them. There are more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

There was nothing ""too much""; nor was there any moment that felt like a drag.

"Good fun, and love the soundtrack.","Guardians of the Galaxy was a bit of a surprise package for me. The movie is good fun and a decent time filler thanks to the charismatic Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord, and the revival of many old songs featured heavily in the soundtrack. It could have been dismissed as loud mindless nonsense, but Guardians of the Galaxy proved to be a big hit.After being abducted by space pirated following his mother's death, Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) finds himself making a living on Planet Morag as a space adventurer. Peter finds himself being hunted by bounty hunters sent by Ronan (Lee Pace) after he steals an orb. After being captured by Nova Corps officers and imprisoned, Quill manages to break out after forming an uneasy alliance with fellow ragtag misfits Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), Gamora (Zoe Saldanda), and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Battista). When the orb's true power and the cosmic threat it poses is revealed, the group of misfit heroes must band together to save all of mankind.Chris Pratt's Peter Quill/Star Lord is a mixture of Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Marty McFly. Chris Pratt was well known as an overweight comedic actor who drastically reinvented himself and his career by embarking on a very strict fitness regime and turned himself into a heroic leading man with a new found appeal amongst many fans.Zoe Saldanda, Dave Battista, Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper round out the supporting cast, but there is a further star studded cast with Michael Rooker, Glenn Close, John C Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace and Benicio del Toro also feature in the movie.Guardians of the Galaxy is a fun ride and is something you just can sit back and enjoy. Chris Pratt's charisma and the brilliant soundtrack also add to the appeal.Enjoy yourself.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I don't want or need a Mary Sue, but one redeemable character that has a whole personality would be awesome.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Critical thinking is Extinct !!,"Typical over-hyped, overrated blockbuster movie. The movie tried to be funny and serious at the same time, sadly it failed at both. I'll make it very simple.Story premise? Cheap emotional scene with an undeveloped character that i couldn't relate to. Four characters get together without any build up for them, rather it feels because the plot demands it. Character development doesn't exist. Story is very simple: good guys vs bad guys. (enjoyable for kids) Story isn't plausible, especially at the prison, it doesn't make any sense how each character behaves, and how the prison authority handles it is cringe-worthy. Also it's full of plot convenience and scenes which insults the intelligence. Filled with one dimensional characters, this movie has no depth at all, it is just mindless entertainment and the problem here is that it is generic, i have seen it many times before, so this kind of entertainment is outdated and i'm annoyed at how Hollywood is over- using this. Villains are as usual stupid and the good guys are underdogs who win and repeat jokes after each dangerous situation, such original WOW (sarcasm). Soundtrack is very bad. Visuals were great and had some innovative stuff.Guardians of the Galaxy is the typical blockbuster movie we get each year which only relies on good visuals and some mindless action.4 points out of 10 only for the visuals.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Cosmic Adventure is a lot of fun,"This feels more like a parody of the previous Marvel movies, then a legitimate one. That's not a bad thing though, because the constant humor keeps you interested and laughing the whole time. With so many retro gadgets, such as a Walkman, this film may make you nostalgic for the 80s. It has heart, humor and Easter eggs galore. Some people may feel they want to skip this one, because the premise is too unusual. Don't do that. The zaniness is part of its charm. Marvel took a risk, and it paid off tremendously.

I do have to say one thing this movie was visually stunning but I'm still glad that I don't do these in 3D, I would have probably been sick afterward. I do think that the human characters were upstaged by the raccoon and the tree (can't believe Vin Diesel was paid money in this film and only said probably ten words during the whole two hours).

Between the wicked reminders of the music I grew up with and the comical antics of Star lord, it was impossible for me and my wife to not have a great time. Bright crisp colors, stunning fast passed visuals, great effects that deserved the big screen. The music and effects just riled us up more as the story unfolded. Serious comic book action.I don't want to give away anything about the movie for the chance that someone out there has not seen it. How that could happen i don't get it.

Good enough,"Peter Quill is a thief working in the big galaxy, after he had been abducted from the earth when he was a kid. But he will steal something that will set the galaxy in danger. First and foremost, I must say that Zoe Saldana knows her aliens. After blockbuster Avatar and other successful movies like Star Trek she takes upon yet again another alien role in Guardians of the Galaxy and of course it works. Cris Pratt is really good as Peter, not too serious and not too heroic that works along with the other comic figures. Couldn't help but feel that Peter had some Star Trek resemblance, but other than that, the movie follows the star wars sci fi model only with the major final battle action scene. The humor and the odd music work here to set the film of the beaten track and create a hit that most possibly, as the credits in the end suggested, will have a sequel. So 6 out of 10 for this unconventional Marvel movie. Plus, its always nice to see Stan Lee.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I think it is overrated,"I feel like this movie is overrated for a number of reasons. They didn't really make me care about the characters. I'll explain. When they announced the characters in the movie i thought they where pretty okay. They wanted Quill to give out like a player vibe ( not a douchebag ) , the tree a loving vibe , the raccoon a silly but cool vibe , the girl an assassin but loving vibe , and finally the rock looking guy, a man who wants to avenge his family. They managed to do this very well , but in the middle of the story it felt like they wanted to change the aspect of the characters , which made me feel less about them. And they kept giving an illusion that the characters had died when they never did ( to many times ). This makes the movie come of as not being ballsy and to unrealistic ( more of a kid movie ). The vfx and the makeup was amazing , the story was fine , the actors where great. but they failed making me people care about the characters. This is why i give it 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Perfect start...,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a movie that is based on the Marvel comics and as a result also the plot and the storyline of it is based on this. In this movie on the one hand we have an evil god that wants to destroy the universe and on the other hand we have a group of intergalactic criminals who have to work together in order to avoid this destruction.I really liked this movie because of the plot and the storyline because it combines very well the laugh with the action. The visual effects of it is outstanding. Also I believe that James Gunn did very good job in the direction of it. Even if we are talking about a Sci-Fi movie I have to say that the interpretations of Chris Pratt who played as Peter Quill and the beautiful Zoe Saldana who played as Gamora were magnificent. Another thing that has to be mentioned are the voices of Vin Diesel (Groot) and Bradley Cooper (who spoke more than Vin Diesel) as Rocket which gave a different beauty in this movie.Finally I would like to say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a great movie for everybody and especially of course for Marvel fans. I strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I am hooked for life to Guardians of the Galaxy,I am all about comics. I started reading every Spider Man when it cam out starting around issue number 47. I mention comics all over all my Radman_art and Radmanart websites since 2001; when my wife made my first website. The title of my websites refer to a super hero I invented in 1988 and had published in Thrasher Magazine. My splash page for my radmanart2ndhome.blogspot.com web site is of the issue Radman was published in. In all my newspaper articles praising my art; I am referred to as Radman. I created about 150 pages of comics back in my heyday's of the late 1980's. I have drawn the Guardians of the Galaxy's charatcter Rocket many times to perfection on my Radman_Art Blog Homepage 2016 page. I liked to draw Rocket because he is my favorite super hero of all time now. I love his New England accent. I never new I would have a raccoon as a favorite superhero.The point I am trying to make is I am all about comics. Until the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie I had never even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy. Weird huh? Pretty weird coming from a comic authority that I claim to be. Since then Guardians of the Galaxy has become my favorite super hero saga and will be for life.The amazing thing to me is Guardians of the Galaxy first began in the epic year of 1969. Probably the coolest year our country ever had.Say's Wikipedia:The original Guardians of the Galaxy are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Guardians first appear in Marvel Super-Heroes #18.You have to admit that is pretty weird.Long live Guardians of the Galaxy!,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Average plot but cool graphics.,"I've put off watching this film for so long despite all the good reviews, because the trailer honestly did not entice me. I do like Marvel films, but I'm not really into the aliens and galaxy thing (except for Thor), plus I had never heard of the comics before. I probably watched this trailer about 5 times in the past few year and still didn't watch the movie until now. Even while I was watching it, I was debating whether I should continue. Not to say that I'm glad I did, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.This film was pretty entertaining as I didn't realize time passing by while watching this. Chris Pratt is a very charismatic actor, and he was able to hold being the centre of the film well. The supporting cast was great too and Cooper did a great job lending his voice. It doesn't actually sound like him at all, but his voice matched that of his character really well.The story is pretty straightforward and kind of cliché. You have the average guy going about his business, and then stumbling upon something and getting into trouble. He makes friends along the way and at the end he grows to be a 'better' person. Also, it kind of feels like it's trying to be a comedy, but subtlety. Sometimes it even feels too casual and more of a comedy, but without actually being in the genre itself.The cinematics was cool though. Being in space and all, the layout of the planets and the graphics were pretty good. It looked really futuristic and from a totally different planet, so it did its job. The gadgets used were interesting too, however they didn't really explain how the major ones worked. During action scenes its pretty self-explanatory to see most of the gadgets in use, but when they needed to create a weapon from scratch to defeat whatever, it wasn't explained how it worked. It just 'magically' did.People have been saying that this film has the best soundtrack but I disagree. Sure, there are a few great songs in here, but they're only played for a few seconds (OK maybe up to a minute) here and there, it's not enough to fully enjoy it. Plus it seems like it's just added in for the sake of it. It doesn't feel authentic to me.Also, there was this one character who appears for a few seconds in the beginning but then disappears from the rest of the movie. Where did she go? I'm not hating on this film, it's well made, but I just feel like its another ordinary movie.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Special effects were great, I love the Racoon and Groot characters. Love the ship fighting scenes and love the landscapes.The bad. Story wasn't that great. It is predictable, boring and tried to throw in a love story too soon with no character building. A lot of the fight scenes were not great, especially between the two sisters. Some stuff don't make sense. One of the best actors wasn't even on screen. Vin Desil should of been a human character and not stuck saying ""Hodor"" as his only line.Now the ugly. It seems like they spent all their money on cgi and $1 on makeup. Spray painted humans = an alien? No joke, there's pink, green, blue, red, Easter colored aliens disguised as human beings or something. The villains are all bad, as in stinky bad. Think of Nero & Khan from StarTrek were bad ass I don't want to mess with them type. RONAN? Wrong cast, poor face paint, poor acting, not menacing, poorly introduced and on and on.

We Are Groot,"After exploding from the success of assembling the Avengers, Marvel Studios introduced audiences to an obscure ragtag team with Guardians of the Galaxy. Though generally unknown in 2014, even by comic book fans, the team brewed up a storm of uncertainty amongst fans of the cinematic franchise. Taking the MCU where it has never gone before, director James Gunn opened the doors to the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe.After being abducted from Earth in the 1980s, Peter Quill a.k.a Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), joins a team of thieving mercenaries led by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker). After attempting to steal from the thieves, Star-Lord goes on the run in an attempt to cash in on his treasure. With Yondu placing a bounty, Quill is targeted by intergalactic outlaws Rocket Racoon (Bradley Cooper) & Groot (Vin Diesel), as well as the daughter of Thanos (Josh Brolin), Gamora (Zoe Saldana). Upon realizing they share a common goal, this group of outcasts must band together, as the galaxy's last hope against Ronan the Accussor (Lee Pace).Delivering the greatest modern space opera, Guardians of the Galaxy excels at creating a one-of-a-kind thrill ride. Each team member not only delivers a captivating & memorable character, but they all feel integral to the overall story. Though Ronan isn't the most enticing villain, his direct connections to Thanos elevate his tyranny and provide deeper motivation. With a massive cast of characters, everyone gets a moment to shine, in a natural feeling manner, exciting audiences for current, and future endeavors.As overseer of the MCU Cosmic, James Gunn crafted a sprawling and exciting extension of the universe, begging to be explored. Creating a visual masterpiece, every minute of this mostly CGI space journey looks vibrant and believable. From seeing the fibers shake on Rocket's face to the crackling oasis in the cosmos, the careful design and execution paint an unforgettable picture. Rooted in comedy, Gunn seamlessly integrates humor into the adventure, with jokes that consistently elicit laughter. Balancing that out with dramatic and heartfelt moments, Guardians of the Galaxy feels like a complete package.After taking a gamble on some very unknown characters, the MCU could not have been luckier in the payoff. With characters like Groot becoming household names, kicking off a critically and financially successful trilogy, and paving the way for James Gunn to eventually oversee the DCU, the achievements of this film are astounding in and out of the genre. With deep and layered characters, devoted actors, and an imaginative director, Guardians of the Galaxy remains an incredible modern space epic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I still believe GotG is one of the greatest MCU films out there, also easily enjoyable as a stand-alone film.

My First Marvel Movie - And A Perfect Introduction,"A true treat from Marvel, the first Marvel movie I'd ever seen, Guardians of the Galaxy gives us a rollercoaster of wild, spectacular scenes and characters. James Gunn really took Marvel down a whole new path of fun. While Vin Diesel's Groot steals the show, each guardian has their own personality that makes for a real trip throughout the movie. Chris Pratt's Starlord is something amazing. He encapsulates the character well. And I think this is the first Marvel movie with a soundtrack that's something legendary in all of its music. 8 years later, its music is still popular all over again because of this movie. Guardians of the Galaxy is like if 70's rock n rollers took over Star Wars - and I'm glad that happened.

Marvel do good again,"Rating-7/10Guardians of the Galaxy is a Marvel made film that boasts a lot of differences from other movies that they make. The main point to this is that it is humorous and it can feel at times this is one big action comedy, well actually maybe it is that. It has good action too and the fights seen are good, well spread and the movie doesn't have too much of the same thing, I do feel this is overrated for me but I will come to my reasons later, I did find it to be a good film though and here below is why.I found the plot a little confusing and the characters especially the villains in this, unnecessary. Now I mean I got the plot and it isn't bad, it has it's excitement and all but what I felt is that the villains are so in depth and serious about all this, where as there are only brief moments when the heroes seem serious, didn't work well for me that. Having said that the plot does conjure up some good action scenes and some truly crazy special effects that push the boundaries of effects.I liked Chris Pratt as Peter and he manages to blend comedy and emotion into his role and comes out impressive enough to hold the main role. All the cast are funny, no one ruins the party and even the voice acting of Bradley Cooper(Rocket) and Vin Diesel(Groot) make some scenes much more fun and again, emotional. The film goes kind of crazy casting people, some actors like Glenn Close aren't seen much but provide a welcome sight in such an effects driven film.James Gunn is the man behind the helm here and he directs very well and could be the main force for why this is good, many will point to Pratt etc but Gunn manages to get the ball rolling and rolling fast. He and others write the script too and that again provides the laughs, brilliantly acted out by the cast but also very well written too and the choice of music by whomever it was, it very nicely done too.Now to why I felt it is overrated, now don't get me wrong I watched It and look back on it thinking ""yeah that was good"", but great?, for me the answer is no. It just isn't clinically excellent and you may even come out of this with effects sickness, the film is a big jumble of a film and I do feel some people are won over by the jokes rather than the poor plot and those awful villains, and I know where talking about a comic book film here but seriously, I just couldn't take them seriously.You know this film has odd bits of the beautiful, Groot the large tree like character is so lovable and if you haven't seen this, he could quickly become your favourite after watching. The music and the effects can create a strange experience as when they're flying through space, the 70's soundtrack and massive effects create a kind of trippy experience.Overall it is a fine Marvel film though and yet again they have dispensed Sci-fi that is tip-top and to be remembered too. It isn't for me one of the best Marvel films, or maybe it is I am not quite sure on that, they seem to bring so many out it can sometimes get lost a film by them, but this I feel will not be lost. I would recommend this to anyone, a fun film full of lots of well fun things, the sequel I look forward too as of the time of writing this it has not come out but I hope it is as funny and kind of weirdly sweet as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

fun space movie,"I thought this movie was good. I really liked all the older songs and the comedic relief brought with them. Like the open sequence, when Peter is using rats like a mike and twirling around on a spooky looking crater. The movie is about a magical orb and those trying to obtain it. Peter steels it but then meets greeny, Gamora, whom is trying to steel it from him. Then there is Ronan and Thanos whom both want the orb to be all powerful.Peter, Gamora, and 2 new fellows, Groot and Rocket, are caught by the police and put in prison. But Rocket is known for escaping so a plan is hatched and they bring along massive, Drax, with them whom wants revenge on Ronan. They get the orb while escaping, plan on selling it, till they find out how powerful it is.

Aliens who look just like humans but have slightly rough colorful skin. Aliens also share common set of emotions like we humans do.2. Even on galactic scales English is being used. All alien lifeforms come to an agreement to communicate in English.3. All aliens keeps cracking and laughing on American jokes.

One of the best of the MCU,"You don't have to be a fan of the MCU or comic book movies to have a good time with this film. The cinematography is great, the music is well used and makes the film have a life of its own. The main characters that make the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are incredible, and all interact off each other very well.

What a BLAST!!!!,"By far the best origin story movie for an MCU characters. The special effects are incredible, especially in the fight scenes, which make everything extremely fun.

One of my favorite origins for a squad of heros!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Overrated,"This film is bad, Green Lantern is a great superhero movie compared to this. It's just crazy how far Gardians of the Galaxy's rating is off what it should be. This film has zero depth, like intentionally, they dumbed it down on purpose. The sense of humor is corny as hell. The characters behavior was so dubious it was impossible for me to relate. The story was just weird and secondhand. I have no idea what is good in this film besides CGI. Maybe it's the fact that it's the ""hero"" movie where instead of some deep complex ""perfect"" character we have a bunch of misfits with plain problems and lots of flaws. Relatable, right? Other than that I don't have a clue.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Misogynistic Language,"This movie is better than the average comic-to-screen work. I would say that it surpasses many of the year's other films of the same genre, such as TASM2, TMNT, etc.However, this film, like many of the other films in its genre, suffers from sexist tones. But it goes even farther and uses misogynistic, violent language against the ONLY female protagonist, Zoe Saldana's character.She is referred to as a ""wench,"" ""green whore,"" and various other derogatory terms by one of the other protagonists. What is worse, he tells her that she is his ""friend"" but still calls her these names. He then proceeds to exert violence towards an antagonist character who uses a slur against her, proclaiming that ""no one else"" can talk to his ""friend"" that way.So, not only does this movie condone rape culture, patriarchy, and violent language, it also infantilizes and patronizes the only female character through making her tolerant of her colleague's ""protector"" attitude in the aforementioned scene, despite the fact that she is more than capable of taking care of herself.The specific slurs used themselves reflect the dudebro, sexist attitude of the filmmakers and of our society at large: slut, whore, wench, etc. All derogatory sexual terms used for a woman who has more sex than society wants her to. The character has no sex at all in the film, but because she is a woman, she is seen as a sexual object and thus the only way to ""insult"" her in this patriarchal mentality is to use derogatory sexual remarks against her.I cannot support films like this. Whoever wrote this script needs to be educated in gender studies.Yes, the movie had good visual effects and a solid villain and a good storyline. Rocket and Groot were fun characters. But we should not allow the positive aspects of the film to overshadow the threatening nature of its sexist undertones. Such seemingly innocuous remarks and societal norms contribute heavily to and define misogyny, patriarchy, rape culture, victim blaming, sex phobia, and backwards attitudes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Action, Comedy and Music","I had very fond memories when I watched this movie for the first time, I thought Star Lord was so cool and I thought the music was amazing. Revisiting it today, years after its first release, it's still a very solid piece of art.Definitely a great movie in terms of MCU movies, it has a lot of good points, lots of action, comedy, colorful atmosphere, unique soundtrack, very straightforward and enjoyable plot and an iconic cast of characters. On terms of rewatchability I would give it a 6/10, it's fun the first few times but eventually it'll get a little boring, specifically the first half of the final battle sequence was just kinda eh, too extravagant and easy to ignore. Nothing will ever beat that dance battle scene though it was pretty funny. But yeah. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
5 points for the clichés + 1 point for dialog,"I'll try to make this quick, although I kinda enjoyed myself, you fan boys have got to calm down. This is not the ""BEST MOVIE EVER OMG"".The good parts : the dialog : it's not EXTRAORDINARY, but at the very least it's still a lot better than the average earache you get honored with in contemporary blockbusters. It's a lot wittier and funnier than the usual downpour of clichéd overused mindless lines you so commonly endure. It also sounds quite real and spontaneous, surprisingly refreshing and practically makes the film worthwhile (the main cast is OK to meh; dunno why everyone is raving about Chris Pratt though). The main characters are visually pretty interesting and go along well, unfortunately they are poorly fleshed out and rather generic. The goof-ball antihero, the mindless brute, the female assassin, the innocuous terror-critter etc etc etc etc...but a wide array of alien species (SW style) and awesome secondary parts played by actors that have more acting experience and skills than the main cast (!?!) save the day; always nice to see Michael Rooker, John C Reily or Glenn Close (!?!), and cheers to them. This film also (kinda) works because it doesn't takes itself too seriously, so you're a lot less inclined to bitch about the usual truckloads of stupid and juvenile nonsense mandatory to superhero movies (and superhero movie it is not, it's a space-opera); it's got a hint of a hardcore attitude to it, but sadly that gets annihilated pretty quick by the overwhelming Disney vibe, so let's stop talking about that, and start talking about what sucks.THE BAD PARTS : get ready to be stumped : most of the flick is VFX ridden, indecipherable, seen a thousand times looooong-lasting action scenes, just for the sake of it. The story? The plot is three sentences long. Hey, let's ramp up screen time with the eye-shattering spaceship dogfight, the pointless pursuit, the confusing brawl and voila : you end up with a mind-numbing film that is a jumble of situations that we've all scene far too many times before and that have practically no links with one another (should I rewrite this sentence? naah, f*** it, it illustrates the film pretty well). I'm starting to think the average Hollywood writer has a box with a hole and bits of paper inside it on his desk. He has to pick twelve (without watching), sort'em out in a crescendo kinda a way and BAM : here's your script. If you have no ending, just copy the end of Return of the Jedi, so all the geek boys around the planet will spray they 30 something shorts when they ""get"" the ""tribute"" (did YOU get it? the final three-scenes-in-one, part sword fight, part dogfight, part team fight?? MAN THAT WAS SUBTLE). So this is what drags this movie to the near-average : Hollywood thinks ""space opera"", does ""Attack of the Clones"" all over again. I know it must be hard nowadays with video games, movies coming out at an exceeding rate, the sheer amount of competition coming from every possible media from every possible country to do something FRESH.But c'mon, it's Hollywood, they have LOADS OF MONEYZ. James Gunn IS a good writer(he's from Troma and wrote Dawn of the Dead, blessed be him). Give him time to polish an original script, or if he can't do it hire another writer to help him out. Use less cash in VFX and more cash in writing, there is no need to see a thousand spaceships on screen every 5 minutes. Just stop throwing the same old same old scripts and situations over and over and over again, ad nauseam, until every movie just looks the same. I find most modern blockbusters today are HUGE PILES OF BORING SH*T (excuse my french) and I have generally given up, and that's what p***** me off the most with Guardians of the Galaxy : I was ready to give it a shot, it had soooo much potential and a real chance at doing something fresh and new in terms of tone and approach, but thanks to Hollywood it f**ked up : 3/4th of the film is riddled with all the usual clichés and shortcomings that make today's blockbusters so appallingly dull and repetitious.So no, it's clearly not the movie of the year IMO, but thanks to the humor, the dialog scenes, the characters and the second degree tone, I won't have completely forgotten about it in six months and will maybe even recommend it.PS : If it had actual swearing I would have given it 6.5. Thx Disney. Yeah I know there's no 0.5 rating on IMDb, but I can't give it 7.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
MCU Pillar,"Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is a cinematic marvel that effortlessly secures its perfect 10/10 rating, and what makes it truly exceptional is its outstanding humor, iconic soundtrack, and the remarkable feat of making audiences genuinely care about relatively unknown Marvel characters.The humor in Guardians of the Galaxy is a tour de force. James Gunn's masterful direction infuses the film with witty dialogue, clever banter, and uproarious moments that consistently hit the mark. The comedic timing of the ensemble cast, led by the irrepressible Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, brings a lighthearted and enjoyable quality to the superhero genre. The film's ability to balance action with laugh-out-loud moments sets it apart, creating an immersive experience that keeps audiences engaged from the first frame to the last.The soundtrack, curated in the form of Peter Quill's ""Awesome Mix Vol. 1,"" is nothing short of iconic. The incorporation of '70s and '80s hits adds a nostalgic layer to the film, creating a unique sonic landscape that resonates with viewers. Tracks like ""Hooked on a Feeling"" and ""Come and Get Your Love"" not only enhance the on-screen action but also become synonymous with the characters themselves. The soundtrack's ability to evoke emotion and complement the narrative is a stroke of genius, making it an integral part of the Guardians' journey.What sets Guardians of the Galaxy apart is its ability to take relatively obscure Marvel characters and make them household names. The ensemble cast, including Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Diesel, brings these characters to life with charisma and depth. The film's narrative weaves individual arcs for each Guardian, making the audience genuinely care about their journeys, struggles, and eventual camaraderie. It's a testament to the storytelling prowess that turns these underdogs into beloved icons.Visually stunning and emotionally resonant, Guardians of the Galaxy transcends the superhero genre. It's a testament to the film's enduring impact that continues to resonate with audiences of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Really an overrated film....,"I am writing this review only to tell you all that this is one of the most overrated film on IMDb. Before watching the film I saw the rating on IMDb which kept my mouth open. 8+ rating?? Are you kidding me? The film is OK (CGI wise), but not a milestone or extra ordinary or blah blah.. Nothing new, not much punches, nothing to remember and disappointing end. It might be a fun ride for kids but not for collegians and adults. Batista is wasted in the film, Bradley Cooper's voice can not save the film, Chris Pratt seems to be childish and Zoe Saldana appears to be adjusted in between. Anyways, I did enjoy the film but not fully. Really not up to the mark. Great disappointment by Marvel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
8+ Really...I mean REALLY!?!?! Truly a horrible movie,"I've NEVER written a movie review.

It fit the time slot I needed and IMDb was 8+, how could this be bad, I thought!Spoiler alert, well, after the first scene in which the kids mom dies, which I thought at that point the movie had a chance, my hopes were dashed within the next few minutes and I knew that the next two hours were going to be pure agony and I was right. I was wondering if some of the glowing reviews were from people that had a stake in the movies success.Very poor story line, the aliens were all human like with subtle variances and it seemed to just drag on with predictable action and outcomes.

"Beginning, and ending was great, the middle.....","I must say, I was very very very very disappointed with this movie, however I am in no way saying it was that bad of a movie, honestly I have just become pretty tired of the marvel movies in general. I was really looking forward to this flick though. I think Chris Pratt is a great actor, who is really funny, but the jokes rarely were a hit for me with his character. They were just not funny, but that's just me. My main problem with this movie was Rocket. I really hated Rocket, and he ruined the movie for me. There, I said it, Rocket ruined the movie for me. I felt like he was supposed to be some tough guy, quick witted character, but came off as just some annoying rodent. I honestly feel like if Danny Mcbride could replace Bradley Cooper, and not do a bostonish type accent(thats what it seemed to me at least), and allow dialogue that would make the rating of the movie an R rating, the movie would have been much better. I know I am being picky, but rocket had that much of an effect on how I felt about this movie, which I feel rarely happens. Like I said, the movie started off great, then just fell off, maybe because I was really annoyed, but it ended really well. I will see the next one, hopefully Bradley Cooper will be replaced by Kenny Powers in the sequel :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Another Marvel Film,"Marvel's blockbuster formula has time and time again proved to generate massive mounds of money, so why change it? This is my primary problem with Guardians of the Galaxy. It follows the same formula of others in the Marvel cinematic universe but it fails to add it's own distinctive personality to the trade. While a lot of elements in 'Guardians' feel very polished; from the well-crafted action sequences to the witty dialog it cannot shake the overwhelming stale feeling left by the films the proceeded it. 'Guardians' just doesn't feel original.The story of Peter Quill and the formation of the other Guardians is predictable and full of typical blockbuster cliché's but this is not to say that it isn't fun. At times, the tale can be thrilling, and almost engrossing, but it all amounts to feel like I've seen this before. Many of the scenes feel directly ripped out of other films it resembles, and this results in the overwhelming feeling of deja vu.With all this said, Guardians of the Galaxy can be a lot of fun, just don't go in expecting something spectacularly original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A worthy introduction to the Guardians of the galaxy,"Guardians of the galaxy is one of my favourite MCU films and it got me into MCU.

The acting was very good especially from Chris Pratt (Star Lord), Michael Rooker (Youndu), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Racoon), Vin Diseal (Groot), who ever was Drax and Zoe (Gamora).No spoilers for any plot details but it is definitely an entertaining film.

Mistfit superheroes,"Guardians of the Galaxy's strength lies in its likable, well-rounded characters as well as swaggerish and unique attitude (not to mention the trendy nostalgic feeling). A bunch of misfits that are suddenly in charge of saving the Galaxy, that would sound like an overly rehashed theme, but somehow the result is an extremely vibrant and fresh movie. Action is visually clear and well balanced with storytelling and character development. Comedy is surprisingly fresh too and has different layers so that it could be appreciated by different kinds of viewers: we got both pure slapstick and many subtle, witty jokes as well.The only big problem here is the plot, which is your usual and predictable ""there is a stone that can lead to the end of the world. Heroes have to prevent it from falling in the wrong hands."" The bad guys lack any kind of personality and you won't make you feel anything at all. The fact that Thanos will get more space in future MCU movies is not a good excuse. He is just the classic villain sitting there, nothing is explained about him. Ronan surely has cool face painting but that's all you will remember about him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"An Awesome, Fun Space Adventure from Marvel Studios","Marvel Studios got smart with their Phase II films. The first phase was fun but I worried that I would reach a point of over-saturation where I might grow tired of their formula. Then they proved they had more tricks up their sleeve when they introduced the concept of incorporating other genres into the world of comic book films. THE WINTER SOLDIER was a political thriller and now GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a space adventure in the vein of the Star Wars films. When Marvel announced their Phase II series, I was the only one in my group of friends who got more excited for this film than the continuing adventures of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. No, I'd never heard of the Guardians before and that was probably what was most intriguing. It was something different. I immediately jumped on Wikipedia to get some idea as to what to expect and was quickly overwhelmed with the bizarre details of the characters and their cosmic adventures. I couldn't wait to see how it was handled on film. With the announcement of James Gunn as director, it solidified itself as my most anticipated film of 2014. In GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, we're introduced to Peter Quill (Christ Pratt). Quill was abducted from Earth as a child and has since led the life of an interstellar outlaw, referring to himself as Star-Lord. His most recent acquisition is a mysterious orb of unknown power that draws the attention of an infamous Kree fanatic, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan has been tasked with retrieving the orb and presenting it to Thanos, the major villain Marvel has been teasing since the end of THE AVENGERS in 2012. Quill's adventures lands him in an unstable alliance with fellow outcasts in an effort to keep the orb from Ronan's hands: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper).I almost feel as if GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is Marvel Studios' means of giving the finger to DC/Warner Bros. As much trouble as Warner has had in bringing DC comics successfully to the big screen, Marvel wanted to flaunt it's skills by making a movie featuring an anthropomorphic tree and talking raccoon as two of it's main characters. Regardless of their reasons, it worked and GUARDIANS skyrocketed to the top of my favorite Marvel movies to join the ranks of IRON MAN, IRON MAN 3 (yes, I liked it), and THE AVENGERS. James Gunn was an inspired choice for the job of directing the film and I knew from the time he was announced that this was a film to keep an eye on (I loved his 2010 film, SUPER). He brings an oddball humor to a film that needs it, where we're immersed in colorful aliens, strange new worlds, andI repeata talking raccoon. In the end, it was the characters that really made this movie as fun and effective as it is. The casting was top notch and every member of the cast understands the vibe of the movie and plays into it perfectly. Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for the role of Quill and his comedic timing really set the tone from the very start as Quill is dancing his way through some ancient ruins to the tune of Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"". Groot and Rocket were, of course, audience favorites because they were the oddest of an already out-there cast. Groot, a humanoid plant, acts as the muscle for Rocket in their bounty-hunting duo but, despite his size and strength, is a softie at heart. Rocket is the resident wise-cracker with an attitude more than large enough to compensate for his size. Zoe Saldana is her usual strong presence as Gamora, former assassin under the employment of Thanos and Ronan, but the real surprise for me was Bautista as Drax. I'll admit some of his dialogue comes across a little clunky but he had some great moments and was surprisingly good at giving his character some depth. With the exception of the Rock, I'm generally against pro-wrestlers turning mainstream actor but Bautista might be a new exception to the rule.The characters are certainly the strongest point in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY but they don't all get the chance for full development. Marvel has been notorious with an issue of under-developing its villains and Ronan is no different. He's got the look and he's got the attitude and Lee Pace gives a rage-fueled performance, but we don't learn much about him other than he's a Kree with a never-ending hatred for a race know as Xanderians. We get no further information as to why the Kree and Xanderians are at odds or why Ronan refuses to let go of his blood vendetta even after the two species agreed to a cease-fire. Ronan had the potential to be one of the coolest villains in the MCU but he's left one-dimensional. The same can be said for Korath the Pursuer (Djimon Hounsou). Hounsou is a phenomenal actor but he's pretty much wasted in his minor role as Ronan's enforcer. Nebula (Karen Gillan) is done slightly better. At least we get hints at her history (genetically and cybernetically modified by Thanos to be a killing machine) and her motivations (anger/revenge against Thanos and Gamora). Then there's the complaint of the pretty basic story. GUARDIANS relies on it's eccentric characters to keep the movie fun (which it does) and sacrifices plot, giving us the most basic of story lines we've come to expect from Marvel. The villain is trying to get an item, it can provide ultimate power, the heroes need to stop him. It's an unfortunate side-effect for any of these movies tying into the whole ""Infinity Gauntlet"" plot line running through the franchise. They're limited to repeating the same steps. Regardless of these flaws though, GUARDIANS is the some of the most fun I've had in a Marvel film and easily recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

It reminded me of the first Fantastic Four movies with better editing and a little better dialogue.While it's worth seeing I wouldn't give it ""Ranked #52 in the top 250"" here at IMDb.

The most entertaining MCU movie,"Guardians of the Galaxy follows a rag tag group of people as they join together with one thing in common, their hatred for Ronan. Ronan's goal is to control the galaxy and the thing he needs is currently held by the guardians.This movie is amazingly entertaining, not only is it an action adventure MCU movie it is a comedy. Every single joke lands and plenty will make you laugh out loud. It is easily the funniest MCU movie and it's not close. They do a great job of using their comedic ability to change the cliche.Chris Pratt is great as Star Lord not only is he the character we attach to emotionally but he is hilarious.Zoe Saldana is great as Gamora, her character has a really intriguing back story and it gives the movie another level of intrigue.My favourite character in this movie is Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper. Rocket is hilarious and has a really cool relationship with Groot. Bradley Cooper does an amazing job with the voice acting.Dave Bautista was surprisingly really good, his character Drax is really funny and that is because of Bautista's performance. Groot was a really fun side character and added some funny moments to the action scenes. All around great performances, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan just a really good group of actors.Since there are such a wide array of characters with different combat skills it made for some really entertaining action scenes.The Soundtrack is phenomenal, every song is a classic and fits very well with tone of this movie.Ronan was a very generic villain and the only issue I have with the movie. I don't think he is necessarily bad but he is just boring. That being said I do think Lee Pace had good performance.Overall Guardians of the Galaxy is the most entertaining MCU film.

Marvel's laboratories,"There was Forbidden Planet once upon a time, all about the journey to and mystique of discovering a new world in the stars. Then Star Wars. Inbetween these, Marvel seems to have cranked out a few hundred thousand panels populated with sundry worlds, mythologies, heroes, vast beings, demigods. So when time came to fashion their cinematic world in the stars, there was already a vast reservoir of Marvel myth on one side, cinematic ways to build worlds on the other. They have a few dozen people whose job is to keep threading this universe these days.The only one of those that appeals to me is the first Thor and now this a bit less. Two things they do well enough here, one is they chose a corner of their world that will be completely new to most of us but look how uniformly we're placed inside, in such a way as to feel it's a broader world with its own structures in motion. The motley group of heroes have spark. I see this as coherence that gestated for a long time on the page that the filmmakers had the luxury to mine; built on Star Wars.The second thing is that they poke fun at the usual grandiose Marvel world. They often try it but only Thor excelled in this; it was Branaugh poking fun at his own Shakespearean world. So in the middle of it here walks a slightly buffoonish guy abducted with his tape recorder from the 80s and sent to a world where powerful beings threaten to wreak planetary annihilation. (the Kree, the name reminiscent of Forbidden Planet)I like that we traverse a world and the charm that lets us parse movie vistas in the shoes of someone like us who would have known them as movies, it's pleasant to watch.

I Was Amazed! Must See!!,"I remember the first time I watched Guardians Of The Galaxy, I knew it was going to be something special with James Gunn at the helm. Everything about this movie was done in such a professional yet hilarious fashion that everyone involved was just incredible, they all played their parts so well. Chris Pratt as Star Lord, Dave Bautista as Drax, Zoe Saldaña as Gamora, Karen Gilligan as Nebula and the Family man Vin Diesel as Groot, oh and we cannot forget the aggressive companion to all.. Rocket!After discovering this film I started to look deeper into the history behind the story, I felt alot of this was very comic accurate which as a Marvel fan is a want but not a need, all my wants are no longer needed. It's an exceptional take on the story of the guardians, so much so you don't even need to read up on anything, just sit back and enjoy as I know I did.I'd highly recommend checking this out, I'd stick to MCU order if you're new but that's just me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another overrated movie,"I was never a huge fan of the Guardians of the Galaxy, unlike literally everyone walking this planet. I love every piece of comedy, music and visual art in this movie, but the villain and the world building is a bit sloppy. I like to watch the Guardians meet and interact. The prison scenes are all very fun and them bonding is such a joy and pleasure. There isn't much to dislike about this film, but also not too much to absolutely love. It's just a decent film. Although the ending battle was so hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What a Huge Waste of Time and Money,"As the movie started I was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes. I thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some non-serious music started to play, the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there. After that there was special effect after special effect. I love special effects, but it did sound like this movie was made ""only"" to showcase special effects such as explosions, explosions, explosions and did I forget to say explosions? The special effects were indeed magnificent, but it doesn't take long for you to realize it is all eye candy. It is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow. For everyone else, and by everyone else I mean adults with thinking brains, this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques. Surprise, surprise, special effects do not make up for a shallow, childish, and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature person's time.I loved the Ghost Rider, Thor, and the Amazing Spider-Man 2. Even The Avengers was tolerable, but this one was simply a mess. Designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie (Men in Black anyone?). One of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great, the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant. Remember how Thor had great colors in each and every scene? The colors actually went with one another. You don't see that here. A combination of light blue, orange, brown, grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene. It was a huge letdown. Next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art.In summary, this movie is not for adults. Take your kids to see it though. They will definitely love it, but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable, They'd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where it's really needed. Fighting Ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"""I am Groot"", is the embodiment of this film.","I found myself rewinding this a half-dozen times, just to follow the plot, and next, I found myself rewinding again just to soak in the music and the ambience. In other words, I could not follow this movie, because it was honestly THAT GOOD! Every nuance of these bizarre, yet engaging characters, the action, the music, the tone, the steady and witty dialogue, the humor, it was all too much for me to absorb in the natural flow of time.Star-Lord, Rocket, Gamorra, Groot, and Drax, are the most profoundly uncouth, yet cherished ""bunch of jackasses"" in the marvel galaxy, and I was curiously, ardently, and immediately devoted to this assorted group of misfits. Perhaps you will agree that the journey is more gratifying than the story itself; and yet the story itself is profoundly dynamic and complex.You will experience every emotion with this film. Do yourself a favor and see it as soon as possible, or re-watch it, and again, because it's better the second (or third) time. It's like a great Disney movie, it improves exponentially with each subsequent viewing.9.8 stars.I had been reluctant to see this movie after what i'd seen thus far in the MCU, because this seemed like an unnecessary detour down a dead end road. So I mustered what little motivation I had (after it was already on DVD) and decided to rent it on whatever platform at the time, (Redbox?). I had seen all the hype surrounding it, this was a sensation, a dark horse, or some sort of talk like that in the media. I was like, huh? I saw the previews, they seemed kinda weird, strange, comical, and frankly - silly. This was not what I was looking for in the next installment, especially after what were arguably two of my favorite movies of all time, just come out in the past couple years (Avengers, and Winter Soldier). We are talking about movies in the same ballpark as Return of the Jedi, The Wrath of Khan, Titanic, A Few Good Men, Aliens, The Terminator, and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. There was some really stiff competition in this group of titans.The throwback to all the great oldies from the 70's and 80's definitely transported me back to when I was a kid, and my parents had all these records. Each song, one after one, played during key scenes, was like a sentimental journey from age 4 to 15, and the prepubescent little boy inside me re-surfaced for a few hours.I was hit with reminiscence of movies like The Fifth Element, and even Galaxy Quest (for the humor), but this is Marvel all the way, and so much more than these. It evokes that ever so elusive thrill that only Marvel and few other movies can impart with the action sequences, the vastness of the setting, the depth of the plot, and the outstanding performances by the cast. Not to mention the stupendous special effects, and CGI which were second to none.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hilarious and the music is just FANTASTIC,"An absolute blast of a superhero space adventure that brings humor, heart, and a killer soundtrack to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here's my enthusiastic take on this cosmic gem:Directed by James Gunn, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" introduces us to a group of misfit and unconventional heroes, each with their own quirks and idiosyncrasies. We have Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt), aka Star-Lord, a snarky and charismatic space outlaw; Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), a skilled and deadly assassin seeking redemption; Drax the Destroyer (played by Dave Bautista), a powerful and literal-minded warrior seeking revenge; Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a genetically enhanced raccoon with a penchant for explosives and witty remarks; and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), a gentle giant with a limited vocabulary but a heart of gold.What makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" stand out is its perfect blend of humor, action, and heartwarming moments. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, infusing every scene with clever jokes and one-liners that keep you laughing throughout.The chemistry between the characters is electric, and their banter and interactions add a unique dynamic to the team. Despite their differences, they form an unlikely bond and become a dysfunctional family of sorts, united in their mission to save the galaxy.The film's soundtrack, featuring iconic '70s and '80s hits, is an integral part of the movie's charm. The music not only sets the tone but also becomes an essential part of Star-Lord's character, adding a nostalgic and fun element to the space adventure.Visually, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a feast for the eyes. The stunning and vibrant cosmic landscapes, along with the impressive visual effects, transport you to a galaxy far, far away, making the movie an immersive cinematic experience.The action sequences are exhilarating and well-choreographed, showcasing each character's unique abilities and combat styles.At its core, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a story of unlikely heroes coming together to fight for the greater good. It's about friendship, redemption, and finding family in the most unexpected places.This film is a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre, offering something different and unique. It doesn't rely solely on epic battles and superpowers; instead, it embraces humor, heart, and a sense of adventure that sets it apart from other superhero movies.So, if you're up for a fun and thrilling ride through the cosmos with a lovable group of misfit heroes, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is an absolute must-watch. It's a delightful and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that will leave you with a smile on your face and a desire to dance to some classic tunes.

Galactic Misfits Triumph: A Heartfelt Ode to the Oddities of the Universe,"In the cosmic sprawl of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" emerges as a rollicking ode to the misfits and outcasts of the galaxy. Director James Gunn orchestrates a symphony of irreverent humor, heart, and a tapestry of visual splendor that feels both familiar and fresh in the superhero genre.The film introduces us to Peter Quill, or Star-Lord, played with a roguish charm by Chris Pratt, who leads a band of intergalactic miscreants. There's the enigmatic and deadly Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the literal-minded Drax (Dave Bautista), whose deadpan delivery provides some of the film's most unexpected laughs, the sardonic and resourceful Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the gentle giant Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel), who speaks volumes with the simple phrase, ""I am Groot.""Together, they are less a team than a makeshift family, each member nursing their own wounds and grievances, yet finding common ground in their shared status as outsiders. The chemistry among the cast is palpable, lending credence to their unlikely camaraderie and elevating the film beyond its genre trappings.The visual effects are a feast for the senses, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring the farthest reaches of the galaxy to life. The action sequences are kinetic and thrilling, yet always clear and coherent, a testament to Gunn's deft handling of the material.The soundtrack, a mixtape of '70s and '80s hits that Quill clings to as his last connection to Earth, not only provides an emotional anchor but also underscores the film's themes of loss and longing. It's a brilliant narrative device that resonates on a deeply personal level.However, the film occasionally succumbs to the Marvel formula, with a villain who, despite Lee Pace's best efforts as Ronan the Accuser, feels underdeveloped and one-dimensional. The plot, while serviceable, sometimes takes a backseat to the spectacle and humor, leaving certain narrative threads feeling less than fully woven.Moreover, the film's reliance on quips and banter, though often delightful, can undercut the gravity of its more dramatic moments. The balance between levity and seriousness is a tricky one, and ""Guardians"" sometimes teeters on the edge of incongruity.Yet, these are minor quibbles in what is otherwise a triumphant addition to the superhero canon. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a testament to the power of storytelling that embraces the oddities and idiosyncrasies of its characters, creating a space where even a talking raccoon and a sentient tree can find their place among the stars.The film's heart lies in its affirmation of friendship and family, found not in shared blood but in shared battles. It's a message that resonates universally, and one that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" delivers with a sincerity that is as surprising as it is moving.In a cinematic landscape often dominated by cynicism and darkness, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" shines as a beacon of fun and wonder. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most profound truths can be found in the most unexpected places - and people. And isn't that, after all, what the best stories are all about?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Guardians of the Galaxy - Review by Arno Ramon - Entertaining, Slightly Comic, Cheeky & Developed","Guardians of the Galaxy is an entertaining movie. Fast paced, well-packed and full of SFX battle scenes, it makes it an enjoyable experience. The characters are well developed, which you would expect from a Marvel movie.The storyline is based on the retrieval of a mystical orb in far corners of the Universe. Different groups try to obtain this orb for various motives. Money, Power, Prestige or Greed are amongst them. If you're looking for deep philosophical insights, then you're in the wrong place. But the story is strong enough to keep you excited.Main actors Chris Pratt & Zoe Saldana have a bit of an alien romance going on, and actor Michael Rooker convinces as a universal black market salesman. On top of that Benicio Del Toro plays ""The Collector"" who treasures intriguing objects from around the universe. It made me wonder if he owns a stash of vinyl records.It has a resemblance to the remake of Star Trek which was released in 2009, where the ongoing battle between good & evil plays a central role and cheeky comedy makes you appreciate the characters.All factors considered, Guardians of the Galaxy is entertainment, and has a storyline that's not boring. But don't expect it to go under your skin, because it's not going to.Final Score : 7.2Thanks for watching,Arno Ramon",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Above average,"Far from a brilliant movie, it has enough to deliver, especially if you are a CGI fan. I did not dislike the movie but as it went on, I could almost guess what was going to happen. There is no real surprise. It would gain if it had a bit more depth. Intro, development and conclusion of the story are rather trivial. The characters will probably be more explored in the sequels since in this movie the spectators did not get to learn anything about their history (except for the main character of whom you get a glimpse). In my opinion, this is a more cheerful, hectic and colorful ""The Chronicles of Riddick"".Briefly, I would say :Awesome: - CGI; Average: - Actors; - Story; - Jokes; Awful: - Does not bring anything new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Love it.,"I'm 60 years old, and usually find superhero films completely boring and uninvolving, so why do I love the Guardians movies, what is it about them?For me I think it's they have a real heart, characters that develop and you actually care about, plus let's not forget the amazing humour, I think that's what really makes a difference for me. I actually laugh out loud multiple times.Plus let's not forget the actors who bring these characters to life they all do an amazing job and make them believable and likeable.Then there's the director, James Gunn who really seems to have a real talent, and fantastic music taste (he used my fave Norwegian glam rockers Wig Wam in Peacemaker!), with the music adding to the atmosphere in the Guardians movies.The first two are in my top 10 movies of all time, looking forward to the third.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Marvel Comics Creator Stan Lee Was Born on December 28th, 1922","Marvel took a huge gamble on this film when they began production back in 2013, with director James Gunn. It was gutsy going into the Marvel Comics closet and pulling out characters, that no one really knew about or remembered (unless you are a true die-hard Marvel fan), with the hopes of bringing the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the outer space section of Marvel Comics. This is something, that needs to happen eventually, in order for Marvel to complete its transition from page to screen, because many of their characters and universally historical plot-arcs, take place in outer space. This was a very brave move by the studio, because Marvel and James Gunn nailed it. What is really interesting about this achievement is the fact, that there might not have even been a ""Guardians"" movie made, if it hadn't been for the real-world reality, that Marvel couldn't make any X-Men or Fantastic Four movies, because FOX owned those film rights. So, by not having access to those characters, it helped ""Guardians"" get pushed to the forefront. So, Marvel gave the greenlight to start producing this film.Marvel took an obscure group of heroes, mostly considered second tier or even third tier characters and turned them into pop-culture icons overnight. It was quite a feat indeed. Chris Pratt, plays Peter Quill, aka: Star-Lord, a human, kidnapped from Earth as a kid, who ends up leading a band of criminals (turned anti-heroes, turned heroes), in a distant part of the galaxy. The beginning prologue to this film is done quite well by director James Gunn. It depicts, without giving anything away, a tragedy in young Peter's life, that spring-boards the plot, towards the reason why Peter was abducted by an alien, named Yondu (Michael Rooker). Gunn gives us an amazing set-up, for this story. You can feel the energy of this horrible tragedy affecting Peter. The scene is very powerful. Some may think it is too serious for a film, such as a comic book movie. However, this scene has a point and sets things up for what is ahead.Two and a half decades later, Peter, now calling himself Star-Lord, in a distant part of the galaxy, has become somewhat of a scoundrel and a thief. Yondu has managed to convince Peter, that he was rescued by Yondu and he is the closest thing to a father that Peter has. By pushing that thought at Peter all the time, Yondu is able to mold Peter into a scoundrel-thief journeyman of sorts. Peter helps Yondu steal anything and everything they can find in the cosmos. This brings us to the point when this film really begins to take off. Peter stumbles across a mysterious orb and is immediately attacked and chased by the bad guys. The evil Kree Empire is in dire need of getting that orb back, so their leader Ronan (Lee Pace), can use it for their evil purposes. Ronan has two warrior-sisters, daughters of the mad-titan Thanos (Josh Brolin), named Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana). He wants to send the sisters after Peter. Gamora wins the argument and begins her search for this so-called Star-Lord.As the film progresses, Peter meets Gamora and a rag-tag group of other ""Guardians"". They are interesting characters, such as, Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper), Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). This is probably Vin Diesel's best film ever, because he only has to voice-act and say, ""I am Groot"". Groot ends up being the headline fan-favorite character from this film. ""I am Groot"" is now a catch-phrase, that a lot of people use now. For my money however, the best work and best character over-all, comes from Bradley Cooper, the voice of Rocket Raccoon. Rocket is now one of my favorite Marvel characters, however back in the 1970s, I felt, reading about the exploits of this character in the comic books, the idea of a talking space racoon, seemed silly and ridiculous. This is another reason why James Gunn was so good at piecing together this film. With a talking raccoon and a talking plant, it all seemed to translate really well onto the big screen. It worked. It was convincing and now I love Rocket. Go Bradley Cooper! James Gunn's first venture was a big success. Parts of this film have already entrenched themselves into our popular culture, most notably, Star-Lord's Walkman playlist, that everybody wants to hear. This is a must-see film. It is always interesting, seeing virtually, unknown characters and plot ideas, thrive at the multiplexes. This film would make a killing at the box-office and win the hearts of critics and fans everywhere.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Rev of Guardians of the Galaxy,"We've all heard of them, most of us have seen at least one of them, and they are still being created. Marvel Movies: the cinematic series of this generation that includes a wide range of American superhero films. But let's take a look at a seemingly underrated film in the marvel series: ""Guardians of the Galaxy""- a bold and exciting new film that is not afraid to stray from the typical marvel movie expectations. This film, written and directed by James Gunn and released in 2014, is an exciting, humorous, action packed and heart-warming film that takes place in space and follows the life of main character Peter Quill. ""Guardians"" highlights the journey of 5 intergalactic misfits as they, brought together accidentally, pursue their eventual mission to save the universe.""Guardians"" is no doubt unique when compared to the Marvel films created before it. From its flowing humour, explosive fun, and action packed plot, this movie takes on an entirely new aura; the film bursts at the seams with color in its shift from Marvel's usual earthly setting to a galactic one. Additionally, it refreshingly includes visual, artistic and even plot influences from movies like ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"". The inclusivity of these influences and the interstellar scene changes give a special nod to the sci-fi fantasy world as a whole, providing us with moments and characters that can resonate with almost anyone. Visual effects go beyond scene changes, however. These are spot on when it comes to life-like animated characters, such as Groot and Rocket, all the way to the colorful backgrounds displayed in each differing landscape. Despite exquisite shooting methodologies and special effects, the music in this movie may be the thing that pulls you in. From the beginning scene up to the final moment, music plays an essential role in the wonders of this film. The 70's playlist that excitingly welcomes you in the opening scene, brings you along the adventures throughout the movie and is directly connected to Peter Quill's character, will leave you dancing and definitely looking the songs up when you leave.The characters' particularity and individuality is also something to note- not only are they each from different planets and are different species, their dialogue and personalities seem to be just what we needed in a Marvel movie. Not your expected heros, but a bunch of misfits that you'll love, and that will for sure leave you laughing at almost every interaction. With each actor included more magnificent than the one before, manifesting strong messages without the use of words, focusing on human touch, energy and mannerisms to explore a character, the emotional and soul-stirring levels are raw and exuberant. You will fall in love with each of these characters, played by incredible actors including Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, and the family that they grow to create.If you're not looking for an action packed, fight scene heavy, violent film, however, this movie may not be the movie for you. It adheres to those comic fans that don't desire another simplistic Disney movie. But for those looking for a clean, family-friendly film, the raunchier humor and consistent use of violence may lead you elsewhere.Despite its violent, edgier manner, this film has definitely gathered a large fanbase, as those that have dug deep into the world of Marvel have no doubt fallen into a deep appreciation for the beauty, humour, action and emotion that embodies this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A step down for Marvel,"Don't get me wrong, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has everything one might expect from a MCU (Marvel's Cinematic Universe) film - a bunch of superheroes fighting iconic villains, special effects explosion in the climax, an after credit scene and some other scenes here and there to show linkage between films in the franchise. This one also has nice warmth and has its heart at its right place unlike the more dark 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' but it fails to reach its levels in terms of direction and execution. I just felt like this film was trying to be too simple not quite taking it self seriously which some people may like but the script is neither innovative nor interesting.Chris Pratt plays ""Peter Quill""(aka Star-Lord) who is kind of professional thief. But when he steals an orb which we all later find out is much more than a normal orb all kinds of troubles step- in. On his adventures he is accompanied by Gamora(Zoe Saldana),Drax the Destroyer(Dave Batista) and two most-interesting characters; one called Rocket Raccoon (voiced-Bradley Cooper) who is genetically modified talking raccoon and another called Groot(voiced-Vin Diesel) a mysterious humanoid tree. Both groot and rocket are best friends and partners in bounty hunting, their pair is the best thing in the whole movie. Things get dangerous when our villain some Kree warrior Ronan pops up looking for the Orb and he is the weakest point of the movie. Ronan plans to destroy a planet Xandar and many other planets later using the orb in vengeance of death of as he says ""my father and his father before that"". Ronan just keeps repeating those lines whenever he is supposed to look dreadful which I just couldn't bear. His character was poorly developed which was setback for the whole film.Even though I was overall not happy and disappointed(as I high expectation looking at the reviews) still it has quite many positives going in favor. Special Effects, CGI wise very good but which film in these days doesn't satisfy that? Chris Pratt was quite cool as Star-Lord and his nostalgia for 80s music and dance was also pretty enjoyable. Gamora and Drax seemed a little bit odd but the make-up and styling for them was pretty good. Groot whose vocabulary is limited to ""I am Groot"" is lovable but its the Raccoon who steals the show with his witty and funny dialogues. Comedy wise the movie has lot to offer, I was laughing hard quite a lot many times thanks to rocket,groot,even the others sometime.The music and score was good. But all this was entangled in a weak plot and the story which follows. We have the same story where our heroes need to protect some dangerous item from falling into wrong hand,the bad guys then find it and just before use it for destruction they are stopped in a action-packed climax. I know most of marvel movies follow similar path but there is something new here and there but here I felt this was the weakest film of Phase 2.Another thing is the movie is being popularized by many as best sci- fi movie of all time and all. It was just a good action- adventure- comedy and the sci-fi elements in the film weren't properly developed thus I feel it barely falls into sci-fi genre. Many might enjoy it a lot, yes its nice popcorn flick it sit around and watch with friends or kids. For me, it was just one-time watch and slight disappointment looking at the hype of the movie. Still I would give it 6/10 (instead of 5/10) thanks Mr.Raccoon in there, he was one best characters I have seen this year.RATING:[3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"A space western comedy from Marvel. Weird combination, but it works","I remember, when I first saw the previews for Guardians of the Galaxy, thinking it looked like the dumbest movie ever, especially since two of the leads were a talking tree and a talking raccoon. To my surprise, when I actually watched it, it turned out to be a ton of fun. I get the feeling that Marvel knew this cast of characters was bizarre to the point of ludicrous, so they figured the best way to make the film work was to give in to the madness and make it as irreverent as possible. The humor hits every time, with endlessly quotable lines, great running jokes, and some hilarious individual moments, like when Peter randomly starts dancing in the middle of Ronan's big villain speech. On top of that, the story is well written and paced, the characters well established and developed, and it does a solid job of introducing the major threats of Thanos and the Infinity Stones.A good group of characters are no good unless they have a good cast of actors playing them. Thankfully, we get a really strong one here. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana may not be the world's greatest actors, despite constantly being cast in blockbuster franchises, but they give career best performances in this film, not to mention the sequels. Bradley Cooper meanwhile is excellent as always. Vin Diesel gives a ton of personality to a character that can literally only say three words. Dave Bautista is easily the funniest character in the film as the hilariously dumb Drax. And the rest of the cast is great too. All except one: Ronan, who's easily the worst villain in the MCU, at least among the movies. Personality? Non-existent. Design? Really goofy. Motivation? Super generic. Acting? Beyond hammy. About the only good thing I can say about him is at least he's competent.The effects have aged really well, considering the film turns ten this year. Rocket and Groot in particular are really impressive, as are the designs of Ronan's ship and the Knowwhere outpost. We get a fantastic soundtrack, which includes some classic old school songs like ""Come and Get Your Love"" and ""Hooked On A Feeling"". And while the action scenes aren't among the series' best, they are some of the most detailed and intricate and contain some of the best moments, like the Guardians' escape from prison and Yondu using his arrow.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy is one of a bunch of movies that prove the old adage that looks can be deceiving. It may look like a really silly film, but trust me. It's a lot smarter and more enjoyable than you may think. Sure, Volume 2 may be better, but the original still holds up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another great Marvel flick...,"It was funny, entertaining, emotional and action packed - just like all the other marvel films as of late, but I kept getting this nagging feeling I'd seen it all before. I also feel that it could've possibly benefitted from being a 15, as in places it felt hindered by the rating, but you know - why make a film better when you can make more money eh...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I am now a Guardian Fan forever,"I did not grow up reading comic books or even being a Marvel fan, so I knew nothing of any of the characters in this film before watching it. I must admit after being talked into watching this, I am now a Guardian of the Galaxy fan.
This movie although over 2 hours long kept me involved and wrapped up in the story-line every minute of my viewing. The vivid colors used to represent a galaxy or galaxies that don't exit and are very different than ours was outstanding. The method of used to create the bond between the characters was done so well I didn't realize the relationships were beginning until they wanted me to know.
The Soundtrack used in the movie is enough to make this kid of the 80's want to watch the movie again. The movie is action packed from start to finish yet has enough humor in it to make you constantly laugh. The special effects lighting and color pallet made me want to see the sequel.
I would recommend this movie to everyone who like action films, the story-line that is developed for us to watch is very good and the characters playing off each other is great.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good movie for teens if it weren't for the annoying music,"Some kid's mother is on her death bed. She gives him a gift. When she dies he runs out and is abducted by a spaceship.We meet Peter again in the present (future) on an abandoned planet, were he pulls an orb out of some holographic image. He calls himself a junker and an outlaw by the name of Starlord. Some bad guys show up who want the orb. He defeats them. We learn that some bad guy named Ronan was commissioned by some uber giant bad guy to get the orb at all costs. Now they put a bounty on Peter and Ronan sends some green girl to get the orb.As he's about to deliver the orb to the buyer on an earth-like planet, he runs into the green girl and a pair of bounty hunters--a talking raccoon and a walking tree.They are all jailed. Turns out everyone in jail wants to kill the green girl because she or her boss has murdered family members of all the inmates. Among them is an articulate steroid muscle. They all agree to work together to escape. They come up with a plan and indeed manage to escape of sorts. But turns out that muscle in his eagerness for revenge called Ronan somehow in order to confront and kill him. Ronan shows up, grabs the orb and kicks their behinds. Peter ends up grabbed by his mentor, the same guy who abducted him in his youth.Now they all have to work together to grab the orb, which contains an infinity stone so powerful that it can destroy galaxies, no less, and defeat Ronan before he can destroy the earth-like planet. Just how does Marvel manage to make dozens of movies with the same story? Guardians of the Galaxy is mild adventure movie for teens. It places more emphasis on story and emotions than on CGI carnage. But it's a bit too much, it's constantly trying to get the audience to shed a tear. I do appreciate though the moderation in hyperfast brain-frying CGI battles. What I don't appreciate is the constant loud obnoxious music blasted at full volume. I sure hope this isn't a return to the 90s fad when movie studios were more concerned in selling a lousy compilation CD than in making a good movie. I'm also a fan of the 70s and 80s and like some of the music of the time, but here they managed to collect the absolute worst songs of the era. If that weren't enough, there's the obligatory bombastic Wagner-ripped off orchestrated music. If some American lawyer ever convinced the Wagner estate to sue Hollywood studios for piracy and other related crimes, they'd make trillions.This movie is also quite funny as when Peter challenges Ronan to a ""dance-off"" during the climax. Guardians also looks pretty cool at times. They learned their lesson from Thor I. Audiences want to see cool, colorful cosmic sights.Casting is iffy. Pratt, Pace, and Gillan stand out. Saldana and Rooker are awful. Cooper, Diesel (?), Close, del Toro are unnecessary. Why not give a chance to new or newish actors, instead of throwing even more money at these multi-millionaries whose contributions to this movie are questionable at best.For the intended teen audience, Guardians is a recommendable movie. Despite the silliness of it all, it doesn't treat the audience as complete morons. The movie handles language well, not vile but even articulate at times--always a good thing to foment in young people. The fact that this movie turned out so well while directed and written by people with virtually no experience, and this is becoming a strange trend lately, shows that all the fuzz about ""The Director"" is completely overblown. Clearly the way movies are made these days makes the role of the director far less important and it looks like it doesn't take a lot to direct a movie. That's not to take away Gunn's writing skills, which are also rather surprising.It's an alright movie for older audiences as well, but I have to say that the oversaturaturation of the movie market with Marvel movies about the destruction of the universe is starting to get a bit too much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Yes this is a well made flick no one really asked for.,"I did know previously about Rocket Racoon. But after watching this flick see he's part of a Marvel superhero team, the Guardians of the Galaxy.We have Peter Quill/Starlord, a well armed galactic warrior.Gamora, a green skinned alien babe stepdaughter of Thanos who soon aids him.Rocket who is badass and voiced by Bradley Cooper.Groot, a sentient tree like creature that has a limited vocabulary.And, Drax, a big burly fella portrayed by former wrestler Batista.And such an awesome ultimate foe to deal with.

"Its Good, But Not A Masterpiece","The Movie is good, but not a masterpiece like some critics are giving it. Chris Pratt is really good in this movie and steals the show, but between the too much Eagerness, for the film, this movie is not as great as some people make it out to be. Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon, and Vin Diesel as Groot the movie is very well done, just like Iron Man this movie is good, just not a master piece. Like other films are like The Dark Knight (2008) or Ben-Hur (1959) is those are 10/10, so i'm surprised that this movie critics are giving 9/10, 10/10. The Length of the movie, is a little too long, for this sci-fi comic book adventure, but that is not much of a problem. Zoe Saldana, is OK in this movie though, but that is not much of a Problem for this movie.Acting 7/10, Special Effects 9/10, Length 5/10, Accuracy 9/10Total 7/10 GOOD!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Go All The Way.,"With the conclusion for the Guardians about to arrive at the cinema, it seemed like a natural time to revisit the first two films and see how I feel about them. The original ""Guardians"" I've seen a few times, so was very familiar with it, I did watch the IMAX version for the first time though and it's still a fun, funny and visually impressive time.Having decided to keep a score for himself, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) an Earthling who has been offworld since he was youngster, has a bounty placed on his head by The Ravagers, the crew he's been with. Unbeknownst to him, the item he's stolen is an infinity stone, which Ronan The Accuser (Lee Pace) has been tasked with finding for Thanos (Josh Brolin). He despatches Gamora (Zoe Saldana) daughter of Thanos to recover the stone, but Gamora has already decided that her father must never take possession of it.Interestingly, I did perhaps find the film less funny this time, than I have previously. That might be because humour is the aspect that loses the most effectiveness with rewatching and I just remember the funny bits, above the rest. Some of it does feel a little flatter than it did though - ""Dance off, bro"". From an action standpoint it's better than I remember with the final space battle in particularly being far more visually interesting than I remember.There are parts of the film that I didn't remember featuring, such as Rocket's bemoaning his existence, that I think might well feature in the 3rd film, based on what I've read. I almost forgot what this version of Groot was like, seeing on how we'd come to see both Baby and Teenage Groot in later films. I also like that the film has a number of British TV star cameos, which you do get when they film at Elsetree, in particularly for this film, Ophelia Lovibond, Emmett Scanlan and Peter Serafinowicz. There's also talk of Celestials, and you see one, who looks remarkably like the calcified head sticking out of the Earth now, in the Collectors story.Whilst I don't think that it touches the very upper echelons of the MCU's best film - it's a really really strong one and this probably won't be the last time I watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Did I just see the same movie as everyone else?,"This movie is average at best. Don't understand the hype it is getting. Lead character lacks charisma or screen presence and comes across as a real prude. I was interested more in Racoon and Groot and would have liked to see an origin story for them rather than the lead actor. The plot and script are extremely threadbare. The jokes are not funny and characters look bland while trying to be cool. Not much is explained for any character and motivations, just a small line here and there. This lead to me not rooting for anyone. The suspense never really builds even with such high stakes as future of a planet and subsequently the whole galaxy. In the course of events, an important character supposedly died and had no impact on me whatsoever. If only juvenile humour and special effects make a film for you, go and watch, otherwise go with very tampered expectations!!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
my film review,"The film ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" features a few notable actors, such as Chris Pratt (Peter Quill), Vin Diesel (Groot), and Dave Bautista (Drax). Our noble galaxy defenders form one of the most unorthodox teams you have ever seen to save the world from its impending doom. This team that starts as a bunch of strangers brings us one of the most dysfunctional but hilarious teams of heroes we have seen on the big screen.The overall theme of this movie is all about friendships. In this film, we see a team of strangers build a bond over their time together. We see them go from fighting one another to eventually putting their lives on the line for each other, in order to complete the task at hand. We see Peter Quill sometimes struggle to keep his new crew together, but ultimately, he finds ways to make them fight together and not at one another.This film reminds me a lot of the Avengers movies. The plots and themes of both movies are very similar at times. We see teams formed of people that, at first, seem like they could never work together, but hard times and significant challenges, help to grow our teams to where we see friendship and love for one another.The filmmakers used a few excellent techniques in this film so that we could see our team coming together. At times in the movie, we see the filmmakers use fast cuts so that we can see multiple people in just a few seconds. We can see numerous angles that mix close-ups and full-screen room shots in just a short amount of time. This helps the viewer know how the team works together in a few of their fight scenes. These techniques allow us to see the team fighting for the ultimate goal, not individual wins, but a win for their entire team.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Bit overrated, but worth a watch","As you have already noticed I don't think this movie is the best I've ever seen. But that doesn't mean that I think it's the worst I've ever seen. Chris Pratt performs pretty decent as Peter Quill, or ""Star- Lord"", with his cheeky attitude and, sometimes, funny moments. Peter Quill teams up with Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot, after certain more or less unfortunate circumstances, in hope of stopping the evil villain (too cheesy?) Ronan The Accuser. Underway they run into problems in different location, such as a prison escape. The aesthetics in the movie is quite good. The CGI is pretty good and the motion capture of Groot, Rocket and so on is really well done.

Entertaining flick that borrows elements from other sci-fi crew movies,"There seems to be a lot of hype going for this movie. I personally thought it was a good movie, but also thought it was a bit overrated. Some even claim this is the best Marvel movie so far...I have to disagree with that one. However this combines well developed character for a movie of this sort, that is incorporated well into the comic book, story-wise. This movie actually give all the main character in the crew to shine, which just doesn't applies to a lot of movies of this sort *cough* ""The Expendables"". So when it comes down to it the build up of the main team and how they get together and become a team is done well and I actually was interested in all the members of the crew, especially when it came to Rocket and Peter Quill. The action sequences are done well, nothing that I found to be groundbreaking, but it didn't seem mindless like ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"". Overall this is entertaining flick that combines elements from other sci-fi movies that deals with crew members and it's done well. Overall this is a good popcorn flick that is worth checking out.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unforgettable,"Going through every single piece of MCU movie, show, and even one-shots... in order. While Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and The Avengers is epic, and I had a blast watching all of them, none of them come close to Guardians of the Galaxy. Guardians of the Galaxy have such a unique vibe, that makes them stand out. I have watched most, if not all of the MCU shows and movies over the years here and there, but all of them have been very forgettable, excluding Guardians of the Galaxy. In Guardians of the Galaxy I remembered every scene and dialogue despite only having watched it once in what feels like a decade ago. But as I watched Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers... I only remembered a couple of scenes in each movie.

Setup is familiar, but with impeccable casting, flippant dialogue, superior special effects, a rocking soundtrack, and enthralling action scenes, it pays back in spades. Non-comic aficionados may be completely unfamiliar with the characters and see this as a thinly veiled hybrid of the Avengers, Star Trek, and Star Wars, but the finished product is just so much fun to watch that it really doesn't matter. A worthy, memorable, and distinctive addition to the Marvel universe. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Nothing overtly memorable here with the exception of the 80's soundtrack,"Call me old fashioned but I just didn't get the hype surrounding Guardians of the Galaxy.

A Good Intro to the Guardians,"When I first saw the film I had mixed feelings. I came to the conclusion that I love these characters so much it's hard for me to see them portrayed differently than how they should be (appearance-wise and personality-wise). I remember having the same feeling after seeing The Incredible Hulk the first time (Hulk is my absolute favorite) but luckily after a good night's rest and a long introspective solitary car ride I was able to get past it.I saw it (Guardians) again the next day and loved it more. I think the film did the best possible job of introducing these characters to the largest audience possible and accomplishing financial success.That being said I wish Drax and Gamora would have had more intensity in their performances. I loved the intensity in Nebula and Ronan although I thought both characters were wasted to a degree (Ronan should not have been defeated so easily and certainly not killed). I really wanted more of Nebula and Ronan, exploring the motivations behind Ronan's fanaticism (making him feel more three dimensional and believable). Wanted more of the Collector too (another waste of a great actor). Thanos too lacked the dark menace I wanted to see (he just didn't feel as epic nor as evil as he could have). Yondu's Yakka Arrow was brilliantly realized but he himself was barely a shade of who the character should be.Loved Rocket and Groot! Star Lord was funny but not the character I wanted more of. I understand why the film goes overboard on the humor. If you can get an audience laughing you can get them to go along with just about anything you want (and for a story as crazy as the Guardians it was a sure fire way of ensuring success with such a questionable property). But Marvel has got to start ratcheting up the tension. A story that requires the Guardians of the Galaxy should be one of universal peril, something that dwarfs the stakes that any earthbound hero deals with. And when you are introducing someone as dark as Thanos things need to feel dire. Ronan is a serious threat but the movie treats him almost like a cartoon character (again I understand why, it's a kid's movie for god's sake) but still- there's a line between doing what it takes to be successful and doing a story justice. The film seemed streamlined the hell out of (which is great for today's A.D.D. audiences but does little to create any real substance).I hope Marvel has shaken all the laughing out of their systems and we finally get another dire epic like Captain America 2. Let's hope Avengers 2 is more serious. All in all I do really enjoy the film. It didn't have the ""Wow Effect"" on me like Cap 2 or Avengers but I did seriously enjoy it more the second time after the disappointment wore off. I think (hope) it is one of those films that gets better the more I watch it.My hopes for Guardians 2: I hope they take it more seriously. I hope Gamora gets her gold circles around her eyes and shows her truly deadly side. Lose about 70% of Drax's scars/tattoos and amp up his intensity. More Nebula (I loved Karen Gillan's performance). With Thanos being in cahoots with Death let's bring back Ronan for another ride and flesh him out (Lee Pace is too good to just throw away). Increase the threat and darkness surrounding Thanos's character (make him feel scary as hell). What about the Collector's other Infinity Gem? Where the hell is that? More Collector. Soon Marvel needs to start laying the groundwork for either Captain Mar-Vell or Adam Warlock (the only men able to defeat Thanos). The Guardians need to start recruiting real power players in the next film (either Warlock, Mar-Vell, Nova ((Richard Rider)), or Quasar). And make Groot more gnarly.Either the above requests or give us Kang The Conquerer and introduce us to the Guardians of the Galaxy from the year 3014 (the originals) and bring us a united front of both teams of Guardians (including the REAL Yondu) together to take down Kang. I'd love that! Sorry to ramble on for so long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I've Played Video Games That Make Better Movies Than This Stinker,"I was absolutely amazed by ""Guardians of the Galaxy""....amazed at how bad it was after hearing how wonderful it was.People in all seriousness are discussing whether or not this film is the new generation's ""Star Wars."" Have the people who are discussing this even seen ""Star Wars?"" They must be thirteen years old.Indeed, thirteen year olds and younger are the only demographic I can possibly imagine liking this film. It struggles to achieve the same sense of whimsy and humor that infused the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, the Indiana Jones movies and even more recent super hero films (see ""Hellboy II"" for a film that perfects it). But it fails miserably, mostly because the cast doesn't have the talent or the chemistry to pull it off. Chris Pratt creates a vacuum at the film's center -- he doesn't have the screen presence or charisma to carry it. And he's surrounded by a film that just starts in the middle of a dumb story, as if everyone coming to see it is already an expert on this particular series, even though it's one of the most totally obscure of any of the superhero stories. And the action sequences are a frenetic muddle made worse by the 3D. When the biggest asset in your live action film is a CGI talking raccoon, you know you're in trouble.Seriously, I am a big fan of the Ratchet and Clank video game series, which this movie put me in mind of, but R&C (a video game!!) has more humor and narrative cohesion than this film.Grade: D+",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy has viewers Hooked on a Feeling,"Esteemed director James Gunn began to form his reputation of creating modern classics by directing and co-writing Guardians of the Galaxy, utilizing all the action, sci-fi, and humor diehard Marvel fans adore. Gunn creates another epitome of Marvel by utilizing spectacular special effects, a strong plot, and an amazing soundtrack of masterpieces all ages can enjoy countless times.
Guardians of the Galaxy follows the life of a human, Peter (Star-Lord) Quill as he transforms from a bounty hunter caring only about his next paycheck to a hero with emotions, fighting for the good of the multiverse.
Peter Quill was born on Earth in 1988, and after his mother's death, he was taken in by a bounty hunter named Yondu, who quickly became a father figure for Quill. Growing up with a ruthless pack of bounty hunters shaped an unapologetic and apathetic life for young Quill, who quickly turned to follow in the steps of Yondo, joining him in becoming a fellow bounty hunter. While searching for an orb worth a small fortune, Quill discovers its true power and value, and decides it is necessary to keep it from falling into the hands of the powerful Ronan the Accuser. Similar to many Marvel classics, Star-Lord needs to band together with unexpected friends along his journey as he attempts the impossible while blasting 70's rock through his cassette player with distinct orange headphones.
Gunn provides fans with an outstanding film that grossed over $700,000,000 worldwide, by utilizing his happy-go-lucky sense of humor, amazing casting and a carefully compiled soundtrack that brings the atmosphere classic rock into modern films. Gunn demonstrates this dynamic combination from the very beginning, where Star-Lord can be seen dancing goofily while fighting small dog-like creatures to ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. Combined, these characteristics tie together an appealing film that can be admired by everyone.
A marvel movie wouldn't seem adequate without roles being filled by big actors, and James Gunn exceeded those expectations. Big names like Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper fill the roles of key characters, adding to the appeal of this goofy action-packed film.
Perhaps the most well respected aspect of Guardians of the Galaxy is the admired discography. The soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy is considered one of the greatest soundtracks in a film, placed amongst other classics like Black Panther, Almost Famous, and Grease. Star-Lord carries the last memory of his mother, a cassette tape titled ""Awesome Mix"", with him at all times. This tape contains numerous well known tunes from the late 60's and 70's, and these songs formed the soundtrack for the film. Gunn uses these songs to contribute to the mood created in multiple scenes. For example, when planning and arming the team for his attack, Gunn uses the song ""Cherry Bomb"" by the Runaways. The lyrics and music to this song create the tension, anticipation and excitement that Starlord was feeling during that moment.
Every film has room for improvement, and this one is no exception. The carefully placed stylistic additions can be concealed by the constant action and violence persists throughout the movie. Like most Marvel films, action is the main priority, so plot and character development can sometimes be lost in the conflict.
Through the entire film, James Gunn helps create yet another perfect example on how Marvel continues to meet and exceed viewers expectations. Each cast member and song was carefully selected, and combined they create a beautiful example of how modern action films can still be calculated works of art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Easily one of Marvel's best,"Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the best films in the MCU that proves how much potential these films have and what they're capable off when that potential is fully realised (doesn't hurt that they actually let director James Gunn do what he wants). Taking C-list characters and making them instant standouts with a funny, action packed and heartfelt film about overcoming trauma through friendship and shared pain.Chris Pratt leads as Peter Quill and makes him a loveable loser with plenty going on below the charming surface. Zoe Saldaña is effortlessly confident and capable as the smartest and most sensible Guardian of the bunch. Dave Bautista is really good at comedy here with Drax's inability to gauge metaphors but still imbues him with a visible sense of loss.Rounding the core Guardians is Bradley Cooper as Rocket, hilariously insulting everyone throughout but the standout moments come from his inability to tolerate his own existence which are heartbreaking. Lee Pace as Ronan isn't a particularly strong villain but he's used sparingly and consistently feels like a genuine threat.James Gunn's direction is incredible, its actually insane how much more personal, stylised and alive this film feels compared to everything surrounding it in the greater universe. The action set pieces in particular are genuinely thrilling and clever in their construction, which is particularly impressive when factoring in the huge leap in budget between this and Gunn's previous work.The music by Tyler Bates is excellent, it's so heroic and epic without ever feeling generic, instead offering something iconic and instantly recognisable. The soundtrack is also a huge standout, full of superb song choices all utilised at the right moment with a strong emotional connection to the core of the film (something many of its impersonators forget).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Beautiful film, great action, but zero drama.","I watched this on New Years eve and I decided to interrupt my Twilight Zone marathon for a few hours so I could see this. I found myself yawning quite a bit, but I kept watching because the beautiful cinematography. I gave this film a 6 based on it's stunning production values. The sets, the makeup, the art direction, the CGI, the costumes, etc. Besides all this, I thought that film lacked in plot.

the worst Marvel Crap ever made,"GUARDIANS OF THE CRAPLAXY It's been a while since I gave a comment about movies. Usually when I do, it's because the movie was extremely awesome or annoyingly full of cow dung. I went into the theater without any idea what guardian of the galaxy had in store. Sometimes a movie is more enjoyable when u don't know any synopsis at all. So that is what I did. All I knew was that it had a good number of positive reviews and IMDb had given it at least an 8. Most of the time when IMDb reviewers give a movie an 8 u know the movie is gonna be awesome.and nothing can or could go wrong. RIGHT????  HOW WRONG, I MEAN HOW VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY WRONG I WAS. Please if u r someone with a functioning brain I implore you not to go watch this garbage. Allow me to be the messiah when it comes to this movie. Take it that I have gone to sacrifice my cash and time for u to stay away and just download it if u can.and even that make sure u download it from a place that is sharing free Wi-Fi. Why do u ax? Why am I blasting this movie with so much ammo you ax? It's simple. Nowhere, ie weather in reality or fiction can a bunch of people always save a complex situation without coming out unscathed. Also I don't even know if the movie is a comedy or a thriller or action. It tries woefully to emulate all 3 to no success. I AM GONNA END HERE or I will go on and on. And I am trying hard not to give away spoilers. BUT LET NO ONE SAY I NEVER WARNED THEM. Ps: there are 2 sure fire ways to watch it without having any regrets. 1. Going to watch it with a lady friend that you wanna score, and 2. When you are high on weed.

A Salsa of Comedy with amazing action and visuals.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 is a Marvel Superhero movie directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper as Rocket andVin Diesel as Groot.This movie is different from other Marvel movies which is filled up with Action, Comedy and eye appealing visuals. Credit should be given to the team to recreate the magic of the Marvel series.Acting is great, screenplay is similar to all the previous Marvel movies although but comedy and that too good comedy is been added to the screenplay, In my opinion Bradley Cooper stole the show with his voice of Rocket and great comic timings. Background music is always strong aspect of Marvel movies and there is no exception in this movie also.The Support cast of the movie such as Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close and Benicio del Toro were equally impressive.I Really enjoyed this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Truly an overrated blockbuster.,"This movie WAS entertaining, I'll give it that. But it proves Hollywood is at a new low. Every single thing nowadays is either a sequel, superhero, a remake, or a rip off. Guardians of the Galaxy just supports this fact. Marvel uses their least selling comic book in a cash grab so appreciated it makes my head spin. Filled with lines so cheesy you need crackers, this movie is stealing your wallets one by one. James Gunn also should be mentioned. He attempts to help this cash grab by filling it with references to better movies. Half the people who've seen this only like it because of the soundtrack. I just wish people could see this is nothing new, it steals from the cult classic , short lived television series ""Firefly"".

This Marvel gamble pays off more often than not.,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is, without a doubt, the weakest Marvel Studios film yet. But it's also the most charming. It suffers because of its very simple origin story. The reasons why many people overlooked this are its likable characters, sweet retro soundtrack (the songs Come And Get Your Love by Redbone and Go All The Way by Raspberries are featured at the beginning), comedy, and impressive visuals. It's really like a colorful lollipop. Once you're done with it though there's not much to return to. Sure, people liked it when Footloose (1984) was mentioned. The whole audience laughed in the theater where I watched the film. The performances by the cast are all good. Even the supporting characters are played well, reminiscent of Maximiliano Hernandez's excellent part as Jasper Sitwell in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Among the heroes it's Dave Bautista who steals the show as the angry yet honorable Drax the Destroyer. The interesting minor touches that he brought to his performance reminded me of the way Dwayne Johnson acts in some of his roles. And Bautista's bits of comedy are some of the most effective and intelligent in the film. I think that Chris Pratt was chosen to play Star-Lord because of his looks. His performance is still good though and it's clear that he's trying, sometimes seeming forced but effective. Screenwriters James Gunn and Nicole Perlman attempted to give every character time to develop, so even Groot (Vin Diesel) gets to show that he's not just houseplant/muscle by the end of the film. The raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) is another well-realized CGI creation. Rocket's uneasy life and his origin made him heartless and hard to get along with, though he is the technical wizard of the team. As Gamora, Zoe Saldana isn't really the tough female character that she says she is. But she did participate in most of the action, and her performance is one of the best in the film. Lee Pace plays the main villain, Ronan the Accuser, a character that I think was tragically underused. Along with Bautista and Saldana, Pace provides the best performance in the film. This doesn't mean much, however, because Ronan has little to do and little to say. He hardly participates in the action, something that's really unforgivable for a villain in a superhero summer blockbuster. And this brings me to another problem that I have with this film. There's a lack of thrilling action. Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers the comedy and the characterization but the action is a disappointment, comprising mostly of chases. Even the predictably big final battle offers few thrills. After the action-packed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians Of The Galaxy seems tamed in comparison. Because of this I don't have an urge to see Guardians Of The Galaxy again. Despite the convoluted plot I commend director James Gunn for what he's done. It's definitely a film worth seeing because it brings something fresh to the scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A really fun space opera,"One night in 1988 Peter Quinn's mother dies and then he is abducted by aliens... not a great day. Twenty six years later he is roaming the galaxy as a thief known, if only to himself, as Star Lord. He steals a mysterious orb and soon everybody is after him; some because there is a bounty on his head others because there are those who want the orb for the power it holds. The soon crosses paths with bounty hunters Rocket and Groot; a genetically engineered racoon-like being and a walking tree, and Gamora, an attractive green woman who is after the orb. They are all arrested and while in jail form an unlikely partnership; they are joined by a fifth member, Drax, who wants revenge against Ronan, the being who murdered his family. They manage to escape but there troubles are far from over; Ronan wants the orb as it holds the power to destroy those he opposes. Few people they approach can be trusted and much of the time they don't trust each other... it will be a miracle if they can save each other let alone the galaxy!When I saw that this was a Marvel film I initially thought it might be yet another superhero film; it isn't. Instead we get a space opera which is full of action, humour and some fine lead characters. It may not be quite as high camp as 'The Fifth Element' or 'Jupiter Ascending' it is in that ballpark with over-the-top villains and exotic aliens. The plot might not provide too many surprises but it does give exciting scene after exciting scene. The characters are great; I particularly liked Groot; despite his very limited vocabulary. The cast does a fine job; this includes those we see and those who provide the voices for the animated characters. The special effects are top notch; they make the animated characters fit seamlessly into the live action and provide spectacular backdrops to impressive action. The use of music from the '60s and '70s was fun and nicely justified by the fact that Quinn had a tape of his mother's favourite music... of course the idea that he could play it for over twenty years without it being chewed up is perhaps the most unlikely part of the film! Overall I'd say this is a really fun sci-fi romp that can be enjoyed by anybody who enjoys the genre but doesn't take it too seriously.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Silly? Yes. Entertaining? Yes!,"""So here we are: a thief, two thugs, an assassin and a maniac. But we're not going to stand by as evil wipes out the galaxy. I guess we're stuck together, partners."" Peter Quill (Chris Pratt)Quill, the thief among the ""Guardians"" pretty much sums up the rag- tag heroes of the summer's entertaining sci-fi spoof—even if you don't take my word, believe that with several hundred million dollars of tickets, the box office champ is funny. With its tongue firmly placed in its cheek, Guardians of the Galaxy is an amusing, lighthearted take on just about any space opera you have seen, Star Wars being the touchstone for characters and laughs.It's the same-as-always wacky mission for these societal rejects— save the galaxy and they save their reputations and themselves from jail time. Quill leads four misfits: Gamora (Zoe Saldana—she is sinfully attractive!), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper as a raccoon), Groot (Voice of Vin Diesel as a tree and sinfully underused), and Drax (Dave Bautista at his bulked best).The plot is so convoluted you'd need some of the computer power behind the graphics to make sense of it. But coherence is not the point— this is a summer fantasy better than most because it doesn't take itself seriously.The smart dialogue may be best expressed in this exchange:Gamora: ""And Quill... Your ship is filthy.""Peter Quill: ""She has no idea. If I had a blacklight, this place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.""Does that mean it's superficial? Absolutely. Silly? You bet.

Better than John Carter of Mars,"Marvel delivers entertainment, special effects and usually a boatload of action. But with the relative success of Pacific Rim, (and as memory dims on John Carter) Marvel/Disney is probably wondering if it's property is sometimes a bit of a trap.I understand that in the franchise world, a one off film with new characters is a ridiculous risk, and this probably accounts for why the film is so very conservative in nature. The film trades the usual minor philosophical dilemma for fairly weak humour.It is a well trodden journey in familiar surroundings, at least told with panache and great visual effects. But I must say, there is something impressive about the rendition of a tree and a raccoon, and in fact all around the effects are pushing the bounds of what we've seen before.Very entertaining, but urgently forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

However, there should be a certain sense of seriousness when you are dealing with a plot as dark and sinister as this one.

We left the theater.   It was that bad. (Spoilers),"The first five minutes of Guardians of the Galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun, creative, and quirky ride. Then after 10-15 minutes went by I couldn't help but feel I've seen this EXACT movie before. I had. It was a film entitled Raiders of the Lost Ark. You may of heard of it. If you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film. So they updated it with a LOT of CGI and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now. Of course pepper in a cameo with Stan Lee right? The movie gets worst from there on out. The CGI is over the top, the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them. One minute they are trying to kill each other (or not kill each other for some reason... why put him in a bag? I don't get it. Just take the orb). Then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 20-30 minute CGI jack fest that looks just like another film. This time they decided to duplicate Star Wars Episode II (not a good film to replicate). A space chase with CGI only Lucas could love. Ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects. Your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film. You might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well. This leaves us a little later on with Peter Quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established. Matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him. Sure. Cue more CGI and miraculous healing a minute later to his face.... after all he isn't mortal is he? Or is he? There is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him. They have a prison suit that fits a 2' tall raccoon (who doesn't know what a raccoon is even though he speaks English) but not a prison suit that fits a 8' tree. I think this was a case of the CGI department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent. The tree has a case of the Hodors but not unlike Chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences. Except with Chewbacca we could infer Solo was guesstimating what Chewy was saying and having fun with it. This is not the case. The raccoon actually understands everything. The film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it. We took their cue ten minutes later (the person I was with kept looking at me like... really??) and left as well. The film was an obnoxious capitalistic CGI jack fest that had no story (that wasn't stolen from three other high grossing films), no character development, and no creativity. To give you an example of how uncreative it is, after ripping off the entire intro to Raiders of the Lost Ark the director (I assume) tried to pull a song from the Reservoir Dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film. In this case ""Hooked on a Feeling"" was used. When? When the characters were entering prison of course, why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison. Contrast this with the brilliant work of Tarantino's use of the same song in Reservoir Dogs. It's like the director never saw Reservoir Dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film. What happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? It just disappeared midway thru the film and didn't return til later. They had to have the Episode II CGI jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene. I could go on from there about how bad this movie was but I would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes. Maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition DVD (at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions) I might just do that. Until then I'll cross my fingers and hope JJ can save the Holy Trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye. It's no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for Episode IV.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

They're cleverly written to please the viewer a brain-resting title that makes you feel accomplished, part of something bigger and, most of all, doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. I wasn't dying to watch Guardians of the Galaxy for two reasons: I didn't know about that specific Marvel group of heroes and the marketing image built around it gave me the feeling that it wasn't for me. Something changed, several people made positive comments about it therefore I watched it. I was pretty excited at the idea of another brain-resting enjoyable marvel film (you know where I'm going here). The all film was a disappointment. Chris Pratt didn't get the sympathy he was desperately looking for with his melancholic mix tape. Rocket the raccoon tried to lift the humor of the film with few quite amusing episodes, but overall he also didn't make me want to care. Neytiri.. oh no, I meant...

I felt I spent two hours watching at the desperate attempts of the cast of getting my attention, when I could really only focus and enjoy on Vin Diesel's brilliant performance. I don't know if it was a poor script or if James Gunn didn't feel as inspired with this cast as with Sarah Michelle Gellar and friends.

About as good as you're going to get from the MCU,"'Guardians of the Galaxy' is about as good as the MCU gets in my opinion. It's not a particularly great or memorable film, but it's at least interesting enough to keep your attention for two hours with a few laughs along the way. James Gunn and Taika Waititi seem to be the only ones that understand that if you are extremely limited in how safely you have to tell a story, you can at least add some humour into the mix to make it watchable.It's strange seeing the humour in this movie actually. There are definitely some decent laughs, but we know how funny Gunn can be when given a free license. You can tell how restricted he is by the PG-13 rating. I know we'll never get it, but an R rated 'Guardians of the Galaxy' would be a lot of fun.The film has a decent villain. His story or motives aren't very interesting, but at least he seems reasonably menacing. The music is good and the pacing is decent.

It shouldn't work - but it does (and how),"It really shouldn't work: a sci-fi, super-hero movie with an utterly bizarre set of five characters - the guardians of the title. There's Quill (Chris Pratt), the only human, an Indiana Jones/Hans Solo type with a devil-may-care attitude to all danger; next up we have Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a green-skinned woman with special martial skills who seems to have wandered in from the set of ""Avatar""; then there's Drax (Dave Bautista) with huge muscles, multi-coloured skin and a habit of taking comments literally; even more outrageously we have Groot (Vin Diesel in motion-capture), a tree - yes, a tree - with lots of branches but only a three-word vocabulary (remind you of Chewbacca?); and finally - my favourite - there's a talking raccoon with attitude called Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), a little fella with some BIG guns.And yet, work it does - but how? Well, visually it's an absolute treat - different worlds, buildings, vehicles and weapons, the magic of deep space, and lots and lots of colour. I saw the film in 3D on an IMAX screen and it sucked me in. Plot-wise, it's all a bit confusing - lots of complicated names and something to do with a mysterious metal orb - but the whole thing zings along so speedily, it just doesn't matter. Perhaps, above all, it is quite simply fun - it is a rollicking escapade with lots of humorous one-liners and funny situations.

Star-movie,"The first of the sequence Guardians of Galaxy delivered a different construction of characters than Marvel is used to. Also, creates an atmosphere the complements Marvel's universe and discusses some social/political aspects. Technically, there is no flaws in the screenplay, acting, direction or especial effects, contributing for a whole well-executed cinematography.
The highest point of the movie is the construction of the personas. All the characters are constructed following the line of a group. The development of its real personalities are centered on their role as group. This is different than what Marvel does with Avengers, for example: every heroes is someone and they together are the Avengers. This great way of construct characters, made Guardians of Galaxy follow and discuss the sentimentalism of them and the sense of the group (this last one can be one of the social critiques).
The social/political discuss can be generalized in some questions: what is evolution, as we think?, what comes with power?, what conservationism, masked by tradition, can bring?, etc. Every scene of the movie is a little discrete social/political/cultural critique , shown in a light and clear way (as Marvel loves to do).

Less is definitely more,"I just watch the movie in theater recently and it was OK. Yup, you don't want your movie to be 'ok', at least 'bad' define something. What the movie lacks are concentration and structures. The story is largely interesting with every characters have their own struggles and unique identities. However, the way the movie portrays them is very predictable and somehow a bit juvenile. The animation values are very visible here that they make it less realistic and approachable. Some of the comedies are quite hilarious but a bit predictable and too much. Comedy doesn't have to be loud. Those flaws just make the movie lacks tension and seriousness. Most of it is trying to appeal the mass audience with those commercial values.What I'm suggesting they should do for the next installment is they should find the focus and strongly hold to it while attaining some commercial values that are needed in this type of movie. It is understandable that they try to grasp as many audience as they can because this is the first one. However, audiences are getting smarter these days that they can see if there is inauthenticity values in a movie.

So I shouldn't criticize all the nonsense because it has a more complex and broad scenario than other marvel movies just like Thor.I obviously didn't like most of the action scenes, it seemed simple to me, the effects are great but the one-on-one fight scenes did not satisfy me. Especially I found the prison break scenes very simple, I did not understand how the crew was quickly uniting and trusting each other but of course, it could be because the movie is 2 hours long and they want to get to the main topic quickly.Finally, I think this movie was a transition movie. They will bring marvel characters like Iron Man and Captain America living around the world to the galaxies and I think a movie enough for the transition was just my expectation, I didn't like it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Boredom,"The trailer looked incredibly stupid but I went anyway for the positive reviews. For the duration I couldn't shake the fact that everything I was seeing I had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer. GOTG lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s (from which it took most of the scenes). Mid showing I walked out to make a phone call. I almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story, character, wit, or creativity that the first half utterly lacked. Fortunately I saw it alone so I didn't have to deal with the social pressure to stay. If you see this, then I would recommend the early matinée discount.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Redeems Marvel!,"By this point in the Marvel Universe I'd really lost interest units predictable and boring plot. Captain America, IronMan and Thor were not doing it for me. I remember giving up on the franchise altogether at this point. That is until Guardians of the Galaxy. The first time I watched it, it seemed so new and such a change for Marvel. Although watching it a second time in the context of Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther and End Game (even Ant-man and Doctor Strange) it just seemed like the new normal. It didn't seem so new and outrageous.This movie helped to bring my interest back in the whole Marvel movies altogether. The strength of this movie is its supporting cast. I think all the previous Marvel movies had strong lead actors, this is even more true with Chris Pratt. But they always had such average supporting actors. They were boring, one dimensional and took away from the story rather than contributing to it. Guardians however, has an excellent cast. It goes from strength to strength with the wity humour, logical and clear motivations, character development and emotional investment. I actually care about these characters. Unlike Thors b team of friends.Guardians other strengths are definitely its villains that move outside of shield or Hydra. Man shield is so lame. And its use of music.Right from the start the music sets the tone of what you're in for and it feels so fresh and different. Its light hearted and anything but cheesy.It also moves the overarching plot along with some relevant clues towards Thanos and his motivations.Guardians is a great movie and redeems everything that marvel should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Futuristic Action Movie with Comedy,"I am new to the newer phases of Marvel movies and hadn't checked this series out. It was not until this past week that I hopped onto Disney plus. I gave this movie a shot and I am pleased to say that I am thankful that I watched it. Very good acting and has a lovely cast of actors (many of my favorites) This movie has a lot of action and jokes spun in. The special effects are awesome. James Gun is a great director. I highly recommend this movie and those of the series to anyone who likes action, comedy, and futuristic approaches. Can't wait to see volume 3 today. The storyline is very fun to follow as a group of misfits somehow come together to form a party (guardians of the Galaxy). Each brandishing their own quips and skills. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A perfect universe,"I really liked this movie. I loved the vibes , characters,jokes and specially rocket . I really enjoyed it & for sure iam watching it again. Just one point i didn't like that every second someone of them was going to die but they help him in the end except what happened with groot but it didn't ruin my enjoyment. And iI reallyyyy liked how rocket turned some cliché moments to funny moments that i really enjoyed like when they were telling peter that they are joining him in the plan even if they died and other moments... I highly recommend this movie it was so enjoyable, Funny and you can easy get attached to any character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Comedy and Decent Action make this worth a trip,"What would you think if you saw a raccoon, a walking tree, a scarred wrestler, a green skinned woman, and a lazy intergalactic thief? To the general public, you would probably think this was the stupidest and most ridiculous idea to be put into your head. However, to those that are fans of comic book lore, it sets you on a path to excitement as Marvel's latest creation is released into the theaters. Yet this late in the summer does the superhero flick still have the same spark, or have we been served a lackluster filler until the next Avengers film releases next year? Read on to find out.Let us start this review with saying that Guardians of the Galaxy will not disappoint. The incredibly fictional team of anthropomorphic aliens brings a lot of diverse aspects to a series that has been rather consistent over the last few years. Stepping away from the heroic images of rock hard abs and blaring percussion music, the protagonists in this film are your run of the mill vagabonds of the galaxy. This fresh hero image is hilarious, and sets the stage for the humor that fills this movie. That's right you heard me, Guardians is filled to the brim with laughs of all kinds using the ridiculous character designs as a foundation to make you scream out in delight. In particular is the raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper), whose wild, enigmatic edge comes out in full force. Rocket is a feisty little cyborg animal, whose pent up rage leaves him with a short fuse that leads to explosions of cursing and well timed insults that are so amusing coming out of a little animal. Cooper does a great job with his voice acting, using the right balance of emotions to give us laughs and yet not overdo it to get annoying. This may also be because of the character design, but the casting made the right call getting the talented man the role of the raccoon.Yet the furry little rodent isn't the only source of humor in this movie, but the rest of the cast provides some other quips and treats. Chris Pratt is the same egotistical idiot he plays so well, though this time trades his mindless, dribbling shouting for some well-written dialog. Zoe Saldana is the femme fatale, whose gorgeous looks guide the group along the adventure. While not the funniest of the bunch, Saldana's acting is spot on, and her character plays off the others to provide some awkward relationships and a few zings that had me chuckle. The large and in charge assassin Drax (Dave Bautista) is surprisingly funny, mostly due to his literal take on every single thing the rest of the crew say. Combine that with well timed execution of his lines and you have a good mixture of fun, though his action scenes are surprisingly lacking and simple. Even Vin Diesel's animated avatar Groot has some laughs, despite saying five words the entire movie. Like an infant, Groot tends to put himself in situations that are harmful, often relying on others to bail him out and apologize with his catch phrase ""I am Groot"" that while simple, is again delivered at just the right times. Yet as the adventure continues, the lovable tree alien does many other things that will have you laughing, many of which I don't wish to reveal to avoid ruining the movie.My preceding paragraphs state that this movie has a lot of humor, but what about the action. In truth, Guardians of the Galaxy is not as much hard hitting, fist slamming, mystic weapon slinging that we've seen in the past. No Guardians instead puts a bit less slashing and more laser blasting explosions into the mix, allowing for an adventure that feels like part Marvel, part Star Wars, and part Independence Day. Many movie fans will be picking up references from Star Wars over the course of the movie, with tweaks to the scenes here and there to avoid copyright infringement. While this may lack some originality, the creation team did a nice job balancing the action with the comedy, giving us just enough fighting to quench our thirst before an exciting conclusion. Well exciting for the most part anyway, the ship-to- ship battles were my particular favorite, and the infiltration scene was rather good. Unfortunately some of the epic build up fails and becomes anticlimactic fighting that was merely an attempt to get their money's worth. In particular, the villain Ronan (Lee Pace) was not that threatening, but more so a pompous windbag who merely spoke loud and carried a big stick. Sure he had a menacing glare, but he spoke more than he acted and had little skills in the art of fighting, especially when you compare the size of him to Drax. Maybe that was the point; maybe the lack of edge was to go with the comedic theme of this film. Yet it was still a little disappointing to me, though the ending did make up for it.Despite the lack of seriously threatening villains, Guardians of the Galaxy was well worth the wait. The blend of comedy with action is incredibly entertaining, and the cast of characters bounces their styles off one another to keep you laughing with a well-written dialog. Add in the nostalgia of geeky science fiction and retro movies and you have a fun adventure to fill the superhero gap from this summer. Of course there is some dark and mature themes in this movie, especially with some of the cursing, but this movie should be okay for kids as well. So go have some laughs, enjoy the special effects and make sure to stay after the credits for another classic scene. My scores for this flick are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
They call themselves the Guardians of the Galaxy,"Guardians of the Galaxy is an iconic superhero movie for a reason. This movie brings the humor, heart, and action that we've already seen from the MCU, but done in a way that is true to James Gunn.The Avengers took time to establish an iconic team of heroes over the course of several films, but this movie does a great job with making us care for each member without having multiple films to do it. The actual story is not complicated at all. You have a mad titan who needs a power source to rule the universe, and you have a ragtag team of misfits who are trying to stop him from doing so. That's It! There's nothing I can say that hasn't already, but I can say if you are looking for space filled Adventure Sci-Fi Epic with emotional character depths, brilliant comedic moments, heart pounding action, and an amazing soundtrack, I HIGHLY recommend this. Well done Marvel, and James Gunn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Marred by a poor quality new version on DVD, among other things.","Technical issues should not be a significant factor in watching a movie. They were when I watched a new copy of this film on DVD-it jammed there times in an otherwise functioning DVD player. The film is good-on the big screen-but its sometimes very dense visual field will not translate well onto the smaller screen unless of course someone has a very large TV at home. This also probably represents the best of what Marvel comics had to offer. When I was younger I was familiar with all the different comics and most of them were not very appealing-which would be most of the Marvel comics-since they were often drawn in an overly stylish way that was like using a visual language of 'artistic clichés' which was not very creative. For a decade at least there has been a massive amount of attention expended in turning Marvel comics into movies-and very little has been seen from the other comic book creator-DC comics-which was generally thought of as having the better artwork, compared to Marvel comics. This is a fun film but its success will probably only spur more adaptations of the other essentially repetitive and dull comics that Marvel churned out month after month for years on end. It is as if someone thinks that comic adaptations are always good for adult viewing also as if nurturing a never-ending childhood should be the goal of the entertainment industry. Since most of this subject matter is movies with a significant amount of violence in them that should concern adults. It should not be that kids are growing up with all violent movies and adults should not also be expected to always enjoy watching that kind of thing also-as if they were children as well, when they are not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A Crazy, Epic, Space Adventure","I saw Guardians yesterday on an early screening. You had to sign up in order to win tickets online, so most of the audience was fans like me. The atmosphere during the movie was amazing. I have laughed more than in most comedy films I have seen in my life, the visuals were better and more beautiful than in any other marvel movie and I had a tear in my eye once or twice! Thought the plot isn't new (team up, save the day!), the movie still manages to have a very different take on the superhero/Sci-Fi genre. This is thanks to the music and sometimes crazy, sometimes heartwarming characters that form the Guardians of the Galaxy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Def the funniest MCU movie so far,So honestly I don't think this movie is my cup of tea I can sit and acknowledge it's still pretty good and can say I still enjoyed watching it but tbh it was kinda whatever except for the fact that it was definitely the movie that got the most chuckles out of me thus far in the MCU and rocket is just iconic lmao just a lot of things rocket did were great he's definitely my mvp of this movie part of what kept me hooked don't think I'd be as big of a fan without him. I think I'd like groot more if it wasn't obvious that they were just trying to make him a mascot but whatever and the other three are whatever drax is kinda annoying gamora is whatever and I do like star lord then the villain and everything honestly just felt like set up for the future maybe I'd feel different watching this in the past without movies like infinity war and end game but they do exist and that's how I feel about this.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An atrocious waste of time,"I had more or less low expectations for this film, but after being semi-forced to watch the whole thing (social obligations), I was met with the unfortunate end of ""Low"".The film had some interesting and novel ideas to play around with (a bandit raccoon and a walking tree? Perfect!), but the word that constantly came to mind while making it through to the end was ""Overdone"". Too much action (yes, I said it), paper-thin characters, a plot that made absolutely no sense at all, and weak attempts at humor - the combination of all these left me checking the time every few minutes waiting for the all-too-predictable ending to be over.Oh, and a constant irritation (at least to me), was the ""soundtrack"" -- songs from the 70's which grated on my nerves. I guess they were trying to be ""original"", or something.Simplify the plot, develop the characters a bit more, work up some *good* actions (not just random explosions and bits moving about) and there might have been something here to hold my interest. Unfortunately I'm not a teenage boy who might think all this overkill is a-w-e-s-o-m-e, but I was bored within 30 minutes.Sorry - I wanted to like it, but it didn't happen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My first review. And I want it to be for this movie,"I walked out of the theater feeling the same way I did back in 2012 after seeing The Avengers. This movie is enough to bring out your inner 9 year old alter ego and Make You Cry Tears Of Joy. The film was very Action packed. It was a simple plot, but at the same time I felt overwhelmed with all these characters, action and effects.And yes It was still pretty easy to keep up with. And yes Marvel played very safe while launching into its cosmic universe and it seems to be worked out really well.Every member of the Guardians line-up got the right amount of screen time. if you think that Talking space raccoon and a Giant talking tree won't work on a big screen then you are going to feel so wrong after watching this movie as these two were really terrific throughout. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is pretty bad ass. Drax the destroyer is very true to its name. And Yes Peter Quill aka star lord is going to be our new tony stark as Chris Pratt is true show stealer.So, for those who have hang-ups about how you don't want to hear its better or more popular than this or that, don't get caught up in that nonsense. Who cares where people rank The GOTG or Iron Man or The Dark Knight or what have you? It doesn't matter. So, just do yourselves the favor of seeing this movie. It is just a boatload of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Fun, campy and wildly entertaining. One of the best Marvel films to date.","Guardians of the Galaxy plays out like Star Wars on crack, its fast, ferocious and a badass entertaining thrill ride throughout. Following a rag tag group of intergalactic criminals, Guardians has the plot line of a Star Wars film, the characters of a Dirty Harry film and the action of every Marvel movie combined. What makes this film stand out from the rest of the Marvel films is that it engages you knowing that you have absolutely no idea who or what the hell this is. It does a great job filling you in with information from the comic and it makes for an enjoyable watch. Unlike the fans of the comic, I had no knowledge of Guardians of the Galaxy and walking out of it, it really educates you on anything you may have missed out on all while giving proper character growth and development without heavily relying on the comic books as ""common knowledge"". Chris Pratt is awesome in this film, he reminds me a lot of Indiana Jones in space. He's a wise cracking, ass kicking criminal that can beat with his words or his fists (more times than not, its his fists). Dave Batista, Zoe Saldana, Michael Rooker, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper along with Pratt gives Guardians of the Galaxy a better cast than Avengers. The film comes at you like a bullet train thats about to derail, you're always engaged with these characters despite most of them being an alien, a talking tree or a talking raccoon. The film is really amazing in that you look at these characters and the ridiculousness of the situation and still don't even question it. Now there are some plot holes that will more than likely be cleared up the Marvel way, meaning down the line something will happen to patch up a couple holes here and there. While that may prove to be lazy writing, I think Marvel films have now earned the right to do whatever the hell they want. Guardians of the Galaxy is a great comic book film and this is coming from someone who was so apprehensive about seeing this film that I almost didn't go. This is a surprising, entertaining, gut busting thrill ride that is impossible to disappoint especially to fans of the Marvel universe and franchises. But even if a superhero movie isn't your thing, I'm confident enough to say that you'll have a great time seeing this movie. It is that good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unexpectedly stellar: perfect blend of comedy and action with a wonderful cast.,"Guardians of the Galaxy: So much better than I initially anticipated. After first preview I knew I'd see it, but wasn't expecting much. WAY exceeded expectations. The overall tone was unique, and perfect: very funny with the right amount of action/drama. An oddball pairing of characters that works very well w/ a stellar cast.I went into this movie without any knowledge of the story line and it does a great job of telling everyone's story, getting you up to speed and then it takes off immediately.

Best movie I've seen this year!!,"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy is proportionately perfect with the amount of laughter, action, and even emotional content. The film's mischievous misfits presented great chemistry along with its dynamic supporting cast. With plenty of CGI/special effects to be captivated by it also makes a strong case in being in its own realm separate from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's heroes and heroines and makes for a very promising film to close out the summer. My expectations were high and yet it not only met them it exceeded them. The tone throughout is pitch perfect. It is amazing to see how efficiently we were introduced to so many layered characters and yet the movie never lags. The visuals were stunning and by the end, I felt something I hadn't felt in years, the desire to get in line and see it all over again. I can't wait to know more about their adventures that I even went right to the source material and began reading. Bravo. Rather than the comparisons to the Avengers as some have made, I saw the story more closely related to the arc in Star Wars. 30-40 years from now the kids in the theater today will likely have the warm fuzzy I get when recalling SW when they think of GOTG.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hooked on a Feeling.,"Guardians of the Galaxy is hands down Marvel's early surprise Christmas gift. This movie had a spark and potential to be a one of a kind, yet once again Marvel handled it wonderfully.It starts off with Peter Quill as his journey to steal a certain orb for the bounty, this leads to him meeting a ragtag of misfits, they team up to prevent the orb getting in to the wrong hands.It seemed like a very ordinary story and I felt divided about this movie at first. I tried reading a couple Guardians comics and they had wonderful story lines, although these did not stop me from worrying about what the movie may turn out to. It turns out I was very, very wrong.Guardians of the Galaxy is special, it's one of a kind and a very fun movie. Just like the previous Marvel movie (Captain America 2). This one had a simple plot, but a great execution. The specialness of this movie starts with the heroes. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel and even Batista!! Were perfectly cast for their roles. They were very enjoyable to see on screen even when some of them are all CGI. For me Christ Pratt and Bradley Cooper and even Vin Diesel as a talking tree all stole the show! And since this is a Marvel movie, I have to mention how the action was very very excellent. The action scenes reminded me a lot about Star Wars and Star Trek. The action was very exciting and thrilling as well, it will be sure to bring the inner childishness of anyone who'll watch it. Another great thing about this movie is that it is NOT SERIOUS in a very good way. A technique Marvel has been using through out the years and proved to be successful. Although, other people have been saying that the villains are the low parts of this movie. However, this I do not all agree with. Ronan was a good villain. He was menacing, formidable and frightening. As for Nebula, she was only quite good. The main focus of this movie was the heroes, so the villains were put secondary and for that I did not mind.If I were asked where I would place this in the ranking of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, I would put this on #2. Following the Avengers at #3 and Captian America 2 at #1.With a special and one of a kind team, extremely funny humor and great emotional moments, great visuals filled with thrilling and exciting action, a fun and enjoyable 2 hours. And did I mention the awesome 70s - 80s soundtrack?Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel's huge and hilarious big middle finger to DC's ""serious"" tone and proves that superhero movies do not need to be ""serious"" to be good.So, your move DC.Verdict: 8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the best movies ever,"Coming into this movie I didn't know what to expect. Other then the trailers which looked great, it could have been another superhero movie mess like the ""Green Lantern"" (2011), and while ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) was good, it was fairly forgettable.Now this movie was pure awesomeness!An excellent movie all around, very entertaining. In particular being around in the 70's and 80's and a lover of cinema, I loved all the music and little movie references.For the first time in a while I was lost in a movie, loosing sense of time, just enjoying it for what it was.Everything about it excellent, from the story to production, etc. Well done for all those that were involved with it's production!Go see it ASAP!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The best entry in Marvel's Phase Two,"Marvel likes to take risks hiring fresh directors for its big projects. James Gunn, who has only directed two movies and written a few movies including Scooby-Doo, was tasked to bring bunch of misfits to life. The risks are James Gunn, who does not have a lot of credits, and the source material, which is not very well-known to general audience. Fortunately, James has proved people wrong, he could indeed direct a fast-paced entertaining and witty action thrill ride.The story: By now, general audience and fans should know the formula of every Marvel movie. Guardians of the Galaxy does not change much in that aspect. But what makes it stand out from the others is that these heroes are almost like anti-heroes. In the start, they are not heroic or morally right. They are sort of selfish and only think for their own good. However, further in the movie, they begin to help each other and form a team know as Guardians of the Galaxy. It could draw comparison with The Avengers. In The Avengers, the heroes have to learn how to work with each other. James Gunn does not bother to add long dramatic speeches or poetic dialogues to develop the characters. Instead, he blows things up to let the characters bond with each other. There are lots of action. In fact, it is one of Marvel's most action-packed movies. Right from the start, it is packed with fast-paced explosive action. The CGI works with the action scenes. Rocket and Groot are two neatly animated characters. The rest of the characters are just as entertaining. The villains may not have a lot of things to do except growling in their heavy make-ups and showing bits of their powers. Music by Tyler Bates is good especially in some tender moments.Overall: Guardians of the Galaxy may have a formulaic story but it has heart. Surprisingly it is touching at times. It has all what a blockbuster should have; thrilling action, great CGI, epic music. Marvel is confident that this will do well that it has announced a sequel. With this just as the first adventure, I would surely like to see more adventures as they face more challenges.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Packed with action & amusement. A must see - coming from a non science fiction fan!!!!,Call me small minded but I wasn't holding out much hope on this film when my boyfriend dragged me to the cinema to see it. This was mainly because I do not like science fiction or anything that is not remotely realistic. But boy was I wrong. I came out of the cinema smiling and it turned out i enjoyed the film more than my boyfriend(just). The mix of action and comedy teamed with emotion made it the perfect mix in my opinion. The characters work so well together and it was truly a pleasure to watch and the way they played it had me hanging on the whole time(which for me is not easy!)

Chris Pratt's best 😍,"The film tells the story of a team on an alien planet. They are known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. They are united in prison to protect a stone. After that we get a great visual experience. Chris Pratt and Groot seemed to perform well. Vin Diesel's voice sounded amazing. The absence of a good screenplay is to be mentioned. The rest of the character creation didn't seem that great either. However, Guardians of the Galaxy is an above average watchable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A surprising treat that I""m happy to say works.","I remember watching the trailers for James Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and scratching my head in confusion. A science fiction comedy set in the comic book world of Marvel's Avengers? It didn't add up to me along with the 1960s-70s soundtrack. However, all of these different things add up to make one of the best summer blockbusters of the year.With a script co-written by Nicole Perlman, Gunn introduces us to a new part of the Marvel's Avengers universe with Chris Pratt leading the group as Peter Quill, who likes to call himself Star Lord. Pratt is great as Quill. He's able to do everything in this role, from the action scenes to dramatic moments to dancing on a strange planet.Pratt is joined with a green Zoe Saldana as the assassin Gamora, the very literal and muscular Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), the ferocious and hilarious raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the simple tree creature Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Although they are visual effects, Cooper and Diesel are great as the scene stealing duo. They always come in at the right moment and have the right thing thing to say or do. All these characters have some loss that defines them. Gunn does a great job of combining that pain with laughter and making these characters feel real.Perlman and Gunn's script is quirky and action packed. They follow a comic book movie formula, but always add a little twist to complement the strange and fun characters we follow. It's nice to see a big budget movie like this play around with itself. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" feels like Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead."" It's great for its genre, but also adds great, witty humor to it.Tyler Bates does a good job with the score, but its the 60s and 70s songs that you'll remember. The songs work so well and help give the film its edge. It seems odd at first, but they fit right in. Ben Davis' cinematography is epic and colorful. He gets to work with many colors with the backdrop of space behind him. The visual effects are also top notch. It's a very good looking film.You don't necessarily have to watch the other Marvel's Avengers film in order to understand this one. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a very new part to this universe. The films that would help a little are both the Thor films and Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers."" There are little things that hint at these films.Gunn's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a fun film that delivers both laughs and blockbuster action. It can be wacky and strange at times, but it's a really good film that keeps you engaged. Everything that I thought would go wrong for this film actually worked. It's a nice surprise for the end of this summer that is worth treating yourself to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A rare Marvel Misstep,"When I walked into my local movie theater to watch Guardians of the Galaxy I was sure Marvel Studios was incapable of making a bad film. How ever after leaving the film I am worried for Marvel's future projects. But now the good stuff: Chris Pratt leads a star- studded cast with charisma and style, Vin Diesel delivers a surprising emotional performance as Groot a tree with a three word vocabulary (I am Groot.). The rest of the guardians give good performances with Dave Bautista as the mumbly mound of muscle known as Drax giving the movie some of its best lines. IE: Bautista: when did we decide that? Pratt: Like 3 Seconds ago!!!. Bautista: I wasn't listening I was thinking of something else. Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana round out the Guardians and the last of the decent performances. The supporting cast is not strong with weak performances from Lee Pace as the Kree villain Ronan the accuser, Karen Gillian as his henchwoman Nebula, And John C. Reilly as a Nova Corps officer who's name I have forget ton already. Another problem is the internal logic. People should suffocate in space. Nope.

Better than I could ever imagine,"I will admit, I was a bit cautious of Guardians of the Galaxy a couple years ago when Marvel announced it. I've read the books, they aren't bad, but are they Marvel Cinema worthy? Sure. But would people who had never picked up a comic get it and want to see it? Pics was afraid the answer would be no. Boy was I wrong. I've seen it 4 times and it's passed the ""no up front knowledge"" test with my family seeing it and living it. And having a fun soundtrack didn't hurt at all. The more I watch it the more I think it's the Best Marvel Movie to date. While Captain America The Winter Soldier was fantastic, the surprise humor of this movie made it my new favorite. Plus Rocket Raccoon and Groot stole the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The award for the best summer hit goes to ...,"Guardians of the Galaxy !!!Okay, so when I went to the Harkins theatres I didn't even know what this movie was about or what to expect, since I'm not a Marvel geek. However, I always loved movies taking place in the galaxy and stuff like that, so I went to see GOTG.One word : Phenomenal! Absolutely amazing. It's been such a long time, since I had so much fun watching a movie. The first scenes were pretty sad and moving, but after that .. It was a super fun ride. This movie is packed with action and comedy. I've got to say there was not a single moment that I would get bored.10/10 is my rating, because that's how much I LOVED it . Definitely the best movie for the summer of 2014. I absolutely recommend it to everyone !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Go see this movie ,if you love Star Wars","First let me say after the quirky trailer i wasn't sure I wanted to see it at the movies. It just looked campy and dumb,man how misleading it was. This movie is absolutely fantastic, it reminds me of the first time i saw star wars so many years ago. That sense of wonder and excitement from new worlds being brought to life for my eyes. I love this movie and the characters he has given us are exciting and new. I enjoyed Gunns previous films and how offbeat they were. He has lost none of that here.The visuals are stunning and I wonder how he pulled off a Lucas worthy effects film in such short time. Every character is deserving of being there and delivers. The film knows when not to take itself too seriously and when to revel in it. I have not seen a group of characters come together like this since Han Solo and the crew. Even though the characters are very different that chemistry is there again. In fact the Guardians could well exist in that medium. Unlike the last Thor movie the bad guy here is memorable and striking on screen. The supporting characters are an interesting mix but never lingered on to long. In Short this film has all the right stuff and should absolutely be seen in the theater first.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
silly and somewhat childish but rather funny sci-fi comedy adventure.,"This movie is more of a comedy than anything else. It is truly a comic magazine brought to life on the big screen and more focused on delivering a sequence of action scenes and laughs than anything intelligent in the form of plot or characters. I would say it is a movie for the younger audience and comic fans. Having said that I must admit that I found it rather fun to watch.The main characters are two mostly irresponsible rascals, one dumb but likable living tree and two fanatics of which one certainly need not apply to the Mensa club. Of the five I liked Rocket and Gamora the best. Rocket is a rather likable rascal and Gamora is simply cool. Quill is sometimes just silly, Groot is more of a living prop and Drax is just too stupid.The story is more or less just there to tie the scenes together. Unfortunately we do really not get much of a background to the Guardians of The Galaxy universe. It would have been nice to get a bit more understanding of why things are as they are etc. The return of this movie is watching the action, the special effects and the laughs. It is an action-adventure-comedy plain and simple. If you approach it as such it works reasonably well.Speaking of special effects, they are generally well done. The designs are interesting. The shape of the bad guys spaceship is totally ludicrous of course but visually pleasing and goes with the rest of the movie's tendency to be more of a comedy than a serious movie. The same can be said for that cool but weird net they made by interlinking fighter crafts.On the whole an entertaining movie. I have to say that the dancing scene at the end was a wee bit too silly for me though. I have a problem understanding how a movie like this can get such a relatively high rating at IMDb but okay it was fun to watch and it is not entirely undeserved. Personally I think a 7 out of 10 is more in the right region.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Unexpected Awesomeness,"OMG - Just how good is this film.I expected this film, at best, to be entertaining and action packed - i.e. the same as all the other superhero type films.But this was so much more. The dialogue was intelligent, just the right side of funny (not too much and perfectly balanced) and powerful. The effects were some of the best I have seen (and I've seen ALL the big blockbusters at IMAX). The story line was deep and intricate.And the best of all - the acting (and directing) was PERFECT.I seriously cannot fault this film. 48 hours after watching it I am still smiling with amazement.I AM GROOT!

Very funny Dr. Jones,"There was very much time that I didn't felt so happy with a movie. Watching Guardians of the Galaxy i had this feeling again, the movie runs in a very good rhythm and the 2 hours are right used.The construction of the characters is absolutely well done, in 30 minutes we already are identified with them and the group is concreted.The motivation for all the events is a good one and all this events are more than enough to pay for the tickets. The return of the characteristics of the 80's movie and the action that can remember Scooby Doo may make strange the movie at first, but the happiness brought by the Guardians and all their individuality will convince you that this is the best Heroes movie of 2014.Waiting for Guardians 2#WeAreGroot #Brazil",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Very Fun Romp,"Guardians of the Galaxy is a weird idea from its inception. When you describe even the main characters people will ask questions. It isn't easily understandable why they can't do something because the material asks much more than they can completely contain in a 2 hour film. Guardians of the Galaxy is just a fun romp.We begin our story with Peter Quill/Star Lord. We start with his mothers death and then we get to go to his space adventures. His trying to collect this sphere which many people want for different reasons that include our main villains Ronan and Thanos. We also got to see this group of crazy criminals to connect into the Guardians of the Galaxy.I find that each character is very well cast. Chris Pratt is incredible as Star Lord because he can play the silly kind of character that gets thrust into leadership and becomes the perfect leader to this rag tag group. Bradley Cooper's voice is perfect because he is really cocky and you sometimes don't even recognize him in the role. He is absolutely hilarious and you can tell that he put some real effort into the role.My favorite character is hands down Groot. Groot is something so weird and out there that I didn't know if I would like it. I thought that maybe hiss repeated line of I am Groot would get old, but I didn't get that feeling at all. He is just so well done and Vin Diesel is such a perfect voice that I can't hear anyone else in the role.If there any weak links in our hear characters, it would be Drax and Gamora. I never thought that Zoe Saldana was a bad casting, but at the beginning she didn't feel like an immediate fit, but I found that as her character developed in the film she got much better. Dave Bautista isn't a horrible casting choice, but I thought his character was really just misused until the last thirty minutes where he finally gets flushed out really well. But both of their characters still deliver some hilarious lines that you can't not laugh at him not understanding the culture of Earth.Through the source material, there is a lot to explain and I felt that sometimes they were just explaining the back story to the audience and no of this was included in the hilarious prison line up scene. I found that sometimes the story just deliberately explain what was going.Marvel again spares no expense on the special effects. This movie is beautiful and has some of the best effects in a Marvel film. It is incredible how well our two CGI characters blend with our three tangible characters without feeling like they are talking to a green screen.James Gunn really had some great direction in this film and his crazy style fits very well to this story and material. I find that the pop culture references are really fun. Sometimes I think they over stay their welcome at some points losing some of this films own identity, but they didn't get on my nerves that much.The really disappointing thing about this film is that the villains aren't really fleshed out at all. Karen Gillan has some character development and has somewhere to go, but needs some more time to get a true feel of what she is about. The main villain Ronan has no character at all and gets only like 5 minutes of screen time and only seems to do what he does because the script says he does.I find that some of the minor characters like Glenn Close and John C. Reilly don't hit the mark as well as I wanted it to, but Yondu played by Michael Rooker is a surprise treat that has a lot more to do than I thought he was going in.This story spreads thin in some spots as well as having some weak characters and mainly villains, but I laughed at a good 90 to 95 percent of the film and just had the most fun watching any Marvel film. The 5 Guardians are great and the writing defies a lot more convention than you might think as well as hiding some really cool tidbits for fans of not only the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the Guardians of the Galaxy comic as well. An enjoyable film that deserves a 3.25 out of 4 stars.Now I want to hear from you. Have you seen Guardians of the Galaxy? Are you going to check it out? Comment below and let me know. Thanks and remember that I love nerd movies and I am an addict.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Film Review: Guardians of the Galaxy,"Who would have thought that Marvel's next highly entertaining, multi-million (hopeful billion) dollar cinematic adventure would be set in a futuristic space world, whose tonal and narrative flow is shaped around a retro-filled soundtrack with songs dating from the 1960's to 1980's? With hits including Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling, The Runaway's Cherry Bomb, The Jackson 5's I Want You Back and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy is the epitome of silly, mindless fun at the movies. I'm not sure what Marvel Studios obsession with Marvin Gaye may be currently, but after having the song Trouble Man dictate the narrative for the highly impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier earlier this year, it seems that the powerhouse studio is repossessing old concepts and ideas, and polishing them up quite nicely. With a bit of frantic, highly busy visual effects as well as engrossing dark physical and illicit family comedy, and presenting them in exuberantly exciting fashion for people of all ages to enjoy, Guardians of the Galaxy is a clear-cut winner.There is no denying that Guardians may very well be Marvel's own Star Wars for a new generation of highly diverse and eager young film goers; the film, which is inspired by the classic series, also does a great job spoofing much of the universe brought to life by George Lucas in the seventies. Guardians is, in many senses of the phrase, a roller-coaster ride of a film whose intention of fun is never questioned. If ever Disney wanted to shape a theme park ride around any of their properties, Guardians would surely be their best bet–never mind Pirates.Geek culture has officially taken over cineplexes, and for the most part, so will Chris Pratt, whose turn as Peter Quill a.k.a Star-Lord, will surely be the clear victor at this weekend's box office. Quill, a rambunctious outlaw whose fame as a nuisance to the galaxy is as important as his alias, leads a rag-tag group of criminal misfits to iconic hero status. Like most heroes, Quill isn't quite sure he knows he's a hero yet. Stealing and collecting junk from around the universe on his filthy Corvette-like spaceship he uses more like a bedroom for alien women than as a means of transport, Quill finally steals something so powerful, it threatens to destroy the world and him, forever. But unlike Indiana Jones, Quill doesn't have to dodge booby-traps and outrun giant boulders, instead he just has to deal with an array of peculiar characters including; a crew of awful aiming mercenaries loyal to Ronan (Lee Pace) led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), bounty hunters Rocket (a genetically modified, wise cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper), a humanoid tree Groot (voice by Vin Diesel), an assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and a murderous maniac intent on vengeance Dax the Destroyer (former wrestler Dave Bautista).Eventually, everyone involved with Quill and the orb he has stolen are imprisoned (except the bad guys of course). In prison, the five begin unlikely friendships based on trust, sacrifice and intimidation that allows them to escape prison and set a course to a buyer, The Collector (Benecio Del Toro) who will stop at nothing to have the newly stolen possession in his hands. Upon discovering Quill's possession of the orb, Ronan gets direct orders from Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. Led by his muscle Nebula (Karen Gillan), Ronan and his dark army go to extensive corners of the galaxy to retrieve the orb, and kill anyone in their way.Guardians can rest assure that it is by no means a revolutionary film to defies the boundaries of the superhero narrative and the 'stop the bad guy from destroying the world' clichéd storyline we have come to love and hate. Thankfully, the film is a practice of clever humour and nuanced physical slapstick that make its way into the superhero genre. Pratt does a star-lording job of leading a fresh group of actors to new heights in super hero comedy as well as interacting and getting the most from his voice cast.Director James Gunn (Slither, Super) whose previous work makes no indication at all that his fit in Marvel's world of intergalactic superheroes would work, does a surprisingly fantastic job writing and directing obscure comic book characters. Obvious losers in the comic book world, Gunn does an amazing job of making the Guardians cinematic heroes whose allure on screen, consisting of saturated visual effects and computer generated imagery, make for one of the greatest complete ensemble of the summer. So what if his overly ambitious score is distracting to viewers during intense scenes of built up drama and highly concentrated action. Gunn, has us, from the films first frames, hooked on a feeling of nostalgia and escapism that we haven't felt for a long time.Guardians is in no way a galactic achievement in the world of villains and heroes. Pace, who originally auditioned for the role of Quill, is wooden, unrecognizable and suffers greatly from any real ability to scare his audience with fear or threat. With the occasional close-up to the dark eyes or tarred teeth, Ronan is quickly overshadowed and squashed by the menaced-voice, short presence of Thanos. With the promise of such an iconic villain's chaos and the repercussions it will have in the world of the Avengers and now the Guardians, the film is very much an introductory film with very little new superhero material and rather a pastiche of potential for bigger threats and danger for future instalments.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Ideal Summer Event Movie,"Awesome songs from the 70s and 80s?Five losers who you quickly grow to love?A gun-toting raccoon and an inarticulate tree who grows on you in may ways?Join the ride, because with ""Charm +42"" beaming from all angles, Star Lord (or Peter Quill) is easily the most likable anti-hero since Han Solo, although the fashionable comparison is unfair as there is actually very little in common with that character. Rocket the Raccoon is the real Han Solo in this film and Groot the Tree is his Chewbacca: Rocket just hasn't met his Leia yet...I have no qualms putting this in the 10 category (the top 10% of movies I have ever seen). There is an emotional journey for all five characters that feels truly earned, and far surpasses any such attempt in previous Marvel films.It isn't perfect, the music score (beyond the picked songs) is tuneless and so-so (no John William's class here). The enemies are truly cardboard and dull (although there is an excellent pay-off for this). Karen Gillan is the most poorly short-changed by the family-movie rating as her psychopathic character isn't seen killing a single person removing all fear from her implied awesomeness. Glen Close's Nova Prime is flat and John C Reilly's cop's important character arc is seriously underdeveloped. The antagonists or the hero's don't even have the most awesome kill scene, you'll have to whistle for that!But don't let any of that put you off. The five protagonists are what this film is about, the plot is a distraction, you will just want to spend time with these people: again and again. I love it. I hope you do too.I want more, and more and more. I want Star Lord and team to meet Loki - there's an antagonist who just might dance back!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Hilarious but empty,"In perhaps Marvel's riskiest move, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was released this past weekend and found traction that few expected. Grossing in the 92-million dollar area over its first weekend, 'Guardians,' and the particularly talented marketers of the film, drew in many viewers and sent away many fans. This one included. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is an extremely fun film about a band of five misfits who come together through necessary circumstances to save the universe. With a little bit of a bumpy road along the way, we are allowed to enjoy, laugh at, and surprisingly care for these characters over the course of a fast-paced two hours.Chris Pratt, an actor well known for his comedic roles, headlines the cast of characters in this film, and does an excellent job of not being left behind in the story and by other, more interesting, characters. Pratt is able to hold his own in the film, and may walk away as many people's favorite character, which is a feat when he's standing alongside a sassy raccoon and a gentle, talking tree. Zoe Saldana played the apparently green-skinned Gamora, who's fairly realistic acting was an unfortunate misplace in this film. I'd personally like to see a standalone film for Gamora to see what it was Saldana was intending to do with her character, because in this film the director, or at least the producers, did not allow her to follow through. Sadly, because of this many people are going to walk away with dislike of her part in the movie.Also making up the five Guardians are WWE fighter Dave Bautista as the not-so-destructive Drax the Destroyer, and Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel lending their voices to the film's favorites Rocket Raccoon and Groot, respectively. I particularly liked what Cooper did, actually lending some effort to voicing the raccoon, and Vin Diesel's performance was extremely subtle and small, but excellent nonetheless. Lee Pace, Benicio Del Toro, Djimon Hounsou, Glenn Close, John C. Reilly, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, and a brief hint of Josh Brolin make up the impressive supporting cast in their various and hilarious roles.This movie was, in a whole, absolutely hysterical. This isn't the first time a Marvel movie has been that way (cue unpleasant flashback to 2011's Thor), thankfully this time around it was completely intentional. After getting through a very rough first ten minutes, I was laughing out loud until the very end. Director James Gunn took every opportunity he had to change any sort of suspense or drama that might sneak its way into our head into a moment of uncontrollable laughter. And it worked. That's the best thing, it absolutely worked. Here and there you'd run into a moment where you were ready to get on with the story, but in the end that didn't matter. This isn't a movie where afterwards you go and tell everyone about all the cool things the heroes did and how intricate the plot was, and it's not meant to be. This movie is meant to make you laugh, and it does.'Guardians of the Galaxy' had many imperfections. The visuals were amateurish for a film with such a large budget, the necessary storytelling dialogue was forced and predictable, and the fight cinematography left you dizzy with a bad feeling in your stomach. In the end though, it didn't make a difference. What director James Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman decided to do from the start was allow just enough plot and action to make it a ""superhero movie"" with the final intention of making a laugh-out-loud comedy. They did, it was, and I laughed for two hours.But for just those two hours. I look back at the film now and realize that it left me with nothing. I laughed hysterically while I was watching it, but now all I have left to take with me from the movie is a couple funny lines to quote. For a movie to take the leap from good to great is that wish to watch it again because it found a good place in your heart. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" wasn't able to do that for me. I can't say I disliked this movie, because I didn't: I was laughing harder than I have for a while, it just couldn't go that extra mile, and I don't think that in a couple years anybody will be remembering this film with any special fondness. So as I left the theater I was loving this movie; unfortunately, it stopped there.I give ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" a 7.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Hooked On a Guardian,"This is flat out the funniest Marvel movie to date, and the most daring property they have brought to grace the silver screen. It takes the Marvel universe from strictly earth heroes to thugs, thieves, and assassins that are forced into becoming heroes. Upon announcing the film would go into production last year, I was very worried that it drastically shift the current tone of the universe and in return not bring enough audience into the theaters to see the film. Well I was wrong on both fronts. The trailers sold it as a space epic that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is exactly what it turned out to be. Films that are self aware are smartest. Plus when a film has a talking raccoon who shoots rockets how serious can it be? The cast was absolutely perfect. Chris Pratt is a star who has some of the best comedic timing in the business. Zoe Saldana is as BA as Scarlett Johansson is as Black Widow. Dave Bautista was a pleasant surprise as Drax for a wrestler turned actor. And how can I forget Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket and Groot respectively, who by the way steal the entire film. I was pretty surprised at how little some of the supporting characters were in the film though. Glenn Close, Djimon Hounsou, John C, Reilly, and Benicio Del Toro were basically cameo roles. I did think Ronan was pretty one note and a typical superhero villain. Much like Malekith in Thor, Ronan lacked relatable characteristics and wasn't nearly as charismatic or intimidating for that matter as I would have liked.The whole film looks beautiful but I will say I would have liked to see more of Xandar and it's people. The people in this galaxy never look like the next person, which does throw you off a little bit. Like I said, this is one of the strangest superhero movies, and movies in general that I have seen. Id like to think I know a lot about Marvel characters but there are so many characters in this film that I had no clue who they were. So for the general audience, it may seem a bit too distant from other superhero movies for their liking.For as great as each of the guardians were and how many great one liners there were between the 5, I don't think there's one big action scene that I will remember from this movie. The film itself is most definitely memorable but with these big superhero movies you always think of the action scenes. With Avengers it's the assemble scene fighting the chitari. With The Dark Knight it's the truck flip. With X-Men it's Magneto hovering with sentinels. And with Man of Steel it's the Smallville fight and the neck snap. Guardians will be remembered more for it's great laughs which is fine, but it's something to improve upon for round 2.So overall I really enjoyed this summer blockbuster and it's quite the movie-going experience. I think it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone and the great thing is you don't have to have seen any previous Marvel movie to understand the plot. I brought my girlfriend, who hadn't seen a single Marvel film to date and she had a blast with it. I am sure I will be seeing it at least one more time. By the way, I was stunned they went the route they did with the after credits scene.+Funniest superhero movie to date+Brings Marvel to the cosmos!+Groot and Rocket are incredibly charming and lead a perfect cast+Self aware+Everything looks beautiful+Memorable soundtrack-No defining action sequence-Ronan was bleh8.7/10SECOND VIEWING 9.0/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Good, but not great","Guardians of the Galaxy must have been a very hyped Marvel Superhero movie of 2014. At first, it was questioned that a movie depicting a band of lesser known superheroes would ever make financial success on the big screen. When it was released on August 1st, throughout a few months, it was successfully huge. This was worth noting that audiences do have an appetite for something a little unusual.When I watched Guardians of the Galaxy from beginning to end, I wasn't entirely amused. It was enjoyable no doubt. But it had a lot of flaws in my opinion. I really hope the sequel in 2017 will bring some improvement because this sub-franchise of Marvel has a lot of potential.I'll start with the bad parts first. The plot is overall weak and too simple. The villain, Ronan wants an orb that has power and the heroes have to make sure he doesn't get it. I mean this movie is obviously based on a comic book and is supposed to be more light- hearted and less serious, but it really felt like a Saturday morning cartoon episode that is expanded to a full-blown blockbuster. Another downside of GoTG is that pop culture references = comedy/Humor. I don't get what's funny when a song from the 70's/80's is being played every 30 minutes throughout the movie. In fact, I'm already sick of the 1980's nostalgia that is prevalent throughout not just this movie, but other ones. It's becoming too cliché in this decade now. We get it. The 80's was cool for people that were kids at the time. We don't need this kind of pandering throughout every fun film. Guardians of the Galaxy also should have focused on less action and more character development. I really wanted to know more about Rocket Raccoon (which was my favorite) and more dynamic backstory on Gamora.Now the good parts of GoTG was the chemistry between the characters. Chris Pratt plays Starlord well and may become a Sci-Fi icon in the future. The world-building is also great. The GoTG franchise can really stand against Star Wars if it wants to.Guardians of the Galaxy is really a film that didn't not live up the hype, but it wasn't terrible or fairly decent either. It was good, but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great sci-fi film, Bad comic movie!","Ugh OK this movie was a great sci-fi film, but bad comic film!, This is to be expected from Marvel as of late, the CGI mixed with one liners are Marvel's bread and butter, they fly through every movie with same repetitive formula without any real direction. This was a film I had high hopes for , but was completely disappointed with how they butchered the characters and turned this into a Serenity Sequel rather then a Guardians film.Mixing and matching story arcs from the Annihilation and Infinity Gauntlet (which predates the current Guardians tandem by 20 years), was a cheap and lazy move by the writers. Not to mention the shameless portrayal of Ronan the Accuser as a merciless madman like Thanos, rather then a noble warrior king that he is .In the end it was a decent movie worth the price of admission , albeit a far cry from the Guardians of the Galaxy fans deserve.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great Mix of Comedy and Action,"I heard a lot of people talking about this movie longer before I saw the actually preview for it. When I did see the preview, I was excited to watch a movie with creatures and action that looked so, well, awesome. During the movie, I was surprised at how well the directors and actors mixed comedy and action. Normally this type of mixture doesn't turn out entirely well, however Gaurdians of the Galaxy did an absolutely flawless job. I was so amazed at how awesome this movie actually was that i wanted to watch it all over again. (Totally buying the movie when it comes out) There wasn't profanity, that was noticeable. There wasn't nudity, and there wasn't a whole lot of action and minimal comedy. The comedy and action were balanced, and during the movie there was tons of oldies playing and being sung.

A Fantastic Surprise,"I was skeptical about Guardians Of The Galaxy to say the least. Starring professional wrester Dave Bautista, directed and co written by the man who wrote the live action Scooby Doo movies and directed a segment of Movie 43, and a very unusual movie trailer led me to the conclusion this wasn't going to be a good movie even before it was released. But then it came out and the feedback was nothing but amazing, so I found myself watching the movie despite my doubts, and man am I glad I did.Guardians Of The Galaxy IS Marvel's best movie. I can't tell you how many times I was left laughing out loud, cheering characters on, and grinning from ear to ear. The action might not be the greatest compared to other Marvel movies such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier or The Avengers and the direction may not be either, but the screenplay is nothing short of amazing and blows other Marvel movies out of the water. Still, the OK direction and sub par action didn't bother me to much as although Guardians Of The Galaxy is a superhero movie, it's definitely more of a comedy than an action movie, and it works great. Really the only big gripe I have on the movie is that the villain is a little weak. The best villains are the ones that you can connect to and understand and that isn't the case in the movie. Another small thing is the ending might bother some people although I thought it worked alright.Still, despite any complaints I've expressed about Guardians Of The Galaxy this is a must see. The chemistry between the characters is flawless and every single character is fleshed out. You care about them and want every single character to succeed. And although I've been raving about the comedy portion of Guardians Of The Galaxy don't think that the whole movie is riding on the comedy because emotion scenes are executed just as well.Overall, Guardians Of The Galaxy Is one of my favorite movies of the year as well as one of my favorite superhero movies of all time. I promise anyone that watches this movie will enjoy it and I implore anyone and everyone to stop what you're doing and go to your theater right now to watch it.I hope you appreciated my review of Guardians Of The Galaxy and I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Nice Surprise for a Non-Comic Book Guy,"Every time I watch one of these films, I am immediately at a disadvantage because I don't know the mythology behind them. It didn't matter here because while progressing the story, we were filled in well by commentary from the characters. Chris Pratt is a funny guy with his endless sincerity and optimism. What works here, and what others have said, is the humor is offhand enough, but funny enough, to not interfere with the mission. The good guys (as well as the sort-of good guys) have a nice chemistry. Some are clueless and some are simply very clever. I remember seeing the ads for this a year or so ago and the raccoon put me off in the ads. As it turns out, he was a dynamic, sympathetic character who is himself a victim of circumstances. He ever gets called a hamster at one point. Anyway, I just wanted to weigh in on a very entertaining film. I'm sure the sequel will continue the fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
We are Groot.,"Brilliant. That's one of the only words I can think to use to describe this film. It was amazingly made, and Chris Pratt - phwoar! The relationship between all of the characters is outstandingly funny, I laughed the whole way through the film. I would go see this film over and over again it was so good. I can't wait until the sequel. It was a nice change to see older music being used rather than the hip- hop rubbish that's played on the radio these days.

A forced action-comedy,"After getting caught and arrested, a group of bounty hunters must protect a sacred sphere which grants immense power to the one who can ""wield"" it. They must fight against a maniacal character who's determined to destroy the entire race once he's in possession of the most wanted object in the galaxy.It's a movie full of action, fights and explosions which, unfortunately, has two major flaws. It is too superficial and simplistic in terms of story, thus being predictable, and, although it is featured as an action/adventure movie, it desperately tries to make you laugh, a lot more than many full-fledged comedies, with many forced scenes and dialogues. As it happens most of the time when you try too hard to be funny, you get a movie which actually isn't, or by far not as much as it wanted to be. Instead, they should have focused to create a serious movie with a solid story and some better thought dialogue which would have been a lot more enjoyable, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with some interesting characters and some spectacular visuals, but gets dragged down by some aspects which shouldn't have been there in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very good comic book movie,"Movie follows Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and a band of various characters--green-skinned vicious Gamora (Zoe Saldana), muscle-bound angry Drax (Dave Bautista), Groot a talking tree (voice of Vin Diesel)and an angry raccoon named Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). They're trying to keep an orb out of the hands of a bad guy determined to rule and destroy the universe with it.OK--I liked this but I didn't love it. It moves quickly, the special effects are incredible (especially in 3-D), there's plenty of action and fights and Rocket is LOTS of fun. However there are gaps in plot and story (I'm assuming they're saving them for the sequel), it gets way too sentimental at times (they keep cramming the message that friends are good down your throat) and I didn't think Pratt was all that good. He's all handsome and muscular but I thought his acting was pretty bad. I didn't find him endearing or that interesting. Actually none of the acting was that impressive. Rocket comes across as the most engaging character in the film (seriously--how often do you get to see a raccoon with an attitude?). Also I didn't find it that funny. There were plenty of amusing lines but that's all they were--amusing. I didn't laugh once. Still it was a fun summer movie. Worth catching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Great effects with a notable lack of substance,"From a hospital room where a child witnesses the death of his mother, an alien abduction follows and fast forward some 20 years to the present life of this man in deep trouble. A seemingly ordinary man gets hold of a very valuable object and as a result his life is in great danger as some very important individuals are prepared to go to great lengths to obtain it. In a nutshell, this is the main thrust of the film and it is not hard to observe how it astutely suffers from a very weak storyline.Who the main protagonists were and how this intergalactic link came to be, it remained largely unknown except the occasional insertion of information as the film developed.On this note, this movie developed largely out of action scenes which were pretty much a constant. This undoubtedly was its strongest point, plenty of action some of it impressive will keep one engaged despite the gaps in the story. A put off in this was the frequent attachment of the main character to a cassette player that often played romantic songs and to hear that in the middle of space battle as they tried to survive was very anti climactic.On the whole, this will undoubtedly impress the early teen audience and the die-hard fans of Marvel comics as well as sci-fi enthusiasts. Mindless constant action without a storyline will indubitably be a favourite amongst 13-18 year olds. As for the rest of us, well we'll just have to let ourselves be absorbed by the action and bypass the lack of substance.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Entertaining Movie, Cool, Some Wrong Character Info","I gave this movie an 8 because it was refreshing. I give it a 6 for them mixing up so much and giving wrong info. It was an entertaining movie, I just wish they didn't just outright change character histories without even making it sound legitimate - especially for those who are familiar with the characters and know their back stories. Marvel mixed and matched characters from various alternate time lines within the marvel universe in this movie.For example, Yondu, in this movie is such a character. Here is his data http://marvel.wikia.com/Yondu_Udonta_(Earth-199999)The Yondu from the comic books is here: http://marvel.wikia.com/Yondu_Udonta_(Earth-691)Those of you who don't know that there was quite some wrong information in the movie - the writers disregarding marvel history in their lame attempt to make it more sensational, check these linksGamora - Not the silly girl she was portrayed to be in the movie. http://marvel.wikia.com/Gamora_(Earth-616).Here is Thanos his file, http://marvel.wikia.com/Thanos_(Earth-616)Nebula http://marvel.wikia.com/Nebula_%28Earth-616%29The Nova Corps http://marvel.wikia.com/Nova_Corps_(Earth-616)Few characters who go from biggest baddest bad guy to good guy roles, need sensationalism. You might want to read the Infinity Sagas, to find out how much of a bad-ass Thanos really is.All Main Marvel comics take place on Earth-616. Our reality, is known as Earth-1218 You see, Marvel has many different alternate realities where their stories develop and characters originate. I suppose the mixing-up was done to cut some corners and to make it seem more interesting for the box-office.All in all, it was fun. But frustrating to see how weak and sometimes lame the characters were made out to be by the writers. I mean, Gamora, the most dangerous assassin, was taken down so easily so many times...Go watch it.

Fantastic Movie and one of the highlights of 2014,"I was one of the non-believers. I couldn't see how Marvel was going to pull this movie off with a bunch of secondary characters who I really didn't know much about. After all, in the comic adaptation world we've been used to seeing the major players turned into big budget spectacles and the more minor and fringe characters being released by secondary studios...I have never been so happy to be wrong. When I say I was a non-believer, I was going into this movie fully expecting to see the first Marvel flop in recent times. That said, this wasn't just a movie, it was an event. I honestly believe it launched the long term platform Marvel recently announced and enabled less mainstream characters such as Dr. Strange and Ant Man to get full blown big budget productions.Much of the movie's success comes from Chris Pratt's portrayal as Peter Quill/Star Lord. He was born to play this character and is a bona fide star and leading man. It's one of those moments when a star is born and it just so happens the platform he did it on was one the best films of the year.Another thing that makes this movie so great, and what Disney/Marvel are masters at, is making it accessible to everyone. I think everyone form Junior to Granny would have a ton of fun watching this movie. The mix of humour/action/effects/story make it a truly unique experience. It's like they took what they had learnt from all of the previous Marvel movies and combined it into this one. Every detail was put into the production most likely because of people with opinions like mine where we were not sold on this concept.Something else that stood out for me was that this didn't feel like your typical 'super hero(es) save the earth' story because of the space element. It seemed larger scale and a fresh direction. It was one of the more original story lines because these are aliens and not typical super heroes like The Avengers. All of this combined to create a more unique and refreshing experience. That and the heroes weren't cut and dry good guys, they were definitely more of a grey area.In the end, if you haven't already, get down to that theatre before it's too late. You don't want to be the person who didn't the full experience of this theatrical event. After that is done, stream it on Amazon so Disney knows how much this movie was loved. This was definitely my movie of the year...there were some other good ones, but none in the league of 'GoG' as it is now known. Flixer Approved!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything You Could Ever Ask For!!,"I remember being one of the select few of being a bit overly excited hearing that Guardians was about to get their big screen debut. Yes, I knew it was a huge gamble. Honestly, it was a win-win situation for them. (If it was good, then MCU could bring ANY character to life. If it was bad, it was a lesson learned; pair them up with The Avengers, like in the comics, and continue on). A lot of people weren't thrilled about this, but I kept my hopes high.Last night, I was able to catch the movie on the night of July 31st. HOLY CRAP THIS MOVIE DELIVERED!! I loved everything about this film! It had everything. It was hard for me to dislike any one on the team (though Rocket and Groot were the stars of these ""losers""), Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax...hell even Yondu was nice. One thing I REALLY liked that had a bit of an advantage over The Avengers was that they all sacrificed for each other. They grew into a family the more and more the film developed. The ONLY gripe I had about the movie was I wish Thanos was just a TAD bit more in here. Ronan was cool, but just didn't hit a home run (maybe got to 3rd base, but nothing past that). What more can I say about this? Easily the first 10 giving out from me in a LONG time. You will laugh, you will cry/have that tear in your eye (never thought I would say that for a Marvel film, but...), you will even find yourself dancing!

Fun and Entertaining Fantasy Movie,"""Fantasy"" is surely the correct term to apply to Guardians of The Galaxy. Those expecting a grounded Marvel Movie, or one that bares any relation to the real world at all, like for example, Spider-Man or Capt. America are likely to be sorely disappointed. I don't think this is a movie for everyone. Indeed, at times it plays like a superannuated Doctor Who adventure.But I liked it, that's for sure! Bold, brassy, with some colossal action sequences - but not frightened to go for dumb laughs and cosmic weirdness on a scale Marvel have not yet approached. It isn't quite as funny as some of the reviews would have you believe - but it is witty and entertaining. I came to care about the characters, which in today's CGI infested modern blockbuster environment, is a refreshing change. And that's in spite of the fact that the film is loaded with special effects, explosions and action sequences of a type I normally loathe.The acting in this movie is spot on, with Chris Pratt an engaging hero, and the CGI Groot is just bloody brilliant. This is a greatly entertaining popcorn movie as long as you don't take it seriously. I don't know much about the comic so I can't compare it. But as a film I'd definitely recommend it as long as you don't want Citizen Kane or Vertigo!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun movie and WAY better than I thought it would be...,"This film is a lot of fun to watch.The effects are great, the costumes and props are great, and the actors do an excellent job with their characters.

Well, there IS some ""formula"" involved in the film, and they try to exploit the whole ""grrll power!!"" scene where females are fighting....which just looks ridiculous, but the film more than makes up for any minor flaws by simply being more fun to watch than to pick at.Highly recommend giving this one a watch.9 of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fun and fresh space adventure,"""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" directed by James Gunn, is a refreshing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, blending humor, action, and a quirky ensemble of characters. The film follows Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who is abducted from Earth as a child and grows up to become the space-faring rogue Star-Lord. He forms an unlikely alliance with a group of misfits: the fierce Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the literal Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), the wisecracking Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the lovable tree-like Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel).The movie's charm lies in its offbeat humor and the chemistry among its main characters. The soundtrack, filled with classic '70s and '80s hits, adds a nostalgic and energetic vibe that complements the film's tone. The visual effects are stunning, bringing the vibrant and diverse galaxy to life.While the plot revolves around a familiar battle to save the universe from a powerful villain, it's the character development and their camaraderie that make the film stand out. Each member of the Guardians brings their own backstory and personality, creating a dynamic that is both entertaining and heartfelt.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" successfully blends action, comedy, and heart, making it an enjoyable and unique entry in the superhero genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of the Galaxy was a blast and my favorite movie of the year so far,"Earlier this year I saw the Captain America sequel and remarked that so far it was my favorite of the films released since The Avengers. However, I also remarked that Guardians of the Galaxy was coming out and it looked like it might be pretty good so it had a chance to be the best. Turns out, it is the best so far! I saw it a week after its release, usually I would have written a review by now, but been busy with a new house and all and I have limited access to the internet. Suffice to say, the numbers are pretty much making me think that others think this is the best one too as the only one that it probably will not outdo is the third installment of Iron Man as far as box office. This movie features a team of offbeat heroes that come together to utilize each others strengths and hide the weaknesses and is a very funny movie with good action as well. It has everything one looks for in a comic movie and I do believe one of the reasons it is a bit better is the fact we are all a bit less familiar with these particular heroes than say those on the X-men or say the Avengers.The story has a young boy visiting his mother one last time in the hospital. The woman dies and the boy runs out of the hospital and cries in the middle of a field where he is abducted by aliens. Years later this young boy is now a young man who calls himself Star Lord. He is after a strange artifact on a planet that appears in ruins. He is confronted and then escapes others after the strange artifact. Star Lord soon finds a bounty on him as the aliens who abducted him and are basically space pirates called Grievers want the artifact as well. Also, after this artifact is one of the most powerful villains in the galaxy, Thanos and he sends his daughter after it as well. Well Star Lord soon finds Thanos' daughter and a raccoon named Rocky and his partner, a tree alien named Groot are after them and after a scramble to get the artifact and get away, they all find themselves locked up in a prison where they meet another alien named Drax, that wishes Thanos' daughter dead. However, they soon will learn to work together and learn what the precious artifact is and how deadly it potentially is in the hands of someone dastardly or anyone for that matter!The film is really good, as I've said, and I believe it has to do with the characters. They are all very unique and they all have their quirks. From the womanizing Star Lord, the can't get a metaphor Drax, to the daughter of the evil Thanos, to the mechanical Rocky with a wicked sense of humor to Groot who can only say, ""I am Groot"", this group is very humorous to watch. I do believe it helps that not many people are familiar with this team, as all the members got to shine. Unlike say a film like X-men where there are so many casual fans so a character like Wolverine is always seemingly showcased and the team leader Cyclops gets portrayed as a wimp when anyone who reads the comics can attest he once fought all the X-men, including Wolverine to a standstill. That is the problem with having so many cartoons, people with limited knowledge draw conclusions and the movie studios cater to them. Like Spider-man. Anyone who has read the comics knows the villains that have been his biggest tormentors are Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. Venom is all the casual fan wants to see, even though he was only a big time villain for like a five year stretch. Here, though, no one stands out as there is no Wolverine or to a lesser degree Iron Man and I think that is what helped this movie. People thought the fact this was a lesser known comic would hurt, but in actuality it may have helped it.So, this film is my favorite of the Marvel films released since The Avengers. In fact, it is almost on par with that film. I only give that one an edge because I do so love seeing the Hulk do his thing. Though I have heard rumors that the next Guardians film may do the planet Hulk storyline, which would be awesome. This film itself was awesome as it did have a lot of funny characters and good action. Also, Thanos looks great as it almost seems they took him straight off the pages of the comics. My only complaint about the film, which it is only a minor quibble, is that they never showed Thanos really do all that much. I would like to see him do something truly destructive so that the moviegoers not familiar with his power know what is in store when he is the primary villain in a Marvel movie. I was hoping he would be in Avengers 2, but they went with Ultron instead. Hopefully, we shall see him in the third, or heck let him take a more active role in the second film of this franchise, because I like where they are going with it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Impressive!,"Hey,so I just returned from the European premiere of the movie in German theaters. I did expect a generic but entertaining film like most marvel movies. What I got was a 2 hour spectacle with the most impressive CGI effects I've ever seen. You just can't tell the difference between animated locations, characters and objects anymore. When animated characters are touched it looks real, when animated space ships crash into something you can see the force of the impact and the weight of the object seems just right. Every time a new location was introduced I was amazed by the beautiful look and the diversity of art design.With that in mind the rest of the film can't do much wrong anymore. The story is generic, yes. But what do you expect from a film called Guardians of the Galaxy...some guys try to guard the galaxy. But it is nicely wrapped up and you do not get the feeling it is kept too short. The characters are kept simple but they mostly stick to their characteristics or their racial attitude.I also liked the humor which was above average. All the different species which come together offer a lot of opportunities for some funny arguments and/or jokes.The music fit pretty well into the film and plays a greater role than I expected.One thing that I am disappointed by is Vin Diesel as Groot. I just did not recognize Vin Diesel in this character once during the entire film. He could have just been replaced by some other guy. So he was only picked because he is a famous actor (correct me if I am wrong with this).To sum it up: the film is pretty much worth to be seen in cinema and is a milestone in CGI technics!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians Of Marvel,"To be Honest, i didn't knew who the Guardians of the Galaxy were, but they got me with the trailer. This year we had pretty good films as Godzilla, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and it seems that Guardians of the Galaxy are Marvel's next big thing!!The movies is full with everything, literally everything, it has action, comedy, and even more you won't expect.The actors stick to their roles, such as Bradley Cooper or Vin Diesel, even former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista makes an excellent performance. The story is probably one of the most original i've seen on Marvel. So i'll keep it to you simple, if you want a film that KICK-ASS in so many ways, that has very good actors and you want to have a good time with your son, your wife, your girlfriend or your mother, father, brother, trust me this is it.These my friends are The Guardians of Marvel.i mean Guardians of the Galaxy.But seriously,it should call Guardians of Marvel because this is so much better than any movie ever made of Marvel.Don't trust me, go see it yourself",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I Am Groot,"As perhaps one of the few in the screening I went to who was familiar with the source material (yes even with the original 1969 incarnation) this film had a lot to live up to for me especially with all the positive buzz surrounding it, but thankfully it did not disappoint.Guardians Of The Galaxy delivers on almost every level and it's great to see a studio being brave and confident enough to have allowed James Gunn to make this relatively unknown property, other studios could really learn something from the success this film will undoubtedly enjoy – firstly stop making dramatic changes from the source material that your film is based on (there's a reason it's popular to begin with). Secondly if your film is good enough build brand awareness like Marvel did with this as the marketing for this film as it was simply faultless. Thirdly superhero movies can be fun without being silly as this film proves, so we don't always need dark and broody.The main thing that Gunn got just right with this was the tone and balance, yes it's mostly fun (without really being an out and out comedy) but it also gives you just about enough information about each character so that you will root for them but not so much that it ever slows things down or becomes too pretentious. For example the first two scenes which feature the same character (at different ages) couldn't be more different in tone but somehow it still feels right and a natural progression.Chris Pratt anchors the film as Peter Quill offers great charisma and the progression from wannabe to hero always feels right, after this you feel that major stardom beckons. Zoe Saldana is always great and her Gamora works perfectly well although I feel the character is played as more of a foil for the others so it's a generous performance. Rocket is so well animated that there was never a moment that I thought about him being CGI, he's brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper, so he is in many ways pretty much the character on screen I'd always imagined he also has some great lines. Groot almost steals the film and although Vin Diesel does well with the limited lines it's the animators that really succeed here by giving Groot such humanistic facial expressions making him the heart and soul of the film. Dave Bautista was perhaps the biggest surprise for me, his Drax was not only very fitting in terms of being a revenge driven powerhouse but he also has some of the funniest lines and offers some subtlety, it will be interesting to see what Bautista does next.The villains fare less well although this is not uncommon for a superhero movie because the main purpose of the film was to put together the team so although Lee Pace, Karen Gillan and Djimon Hounsou are perfectly fine, they look great but they're not really fleshed out and are fairly generic. The plot is fairly straightforward as with many Marvel movies but that's not really the point here because there's a real tonal shift which means you may notice it less. It really is a beautiful looking film too so kudos to the artists, costumes and makeup are impressive too.The film succeeds because like Peter Quill it has a lot of swagger, it's always fun without ever becoming too goofy, it's accessible without spoon feeding the audience and therefore it's just a whole lot of fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I AM BANTS,"The great space opera of the 2010s was very late into my eyes and carries now the baggage of all that came after it, but for large parts it still feels fresh, bright and characterful if also regretfully shot through with a sort of risible laddy banter and gaze (men can look like trees, racoons, big dudes and small dudes, the women can only look like green pink or blue women). The real strength here is the design which has some of the clearest European comics influence I've ever seen in a giant corporate American thing. The ships and environs bring to mind gorgeous French titles like Orbital and it still looks fantastic. Sadly there is that characteristic third act flabbiness that infects all MCU films and the finale feels about forty minutes too long.

We are Groot.,"Peter Quill, less commonly known as Star-Lord, finds himself in the middle of a Universe-wide conflict trying to gain control of a sacred orb that has the power to obliterate organic life and planets. Quill, almost a Han Solo style pilot, must team with a group of remarkably different outlaws in a bid to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.Clocking in at a refreshing two hours, Guardians' is heart-warming, fun and probably Marvel's best film to date. Starring; Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Bradley Cooper as Rocket Racoon, Zoe Salanda as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax and Vin Diesel as Groot (his easiest role yet, probably).Pulling on emotions followed shortly by laughter, Guardians' has enough to keep you engaged and wanting more. Reeling in the references to other Marvel features (Thor 2 and The Avengers), Guardians' manages to put into perspective the scale of the Marvel Universe and how they all link.

Guardians of the Galaxy was a disappointment.,"Guardians of the Galaxy is everything wrong with today's movie industry and last decades. The company have all the funding they need to produce and hire writers for a solid movie, but yet they end up making something that just looks pretty but with no substance.That's how this movie felt like to me in general. While it had some moments that made me chuckle for real, that was about it. Otherwise it felt like I were watching a movie built up on logic you'd see in an anime where logical train of thought and actions are neglected in the ""power of friendship"". Which was a real turn off together with the constant clichés in the dialogues.Marvel had the potential to deliver a great movie, I really do think so. But the fact you had to endure the childish plot devices, villains with all talk but no brain and bad writing makes this a movie I'd not like to see again.

Guardians is just flat-out exactly what I wanted from another ""group against badguys"" action spectacle: a witty and snappy sense of humor, phenomenal writing, *gorgeous* special effects, well rounded and lovable characters and an overall story that weaves its way effortlessly into the Marvel movie mythos. It's one of those rare, jam-packed rides that makes me want to just go get right back in line and enjoy it all over again.It stands right next to The Avengers as an incredibly entertaining piece of filmmaking while also offering plenty of its own style and humor to make it unique, while the Sci-Fi backdrop makes Guardians all the more enthralling and fresh. In a mere two hours the characters grow and surprise, which is incredible for 5 major characters never before introduced to the Marvel Movieverse.The whole cast is phenomenal, but it's evident that Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) steals the show (I think the whole audience agreed on that one). Combine winning and hysterical performances with smart, snappy writing and you get an excellent, side splitting action comedy. Who knew? Chris Pratt is also *perfect* as StarLord, Saldana plays Gamora very well, Vin Diesel's winning performance of Groot is awesome, and Bautista's character is just plain funny.Combine all the above with some great emotional notes, a few excellent and relevant themes, a fun and entertaining score (combining a memorable orchestral score with classic 70's tunes) all while exploring an enticing and incredible world makes Guardians of the Galaxy just so much fun. It may have some issues, but I had too much fun to care. Top of the line entertainment all around, and one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wow,"Wow, I don't review many movies and I hate CGI but I felt like Guardians of the Galaxy (GOG) did a great job of balancing CGI with a lot of hard work on their costumes, acting and the writing was FANTASTIC.The actors did a great job but they did have a great script to work with. The hype was totally justified.The actors were awesome and the story plot was great. It was a bit hard to follow and the names did get confusing but its minor details in a wonderful story.I do have to say that I didn't know anything about the story before I went but if I wasn't a fan then I am certainly now. They did a great job telling the story and it could have gone Dragon Ball Z with the wrong script. Go and see for your self. I think the movie will be higher than 8.8 soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The only MCU movie I liked,"Won't dig in too deep. I hate MCU and superhero movies. I never saw a genuinely good ones. Even the most popular ones I find to be a chore to sit through. This one made me happier, mostly because it is a space fantasy first, and superhero flick second.Don't get me wrong, it's still an incredibly stupid story. But with the amounts of comedy put in, I can just watch it the same way I watch Spaceballs - to laugh and be entertained, plus add here good environmental designs and some imaginative locales.So, yes, I liked it. Alas, that's all. It's still dumb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome!!,"Guardians of the Galaxy... Mini review...It's been called the boldest and riskiest move yet by Marvel Studios, with some eagerly anticipating theatrical failure...But after sitting through 2hrs of awesomeness I can honestly and safely say that Guardians of the Galaxy is a treat for the senses with a brilliant foot-tapping, head-bopping soundtrack and great humour with lots of one-liners.With a great cast and a wisecracking performance from Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star Lord who is clearly equal parts Han Solo and Mal Reynolds. Among other characters in the film there's Rocket played by Bradley Cooper who is positively brilliant and (dare I say it) probably one of my favourite characters in the movie.I have to agree with some critics who are calling Guardians of the Galaxy ""possibly the best Marvel movie yet"".Personally, I thought the movie was terrific. It's funny, it's sweet, it's exciting, it feels fresh and familiar all at once. it wears its heart on its sleeve, places tongue firmly in cheek, and never once gives up trying to impress us. It's bold to compare this to Star Wars, but the comparison is there.I won't spoil the plot or tell you what characters from the Marvel-U appear in the movie but what I will say is that it's not a superhero movie. In fact, this is a different type of movie from the Marvel studios, and that's a good thing!Oh and by the way, there's a scene after the credits although it's not a must see.Many reviews are saying this is ""Star Wars for a new generation"" and I'll be honest, I have to agree! I enjoyed every minute of Guardians and I'm sure will too!Here's looking forward to Guardians 2 in 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
average film - nothing special,"I put off watching this film especially to get away from all the hype and build up so I waited for that to die down.. I have to say that this film has much to be desired and is nothing special at all.The people I spoke to all said it was good but by good I guess they meant passable. The story is childish, the plot predictable and generally a very cheesy film that tries and failies to be funny. I am not sure who its targetted audience is but if you are a xmen, avengers fan this won't appeal to you - maybe to your 10 year old son?!I feel that I am being honest here, the only plus is that the CGI is good and looks good visually but thats all you will get from this film i'm afraid - a waste of time. I haven't watched avengers two but hoping its better than this!Avoid and save yourself two hours!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Amazing visuals,"The plot was a bit stupid, and the acting wasn't the best, but other than that, the movie was pretty good. The special effects were jaw-dropping. All of them were extremely good. The CGI was also really good. Rocket and Groot both looked really realistic, and the only bad CGI was on Thanos. Ronan looked really good and scary. I hated the acting for Peter Quill when he was young. The action was actually moderated in this movie, and there were decent chunks of each of the Guardians fighting, not mainly focusing on a few characters like The Avengers. If the movie had better acting and a better plot, it would've been perfect. The special effects got wasted in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"a winning combination of comedy, characters, and special fx (and a little heart)","Guardians of the Galaxy was something I saw this past summer, and by now it should be gone from my memory, or rather a little faded. Summer blockbusters should be fun as disposable entertainments (or on the flip-side can be detrimental to your brain and well-being if they're not), and yet Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel Studios' 10th feature film in eight years, has a little more to offer than the usual. At least, it should be said, with its characters and most of its cast. Plus, it's a comedy deep down - with some tragic roots that aren't totally ignored - and it stays true to that and makes it more memorable on those grounds. If it's not THE best of the MCU flicks yet, it's probably the funniest by way of its ensemble.After little ""Starlord"" (yeah, it's not his name, but might as well) loses his mother at the start of the movie (and yeah, a bit of a dramatic start, but director James Gunn makes it real and impactful) and happens to get, yes, sucked up into a spaceship by some mysterious group, it cuts ahead to twenty years later as the boy is now a man (Chris Pratt), a kind of bounty hunter but for objects instead of people. Somehow one thing leads to another and he winds up in a prison, alongside a motley crew of other 'low-lifes' like Rocket Raccoon (voiced by, yes, Bradley Cooper), his companion/partner/Tree-Monster Groot (Vin Diesel), a woman (Zoe Saldana) who is actually from a family of royalty but gets shuffled out by a betrayal of sorts, and Dave Bautista as a Big-Headed Lunk named Drax who's one crutch is that he takes things very literally (including gestures that seem self-explanatory).This central ensemble is cast and played with excellent timing and a strong variety. No one member is alike, even though there's plenty of sarcasm to go around - Starlord is like a Han Solo, but to a point so is Rocket Raccoon, and of all things it's the latter who is the most 'bad-ass' of the bunch with his technical skills, though also the most unbalanced - and quirks and distrust is a-plenty. There's a lot of comedy in the writing, including some off-kilter sexual references - which, for me as a summer movie presumably meant for kids, made me giddy that they could get away with it, and more importantly that they were hilarious - but also Pratt has excellent timing and chops with everyone. And yet he doesn't play it all for laughs all the time, and when called upon to be serious or call back to his character's mother and past, he can go there too.The fact that Gunn can get the audience so worked up about this group is really endearing (he described the difference between them and the Avengers like the difference between the Stones and the Beatles, similar songs to play in a group, but varied approach to the music with Guardians being harder edged), including, yes, a giant tree and an over-bearing Meat-Head like Draxx. And there are a couple of solid supporting players who have just delightfully bizarre science-fiction/space-opera get ups (this is also a variation on Star Wars of course); Benicio del-Toro in his one scene and Michael Rooker, the best 'villain' type character of the film as Starlord's a-hole mentor, steal their scenes completely.I mention all this good stuff, not to mention some winning action set-pieces and occasionally truly spectacular special effects, because the main plot of the film isn't all that great. It's a little been-here-done-that, the Magic Item (one of the items that will eventually make up the Infinity Gauntlet) that has to be saved and protected, and a main villain via Lee Pace that just isn't interesting or compelling. He does what he can, but there isn't much room to do past what is required. It's almost as if Gunn and Nicole Perlman (the writers) knew they had to work with this boiler-plate sci-fi story, did decently, served the franchise that's continuing, and decided that the best way to make this worthwhile would be to give the really choice stuff to the heroes. For me the only thing keeping it back from the heights of The Avengers is a really captivating villain or stakes in that regard.But if you watch it for these main players, their rapore with one another, the awesomely self-conscious soundtrack (you laugh when certain songs come up, and tap your feet at the same time), and some of the wilder visuals that can come up for these planets and settings - and did I mention a f***ing raccoon is one of the great characters of the past several years in mainstream films, it must be said again - it's popcorn bliss for a couple hours and change.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Got my mind blown.,"I have never read a comic about these guys, and the only character i recognized was Thanos, still im happy to say that this has become one of my favorite Marvel movies so far, it was a intense, funny, heartwarming, gutclinching roller-coaster with amazing attention to detail. I don't wanna spoil it for anyone so im just gonna say it was as close to a perfect score 9/10 a movie of this type can get, I don't even know what to compare it to, nothing i'v seen in the past comes close to what this was, it felt fresh new and innovative! I loved it! If im gonna give it some critique, I would have to say that there was one scene in the middle of the movie that didn't really make sense to me, something about a gravity controller making guns not work, oh and the clip after the end credits kinds got me worried, will we soon see ducks in space? ;) hehehe Howard? but whatever, it might be epic in its own right, Rocket sure was a gritty raccoon and ""WE ARE GROOT!""!.THINGS WILL GET EASIER!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
10 out of 10,This movie is unpredictable...if you avoid the many movie clips that is. It is heartwarming. Yes. It has action. Yes. They also mixed in a lot of comedy and adventure. It has a little romance...very little. It is well written with great special effects and so it is really easy to recommend to the PG-13 movie crowd.I intend to buy it the second it comes out.Marvel and Disney are going to make a ton of money on this excellent film. It is the best of all the Marvel films they have done.

Every joke by him was always on point and very funny.Another plus was the soundtrack.Every song was just so good.It fit the story.

"In Another Galaxy Far, Far Away","This film is recommended.Finally a comic book blockbuster that doesn't take itself so seriously and never gets bogged down with all of its mythological narratives and sci-fi claptrap as so many do. Here is a film which also gives itself time to establish interesting characters and situations before all the CGI kicks in, with full doses of humor and wit to spare. Such is this unexpected surprise called Guardians of the Galaxy. Yes, one can easily see the Marvel franchise concocting sequel after sequel of this motley crew and their fool-hardy adventures in future installments, but just sit back and enjoy this original source while you can.This film is a fine send-up to the 1977 granddaddy of them all, George Lucas' Star Wars. It even follows its characters and plot somewhat. Just substitute Hans Solo, Luke, Princess Leia, Chewbecca, and the droids for this new group of space age crusaders: Peter Quill (Chris Pratt, totally buff, confidently sexy, and channeling a young Harrison Ford), a handsome daredevil of a pilot, Gamora , a Xena-like warrior princess (played by Zoe Saldona a.k.a. the reigning Sci- Fi Queen, thanks to an impressive resume that includes Avatar and the Star Trek films), and, as comic relief, a trio of cohorts including Drax (overly muscled WWF wrestler Dave Bautista), Groot (a walking talking stick figure voiced by Vin Diesel) and a CGI wise-cracking gun-toting raccoon named Rocket, who gets most of the best comic one-liners (superbly delivered by Bradley Cooper). Yes, a new generation of misfit heroes for a new generation has arrived.The far-too-convoluted yet simple-minded plot revolves around a missing and most powerful orb that can destroy the universe. (Shades of The Green Lantern!) Of course, there are an onslaught of villains, far too many, to serve as obstacles for our gang of heroes: Nebula (Karen Gillan), Korath (Djimon Hounsou), and as our modern day Darth Vader, a black hooded figure named Ronan (Lee Pace). Also aboard for the ride are: Glenn Close, Benicio Del Toro, and John C. Reilly in small and seemingly insignificant parts (at least in this first chapter). But none of that really matters. It's the exciting action sequences and the interrelationship between the film's characters that are the important elements for this film to succeed, and succeed it does! While much of the battle sequences lack visual focus with invasive upfront close- ups and shaky camera-work, the essence of comic book pandemonium is still up there on the screen.Solidly directed by James Gunn, with a clever screenplay by Nicole Perlman and Gunn himself, Guardians of the Galaxy is a nostalgic throwback to more innocent times. Its purposeful 70's pop music score helps bask in the glory of a happier era, when science fiction was once king, so long before all the gore and violence seeped into its core. But that was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...GRADE: B",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Really? An 8.1? Ok. I guess,"Now, I watched this back when it came out, so I remember less to nothing as far as the plot goes, but this ain't about that specifically (To be fair, I forgot the plot as soon as I left the theater). I'm seeing either ridiculously high or low scores for this, but chill out, people. It was just alright.The characters are ok, nothing amazing, but there's enough there so I don't hold them with contempt. Comedy is subjective, but it was generally ok. Music's ok. That's right, I said it. It's just a lot of ""hey, remember this song?"", but movies do that. Jackson 5 was a little much, but whatever. Story was...I don't remember, so nothing special.All this movie was meant to be was a rag-tag group of characters coming together and doing a thing. And it did acceptable at that. I can say without a doubt that this movie is largely inoffensive, and basically good.Any score for this above a 7 is ludicrous, as is anything below a 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"It's Okay, But It Is A Very Familiar Marvel Story Could Have Been Better.","Another Marvel picture to expand their universe a little more. However, this didn't live up to the hype or the fanboy hysteria, well, not for me.I have to say though the special effects crew were running on all cylinders as the visuals are truly spectacular and as close to flawless as you could get. It was pretty difficult to see where the CGI kissed the reality. Much respect for the crew.Respect too to the Director James Gunn who did a splendid job keeping the action flying and the drama, what little there was, at a steady pace and flow.However, I would have liked the formula to be a little different as it ran straight in line with all the other Marvel films. As soon as they knew they had a winning formula with Avengers Assemble their team movies have kept to that style, which unfortunately is running thin.As for the characters, they could be interchangeable with others from the movie universe. Personally, I would have loved to see the original version of Star-Lord who was a much stronger character than the one here, who is a cross between Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark... He even had the ego and nerve to call himself ""Star-Lord"" - what an arsehole. This should have been the title handed down to him from his father, who was a Universe Policeman. It also would've been nice to have had his original ship as it was a living entity and a character in its own right - but no, we stick to the formula.Gamora was just a green skinned Black Widow... with some of the same moves.Drax was a less powerful Hulk. Though he had the inevitable ""The bad guy killed my family"" scenario, where the Hulk's incentive is to SMASH... Drax has the same compulsion but to KILL.The best thing, by far, were the two CGI characters of Rocket Raccoon and Groot who were brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Cooper's vocal portrayal was so perfect for the character; and even though Groot only said ""Groot"" Diesel added depth and character to every ""Groot"" spoken.These two also seemed to get the better scene's like the one where they're planning to escape but are wondering how they can get one of the escape plans components. While they are talking about this Groot just goes and gets it. Then when the action starts it's always Rocket you look to because this Racoon loves his weapons with a passion verging on obsession.Respect to the actors who portrayed the hero's as they all did a great job it's not their fault there wasn't much scope for character growth. I just think that Marvel is coming close to stereotyping themselves. They could do with spreading their wings a little wider.With that in mind, it would be nice to have a villain who isn't trying to conquer or destroy worlds, we've seen it before. when we finally get to the much hinted at and waited for Thanos what will he be doing? Oh yes, probably looking to destroy or conquer the world.Then there's the awesome 80's soundtrack courtesy of Peter Quill's walkman... where does' he get the batteries from? Probably that's what the Ravagers were stealing on Earth when they picked him up. The director uses the soundtrack to it's greatest potential. Well done.All in all, it's a well told and fantastically rendered story, though all too familiar, with great action sequences, so leave your brain at the door and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Star Wars of the MCU,"SYNOPSIS:
Starlord (Chris Pratt) and a group of misfits get together to ensure Ronan (Lee apace) doesn't get his hands on the powerful orb.REVIEW:
If you know me, then you know by me calling this the ""Star Wars"" of the MCU doesn't have the greatest connotation. I am slightly biased as I'm not really a fan of fantasy films (more so meaning different worlds and non-human looking characters) and I'm not a big fan of movies set in space. With that being said, I don't hate the film. I know so many people have this in their top 5, but for me it's a lower half film. Although, I do love Chris Pratt, I think there's a few moments where his acting really missed. This occurs over the course of the MCU films that he appears on. There are simply a lot of space fighting scenes that I just get bored by and the strong point for me is the scene in the prison and the soundtrack. I also find Nebula's character extremely corny. Far too intense for my liking and whenever they try to give her a comedic line it falls so incredibly flat for me. It hurts for me to say that cause I love Karen Gillian. I'm also not a big fan of Rocket. It's hard for me to be critical to his character since I feel it's just a taste thing for me. I don't find him funny and I'm not ever waiting for him to be on screen. Again, I love Bradley Cooper though. A couple things I do enjoy are Drax, Groot, Starlord (for the most part) and as I mentioned earlier the prison scene and the soundtrack.I know it sounds like I hate this film based off the review I just made, but honestly, I'm right in the middle. I don't really care to see it again, but I know I probably will some day and I'm at peace with that. 6.0/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fun - Hip - Entertaining - Own This DVD For Your Library.....,When a film comes to the ending credits and you feel remorse because its over - you've just seen a great movie. That's exactly how I felt last night having watched Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time. I couldn't wait to get home and order a DVD online so I could watch it again and again. This movie packs so much fun and action into it you feel somewhat exhausted by all the excitement. The nostalgia of a 70's sound track is novel and shows how original the writers were in conceiving this script. The CGI is perfect and I've never seen so many moving objects in a CGI screen before and I'm told this is a tell for the size and power of the super computer used to make the incredible fighter ship scenes - it was in a word awesome and not to be missed. The acting and directing are flawless and again using live and animated characters side by side were executed perfectly. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the sheer adrenaline and over powering thrills it generates in an audience. See it at least once in a big screen movie house to get the full impact of the screen and the audience.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My favorite movie so far this year!,"'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY': Five Stars (Out of Five)Sci-Fi superhero flick based on the popular Marvel Comics team, of the same name. It was directed by James Gunn and written by Gunn and first time film writer Nicole Perlman. Gunn is mostly well known for directing and or writing (or co-writing) popular indie cult classics like 'SLITHER', 'SUPER' and 'TROMEO AND JULIET'; this is his first big budget blockbuster (and it was produced with a $170 million budget). It stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Lee Pace, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. John C. Reilly, Djimon Hounsou, Glen Close, Benecio Del Toro and others also play parts in the film. The story revolves around a group of misfit outlaws who attempt to keep a powerful orb out of the hands of a monstrous villain named Ronan. It's my favorite movie so far this year.Pratt plays a thief named Peter Quill. He goes by Star-Lord and travels around space hooking up with hot young alien women and stealing valuable artifacts. He was abducted from Missouri as a child, shortly after his mother died, and raised by smugglers called Ravagers. When Quill betrays Yondu Udonta (Rooker), the leader of the Ravagers, Yondu puts a bounty on him. Quill stole a valuable orb for him but doesn't deliver it. The price on his head attracts the attention of a genetically modified raccoon, named Rocket (Cooper), and his tree-like friend, named Groot (Diesel). Quill also runs into an alien assassin, named Gamora (Saldana), who wants the orb so she can keep it out of the hands of her employers, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and Ronan (Pace). When the four outlaws are captured and imprisoned, by the Nova Corps, they decide to team up to escape. They also join forces with a warrior named Drax the Destroyer (Bautista), who wants revenge on Ronan for killing his family.I found this film to be immensely entertaining; it's the type of movie I grew up on and became fascinated by filmmaking because of. It reminds me of a classic 80's sci-fi flick, in the same league as 'STAR WARS' or 'STAR TREK', and the characters are all really enjoyable. The performances are all great (especially Cooper in my opinion) and Gunn did an amazing job directing and co-writing the script. The soundtrack is perfect and it's a beautiful movie to look at too. I laughed, I cried, I was really thrilled and entertained by it; it has a little bit of everything in my opinion. I couldn't praise the movie more; it's a near perfect film.

This is the new benchmark,"What is the point of continuing to make films when you have made an action packed extravaganza like the Avengers already? The answer is so that you can produce a film like Guardians of the galaxy! Essentially, Guardians is everything that was right about the Avengers, minus what was wrong with it (not that there was much wrong with it).The story is extremely well paced, with no time to get bored between the action scenes as these are separated with essential plot details and very amusing comedy lines. The villain does not get to do much, but this film has to introduce so very many characters, locales, items and ideas that the lack of development for the bad guy can be expected and not judged to badly.Rocket and Groot steal so many of the scenes that it automatically makes them the easiest characters to love, but Pratt's Star Lord is still a great character perfectly cast. Gamora was not as lethal as I would have liked, but was still well played and Dave Bautista As Drax is the best performance i have seen from a wrestler, being better than even Dwane Johnson.The special effects are visually stunning, with lots of colour and detail in the environments. Rocket and Groot look amazing and the first proper look at Thanos was also pleasing. Even the make-up effects look good, when added to the performance of Micheal Rooker, you get even better supporting characters to compliment the main cast.If the success of Avengers gave Marvel the confidence to make this relatively obscure comic into a film, then i hope that this film brings in the kind of money that proves it was the right choice so that more brilliant characters can be shown to the general public.

"Not your typical Marvel Movie, likable characters and great soundtrack.","First and foremost, I'm an 70s and 80s music fan and to think that they incorporate such soundtrack in this Marvel film is just a piece of art.Not a typical explosions-laser shooting-spaceship fighting movie. The variety of physical and mental attributes of the main characters gave Gunn (director/writer) lots of opportunities to avoid simplistic and typical fight scenes. I like the balance of profanity in this film such that adults won't feel like they're watching a film entirely made for kids. The humor might at times is worthy only for a smile but some scenes never fail to crack me up. I like how they incorporate Quill's earthly tethers and belongings so as to remind viewers that he's still a human being like us on a great galactic adventure. As a marvel movie, it may not have some epic shots like Hulk punching a large-ass spaceship or Iron Man in a process of wearing his suit, but this film has it's own VFX magic spread in bits throughout the movie like a peanut butter and jelly evenly spread on bread. GotG does not have dead ends and it just starts on rolling since the beginning of the movie and you're going to walk out of that cinema without having a single thought that you've wasted money and time for this movie. I had high expectations before I watched the movie and those expectations were met.This movie is a great addition to the Marvel arc and they showed us something we never knew we wanted to see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Like someone else already said - ""A New Hope""","I have a strange history with the Guardians of the Galaxy, that rag-tag team of intergalactic mercenaries (and more or less, superheroes) most famous for their appearances in comic books published by Marvel Comics.The first I heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, was in 2008, when Marvel Comics debuted a new line-up, which was a reboot of the first Guardians of the Galaxy team that first appeared in 1969. For one reason or another, I skipped over it. Then last year, a friend of mine who owns a comic book store sold me a copy of ""Guardians of the Galaxy #1"" for $45, at a discount from its original price of $50. I read through the book quickly to get an idea of what it was about, but I didn't absorb the details then like I should have.Fast-forward to tonight: I just got done watching James Gunn's big-budget 2014 adaptation of the comics, ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" I have to say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" has a chance to be A New Hope (hint, hint) for superhero movies.You see, since 2004, I've grown increasingly disappointed in the state of superhero movies. Readers familiar with my posts on here, know that ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), is, in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie ever made. I say this because, not just because Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero, but because ""Spider-Man 2"" captured on film EXACTLY what made the comics so revolutionary when they first appeared on the scene in 1962: it was the perfect cinematic update for Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man because it made us all realize that being a superhero is not an easy task, and was not something that Peter Parker (played there excellently by Tobey Maguire) was not entirely willing to bear - exactly as it happened in the original comics. Ever since ""Spider-Man 2,"" I've waited for another superhero film to capture that same pathos, genuine emotion, and being able to make a genuine connection to our version of the ancient Greek gods, but alas, I've been continually disappointed.That's not to say that superhero films made since then have been bad - quite the opposite - but I've just been looking for something with more feeling, and meaning, attached to it.Or something just different altogether. ""Chronicle"" in 2012 represented a breath of fresh air to what at that time, I felt, was an ailing genre. Now, with ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" I see a novel, off-beat property get a lively, big-budget adaptation for the 2014 superhero craze.""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is all of ""Star Wars,"" Indiana Jones, and superheroes all rolled into one. (A New Hope for superheroes movies that combines so many different elements from so many different properties into one.) Though I know very little off-hand about the series, I came out of this film definitely more informed than going in. The film begins in 1988, with young Peter Quill losing his dying mother to cancer (thus representing the film's most - and only real - sincere and heartfelt moment, which coincidentally brings up painful memories for me, being that I lost my mother earlier this year to cancer in much the same fashion young Peter does). Immediately afterward, he's abducted by aliens and then we're catapulted 26 years into the future and into another galaxy, Far, Far, Away from our own.Peter Quill/Star-Lord (now played by Chris Pratt), is a mercenary, wannabe Indiana Jones going around the galaxy trying to retrieve priceless artifacts for his handler (emphasis on the wannabe, because he tries, and fails, to live up to his ""Star-Lord"" moniker, often with hilarious results), infamous blue-skinned space pirate Yondu Udonta (Gunn regular Michael Rooker). A wanted man by intergalactic authorities, Quill's travels bring him together with several other hard-luck losers, freaks, and outcasts (and all-around bad-asses): the green-skinned assassin Gamora (""Avatar"" Zoe Saldana); hulking, vengeance-seeking Drax (professional wrestler Dave Bautista); the wise-cracking gun-slinger - and my personal favorite and break-out character to hopefully rival the popularity of the X-Men's Wolverine - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper); and Rocket Raccoon's mindless muscle, a walking tree stump known only as Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Together, these five unlikely anti-heroes must come together to save the universe from Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), who wishes to lay waste to a nearby planet full of billions of innocent people using a newly discovered orb of mysterious and deadly power.It must be said that Troma graduate James Gunn (who also wrote Zack Snyder's 2004 breakthrough hit ""Dawn of the Dead"") has fashioned himself a different - not necessarily new - superhero film. Screen-time is evenly divided up amongst the five leads, who all turn in wry, slightly self-knowing performances. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" plays well throughout its 121-minute running time. Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon oozes slyness, coolness, and general bad-a**ery. Quite frankly, in the theater his character seemed to get the best response from everyone. And in true Marvel Comics fashion, beneath his hard-edged exterior lies an unwanted mutant freak of nature with no mission or purpose in life and no real connections to anyone else in the universe (except for Groot, that is).""Guardians of the Galaxy"" looks to be A New Hope for the superhero movie genre - a superhero movie that combines ""Star Wars,"" Indiana Jones, and superheroes all into one. Let's wait and see what they can do with this one.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Dance off bro!!! me and you!!,"Inconsistency with villain and sidekicks, Rated it like a comedy movie that it is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A refreshing surprise,"I went into guardians with pretty low expectations. Marvel has been hitting its stride in bringing its comics to the big screen, but Guardians faced several hurdles. First and foremost, the Guardians and their villains rely on more 'cosmic' threats and are less well known than their counterparts. Your average person on the street likely knew who (at least generally) Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor were before the movies. That's less likely to be true about the larger cosmic universe unless you grew up on Silver Surfer or Captain Marvel.Its second problem rested on bringing a larger universe to the audience in a well received method. Marvel tested its chops in the Thor movies, but even there we were on a 'subway' system of planets with fixed tracks, rather than just an all-encompassing universe.Given these concerns, I was hesitant about guardians. But Marvel nailed it. Guardians is unlikely to bring home any major awards, but it is a pointedly FUN movie, and its more than just a popcorn view. It produces some real laughs, and some real emotions from the audience as you follow its story. It also ties into the rest of the Marvel movies and helps develop their over-arching plot.Ultimately, the weakest elements of Guardians is the main antagonist, its villain. While all of the actors deliver great performances (Quill and Rocket in particular), the villain feels either over-exposed or under-developed. In other words, we see him often enough that we should be learning more about him, but never do. If your villain is going to be an embodiment of evil, it needs to be treated like Jaws and limited in its screen time. If, on the other hand, you want a developed villain like Loki, we need to learn more about him. The main villain is stuck in the middle, and while it's not his fault, it is noticeable.Guardians is good enough that when you walk out, you'll be looking forward to the next one. And more than that, its a breath of fresh air from what are beginning to feel like the ""safer"" marvel franchise. It explores new areas, and new characters, and it does it well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Nothing New,"In a galaxy far far away, a part human, a green lady, a brute, a talking raccoon and a walking tree set out to save a purple stone, which can cause a purple explosion, from falling into the wrong hands. That is Guardians of the Galaxy. There is nothing more to it.All the characters are one-dimensional with generic interests in the mission; Peter Quill, the part-human outlaw (Chris Pratt), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and the magic tree (Bruce Willis) are only interested in the payoff and of course in the end they change their motive to saving the world, without any apparent reason. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the obligatory lady in the team, knows how evil the villains are and wants to stop them. The extremely annoying Drax (Dave Bautista) wants to avenge his murdered family. And the villains want the purple stone to take over the world. Why do they want this particular stone, don't they have any other explosives with them? Who knows.There is the overused cliché of circumstances bringing the motley bunch of heroes together, them having an adventure and becoming friends at the end of it. But none of them share any chemistry between them and is it hard to see what made them become friends. Not that we care though; we know they would all end up as friends and so they do.We don't care about anything else in the movie either. We hardly know our heroes and since it is the Marvel Universe, we know none of them would die. The planet, the villains are threatening to destroy is alien, we know nothing about its denizens and again, we know it is going to be saved. The stakes never seem high.The movie, however, is visually pleasing. 3D has been used innovatively. CG is realistic and the worlds created using it are beautiful. The action is good. There are some funny moments and good one-liners. There is nothing new though. It has a run-of-the-mill feel to. Watch it if you like generic action flicks or a die-hard fan of Marvel comics.

Marvel's Best,"A tree trunk that says 3 words, a lady with a regrettable past, a raccoon with an attitude and a guy who has a chip on his shoulder, and a kid whose past haunts him to become a hero. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel's best movies to date. Yes, I am giving one of the biggest franchises a compliment. This movie was really cool.The cast in this movie was just superb – Chris Pratt, to the lovely Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close – this cast was the best ever assembled since The Avengers. Racing across the galaxy to save the inhabitants of a planet from the tyrannical reign of Ronan (Lee Pace). We see that Ronan is after an orb to gain powers that any human could not contain it – or they die. But with the power in Ronan, it makes him more powerful and undefeatable. But with teamwork and a little faith, from the Guardians – Ronan is defeated.This movie was pretty awesome – I would have to say.

Liked it a LOT more than I thought I would!,"Marvel took a risk with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"": it's based on a fairly obscure series about an obscure team made up of obscure characters. While the GotG comics have been around for decades, they just aren't as popular or well known as the X Men, the Avengers or Spider-man. On a related note, the team is made of up morally ambiguous, down & dirty, rough-around-the edges- characters characters who aren't quite upstanding role models like Wolverine, Captain America, and Spidey. Some might even say that Marvel was scraping the the bottom of the barrel, or at least getting close.Well, the risk paid off and there is indeed a reward.This is one the more fun--one could argue it's THE most fun--Marvel Comics movies. It feels like Indiana Jones or the Classic Star Wars Trilogy with colorful characters, thrilling action scenes that aren't so bombastic, and amusing banter. Things are even more fun thanks to a series of 70s hits played over the action at interesting times.The downside may be that it tries TOO hard to be fun, with the plot and humor getting in each other's way or how the more serious moments are almost out of place.Also...don't stick around for the post-credit scene this time. Just wait for the home media release. While other post-credit scenes in previous Marvel movies are interesting & intriguing, leaving you wanting more while setting up future installments, this one...doesn't. That's all I'll say to avoid spoilers.Few people may have been clamoring for a movie based on Guardians of the Galaxy, but many people will like the results.

Unrepentant,"Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 7/10Plot/script: 8/10Photography/visual style: 7/10Music/score: 9/10Overall: 7/10My key word to describe Guardians of the Galaxy is 'unrepentant'. It is what it is, and it stands proud of that, refusing to change to suit anyone's tastes. The genius of the film is that it convinces us to agree.British comics writer Dan Abnett revived the 1960s superhero team in 2008, imbuing it with the spirit of comics legend Jack Kirby, but also giving it a distinctly British edge. In American comedies, the characters are fundamentally friends, but the Guardians are more like those in a British sitcom: they hate each other, but are tied together by circumstances.The setting is that of a pretty silly, far-fetched space opera of the kind that might have existed in the 60s and 70s, but it is brought right up to date by several factors. The most obvious is the look: the most modern CGI is used, bringing two of the main stars - Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel's voice) - to life in a way that would not have been practical even 5 years ago. The settings and backgrounds are also massively enhanced by computer technology.While I am on the subject, it's worth pointing out that the film is as full of stars in the celebrity sense as astrological bodies. Cooper and Chris Pratt (as 'Star Lord' Peter Quill) have shown that they can headline major movies, while Diesel and Zoe Saldana can do the same for medium-sized ones. Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, Michael Rooker, Benicio Del Toro, Karen Gillan, Lee Pace... The list goes on.Something so massive in scale can become humourless, but that is never a risk with GotG. The film is so packed with humour that I would class it as at least partly comedy by genre, and this neatly punctures any sense of pompousness, roundly mocking every character even while enjoying their antics.The music is key. I never would have thought I could like these cheesy 60s and 70s pop tunes, but they are well chosen and inserted perfectly into the narrative - and even the plot - with great skill. In fact, one is part of the scene which I think is the thematic heart of the film. In a brief down-time, Star Lord tries to explain to Gamora (Saldana) why his music is so great, but she only understands when he just plays it to her. The message is the same for the film: ""If we explain it, you won't get it. Just watch it, and you'll realize it's awesome."" And I did.The message goes further, when applied to yourself: accept who you are, don't compromise or change for anyone, and people will eventually 'get' you. It's a wonderful sentiment, and very laudable, if a little convenient for fanboy nerds like me, who are presumably the core target audience. Maybe they were actually addressing themselves, and their shallow Hollywood colleagues; I don't know.Before its release, GotG was predicted by some to be Marvel's first big cinematic flop, but its joy, exuberance, wit and sheer self-confidence have made it, for many, the MCU's absolute highlight.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A real joy ride of a movie,"I have a soft spot for movies that take themselves with tons of levity and still do it properly. That is, while not regarding themselves with undue seriousness, still make the movie with the required amount of professional approach. Guardians of the Galaxy are topping the list on these accounts. The pace is relentless, the characters are ""out of this world"" (and you can take it as literally as you want). Acting is first class the plot is not as important (hence the 8 rating) but just like it worked in the R.E.D. movies, it works here. Nobody cares how much sense there's to the development of the narrative when watching it is so much fun. And as a native of the previous century - the inter movie jokes are super - written and delivered perfectly. This one may be an 8 rated movie but it feels like a 10.

I also heard the Star Wars similarities, a little bit of The Wizard of Oz, and (you got it) the plot is actually a no brainer once you get past a talking raccoon (with a wise cracking New York City attitude) and all of the characters you are meeting shooting at each other. Who are we rooting for? Oh, all of them. I get it... let the sci-fi predictable adventure begin.

Oof -- That was bad.,"LOL! An 8.1 rating at IMDb! It surely seems that the movie studios are automating the stock/robotic positive reviews that overtake this site for each new big budget failure. Come to think of it...I haven't had to fill out a CAPTCHA lately...hmmAnyhow, I made it about 45 minutes in before cutting my losses.Zoe Saldana basically plays the same uninspiring role in every movie she's in...here she's green, there she's blue. Chris Pratt's character seems like it came from the cutting room floor of an American Pie movie admixed with a touch of the Rocketeer. Pratt and Saldana have no chemistry together. The CGI cybernetic, jokester raccoon with the voice of Bradley Cooper is also among the worst characters ever conceived for a movie.The plot was meh at best and the whole production was dragged down by one of the worst screenplays ever put together. I mean it was really awful. Chock full of ""jokes"" and one-liners that just weren't funny. Not even smirk-worthy funny, let alone laughter-inducing. The dialog was artificial and embarrassing for whoever penned it. It was bad and s/he should feel bad for it. This movie tried way too hard to be Star Wars meets the Avengers and it wasn't successful at it.Also featured was too much exposition about what Ronin or Thanos had done or were trying to do; ""you're Draxx the Destroyer!"" type telling rather than showing. None of the characters were introduced in a logical or organic way; they mostly seemed shoehorned in.I think it says a lot about the acting when a CGI tree (hint: wooden) is the best of the bunch.Yes, you are Groot.

Brilliantly Fun!,"I think that I am going to start this review by saying that I cannot believe that the writer/director of a stinker film like Movie 43 actually also had a hand in writing and directed this film. James Gunn has completely redeemed himself, because Movie 43 was one of the worse films I have ever seen. Guardians of the Galaxy had a great story line and the acting was comical with non-stop action. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a galaxy scavenger (thief) who goes around collecting stuff that other people have commissioned him to acquire. That being said, he acquires an orb that apparently is very valuable to a lot of people. This sets up the film and the adventure begins. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) are some sort of bounty hunters and soon discovers that someone will pay a lot of money to bring in Peter (and his orb). During the film, the only words that Groot knows how to say are ""I am Groot"", but somehow Rocket has learned to understand him by his inflection rather than his words. This makes for a very endearing relationship. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) volunteers to get the orb from Peter and the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) agrees to let her go. The initial scene when all of these characters finally encounter one another was very funny and you kind of get to see what all of them are capable of (as far as fighting ability goes). Drax (Dave Bautista) joins the group shortly after the initial meeting. At first Drax is very self-absorbed and really has his own agenda (pretty much like everyone else), but soon comes to realize that the more the merrier (or whatever). The making of the sequel is already scheduled for 2017. I imagine that we will find out who Peter's father was because that is really the only cliff hanger in this film. Stan Lee made his usual cameo appearance as an elderly playboy (really?). Hell, I guess when you own so many characters you have the right to be whoever the heck you want to be. I recently downloaded an app called ""Run Pee"" which tells you when the best time to go to the restroom is during a movie. The app said there is no good time for this film.

We Are Groot,"An alliance uneasily develops between five diverse individuals, each after the same valuable orb, in this action-packed science fiction film. It turns out that the orb in question has the power to destroy entire universes, and while the protagonists are initially motivated by greed, willing to sell to the highest bidder, they gradually become the responsible heroes of the title as they instead try to keep the orb out of evil hands. With little explanation of how the orb works, it becomes little more than a Hitchcockian McGuffin, and with a truckload of explosive action sequences towards the end, the film often seems more interested in being a spectacle to look at than spinning a decent yarn. That said, the characters here are surprisingly three dimensional with the film getting most of its zest from how well they interact with each other. Chris Pratt is especially good as the wisecracking Earthling among them with a fondness for 1970s and 80s music, though the best moments are had by a talking raccoon and tree, both genetically modified to the point of being sentient. The film is a little dry in the moments when neither Pratt nor the raccoon nor the tree are on screen, but as they are present in over 90% of the movie, it is an enthralling ride overall even when the action becomes a tad mindless towards the end. The sci-fi content may not be great here, but the humour frequently works, and with such delightfully offbeat characters, it is easy to see why this hit the right note with many filmgoers when it was first released.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I am not familiar with graphic novel, so my expectations were based on last Marvel or DC hits. I was looking forward for another semi-dark adaptation with pretty deep character development. None of this was in here. 2. Obviously, the movie was orientated to younger crowd and family segment, I wasn't aware about. So you what you get in here is non-complex writing (I was 50/50 annoyed and amused by this through out the flick) and recently so liberal PG style bloodless violence. The movie felt to me as a mix between Star Wars franchise and Fantastic 4, with no potential to grow his own sequels (well if it will choose to grow with his audience, that could bring it to a new level). Visuals were top notch. Pacing was great. I won't be judging acting on this one. All in all great entertainment for any age, but most suitable for a family night out.

It all felt a bit pointless and silly after a while.Zoe Saldana looks pretty slim. Chris Pratt the ordinary guy isn't charismatic enough to lead a movie. Just cause he shed a few pounds doesn't mean he's suddenly watchable.

Guardians Of The Galaxy,"Guardians Of The Galaxy is just a pure fun sci-fi summer blockbuster that blindsided many people when it came out. Not many people expected it to have the success that it did mostly due to the fact that these characters were very obscure in Marvel lore. That obscurity gave the writers a chance to introduce for the first time on the silver screen five really relatable characters to root for, each with their own arc. The fun loving and bumbling Star Lord is a character who was abducted from earth and raised by a bunch of outcasts. At first, he like another Guardian was only in it for the money. However the film has him Bond with the others and begin to see that the value of life is more important. Gamora is the daughter of the Mad Titan Thanos who is only interested in stopping Ronan and her father from using the power stone to cause harm. Throughout the film she is a loner but her arc mostly revolves around learning to work with others. Rocket is not a raccoon to himself but we'll call him that. He was in it for the money and had no interest towards bonding with others. His character was the most interesting from this film, he was the last to join the group in the climatic battle and arguably he was the most stubborn. His arc not just centered around trying to learn the value in working with others but actually befriending them as well. His partner Groot loved people and by the way he is Groot. Groot's arc perfectly coincided with Rocket's in that he wanted Rocket to help others and was willing to make sacrifices to ensure that Rocket would. Groot's place in the Guardians created the emotional epicenter of the film. Drax, the last of the Guardians was a killer on a path to avenge the death of his wife and family. However after crossing paths with the other Guardians, needed to learn to work with them and not allow his grudge to get him killed. These are all five simple arcs that sum up the plot as a group of misfits trying to work with each other to stop a madman from using a power to conquer a world. Not an unfamiliar plot at all but the writing used to make the Guardians such realistic characters really helped make it feel fresh. Unfortunately that writing didn't save Ronan the accuser from being a pretty bland nothing of a villain. Roman's arc wasn't about anything other than being hungry for power over the Xandarians. No reasons why aside from the fact that they called him crazy this one time. Despite this though, this film is a summer blockbuster so I can forgive a slightly formulaic plot and bland villain based on the kind of movie this is. This movie is pure fun whether it's Star Lord dancing to ""Come And Get Your Love"" in the opening credits, to Rocket having Star Lord steal some guy's leg as a prank, to Yondu using his arrow to annihilate Roman's soldiers, and Star Lord challenging Ronan to a dance off just as he's about to commit global genocide. There are so many notable moments, sequences and songs in this film and if I'm being honest, this film has the best soundtrack of any Marvel film to date. Yes, there's some generic score music but the writers very much have you more keyed in on Star Lord's Walkman sound track. ""Ooh Child"", ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", and ""Hooked On A Feeling"" are just a few classics the film throws at you in creative ways to. For example, ""Hooked On A Feeling"" plays as Star Lord is being sprayed with a hose and you get to see... Those abs... Oh my. ANYWAYS, speaking of seeing things, the visual effects were very impressive, especially for the characters of Rocket and Groot. Rocket Raccoon looked like a real raccoon that could pick up a gun and blow somebody's fuckin' head off. Groot looked like a real sentient tree that smiled after annihilating an entire wave of Ronan goons. I think what really keeps this film going are the performances, even though Chris Pratt played himself. Is that a bad thing? No, the man is incredibly funny and did a great job, especially when the Guardians held hands at the climatic sequence. The other Guardians were unrecognizable as their alien characters. Actually I take that back, I can recognize Vin Diesel's mumbling anywhere but aside from him my statement stays the same. Bradley Cooper as Rocket in particular blew me away as I didn't know he had such a great range as an actor. From country singer to a bipolar eagle's fan to a talking raccoon, is there anything that man can't do? On a side note by the way, I loved Benicio Del Toro as the collector, he was unhinged as hell. I honestly wished he played a bigger role in the grand scheme of the MCU but to each their own I guess. Last but not least, the pacing was pretty solid as well. You could say that there were some scenes that may not have seemed to be needed in the film but I would be willing to counteract by saying that it is those scenes that help build the Guardians character. At the end of the day, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a fun summer sci-fi adventure that does lack a compelling villain and contain a few formulaic plot elements but it also has enough going for it for me to say it is one of the better Marvel movies to watch. While it wasn't as fresh as The Winter Soldier was, it certainly was just as fun. I'm gonna give the Guardians Of The Galaxy a 7 out of 10. I had twelve percent of a plan for writing this review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great Fun,"The Best Marvel film yet and best Superhero film of 2014 in my opinion. The humorous approach works. This is easily the funniest Marvel film yet. Rocket Racoon and Groot are fascinating and really funny characters. Every character gets their moment to shine and the team has great chemistry. The CGI and special effects are fine and there not a dull moment in this movie.There were few, just few cheesy and melodramatic scenes I was not a fan of. And I feel this film has an extremely weak end credit scene, not worth the wait.Still kudos to James Gunn and Marvel to make an incredibly fun ride.A strong 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
So many reasons,"What's everyone raving about? It is clear as day to me that this is a satisfactory movie at best and a dull movie at worst. It is not a great movie or even a very good movie. I realize I'm in the minority, but this movie was basically a remake of Flash Gordon (1980) combined with the Power Rangers movie with a few added clichés from Star Wars. While they were playing those 70s hits, I kept hoping for Queen to sing ""Flash! Agh! Savior of the universe!"" That would have actually been funny.It's a mess story-wise. It doesn't define it's world; if anything can happen for any reason (or no reason), then nothing's compelling or suspenseful. Action sequences are indecipherable in terms of cause and effect. I kept thinking I should be caring more. Like when the sisters were fighting. There seems to be some history there that made the fight meaningful, but it didn't register. The villain, a ripoff of the Emperor, Skeletor, and Ming, isn't interesting in the least. His motivations are never firmly established.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Super-fun time!,"-Guardians of the Galaxy is Marvel's newest and boldest movie about a rad-tag group of galactic outlaws who end up teaming up to save the galaxy! If that sounds cool and you think it should look like a Marvel Star Trek/Star Wars crossover than you are right! Because it rocked.-It was funny, well written, and had its touching moments with some killer action. It was SUPER funny actually. There was a lot to like and little to dislike I think.-The plot sounds absurd and you just have to go with it! If you have fun action movies like the A-Team than you won't like it. It really is a super fun story though! (Also, unlike other Marvel films) you really don't need to know anything about the story/characters at all! (Although it is not a bad idea to be caught up on some Marvel films like Thor 2) -The film has a very cliché feel and is a pretty predictable film with its conveniences, but it is still loads of fun! -The cast did well. Chris Pratt (Star Lord) nailed it and was very entertaining. Zoe Saldana (Gamora) and Lee Pace (Ronan) did pretty well, but the show stealers were Dave Bautista (Drax), Vin Diesel (Groot), and Bradly Cooper (Rocket)! The three characters were fun and hilarious and perfect with the actors! -The music was good, but not that memorable.-The effects were good. Not exactly Apes good, but good.-The content was PG-13. No nudity and not too much violence. Action and some language. It is not a young kid movie, but it is not horrible.-So Guardians of the Galaxy is not a super complex artwork of cinema, but it didn't try to be and it doesn't need to be! It is a super fun time and totally worth seeing in theaters!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Wonderous breath of fresh air,"After watching the 'hooked on a feeling' trailer with the ""what a bunch of a-holes"" line, I had a feeling that I'd really like this film and abstained from watching any more trailers so that the experience could be as fresh as possible.As the launch date got closer I would read the top line headlines of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but not venture further into the body of the review. By the time I was sitting in the chair, waiting for the film to start, my anticipation was definitely peaking and I hoped that it would reward my efforts.Oh how it did.Right off the bat, I was transported into a rich world of characters and a film that wasn't afraid to mix touching scenes with laugh out loud moments. The wonder of the characters and their bickering exchanges, sometimes in the midst of action scenes, was fabulously entertaining and involving.Initially I was concerned that I was being hit with too many characters and would lose track but I understood that the film needed to move along at a pace and was relieved that all the characters were fleshed out enough to make them recognisable and engaging.So many elements made it fun - Star lord's wisecracks, Gamora's fiestiness, Drax's hilarious literalism, Groot's big emotive eyes and Rocket's sense of humour.I thought Lee Pace under a ton of makeup was great as a properly evil bad guy and Michael Rooker, along with many of the other supporting actors, hit his marks to create memorable individuals.The special effects were wonderful but, and this is important, always served the film to visualise the director's vision rather than them be a fall back for a poor story (a la Dawn of the apes).I enjoy the Marvel films but was disappointed with Thor 2 and Cap 2. I felt they become a little formulaic with Thor's over reliance on Loki and the interesting character of Cap being submerged under a tidal wave of empty action scenes.GOTG was a wonderous breath of fresh air. A film that didn't need three films worth of back story to have me engaged but hit me with a plethora of fabulously different characters that I could like and root for from the virtual get go.As an experience, as a jolt of entertainment, I felt this exceeded The Avengers as the final battle had just a bit more weight to it. The film was prepared to kill characters off rather than the rather clone like bad guys of the final Avengers battle. This in turn meant there was more of a threat to the characters and hence you felt more 'on the edge of your seat'.Guardians was a great film and I'm so pleased that Marvel were prepared/brave enough to release James Gunn from the corporate shackles and let him and his script writing partner let themselves go. They've created characters and a universe that I'm desperate to revisit and turned this 42 year old man into a cinema awestruck 9 year old.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians Of The Galaxy,"Marvel has officially won the comic book game. Guardians Of The Galaxy features a talking raccoon, a kinda-talking tree, and some of the most batshit crazy stuff they've convinced the mass market to watch. Honestly, you're watching a movie with no guaranteed A-listers, from a comic book series almost no one has read.Chris Pratt is the read winner here, as Star Lord is a great character for him. It showcases his abilities as a leading man, as a comic leading man, as an empathetic leading man, and as a rather average leading man. He's good looking, but not in a freakish way. He's funny, but he's serious too.Zoe Saldana has another awesome role to chalk up to her resume. Why this girl isn't a leading lady already is shocking. They should have given her Lucy. She deserves to anchor her own movies.Also, Dave Bautista could be the next The Rock. He doesn't quite have the humor down, but then again neither did Dwayne Johnson when he was in The Mummy Returns. Dave Bautista handles the role of Drax, a character who doesn't understand sarcasm, and takes everything literally, with a tinge of humor that could hint at her having a bigger career.Bradley Cooper adds a bunch of humor to the role of Rocket. I didn't even recognize his voice. Michael Rooker and Lee Pace round out an strong supporting cast.The plot is basically everything you've seen before, reworked for maximum enjoyment. There's an origin story for Peter Quill, a scene right out of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and a film with a feel of a more comedic version of Star Wars.James Gunn does a magnificent job turning this niche franchise into a fully consumable product, and one that will be remembered favorably. James Gunn, who used to work for Troma, and directed the low-budget Slither, has shown a ton of promise here. I imagine we'll be seeing him directing a lot more in the future.The next Guardians Of The Galaxy film isn't for another 3 years, but that feels about right. You don't want to oversaturate the market, and every two years seems like too much. That's every other year, and for a big franchise like this, it needs room to breathe. More importantly, Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana need to field other movie offers. Saldana has now starred in some of the biggest franchises, including Guardians, Avatar, Star Trek, and even the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. It's time she got offered roles where she doesn't have to paint herself a bizarre color.Packed with action, laughs, and plenty of great pop culture references, Guardians Of The Galaxy is one of the best films of the summer.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

James Gunn is the greatest addition to MCU,"James Gunn changed MCU.Feige's biggest gamble paid off. How this C-List comic superhero group became one of fans favourites is all due to James Gunn and his comedy.Pre-Gotg MCU had comedy but after this movie's success MCU went full comedy. We wouldn't have gotten rebooted comedy Thor if it wasn't for this movie.This has the classic group with misfits. The casting is great, Sarah Hanley Finn is the greatest. This movie launched Chris Pratt higher to the stars in Hollywood. Batista left wrestling and his Drax is a favourite of mine, the unique flavour of humour he brings to the table. Gamora has great backstory and her set was good as Russos fully explored her to greatness, this is why I love MCU, different directors from different movie working together for betterment of whole story.
It was great decision to cast already A-list stars as voice over, Bradley brings everything great about Rocket.The comedy lands perfectly for me. Each character has a bit different style of humour for all people to enjoy at least one. Personally I love Rockets wits but Drax's unintelligence gets the biggest laugh out of me, the numerous times I quoted ' Nothing can go over my head, I will catch them'.Not only comedy, the story is also great with Thanos being build in the back while Gamora and Nebula has their toxic relationship, heart felt Mother-Son breakup with inspiring scenes of 'Take my hand', Rocket lossing Groot with his final line being 'We are Groot', this is such a wholesome movie with the right emotion and comedy.The villain might come as weak but his seriousness makes the scene of 'Dance-Off' much better. James Gunn went full comedy and has a lot of fun with cosmic concepts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not much of the story or character development, but the 70s music and the humour keep the movie interesting,","Quite a fresh and humorous origin story for a group of vigilantes-turned-heroes. The plot is quite predictable and there's no character development at all, but the movie doesn't take itself too seriously at any moment and it's aware of it, and that certainly works in its favour. The 70s music comeback for a superhero film was quite a surprise, and it worked wonders for the storytelling. The spectacular sets and the brilliant special effects certainly add to the beauty of the film. With a little more story and character development, it would have been more memorable (like this year's other origin story, 'Big Hero 6').The cast is well selected, especially Chris Pratt. Voice-over from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is also quite well done. Supporting roles performed by talented actors like Glenn Close, Josh Brolin, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro were small but amusing. It was interesting to see Lee Pace's transformation from the Elven King Thranduil (in 'The Hobbit') to the dark and psychotic revenge-ridden villain Ronan in this one.Hope the future parts have better storyline and character development, and hope it maintains the humour and 70s music charm of this part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Boring; Why the Hype?,"Billed as a funny sort of superhero movie. Unfortunately, it's superhero elements are not nearly as good as a normal Marvel movie, and it's not much funnier than a normal Marvel movie. That leaves it in no- man's land.It does have some funny moments, nearly all of which belong to Bautista or Bradley Cooper. In my opinion, though, the humor is trumped by the endlessssssss random scenes of things blowing up when you can't tell which side is which (and worse, you don't care). The humor also seemed about as frequent as a typical Iron Man flick -- that's not a bad thing, unless your movie depends on its humor to save it.I won't give plot details, but there are layers and layers of bad guys, and you will never understand what motivates them. Even worse, you can't figure out what motivates the good guys, other than they have to be the good guys because a bunch of other people are the bad guys.The dialog is worthy of a Hayden Christensen performance in a Star Wars film. Characters explaining what we can clearly see on screen (in a pitch black room ""It's hard to see in here."")There's a montage explanation of how they are going to save the world -- a time saving trick done a million times before, except here you only want them to save the world QUICKLY so the movie will end. There are completely flat and useless performances from Glenn Close and Benicio del Toro (they'll make money, but they cannot be proud). Their characters could have been played by anyone.I will say that if you liked the Lego Movie, you MIGHT like this. I also thought the Lego Movie was over-hyped, but at least it was a movie like nothing that has been done before, so it was a visual spectacle. This is just clichéd dialog, a meaningless plot and characters you have no interest in.The only theory I can develop for the disconnect between what I thought and all the reviews is that this is this decade's version of camp, understood as such only by college-age folks and younger. If so, it almost certainly will seem to any woman over 30 and any man over 40 as simply a bad film that's trying to get away with something (and apparently will succeed).",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel's Star Wars!,"Guardians of the Galaxy launched in 2014 to surprisingly good box office numbers and amazing reviews from critics. And then came one of Marvel's most unlikely franchises-to-be; and what a franchise Guardians has become! I remember watching this film for the first time when it came out. A raccoon, a tree, that guy from Parks-and-Rec as 'Not-Han-or-Luke' StarLord, Uhura as a green alien, and... Dave Bautista's in this!? I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and the thrill it gave the audience. It's a space opera in the superhero world of Marvel, and it's an intergalactic love-letter to George Lucas' films of the 70s and 80s. You can see Indiana Jones at parts, you can sense Star Wars when there's moments similar to The Original Trilogy in terms of character chemistry and scale, yet this has the heart of a superhero movie. It's got the fun of Sam Raimi's first two SpiderMan movies, it succeeds where green LAntern failed and it doesn't need to be somber like Batman movies. Guardians of the Galaxy is its own thing.Needless to say: I love this film! When I was missing Star Wars until The Force Awakens came along, I had Guardians and Interstellar to occupy myself with in the meantime. I'm glad that this film was successful; it's cinema-escapism that's pretty irresistible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Where does Star-Lord get batteries for his Walkman?,"Yup, I think writer/director James Gunn has done enough to make everyone forget about Joss Whedon. Bringing forth his big screen adaptation of an obscure team of Marvel superheroes called the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gunn's sense of humor and strong grasp of what made so many of the action/adventure films of the 70's and 80's so memorable, has single-handedly created another profitable layer to the Marvel film franchise.This origins story follows our main protagonist Peter ""my friends call me Star-Lord"" Quill (Chris Pratt) as he creates an unlikely alliance with a band of intergalactic misfits, including Gamora (a green Zoe Saldana) Rocket (a raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper) his sidekick Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel?) and Drax the Destroyer (played by Bautista, of WWE fame) who is basically Sheldon after a year of Crossfit, as they attempt to stop the evil Ronan the Accuser from obtaining an orb that could destroy an entire species in one fell swoop. Needless to say, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" shares a lot of similarities with Star Warswell, if the original Star Wars trilogy had focused on the life and times of Han Solo instead of boring old Luke Skywalker.When critics say Gunn is breaking the Marvel mold with this movie, I don't know that that's altogether true. Yes, this is the first (if I'm not mistaken) Marvel film that has little to do with Earth. And yes, it does have a strong comedic element, but so has every other Marvel film since the Disney takeover. What Gunn does do that is quite innovative, is strategically positions the strong comedic element as the star of the show, which along with the cast and an awesome late 60's/early 70's mixtape inspired soundtrack, creates a fun atmosphere first and foremost; even though he's working with a story and characters which may lack the depth of most other heroes in the Marvel universe. He is also responsible for casting Vin Diesel in the first role worthy of his limited acting abilities. With that move alone, I must give Mr. Gunn mad props. Here's to hoping that Diesel is regulated to one or two lines of dialogue in every movie he does moving forward.Chris Pratt: I think we all knew that Chris Pratt was leading man material. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" just works to enforce this notion. Pratt, an actor who can seamlessly move back and forth between genres, is more than half of the reason why this comic book movie will be entertaining enough to satisfy your average Marvel movie-goer, while finding an audience with those who would otherwise steer clear of anything ""comic book"", as he gives both a dramatic and comedic performance as the protagonist Peter Quill (an endearingly overconfident character who maintains an underdog fueled moxie, which stems from his 1980's American upbringing) that is worth the price of admission.Final Thought: ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" has pretty much everything one could ask for in a superhero movie: An engaging lead, fully developed supporting sub-heroes, a badass villain, comedy, well choreographed action sequences and a raccoon that shoots machine guns. That said, is ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" the best Marvel adaptation ever made? No. But is it the funniest? Most definitely.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the best superhero films of the galaxy,"This film, while it has a thin-ish plot and unoriginal villains who aren't as interesting as other great comic book villains, makes up for that in full with hilarious comedic relief in almost every scene, believable character motives and development as well as good pacing. I loved basically everything about this film. I also like how the main hero, Peter Quill, is just some ordinary Joe Shmoe who happens to get blasted onto a great adventure and meets great friends along the way. Perhaps the most interesting character, though, is Rocket Raccoon, who is voiced greatly by Bradley Cooper. There is hardly any reason to not go see this film. Plus it is, for the most part, family friendly and the humor is well written. Possibly Marvel's greatest film yet.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A successful transition from comic, to movie. Not just one movie, or one comic series, but a whole universe brought together simply because someone had a vision of greatness. Not to mention Stan Lee's cameo was great in this film.I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an X-Motion seat, also known as D-Box. D-Box is a chair that will move during the duration of the film, at least during the action scenes. I've seen a few movies in this seat ranging from Man of Steel, Journey 2, Transformers, Lucy, and Star Trek: Into Darkness. None of those movies were worth the price to watch in those seats. But Guardians of the Galaxy, this movie people, is worth every cent just to watch it in those seats. This movie is worth checking out. I can't promise you will like it, or love it.

"Not as good as i hoped, but still great","This movie is not better than the avengers. This movie is not better than Captain America 2. This is not the best Marvel movie. This may conflict with a lot of people's opinions, but its true. I wanted to adore this movie. I could picture it at the top of my top 10 movies of the year list. I was practicing what i'd say in my review video on YouTube. Then i saw the movie. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie. Very enjoyable. But nothing that new or original, which is what i desperately wanted from this movie: to be something completely new that we'd never seen before. The best thing about this movie are the characters. While some, Gamora, are never really built upon as much as others and some, Drax, do become very dull at times, they are all interesting characters. Part of what people were complementing James Gunn about was setting up all these characters in one movie as opposed to Joss Whedon, who worked with characters that had already been established in several movies beforehand. At sometimes, the development is great: i especially liked a scene in which Rocket Raccoon had an emotional breakdown. However, Drax's obsession with finding Ronan eventually became a bore and i got sick of it pretty quickly. Rocket and Groot were great, although i thought that they weren't really shown as having that trademark friendship that they have in the comics. The relationship was there at some specific scenes, although most of the time Rocket thought that Groot was acting stupid, insulting him and using him solely for muscle. Chris Pratt as Star Lord was the best performance in the movie, and he brought a lot of charisma to the character. My main problem was the generic plot. This plot felt like it had been recycled from the Avengers, or any generic team based movie. There's that signature moment where all the team members are defeated and scattered (like in the avengers) only to have them spurred into action again. They start off hating each other and end up being best friends. There is literally a scene where Groot takes out a group of bad guys in a hallway that was basically the same as the Hulk/Loki scene in the Avengers. Don't fix something that isn't broken i guess, but i hoped for something more original. I also think the end credit scene was a massive kick in the balls for anyone expecting something epic to hold them over to Avengers 2. James Gunn hyped it up so much i was really looking forward to it, and it ended up just being a joke. Literally. While i have these complaints, i must say that this movie is enjoyable. Its a good first step into the Marvel cosmos universe, but i hope the issues can be improved upon in the future sequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Terrible story, but funny and worth it","If the film were to take itself seriously, it would have been horrible. BUT, as the director fully understood the limits of his script, he turned it into a virtual parody at which the main characters seem quite aware they're just pulling a shtick. They look at the camera without appearing really solemn for even a second. There are several ludicrous discrepancies in the story and a reviewer accustomed to deep stuff would throw this down the stairs, but the atmosphere of this fast-paced picture is replete with so much action and rich visual effects, the common man will not even notice. It leaves little room for thoughts like ""WTF is this"". Bottom line, this is quite entertaining. It will amuse you greatly, and that's just about that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy,"Normally I kind of avoid these Marvel movies, not because I have anything against them, but they just never interest me enough to start watching. You know what you are getting into 99% of the time, blockbuster fun, but that's it.Guardians was a lot more tolerable for me as it wasn't filled with superheroes and their witty dialog every 5 seconds. Starlord is pretty much the only one that has that witty comedic relief and that's good enough. The other characters are a bit more serious, wel.. to an extent of course. I really liked Drax, but pretty much the whole crew was fine. Yondu was a great side-antagonist. The weakest link of this move would be Ronan in my opinion, just never really worked as a villain, never felt that intimidating. Like Drax said, just a puppet. And when that is your main antagonist it makes it all a bit weak.Directing is solid and the VFX is fantastic as expected by now for most Marvel movies. The finale has some stunning scenes, great music and nice editing.Music/score is great, memorable enough, but also a tad generic action/heroic. That said when it hits, and it's used sparingly, it works. Scenes are elevated to epic events. Besides the score there is a signature element to this movie namely the 80s music played by Starlord and on his tape. They add a needed flair to some scenes but I felt that they could've been used better sometimes, or that the scenes were not as engaging when the music played as I'd hoped. Minor nitpick though as the music selection is fantastic.Story is good, everything is tied up neatly so no unresolved annoying plotlines. Like said before the villain felt somewhat weak and fell to the background in favor of the crew and their dynamic/adventures. Funnily enough the story, especially finale reminded me a bit of Star Wars a New Hope, big ship trying to destroy a planet..fleets and fighter pilots in spaceships trying to attack the big ship, you get it. That's said I'm reaching a bit.So all in in all I was entertained, not unexpected. But it's not a particularly memorable movie with a strong emotional hook, incredible performances or intense moments. But it worked as a solid blockbuster.

James Gunn pulls out an ace knitting together complex characters and yet not losing the plot as a whole which keeps the audience within this absolutely stunning galaxy at all timesEspecially loved the characters of 'Groot' and 'Rocket' bringing Spark to each frame they are in. Chris Pratt is excellent as the Charming Outlaw. Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista are great as well.Special Mention to the Humor in the movie which keeps with the thrill.Guardians of the Galaxy not only provides a great cinematic experience in visuals but also well narrated story line to kick start another Marvel series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"The Crazy Uncle of the Marvel Family, Guardians of the Galaxy is the comic book wild card that entertains from start to finish","The Marvel enterprise has been practically saved by Disney as it's become more structured, more organized, more successful, and less prone to ill decisions since the buyout from the House of Mouse. Love or hate them, Disney knows how to draw up profits from any smaller company----just ask Pixar. And Guardians of the Galaxy is pretty much the assertion that the Marvel universe and comic book movies are here to stay as they took even one of the more obscure and pulp cult hit comics and transformed it into a big budget hearty fest of entertainment.Guardians of the Galaxy is a film that works but should not work because of the content and the heavy tongue-in-cheek humor, as well as containing a cast that hardly has the appeal of an Iron Man or a Captain America. For crying out loud, we have a regular joe, a tree, a raccoon, and a condensed version of the Hulk amongst the main characters. The comic book it's based on is meant to be a Scott Pilgrim type of cult hit that engages with a specific niche audience, but I assure you that it stands perfectly on par with the other Marvel films without overkilling itself.What mainly allows for newcomers and veterans to the franchise to warm up to the characters and the premise is the major focus on character development, fresh script, and also providing a beautiful blend of sci-fi action and rambunctious humor that dances along the PG-13/R line. Although the diehards were probably hoping for Disney to truly let this movie get unleashed, they should be satisfied with the fact that this movie is definitely the dirtiest, rowdiest, and most gutterball of the Marvel bunch. James Gunn holds very little back as we see plenty of dark humor sprinkled on nearly every scene.The outstanding cast also allows for the movie to flourish. Chris Pratt (Peter), Bradley Cooper (perfectly voicing Rocket), Zoe Saldana (Rising up the sci-fi queen ranks), Dave Bautista, and even Michael Rooker (small role, but steals the show as one of the antagonists) portray their characters perfectly without missing a beat and intertwine themselves with the heavy amount of special effects without any issues. The production value here is top-notch as we've come an extremely long way from 70s Superman.If there is something that Man of Steel (ugh.....) has proved, it's that special effects should not be the main hull but the icing of the cake. James Gunn does a fantastic job by giving everyone their moment to shine and allowing the audience to root for them. Unfortunately, Marvel still hasn't really given us a great villain outside the lines of Loki within the past decade, as we have several throwaway villains here that don't have much screen time or much personality either. Luckily the heroes and anti-heroes are far too much fun to watch to make up for the dullness coming from the evil side.Disney/Marvel has quietly revolutionized the film industry by providing us a yearly dosage of films that are connected heavily amongst each other by putting them in the same timeline. It almost makes for a required viewing of each Marvel film in order to be caught up and anticipate the next major blockbuster. So in other words as long as Marvel plans on using the dozens of heroes within its repertoire and maintain it in the same universe, they will not run out of movie ideas for at least a couple decades.Guardians of the Galaxy may have been a cult classic comic book with a quiet history. But thanks to a great script, great cast, and great direction and production value, this new franchise will fit and blend perfectly with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and whatever else Marvel decides (and is legally allowed) to throw in between Avengers movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Absolutely brilliance technicals with so-so script.,"I agree with most of the other reviewers that this was an amazing technical achievement. The CGI was flawless, feeling less like CGI and more like ""real life animation"". The textures were intense and the motion spot on.I would say this movie is Firefly (Serenity) meets Star Wars. Pratt was gorgeous, cheeky and strong. Zoe looks much better as my sweet brown baby than as greeny. Rocket, a raccoon, really? A fun character but single-handedly responsible for the loss of one star in the ratings. All I could hear in my head when he was on screen is the Beatles ""Rocky Racoon"". Sheesh. Oh, and Karen Gillan is very cute but in this character she is shrill, emaciated and weak. Wish Selfie was renewed... Sorry, I digress. I really didn't appreciate Groot until about 1:30 or so. Then I loved him. BTW, waste of a paycheck to cast Vin there.The story is well worn and predictable and most of the script from 1:00 to 1:40 or so is detrimental to the entire experience it cost another star. Those two points are the reason for the other two missing ratings stars.So, Chris Pratt +2, CGI +4, technical fun +3, cohesive cast +1, story -1, script -1, raccoon, -1. Overall I did enjoy my two hours in the chair and 3D was a lot of fun.Cheers!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Huge loss of respect for humanity,"I saw this listed as the best reviewed summer movie from two years ago and can't stand it anymore. When I watched this I laughed at how bad it was. Being utterly sadistic, I went to RT and IMDb to share in the deserved shaming. Instead, I found 90% glowing, not positive, glowing reviews.Just to put it in perspective, I feel I'm pretty mainstream in my tastes, and can enjoy the utterly stupid if that's the point, e.g. Dumb/Dumber, Austin Powers, some Feig, and even Grandma's Boy or Broken Lizard is OK if I'm too tired to change the channel. I also like gratuitous violence just fine, and have willingly suspended my reality as needed since I left the Last Starfighter in tears about 30min in, and Transformers(animated) after the credits rolled. I reeeeally liked Burton's/Nolan's Batmans.That said, I simply don't quite get all the respect for modern super-hero movies, or more specifically, all the respect for certain such movies. Ironman was good, but certainly not that good, and the Avengers is really no better in plot/acting than GI Joe or Green (insert balance of mediocrity here), they just have better directors/budgets maybe. Of course, I've gotten old since Keaton, and I'm willing to admit I am guilty of inflating Nolan's work b/c I dig the stylings, and perhaps b/c I don't like that I got old. So, I give the Thors and Cpt. Americas of the world a pass because I figure they're intended for 8 year olds like my previous self. If arrested development provides a wider audience these days, that's not the movie's fault. Similarly, if you think Tony Stark is better than Jack's Joker, I also blame your parents.As for Guardians, I certainly can imagine an 8-12 year olds enjoying this (as I enjoyed TMNT in all its one liner glory), as well as 13-18 year olds who attend conventions (as I enjoyed the unsolvable mystery of who Adrian Paul would decapitate each week). I don't remember lines from them, and today's 8-18 year olds won't remember any from Guardians. E.g.: a)His race is without a sense of irony? (picturing writers high-fiving over ability to add in at least 4-5 one liners off this contrivance and not have to actually hire someone with any comedic talent to write a joke relating to the plot/action/previous line). b) I am groot means I am groot except if you're a racoon, then it predictably means everything (ala Chewie) from please and thank you to something super technical that it's just amazing/hilarious this character would know about. But hey, I didn't mind it in Star Wars. To be fair to me, Ford didn't wait for a laugh track after each line, and Chewey didn't magically transform three English words into a decipherable language instead of buying Han Rosetta Stone Wookie for Christmas one year; c) dance off. Oh, but what about using old/anachronistic/genre bending songs to create an atmosphere? Yes, awesome, and when Tarantino did it 20 years ago I thought it was just shy of Dre mixing rap and funk, so maybe we'll just add that to the homage bill. Love Pratt as a Lenny figure, but between this and Jurassic World, I really hope he saves any action movie paychecks just in case the Coen brothers don't come a calling by the time the next teddy bear/modern man's man next door shows up (sorry Krasinski, seats taken). Btw, didn't Pratt himself think this movie would bomb and end his career? That, and his great Top Chef appearance would make me go see said Coen bros. movie.So, even if it weren't for the impossibly favorable reviews, this movie is one of the worst movies I've seen,since Thor, and before that Fast/Furious and/or Eye of the Beholder. That for a time I felt like I had to hide my disgust lest I be outed as the only heterosexual male aged 10-40 who doesn't think Gunn is the next Spielberg, makes me write this, and makes me almost as sad for my country as the d/t sandwich the major parties inflicted upon us this year.

Marvel does Star Wars,"Guardians of the Galaxy is basically Marvel Studios doing a sci-fi fantasy/space opera like Star Wars, Star Trek and Doctor Who. And it turned out as well as you would expect a Marvel style Star Wars film would be, a fun adventure filled with excellent CGI and even more Marvel humour than usual. It had a great cast with David Bautista being the stand out as Drax the Destroyer and Vin Diesel gave one of his best performances because he only had to say three words.

"Its a fun movie, but not one of Marvel's best in my opinion.","I came in expecting a really good movie, considering on the day it came out it had a 9/10. I had seen some reviews on it, and it was getting a lot of love from so many people. I really wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't what I anticipated. It was really corny, and pretty boring in some parts. The characters were pretty uninteresting, besides Rocket Raccoon, who I really like. Chris Pratt wasn't funny really at all in this movie, he had a couple funny scenes, though. and Zoe Saldana wasn't really all that great. Drax wasn't too bad, he was pretty funny. And Rocket was cool as well. But the villain was pretty generic. Really the best compliments I can give this movie is Rocket is pretty awesome, and that the movie is pretty funny. Other than that, it was a bit of a disappointment to me, but this is just my opinion. Overall, it is a fun movie, but not a great movie. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Low-key one of the best sci-fi films of the 21st century.,"This film has it all, it felt like a breath of fresh at the time of its release, an interesting story, it's beautifully shot and designed, lots of practical effects, a great cast with great chemistry, an incredible soundtrack, and overall a really enjoyable time. But, the villain is boring, the MCU's constant struggle.Ronan is so one-dimensional that it's only when you explore the dynamics and character relationships between the Guardians do you realise how underwritten he is. Yeah he has his motivations, but what's the point if he is so character-leas and uninteresting? It's the weakest part of the film, but at-least we get to see Thanos for the first time and he has the most threatening scene of the film.Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon is one of my favourite things about the MCU, he always has the best lines and I love his constant bickering with Pratt's Quill. Overall, this may be one of the most rewatchable MCU films, and it really stands so well on its own over time, will definitely revisit it every couple of years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Everybody Wants To Rule The World,"Now this is a pleasant surprise - it's an excellent action comedy and I enjoyed it. Big as it is it may even be the Star Wars of the current cgi gamer generation, only shame that all the characters and maybe the stories were variously imagined decades ago in prehistory. Not forgetting the music; going by the sound quality I only wish my audio cassettes could have stood the test of time so well with such perfect stereo separation and stability after 26 years of constant playing.It starts by a deathbed on Earth in 1988 and swiftly moves onto somewhere else bleak and grimy in the Universe 26 years later. A disparate group of five weird criminals is forced together for their common good under the leadership of Star Lord in defeating a weird baddie Ronan (the barbarian) who will destroy the Universe if he's gets the chance with his new shiny toy, the Infinity Stone. It has been explained to me by a knowledgeable friend that it's supposed to be far more complicated than that and that all manner of gemstones are or will be involved next time. As well as mayhem. Amidst all the cgi cartoon conflagrations there's a generally delightful repartee between all of the main characters, most times hitting the mark but occasionally missing. It's all taken at such a (literally) breakneck speed that it's not surprising though. The proto-Guardians are Star Lord who is reliving Han Solo except that he likes '70's pop songs far more and even enough to die for, Gamora is playing a green Rihanna for the kids, Rocket Racoon is without Gideon's Bible, Drax is built like a power station, and Groot is most definitely playing himself! Or, at least I think he is, as I've never read any of stories or even know or want to know 1% of the tortuous histories. However, no matter how interesting or amusing it gets the indifferent approach to a gruesome and colossal loss of life is always annoying to me – I mean, no one ever had to die horribly in Popeye cartoons and it still does nothing for me to see how many ingenious ways of painful annihilation can be sadistically portrayed by cgi. And must a family fun fantasy film have to open with emotionally fraught scenes of a boys' mother dying of cancer simply to provide the raison d'etre for a Walkman plot device? But as an even better old song goes I Guess I Just Wasn't Made For These Times. Although overall it's not too bad - I did laugh at Groot's violent method of despatching swathes of surprised baddies with a sweep of his arm, and his silly wooden look back over his shoulder afterwards. I wonder if Van Halen's Dance The Night Away was on director Gunn's hit list of olde tunes – it was used very effectively in Mission To Mars but no one watching this would've remembered that very old film.With reservations it's the best Marvel Disney I've seen to date. Two hours whizzed by watching this colourful well-made hokum and I didn't reach for the internet once, always good yardsticks, so exceptional stuff for the kids, pretty good nonsense for us oldies too. My bottom-line advice is to watch it simply because there's a whole new complex franchise looming out there: one day every other film made anywhere will be of Marvel's Universe so better try to get up to speed as soon as you can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Marvel movie?,"Maybe the impressions are too fresh since I've walked out of the cinema an hour ago, but I'd say this is the best Marvel movie, and I've watched them all. Guardians does not have the superstar team of The Avengers, but has an equal or bigger scale with lots of new territory to explore. I'd vote for watching a new guardians movie over the new Avengers. The movie is rich in special effects, is fun to watch and very entertaining. Every character is unique and memorable. The universe feels truthful and solid.If you haven't ever heard of Guardians or Marvell, still is worth watching if you like sci-fi, action or comedy movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A Glimmer of Hope, However Faint...","Despite its smart casting and often undeniable craftsmanship, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (TM) has really been testing my patience of late, and what was fresh in 2008 is starting to feel stale and contrived. Marvel has its story lines so tightly intertwined that every film feels forced to reference at least 2 others in the franchise at this point, and we've reached a point of suffocation. Not helping matters any is a sense that they're basically making the same film again and again, even if they're mostly making it very well.So, on the Guardians of the Galaxy... finally a universe mostly divorced from the Avengers (back to that in a minute) and feeling worlds away from that studio's recent output. Fun, cheeky, self-aware and with much more memorable characters (Groot and the Raccoon being the standouts) than your standard superhero fare, Guardians is at its best when it really lets go and embraces its silliness. It also boasts an endlessly hummable soundtrack.Marvel being Marvel, however, the result is much less perfect than the current IMDb rating would have you imagine. Reused plot tropes are legion, from a distant demigod underwritten super-villain (+ an arch-villain confusingly introduced with no bearing on the plot) to yet another ""destroy-a-city"" climax, Guardians is often handicapped by its narrative similarity to preceding films, and you can't help but wish it had been released before all its mostly inferior cousins. Thankfully though, it is denied the cruel fate Captain America was given, force-projected as he was into the Avengers time period for the sake of corporate synergy.Is this a great film? No. But it is an often very entertaining one, with hugely likable characters, and it offers a glimmer of hope, however faint, that Marvel might relax its centralized creative hold and allow for more original ideas to break through. If that ever happens, the age of superheroes will truly be one of movie magic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good superhero movie but no LOTR,"Let me say I am into all things scifi, and have read many a graphic novel. I have enjoyed all (well, most) of the other Marvel movies. This movie is very good, and even excellent within it's genre. The characters are spot on, the visual effects are extremely well done, and the plot is quite engrossing, particularly for an action film.HOWEVER, this is not another LOTR or Star Wars. This movie is not a 10/10 unless you're comparing it only to films in its own narrow genre. This isn't an exam, where you get a 10 if you don't get any answers wrong. This is a pretty shallow summer action flick, and a good one, but not genre-defying or earth-shattering. Most people will not remember it when next summer rolls around. I think the studios must have worked out how to game the system.By all means, go see it. It's a fun film. Took my 9 year old son with me, and he had a great time too. Just don't set your expectations too high.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
An Unoriginal and Derivative Disappointment,"Personal prejudices underlie this review that includes a strong preference for hard-core serious sci fi. Guardians from this perspective has more in common with the space western soap opera of Star Wars and Hans Solo, Indiana Jones, and even Kurt Russell's character in the fantasy comedy cult classic Big Trouble In Little China (1986). In many ways, Guardians is more of a derivative of the classic television series Firefly (2002-2003) and becomes more of a parody of that series which offered up a more consistent and well-crafted camaraderie that script writers brought to its renegade crew. Guardians does not seem to fit into the tone of the rest of the Marvel Universe and stretches it attempts at one-line humor along with a storyline that really does not offer much in the way of originality nor consistent scene outcomes (i.e., like a city that remains crowded with residents even as terror reigns down on it) that results in illogical plot inconsistencies and predictable forced outcomes. In sum, this movie is entertaining but not much more even with its apparent sincere efforts to be something it is not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Right Guardians!,"Call me lost in space for taking an eternity to experience the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", but I finally launched into it and it was worth the ride. The blockbuster stars Chris Pratt as a charismatic intergalactic criminal named Peter Quill who also goes by StarLord. Peter himself was abducted as a child by a clan of intergalactic criminals just after his mom passed away. His national treasure has always been a walkman with a cassette of some classic tunes, which was one of the classic aspects of the movie. Through unexpected circumstances, Quill teams up with other intergalactic bad guys that are really good; including the green gal Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the vengeful prisoner Drax (Dave Bautista), the sarcastic loudmouthed raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the one-phrase tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Sure, they are a diverse bunch but their mission to stop madman Ronan's Run to control the universe was quite imperative. Director James Gunn sure had some fun developing this one, and he did a commendable job, even though there were one too many action sequences. Where Gunn hit right on target was on the witty screenplay he scribed with Nicole Perlman. What I thought was really a blast off about ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was the zany, pitch-perfect vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket. His Rocket launched vocal greatness, even though Rocket was off his rocker. OK, my pun mission is done here.

"Another great entry from Marvel, a next step","This movie was breathtaking, with stunning visual effects and great characters with a smart, witty and funny script aswell as a kickass soundtrack. The choice of Chris Pratt as Star-Lord was great and he did awesome in the film. Groot was hilarious and so was Rocket and Gamora. Drax is my least favourite of the four but he is still entertaining and gets some great laughs throughout the film.The movie is very well directed by James Gunn with a very unique and fresh looking colour pallete. The set design as well as the look of all the weapons and spaceships are unique too which all to look very appealing even if the CGI does look a little fake in some of the scenes. The villan could have been stronger too with a deeper backstory, but Thanos in Infinity War made up to that with Marvel villans getting better as the films go along.This was a massive blockbuster hit when it came out with loads of hype surrounding it, now since the hype is still strong for this movie series since the third one is yet to come out. This is still my favourite of the two that has currently been released, not knocking the second one though, which visually is vastly superior, but in terms of writing, character and humor, this one takes the cake. It has excellent rewatch value aswell which entertains every time with the jokes just as funny as they were when you watched it the first time. So much imagination was put into the locations of this movie and it has it's own unique identity and feel. It's a huge departure from the Avenger's movies for sure, but this is not the Avengers.

Fun in spite of itself,"I haven't seen a summer popcorn flick in ages, let alone written a review of one in some time. However, if an excuse to see a gun totting raccoon with a rag tag bunch of misfits doesn't get me interested, then I'll consider this a lifetime opportunity missed.Guardians of the Galaxy at first seems to start off like any sci-fi block bluster but quickly separates itself from the rest of the pack upon first viewing. The hero (Peter Quill) is a goofy, smart ass, unintentionally funny character as he sets on collecting an artifact for ransom. In the end, his goods are stripped and a bizarre bunch of misfits just like him set to get it back. The artifact's ""the orb"" importance becomes more clear, as we learn if it falls into the wrong hands it can unleash unparalleled destruction on the planets and galaxies.Films like this suggest for you to suspend your disbelief, the bad guys never shoot straight, the heroes dodge all the bullets, the evil guys never time their powers right. We never take these things seriously, and more so the film takes these to more moronic highs. A walking plant and raccoon make an interesting pair, spitting off dialogue that isn't cliché. Quill has an affection for cheesy music, and it's discussion and genre in significant moments amongst other characters who just want to save the world, makes much for much moronic viewing. After all the aliens have no idea of this foreign concept that makes no sense to them. The female character is all green, giving a nod almost to Star Trek and an interest of Captain Kirk that Quill must conquest, but takes a much more realistic turn.Aside from the fact that a brute character doesn't understand the concept of metaphors, the filmmakers have also bathed this picture in a fascinating light. Giant reams of purple blue and green bathe the screen with interstellar light, creating a universe that doesn't look like anything we have seen before on screen. Even the characters and aliens look like... aliens, with the exception that some are still bi-pedal, many skin tones are represented, never mind a blue bounty hunter who kidnapped Quill as boy, seems to wield the most dangerous knitting needle known to man. His presence and somewhat Texas?Alabama accent (which adds to even bigger irony) seem just the perfect fit as the absurdity grows larger when Quill and him cross paths. Each opportunity is an excuse for him to remind Quill he's lucky he wasn't eaten alive by him and his henchmen when he was first captured.In reality the film mocks itself and its own ideas for telling us that this is all ridiculous and just dumb fun so come along for the ride. The whole thing knows it's absurd, and it's dialed up to 11 by the film-makers giving us a thrill that is the perfect escape for summer.It's not brilliant or amazing, it's quite stupid, but if it was perfect it would ironically be a heck of a lot less interesting and enjoyable. It's the self mockery and stupidity that makes the film work ingeniously. If anything it's the perfect movie to not take things seriously, and bathe yourself in the wild characters and colors on screen. In the end it's a great interstellar trip and escape unlike any you have been on before, and that's really all it needs to be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""You're fine, and you're mine, and you look so divine""","James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy has a defining scene late in its runtime and it's the kind of scene that summarizes its characters, situations, and humor in ways better than any analysis could do justice. The scene comes when our titular heroes are gathered in their bunker, confused and trying to concoct and develop more of their ""12% plan."" When they finally figure something out, each character stands up to declare their participation with Rocket Raccoon standing up last. ""Now we're all standing,"" he states, ""a bunch of jackasses."" That is the best summation of Guardians of the Galaxy I've ever heard and probably will hear. The film works largely in part because it's a more lax, carefree Marvel film than we've seen over the last year or so, unburdened by the commonalities the brand has bestowed upon and the smothering sameness gift-wrapped in expensive special effects and complex pyrotechnics. While the effects and the sound engineering/mixing are nothing to shortchange or overlook, this has to be the most witty, hilarious, and consistently fun Marvel film I have yet to see, which is something the company genuinely needed in their long line of serious franchises.The film concerns Peter ""Star-Lord"" Quill (Chris Pratt), who was abducted from Earth by The Ravagers in 1988, shortly after his mother's death. Twenty-six years later, Star-Lord is wandering on the planet Morag when he finds a small, spherical orb that apparently holds enough significance that the evil villain Ronan places a bounty on Star-Lord's head once he learns the orb is in his possession. He also sends Gamora (Zoe Saldana), an orphan who was trained by the arch-villain Thanos, after the orb. However, one afternoon, Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his tree-like humanoid pal Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) see Star-Lord in public and try to capture him to obtain the large bounty. After a large, violent brawl, the quartet is thrown in prison and learn that the orb is worth several billion units. In order to obtain the units, however, they will need to trust each other entirely, which proves to be more of a challenge than it already is. They also come in contact with a large, muscular, and very literal man named Drax (David Bautista), who works to help them so they can be the noble Guardians of the Galaxy.Director and co-writer (with Nicole Perlman) Gunn knows that, unlike with Marvel's The Avengers, these heroes likely couldn't sustain a feature-film on their own. However, by throwing them together, giving them numerous dialog scenes to showcase their characters' timing and humor, and develop them each considerably with their own stories and motives, he can create a film centered around some of the most likable superhero characters. Despite being a superhero, Star-Lord is entirely human and relatable, from his sassy remarks to his love for eighties music (which leads me to believe that Redbone's infectious jam ""Come and Get Your Love"" has never been used to greater effect than in Guardians of the Galaxy. Gamora shows her incredible energy through every scene, thanks to competent writing and a solid performance by Saldana, who seems to be just starting to break out of the female action hero archetype. Even Drax is the heart of some hilarious scenes, being that he doesn't quite understand metaphors and views everything in a firmly literal sense.But the scene-stealers are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, who compliment each other effortlessly well. Rocket Raccoon has his brash, sometimes vulgar sense of humor to back him up, consistently being an entertaining presence, while Groot's character and conversational simplicity make him a warm and easily-lovable soul. Together, the five create one of the most effortlessly fun and engaging band of heroes that challenge The Avengers in the sense that these characters don't appear to be impenetrable forces of nature. They're not invincible beings and exist on a realm that can be more directly relatable to the audience. In other words, they're the superheros for people that don't really care for superheroes.Marvel truly needed Guardians of the Galaxy in my mind; a casual, irreverent superhero film that shows misfit characters rather than polished ones and momentary pauses for some hilarious dialog rather than disjointed shouting and stale zingers. What Marvel also needed was a film that had a true sense of humor, rather than just infrequent winks to the camera or dopey little sequences of deadpan, which is what Guardians of the Galaxy bears in excess. This very feature is evident from the film's inclusion of a bold, memorable soundtrack, made up almost entirely of hits from the seventies and eighties, with the heroes' theme song ""Hooked on a Feeling"" by Blue Suede at the film's center. While the battles are still pretty long and often infused with some indistinguishable chaos, this proves not to be such a distracting feature since the bulk of the film is such a royal and unexpected treat.In a time where I, and I'm willing to bet several others, are experiencing incredible superhero fatigue, Guardians of the Galaxy provides the ibuprofen and the regeneration the genre and the audience needed.Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and David Bautista. Voiced by: Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Directed by: James Gunn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Terrible,"Just another piece of Hollywood trash. If you're under the age of 8, or you're an adult male who reads comic books, you'll probably like this. If you're a normal adult, you'll probably think it's the stupidest movie you've ever seen. It has all the depth and seriousness of ""Kung Fu Panda"". The ""plot"" is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent, snarky jokes and inane dialogue. The plot climax, in which the main character challenges the villain to a ""dance off"" practically screams at the audience, ""Ha ha ha! You stupid idiots, we already got your money!"" Seriously, this movie doesn't even need Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow -- it mocks itself.This movie is really just beyond bad. If you've ever wondered what it would be like if: A) far-away civilizations looked like bad Nickelodeon shows, or B) a Hollywood producer let his 12-year-old son write a sci-fi screenplay, you'll find this intriguing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A lot of fun, but misses being a classic","It had been awhile since I had such a good time seeing a movie. Maybe it was that I saw GOTG on a rainy day during a vacation, or maybe it was just that I was genuinely surprised that GOTG had some originality rather than being another over-rated, paint-by-numbers superhero movie.Regarding the latter, many of us have grown weary of The Dark Knight, Avengers, and other superhero films that get 8's or 9's here or 80 or 90 plus rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and repeatedly fail to live up to those expectations. Of course, GOTG IS over-rated (much less than the other superhero movies), but that's more of a statement about the flaw in the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings systems than anything.GOTG is more original than those other films because of witty dialogue and memorable/original characters. Chris Pratt's ""Starlord"", ""Rocket Racoon"" and ""Groot"" were my favorites and at least one of them will likely be yours as well. The other characters are more supportive and serve that role admirably. I did have a quibble about the 2 main bad guys - one of them needed to go because it just cluttered the field and storyline. While this probably made sense to the fanboys, I'd never heard of GOTG before this movie and it was likely made to appeal to a broader audience than just fanboys.The thing that prevents it from being a classic (or ""A New Hope"" - seriously?) is that the story is fairly run of the mill and not nearly as expansive or original as what you would see in a classic sci-fi film. The best sci-fi films introduce an original world that even after the credits roll still has huge potential to continue in a number of directions, with great depth and vision. GOTG has some unresolved story lines to give it a place to go, but it's world/idea is too small to have the breadth of possibilities that one would find in Star Wars, Alien, The Matrix, etc. However, not all of the sequels to these films succeeded (Matrix, recent Star Wars sequels/prequels), but this was due more to the failure of script and direction than lack of potential. Of course, that does give GOTG hope - with a well- written sequel that adds original story elements to the fun dialogue and characters we could have a series that rises above its solid, but limited beginnings.Maybe that's what all this ""New Hope"" talk is all about?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
