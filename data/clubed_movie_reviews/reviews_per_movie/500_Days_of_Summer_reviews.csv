A love story deftly built on unrequited love.,"I haven't seen a romance this touching since I was the same type of single sad sack as depicted by the hero of (500) Days of Summer.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his radar up for ""the girl of his dreams"" when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Too bad for Tom Summer is stuck on friends-with-benefits mode. Let the tension begin.Director Marc Webb captures the feeling of innocent, naïve love expertly. Anyone who has taken the lyrics of the Smiths too closely to heart, would be moved by the idea of the person they are crushing on sing to them: ""To die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die."" No wonder Tom soon falls head over heels for this girl.As events unfold out of sequence, you know all along Tom has fallen for a time bomb of a woman, and he can't even see the countdown. When that bomb finally blows up in his face, it unfolds with powerful simplicity-- no exposition or dialog, just two juxtaposed events that capture the heartache of reality hitting a person who sees a person through the filter of deep-seated emotions that were planted at too young an age.So many romantic films nowadays concern themselves with cute ideas; take 'He's Just Not That Into You' or 'Serendipity' for example. Even movies like 'Knocked Up' where a pot-smoking, video-gaming, narcissistic slob tries to turn his life around to try to be a father feels more contrived than real. These movies forget about human feelings.Who cares about stock or cartoonish characters in love. The couple in (500) Days of Summer have true chemistry. There are some beautiful, subtle moments of tenderness as well as some heart- rending moments of disconnectedness between the two that never comes across as heavy-handed. The movie constantly reminds you that these are two different people with different ideas of a relationship, yet they stubbornly continue dating, and they remain lovable all the same.An omniscient narrator sets the film up early on by noting ""this is not a love story."" And, in a way, it isn't. It's a story about feelings. It just so happens (500) Days of Summer captures the sensation of falling in love better than most movies.For more of my reviews, visit indieethos.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"The Glorious ""(500) Days of Summer""","Let's face it. We've all done our share of ""dumping"". Whether it's the, ""Lets just be friends,"" or the all too familiar, ""It's not you, it's me,"" tactic, as long as you're not on the receiving end it becomes a question of, ""How quickly can I get this over with, so I can move on with my life?"" Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to ""be"" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If you're one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, you'll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series. For the rest of you who've at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvationthis movie is dedicated to you.Tom (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) is a wanna-be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the ""new girl"" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, ""casual relationship."" Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded ""time apart."" (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isn't meant to be.(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective non-linear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Tom's feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience.The real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You can't help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine. Their creative way of crafting the simple concept of a break up through unconventional story structuring is a refreshing concept that begs to be seen more in a world where most conventional films tend to play it safe.Leads Deschanel and Levitt manage to bring something quite special to the screen in their portrayals of Tom and Summer (both ""last nameless""). Their chemistry is really what makes the film a joy to watch. Mostly thanks to Neustadter and Weber's superb dialog, both actors seem so comfortable in their roles that their interactions with one another transcend the screen and naturally unfold before our eyes as if we were voyeurs to their unraveling, wanting so much to change the fate of their outcome, but helpless to do so. Deschanel is sexy, carefree and bound to be adored by males everywhere as Summer. Levitt captures the struggle of the neurotic ""boy in love"" exceptionally through all of his various stages of emotional imbalance.(500) Days of Summer is a poem to every down and out guy who thinks he's the only one whose ever been dragged through the mill by their own Summer. What undoubtedly ends up making this picture so brilliant is how relatable it is to its victims and victimizers a like. When all is said and done, there is most definitely a lesson to be learned by Tom's experiences. Everyone you meet along the way, whether just passing through or sticking around for awhile, has a purpose. In the end nothing lasts forever, relationships begin, relationships end. Try to be thankful for all the people that broke your heart, they more than likely helped you find yourself in the process especially you, Summerbitch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is Not a Love Story,"Greetings again from the darkness. The narrator warns us upfront ... this is not a love story. Still, we are so preconditioned by Hollywood, that directive merely floated around in my head until near the end of the film when I realized it was perfectly accurate.Joseph Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel are the leads and each bring a certain quirkiness and sensitivity to their roles. Watching them grow as a couple just never quite clicks for the viewer the way it does for JGL's character. He buys in hook, line and sinker and believes his destiny for love is being fulfilled by Summer (Zooey).Director Marc Webb throws a bit of everything at us - just to prove this is not a traditional love story. We get the fun of memory blender - flashbacks like Day 488, Day 2, Day 159 - well you get the point. That is how most of us remember anyway: non-linear. We also get a funny musical number in the park, a b & w Bergmanesque dramatization, and a leading man whose poetic musings are limited to his writing quips for a greeting card company. Oh, he also takes love advice from his 11 year old soccer-playing sister (Chloe Moretz), but wisely declines most of it from his best friend played by sexist, drunken (and funny) co-worker, Geoffrey Arend.What I really like about the film is that it is different, yet very realistic. So often our ""dream"" girl is just not quite a fit in this world, yet she and the next guy are just right. Doesn't seem fair, but in reality, it is not only fair, but perfectly just. And remember, there is always another season ... maybe Autumn?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wonderful movie.,"Wonderful movie. From the trailer it may appear like your typical boringly predictable romantic comedy, but in reality is a great comedy-drama, with great meaning and relevance, and an amazing twist.Clever plot - not at all predictable, and very original. Direction is equally innovative, switching between different periods of time deftly, seamlessly and to the betterment of the movie.The choice of lead actors was inspired. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are superb in the lead roles. The chemistry is spot-on, and both are suitably quirky and non-mainstream, avoiding it becoming a common-or-garden shmaltzy romance.Topping it all off is a superb soundtrack. The music, excellent in isolation, is integrated perfectly into the movie, and is not overdone.A must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I hate this movie,This movie is one of the best i've ever seen but it sucks. I mean it sucks because of how sad it is. If you want to watch a movie and no matter what cry to you should watch this. I don't recommend cause seriously after i've watched this movie like a week ago i've fallen into a hole and i can't get out of it. I feel just like him and i cant do anything to stop it. Most of the people that wacxh this movie is going to feel the same way and i would never wish this on my worst enemy. I wish i could just forget everything about this movie every time i think about it it's gets worse but at least it has a happy ending. Kinda. If you're looking for an AMAZING cry watxh this at night and i promise you it will be the most devastating thing you've ever seen.

The Beautiful Days of Summer,"Everyone loves summer. It's a time for friends, family, and fun. Ballgames, barbecues, amusement parks, and movies, summer is just a time to sit back, relax and enjoy. Enjoy time off, good weather and whatever else it might bring. Am I missing something? Oh yes, love. Summer is a time for love.The film can be pretty much summed up in one of the first lines of the film. ""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" But is it? 500 Days of Summer is not your typical romantic film. There's something to it, something more than your usual romantic comedy. Maybe it's the style it's done? Maybe it's the realistic nature? Maybe it's the wonderful music? Maybe its the beautiful cinematography? Maybe, its Tom and Summer...Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are the leads, Tom and Summer. These are real everyday people. Tom, a believer in true love. Summer, a doubter. Which reminds me of one particular scene where Summer questions Tom about believing in love. Tom replies, ""It's love, it's not Santa Claus."" It is a real thing, a crazy little thing called love. Tom falls in love with Summer from the start. She doesn't. Tom is like every other guy, and every guy knows of a girl like Summer. The girl they want, but can't have. They try, to no avail. It's frustrating, and Tom is frustrated. He's happy then sad. He doesn't know what to think. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. You really believe their relationship and hardships. It makes you notice the little things in relationships. The film highlights two young stars on the rise. With some great performances lately for Joseph Gordon-Levitt, his stock is rising... dare I say an up and coming Heath Ledger?The story is not in direct order as it goes back and forth from different days Tom remembers his life and relationship with Summer. When remembering, we may not remember every detail in order. We choose what we want to remember. May that be the good, or the bad. For Tom, it's a little bit of both. Big props to the editing department. The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. There's something about it that sets it apart from the usual romantic comedy.500 Days of Summer is really refreshing now a days. It's funny, unique, and true to life. It's got something for everybody to like. Director Marc Webb shines in his feature film debut. I'm interested to see where he goes from here. 500 Days of Summer has quickly become a late summer highlight for me and surprisingly so at that.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A light and realistic approach to an unhealthy relationship,"A light and realistic approach to an unhealthy relationship between two young people, each with their own frustrations, expectations and difficulties in communicating honestly with their partner.Don't expect much comedy, nor much romance or wise messages, which, apart from the narrator, seem to be exclusive to women in this film. Even an 11-year-old girl is smarter than any man, which seems to be forced for comedy purposes.Still, there is a very good message that the film addresses more than once: the importance of being honest with others and with ourselves.Overall, it is a very enjoyable film to watch, with great music, innovative back-and-forth directing and nice colours / photography.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Summer's Webb,"Who is Mark Webb? Anyone? Anyone? It is an astonishing piece of work for a first time feature film director. He counts with a beautifully crafted screenplay and two sensational leading performances and that's where the success of this comedy resides. Jodseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two startling originals with a winning screen presence and a brain, yes, a brain. I was involved in their peculiar relationship because there isn't a hint of shallowness in their back and fourth. I believe it, completely, and when you sit in the dark and believe what you see on the screen, things are going to happen to you the way that happened to me. It is again a confirmation that treating your audience with respect will pay off somewhere along the line. I love Zooey Deschanel, she reminds me of some my favorites of the past without looking or sounding like anybody else. And Joseph Gordon Levitt, well, this young man is something else. He projects a humanity that doesn't need to be embellished. It's just there for us to dive into. Marvelous actor, marvelous performance, marvelous film. I'm so thrilled to be able to say that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""500 Days of Summer"" is a delightfully engaging and poignant tale of love","""This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met the one. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total mis-reading of the movie 'The Graduate'. The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only love two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.""500 Days of Summer is an intriguingly original take on falling in love. Every emotion involved with a relationship seems to be relayed; from the strange and quirky aspects of new love to the tragedy of heartbreak. Marc Webb deftly incorporates his ingenuity and comedy into the film. The writers quite skilfully enrich the film with one of the most immensely beautiful and original screenplays to come along in a while.Tom, a greeting-card writer with artistic dreams beyond his mundane job, meets Summer and quickly falls for her. Eventually, he manages to charm her into a ""casual relationship"". So begins the 500 days that chronicle the happiness, heartbreak, and every other aspect involved with the often changing tides of romance.500 Days of Summer portrays a relationship that is more realistic and less clichéd than most others in it's woefully unoriginal and formulaic genre. In doing so, the film never feels anything less than completely innovative and incredibly fun. The film's story is told in a refreshingly non-linear fashion that strives for and often reaches perfection with each and every scene.The acting is wonderful, especially from the two leads. Since starring in Mysterious Skin (a disturbingly compelling film), Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been one of my favorite actors and proves yet again why he is one of the most talented actors of his generation. His performance was truly fantastic. Zooey Deschanel is absolutely wonderful in her portrayal of Summer and her quirky personalities. Their chemistry is wondrously compelling to watch and their moments together seem wholly convincing and genuine. The supporting cast is terrific throughout and very fun to watch.The music was marvelous and really added to the film. Everyone involved does an amazing job to connect the several elements of love into a satisfying and moving conclusion. The film often shuffles between whimsy and realistic, but, rather than getting lost because of it, the story only seems to be enhanced due to the chaotically transitional moods.500 Days of Summer is a hilarious, deftly thoughtful film about love. The performances are astonishing and the writing is sublime. It is a thoroughly clever and impressive film that shouldn't be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I didn't really like this,"I didn't really like this film, and I've been wondering why that is. It seems to be similar to films I like, and I'd say I felt a low level current of something like entertainment while I was watching it, and I was interested in seeing how things unfolded.I think there were a few things wrong.It was quirky in a way that doesn't really sync up with any of the kinds of quirky that I like. I hear, for example, people complain about Wes Anderson and the preciousness of his films, and I never really get it because that's exactly what I like about Anderson. Watching this, I get it, because this film's preciousness annoys me.I think I'd be okay with that if I thought it was funny. I really did not find this film to be very funny.So I'm kind of left with a not very funny, really precious film about two people who fail to grow in any way. I don't really like or identify with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this film. All he really seems to know is that his heart was broken by Zooey Deschanel, and while there's a dim acknowledgment that his perception of their relationship may have been inaccurate, he learns nothing from this. Since he learns nothing, Deschanel doesn't get an arc either. He would have to want to know and understand her to give her the kind of inner life she'd need to have to be capable of growing.Even so ... I think I'd have been okay with this if I thought it was funny.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
All the Incels need to chill,"Bruh. SO many of the reviews are just ""wahhh all women are lying TRASH!! >:("" Y'all are obviously missing the point. The point is that this is REAL. I don't know why people are saying she's a liar when she isn't. She's very upfront about what she wants because that's genuinely what she thought. But then things escalated. That's how it works sometimes. Just because we think we want something doesn't mean it'll work out that way. And people get caught up. And by the time she was too far in she realized it was too late and he was in love. That doesn't make her a liar, it makes her human. Summer could've handled it better. Hanson could've also handled it better. He knew her intentions going in, but he got caught up. Just like the rest of us. It happens. There's no villain here, just human beings. If you're just gonna watch this movie and cry about how all women are evil because you're a pathetic excuse of a human, then please exit. This movie is heartbreaking, but also a good lesson. It may not be for everyone and that's ok, but no need to blame an entire gender for something a fictional character did (even though she didn't? Still confused where the ""she's a liar"" thing came in...). Watch this if you've ever gotten carried away with love, and hopefully you see the beauty :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My very confused outlook,"I've avoided writing a review for this film for quite some time now because of a few reasons. One of them being I've been very unsure of how exactly I feel about this movie.Critics and average movie goers have praised this movie immensely. It has been described by professional critics as ""a delightful comedy, alive with invention"" among other (positive) things. This specific statement is right about the movie being innovative. We have all seen, heard and read the overdone 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gains girl again'. But this is more like 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl... for good'. Going back to the statement :'a delightful comedy'? I think not. There is almost nothing funny about this movie. The supposed 'funny' parts are basically swearing...ummm...yep that's it. The other parts were way too depressing or 'touchy' to be perceived as humorous. Why this is branded as a romantic comedy I will never understand. If it were up to me I would brand this as an anti-romance movie more than anything. I will not go into the plot too much but I can tell you that the movie makes me sick even thinking about the concept of romance and love. How Summer (the girl) is perceived by Tom (the boy) as her soul mate and how it definitely seems that way in the beginning of their relationship. How it feels like they're 'in love'. And how Tom is pretty much stabbed and mentally abused when Summer suddenly described she's not interested. The popular 'Expectations/Reality' scene in which, on one side of the screen, Tom gains summer back (the expectations) and on the other side of the screen, where he is completely ignored by her (the reality). And of course the ending, which I won't spoil, all of these aforementioned factors combined together make me sick to my inner core.I will commend the movie for being original, not following a generic romance movie formula. And this is probably more realistic than just about all movies in the same vein. But... I just can't like it. It just disgusts and frustrates me way too much. Underneath all the sunny sunshine presentation of the movie, there is too much darkness and depression. And I'm not saying that this is a necessarily a bad thing. It's just that, the way it's portrayed doesn't click with me. It felt me leaving very hollow and unhappy.Then again, I am rating this more than I would rate a typical romance/drama and I'm not a fan of this genre so considering that this is a good rating. If you're into the romance genre check it out. Perhaps it's just my interpretation that's making me feel so disgusted at the movie. Like I said in my title, my views on this are pretty confused.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun, offbeat non-rom-com","Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is always looking for the one. Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) doesn't believe in love since her parents' divorce.

Zooey is a great fantasy girlfriend. They make a fine rom-com couple or in this case, the anti-rom-com couple. The non-linear structure and the serious narration give it a fantasy feel.

Fresh & Original Romantic Comedy,"This was an excellent romantic comedy, although many might not agree that it is either romantic or a comedy. I found myself laughing out loud at many of the scenes, but the laughs in the theater were few, and I think most people would label this a drama with streaks of black comedy.The driving force behind what makes this movie work (beside the script) is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, who carries the movie on the basis of his physical comedy and acting ability. He is the unrequited love interest in the film. JGL does have brief glimpses of true love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) but it's clear she's not interested in anything permanent, just a good time. After his initial sexual encounter with Summer, JGL engaged in a choreographed dance routine of Hall & Oats ""Your Making my Dreams Come True"", which should win JGL some type of award.Deschanel plays the role she usually plays, soulful & pretty free spirit. She played the character very well and the movie viewer could well understand her reticence to engage in a long term affair with Tom.These types of movies might leave some cold, but the ending turned out well.One additional bonus was Chloe Moritz, who played Tom's younger teenage sister and Psycho-Analyst. She was great.A very good movie worth checking out. A near perfect date movie I might add.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Zooey Deschanel has vastly improved in her variety of facial expressions displayed, but still she looks like a cardboard cut out that tries too hard to be cute and fresh. The story is boring, plain and not engaging. The way that the story is delivered is unconventional, but it is not as groundbreaking as people think.

"Achingly Beautiful, the misery of one's love lost -  love remembered.","I don't regularly comment on movies, but this has a personal accord with me.My girlfriend of one year broke up with me the day before I went to watch this film, as promised.That being said, Tom (Joseph Gordon Levit) embodies my apathy and frustration in every mannerism. He allows the audience to feel his pain and disappointment. Tom is a man with boyish ideals, coming to terms with the grief of rejection. He teaches her how one loves, yet she never learns to except and give as selflessly. Probably because, as I and Tom have painfully learned, you can't teach or bequile someone as you would a child into doing love 'properly.' And sometimes, true love dies, and no sea of tears can change that.Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, is fun, beautiful and selfish. Undoubtedly the villain, the film seeks a reversal of standards; the male is now being preyed upon.Is Tom naive? or is Summer a cruel and self interested girl?The only thing that really bothered me was the director's incessant need to punctuate scenes of emotional substance with cliché romantic comedy relief.

"The Sundance story - How I saw ""500 Days of Summer.""","This is the story of boy meets girl, but it is not a love story that will unfurl. Instead a story about loves reactions, caused by two peoples juvenile actionsA little rhyme I wrote in honor of this years funniest and most delightful film. In January 2009 I was able to attend the Sundance Film Festival where I viewed a number of superb movies but none so genius as this one. Unable to buy or book any tickets for the original showings I sadly set my thoughts on other films, till the last day. I had changed plans and went to the ticket office to exchange one movie ticket for another. It was then that I discovered they planned to screen another showing of 500 Days of Summer, due to its immense popularity. Immediately buying a ticket, I found myself in the theater a few hours later awaiting with batted breath. I looked around me and watched as Joseph Gorden Levitt took a seat in the row behind, smiling and shaking hands with a number of fans. Although I too was a great fan I couldn't bring myself to go over there, instead I stayed in my seat and the movie started.An hour and a half later, I was standing up and applauding for all I was worth. In fact the whole cinema was, with every single audience member whistling, clapping and laughing at the brilliance of it all. Then Joseph Gorden Levitt, (the only cast member of the film who showed up) ran on stage and started answering questions. Bubbling with enthusiasm he jumped around, laughing, yelling, and keeping the lot of us entertained. He answered the straight questions with straight answers and the silly questions with straight out of hell silly answers. And at the end ran up and down the stage filming us all with a camcorder, saying he'd remember the day forever, I sure do.Then he went back to his seat and as everyone exited the cinema I swallowed my pride, walked up and shook his hand saying, ""Amazing performance, you're an inspiration."" Then it was over, I found myself being shuffled with the crowd out of the theater and into the cold outside. But even though I was in a t-shirt, I couldn't feel the chill, being instead caught up in the entertainment and thoughts of a vibrant funny film.A film that scores high in all the boxes and one I will certainly see again.100 out of 100.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I don't get it,"Upon my first watch, I hated this. I didn't get it, and I still don't. However, my opinion has slightly changed as this is my re-watch. I have grown to appreciate this movie more because I have watched from Summer's POV. Her cynicism ultimately makes sense. In retrospect, Tom's fantasy makes him fail in his own story. I think Tom viewed this ""relationship"" in a way where he thinks that he can maybe change Summer. He is very self-centered at times which is a possibly reason Summer is driven away. I can never find any clear rationale for what she did, and why. Irrelevant, but why does a 95 minute film feel so long lol.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Romance like books or life?,"With the choice of Joseph Gordon as the supporting role of Zooey Deschanel, we see a complete and effective work.We are going to see a love story. But this is not a normal love story that we are used to seeing in romance novels. This is not a romanticized tragic love of heart-wrenching dramas, nor a ""you've lived well"" fairy tale, nor a romantic comedy. This is the story of love as it really is - silly and serious, happy and pathetic, seductive and painful, enlightening and ignorant, energetic and depressed, full of unexpected joy and despair, all coincidentally and simultaneously... and most importantly, All unpredictable, like life itself.Few of us can identify with Romeo and Juliet or Don Juan, but I believe that most of us have experienced something like this at least once, and that makes this film much more powerful and real than most.

"500 Days of Summer is a celebration of passionate lovers, a story about relationships and how good times remain good times, even if they can't be with the same person anymore","The strength of the production is something that is currently in decline in Hollywood: its good script. The plot itself is not very original, but what is surprising is the way in which the basic plot boy meets girl-boy and girl falls in love-boy and girl split-boy and girl happily ever after is told. And believe me: however trivial and repetitive this plot may sound; the ending will surprise many people. Director Marc Webb had only made two music videos, a short film and a musical for television. After (500) Days of Summer, however, he managed to sign on to be responsible for ""The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)"". And all this because he was able to confer verisimilitude and awaken an almost youthful attraction to the most commonplace of narrative arcs, relying on a lot of wit and intelligence.Running away from a linear narrative, Tom's 500 days with Summer are exposed in a dispersed way, making the story even more palpable and organic. Without at any time, however, confusing viewers with the chronology of events, this clever move works in order to manipulate their eyes in the face of the situation and, mainly, make them even more indignant with Summer, the romantic partner of the protagonist and main antagonist. Of the movie. At least, an antagonism is supposed, since the argument has more to expose than simple black and white. At the same pace, director Marc Webb is extremely competent in making Tom a sympathetic protagonist. After his first night of sex with Summer, an extraordinary musical number appears that expresses very well the joy that the character is feeling. Ludic, the sequence has at its end an abrupt contrast with the far from happy future in which Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character finds himself in agony, finished; pitiful.Thus, after the inventive and beautiful opening, to the sound of Us, by Regina Spektor, the director presents us with several montages that are far from conventional. The presence of a narrator (Richard McGonagle) is efficient, verbalizing some situations that needed to be verbalized, without leaving them, however, expository. Further, it is with the end of the relationship that Tom manages, even without wanting to, to overcome, even without wanting to overcome, the presence, and consequent, departure of Summer from his life. Meeting her again, on an unexpected occasion, all those feelings return. Good times are briefly experienced. Without understanding signs, Tom is invited to a party by the girl, and all the passion of the passionate, dreamy and confused young man returns. The conflicting montage between expectations and reality, naked and raw, is painfully bitter, but honest. Tom is a romantic, convinced that when the heart loves someone, that is destined to be loved forever, and above all, loved by him. Tom is wrong.The audience's interpretation, considering the intention of the work, is more directed towards what goes on in Summer's mind, and not what goes on in Tom's mind, which we are already familiar with right away. Why would she have let Tom love her so intensely if she didn't share the same feeling? And why would she have created new expectations for the boy if reality would not match them? The answer is as simple to understand as it is complex to absorb. The good times that the two had really existed. The passion existed. But that wouldn't last forever. Summer suspected this, while Tom, young lover who once got ""The First Night of a Man"" wrong, did not. Why would this boy be different from all the other lovers she'd ever had? One day the answer came. For her. The excellent final dialogue between the girl of dreams and the passionate young man ties up the left ends, complementing the story's speech, which ends with the discovery of a new station.For an analysis without passions, let's look at the story from three different perspectives: his, hers, and ours, and only then can we draw some conclusions. Let's start with his perspective. Tom is a single young man, raised amid romantic books and movies that idealize relationships as moments of pure perfection. Tom believes that one day he will find the one (in English, ""the only one""), the perfect person, who fits all of his tastes and has the same thoughts as him. Then, on an ordinary day at his job as a greeting card writer, he meets his boss's new secretary, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful young woman who fits all of his projections of the perfect woman, and he, is. Of course, fall in love immediately.From her point of view, all these romantic projections of movies and books are fallacies and nothing more than stories far removed from reality. For Summer, life is much more than relationships, and passions are nothing more than fantasies created by people who are carried away by fleeting feelings. She stresses that she has never felt the way everyone usually says they feel when they are in love in any of the relationships she has had, and also says that this is not one of her priorities. Such a worldview completely escapes the stereotypes we see, where the woman is usually anxious and in search of a relationship, while the man flees from him like the devil flees from the cross.There is a certain touch of comedy in this film. The men are on the worried and confused side, while the women - even Tom's little sister, Rachel (Chlöe Grace Moretz) - show much more security and maturity in dealing with their own feelings. In fact, one of the most striking scenes for me is between Tom and Rachel, where she says to her brother that ""just because a pretty girl likes the same bizarre things as you, that doesn't make her your soul mate"". This is a parallel that I believe we can all bring to our lives: who hasn't been convinced that that person was their soulmate just because they both liked the same style of music, movies or books!?Looking from the outside, right away it is possible to notice the discrepancy between the ways of seeing the world of the protagonists, and that this relationship had no way of working out; but for our young dreamer, the fact that she said in so many words that she didn't want a relationship meant only one thing: she actually needed to be convinced otherwise, and he was the person who would show her what it really is love! Of course, because it's obvious that someone who has said in so many words that he has no interest in romantic involvement is going to fall in love overnight, isn't it? For many Romanesque constructs it is, and this is how Tom initially acts in his relationship with Summer. Trying to understand the whole situation, what we see when looking at it through his eyes is a classic projection of romantic ideals on the partner, where you don't see who the person is, but an ideal someone, nurtured by your own expectations, desires and even qualities you would like the other to have. Of course, each one has their own view of the world and this is independent of the state of enchantment, but when we are in love, we end up reading the other's behavior with distorted, biased lenses, which often lead us to much more favorable interpretations of the other. That they really are.The scene in the park is the best materialization I've ever seen of the feeling when you're in love: you want to dance in the middle of the street, you're smiling, everything has more color, the birds sing just for you; it's that feeling that there's nothing wrong with the world and you are the happiest being in the entire universe. But, of course, this feeling of the character does not last long, since he exaggerates his perception and ignores all possible signs, letting himself go and starting to live more in his projections than in real life, deconstructing, in short, that feeling good and unique that had on the day of the park.The villainization of the female character in this film occurs when we analyze the situation strictly through the male gaze, which, in this case, did not take so much into account what she said and focused more on what he projected. On the other hand, it is also possible to analyze the film in such a way as to villainize it, if we understand that she opened up as much as she could, but for him it was never enough. It's easy to say that Tom wanted more than Summer wanted and or could offer in the relationship, or even that she was mean and lying to him. Looking at history from just one side, or even judging by just a few frames, is seeing just one of the many faces of this complex relationship. This is precisely why we must analyze it from the most diverse perspectives, so that we can have the best possible view of the whole and realize that, in fact, when a relationship does not work out, there are not necessarily those to blame. As Summer herself says, when Tom asks her why her past relationships didn't work out: ""What happened? The usual: life"". Director Marc Webb's resource of telling the story in a non-linear way provides a much more interesting experience than if we saw the events chronologically. Seeing the ups and downs in a mixed way, we can see that both good and bad things were there, ready to happen. There is evidence everywhere. Life is complex and it is not always possible to turn feelings into words, and many times we see that their disagreements happen purely due to lack of communication.Taking a lot from ""Annie Hall"", (500) Days of Summer is a celebration of passionate lovers, pop songs, romantic movies, romantic poems. It is not a love story, at its most youthful and puerile. It's a story about relationships and how good times remain good times, even if they can't be created with the same person anymore. In the end, no one leaves a relationship without learning, and we see this very clearly in the film, since both are, willingly or not, influenced by each other: Summer discovers that love is possible and Tom brings a little more of rationality and maturity for your life. Everything in life is phases, moments, and it's not always the other's fault.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
punchline is the last word,"This was a believable film about unrequited love. I thought the film was quite slow moving and hard to sit through. It was annoying how he chased after her and she was so cold toward him. I suppose this happens a lot in real life. I think the actor who played Tom did a great job but I found the role of Summer to be very annoying. Why would he fall for her? Nothing much happens throughout the whole film until the end. It gets interesting towards the end of the film and then the last word of the film is classic. I do like the theme of hope. I am glad I sat through the whole film and was able to get to the ending because the last word in the film is the punchline to a long, boring joke.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""I'm the hero of this story. I don't need to be saved.""","(5oo) Days of Summer can be summed up as Juno meets Annie Hall. The film's plot concerns an employee for a greeting card company (Tom) who can't escape his previous relationship with a girl named Summer, played by the talented Zooey Deschanel. Bits and pieces of their relationship are presented to the film viewer–out of sequence–as Tom tries to discover why everything fell apart, what he can do to get Summer back, and if love actually exists. I know. It sounds bland, but this one has several elements that push it far beyond the run-of-mill.First, the acting is simply incredible. As I said before, Levitt wowed me with his spot-on Sam Spade impersonation in Rian Johnson's homage to noir films: Brick. In (500) Days however, Levitt sheds his hard boiled detective act and trades it in for the sensitivity and bitterness of Holden Caufield. The sensitive male role is a performance that's often exaggerated to the point where the audience often finds themselves annoyed–and even hating–the character. Levitt's Tom never losses his sympathetic appeal even when his obsession verges on obnoxious behavior in the latter part of the film.Zooey Deschannel is incredible as a thinly veiled Annie Hall clone–Summer. She's the product of a broken home, independent, blunt with her sexuality and incredibly beautiful. This could have been such a simple role to botch. Nothing that Summer says is particularly witty or catchy, but Deschannel (just as Diane Keaton with Annie Hall) manages to make her such an intriguing character through her physical presence . Summer is not only a character that must be watched, but one that must also be read. She must be read through her facial expressions, how she moves her body, and–especially–how she looks at Tom when she's speaking to him or he is speaking to her.The actors aren't the only ones who should be praised. Marc Webb does quite an impressive job with his directorial debut–probably the best since Zach Braff's Garden State. This story could have easily fallen to pieces in the hand of even a seasoned director but Webb rises to the challenge with the talent of virtuoso. The cinematography is never over-the-top or artsy just for the sake of being artsy. Every shot, every angle, and every neat little trick that Webb employs has its purpose. Hopefully, this film marks the beginning of a young and talented auteur's superb career.I feel that it would be wrong not to mention the soundtrack. After all, Tom's attraction to Summer blossoms when she displays her knowledge of the Smith's catalog. The experience simply would not be nearly as enthralling without the music. Every song serves its accompanying scene splendidly and helps the viewer connect with the two leads. I would say that it's even better than the Juno and Garden State soundtracks simply because those soundtrack are more like stellar mix CDs than anything else–there is no theme or running emotion connecting the songs together. (500) Days is a different story. You can almost decipher the story just from listening to the soundtrack. The beginning tracks that deal with the yearning for a crush and the utter joy of ending up with that crush, the middle section of the CD that encompasses the fading of the joy and the eventual disintegration of the relationship, and the final portion of the soundtrack that deals with recovery from and acceptance of the lost relationship. Ultimately, it's an emotion provoking selection of music that's as vital to the movie as the acting and the directing. I would argue that (500) Days of Summer is destined to become a modern classic film, ranking along side Milk, There Will Be Blood, Garden State, Children of Men, American Psycho, and Little Miss Sunshine. Why? It's not because it's a particularly quotable film or that it's an innovative movie with some neat camera tricks. Instead, I think it will because it has a soul. It's a movie that takes a snapshot of love in the modern world and bravely presents it without removing any of the blemishes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Guy's Romance Flick,"Romance movies are generally considered ""chick flicks,"" because they're usually seen from the female point of view. But ""(500) DAYS OF SUMMER"" is clearly a guy's film because it delineates all the joys and sorrows of falling in love from one young man's perspective. Remarkably, I found myself relating entirely with the main character, because back in 1980 I had also fallen for a co-worker, and she just happened to resemble Zooey Deschanel---even down to her hairstyle in this movie! And while it wasn't 500 days of her for me---more like 90 days---all the deep feelings, joys, heady romance, and ultimate disappointment as shown in this film WAS there. So now, even 3 decades later, this film was very meaningful for me. What made it even better was that it was done very creatively; kudos to all involved for their originality of script, cinematography, and editing, and of course all the players are superb in conveying the ups and downs of romance---or at least of deep love that's ultimately and disconcertingly not returned with equal fervor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Masterpiece of the Good/Bad Times of Love,"(500) Days of Summer (2009)**** (out of 4)This romantic comedy is without question one of the best films of the year and will probably go down as one of the greatest films to grace the genre. It's not often I fall head over hill in love with a film from this genre but this here should be put beside ANNIE HALL in terms of its great characters and dialogue. The film tells the story of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), two oddball people who begin dating, which is great until he starts to fall in love and she doesn't. Most Hollywood love stories are so corny and have so much sugar on them that one can't help but get choked in all the stupidity but thankfully that doesn't ring true with this independent masterpiece that manages to be thoughtful, intelligent, funny, sad and perfect nail down the ups and downs of a relationship. ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time and there's a lot of comparisons that could be made with this film. Another favorite of mine from the past decade is Kevin Smith's CHASING AMY and once again, I think the films can be compared for their leading men who go after something they can't have. What works so well with this story is how incredibly charming it is right from the start. The masterful screenplay is so perfectly written that it can jump from happy to sad times and not miss a beat. A lot of director's wouldn't be able to handle this jump and that's why so many films end up feeling uneven but director Webb handles it all perfectly well and doesn't miss a beat. Another major plus is that the performances are so excellent that you can't help but fall in love with the characters. Gordon-Levitt plays that ""dork"" type of character but he brings so much more to the role. His comic timing is perfect but he also manages to be very believable in the more dramatic moments and this includes a rather heartbreaking scene at the end when he finally builds up the courage to ask Summer a certain question while sitting on a park bench. Deschanel seems to have a strong cult following around her and I was never a member until this film. She is so incredible in the role that I honestly can't sit here and think of anyone who would have been better or done more with it. She is so flawless in building up her role into a real character because you could have written her off as the bad person but that never happens because we, unlike Tom, can understand her feelings and her reasons for being the way she is. This is really a film about a guy who finds happiness and expects it to last forever when the second person might not be looking that far ahead. To me the film has a lot to say about relationships, feelings and just human nature all around. The romantic-comedy is perhaps the most worn out genre in film history but ever so often a real gem comes along and (500) DAYS OF SUMMER is that gem.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Here's a review from one of Summer's supporters,"I think many of us can connect with the film at a personal level. I am sure many are connecting with it because they have been dumped for apparently 'inexplicable' reasons by seemingly heartless women. All I can say is that the film reminded me of men who refuse to acknowledge where exactly and why the relationship went sour. Just like the film, drowning under Tom's perspective, refuses to show Summer's justification for the breakup.
I guess interpreting it solely from the male point of view is an easy and common mistake. It is convenient to fall into this trap because of the insanely patriarchal screenwriting.
However, one needs to keep in mind that there is no proper background or characterization for the heroine. She hardly even has decent dialogues. No explanation of her motives. Not a single scene through her eyes. She is just a romanticized figure in the hero's imagination. If you have been rooting for Tom all the way, may be you can re-watch it to acknowledge the problematic characterization instead of wallowing in sympathy for Tom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"More about editing cleverness than real deep feeling, but very fun anyway, and tender.","500 Days of Summer (2009)OK. First--I liked this movie. I seem to emphasize reasons why it wasn't terrific below, but it's good to remember I liked it. And didn't love it.Maybe the clever beginning, insisting through a deep-voiced narrator with a twitch of humor, raises expectations a little: this is not a love story. But it looks and feels like one, and of course, it is one, whatever the end might imply. Love varies and is still love.The movie leans on its format, jumping from moment to moment back and forth through the year and a half of the movie, to give it some of its verve. Surprises are often created by a wry coupling of moments--a happy person as the elevator doors close turns to a sad person when they open, a couple hundred days later. And then back, to day 3 or day 40, or whatever gap might be mined for laughs and irony. This saves the movie, really, but it also becomes the movie, instead of the relationship between the two young leads. The relationship should be everything, and it is everything, of course, but it isn't really much. If you put the pieces back in chronological order, you have something not too amazing, something actually pretty dull, certainly not an hour and half's worth.The man, Tom, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the woman, Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel, are almost perfect. They're fun, they are witty, they are restrained as needed, they show tenderness. I liked them a lot, but I didn't love them, and neither did the person I saw the movie with. And if there is a film that needs a couple with magic on the screen, true chemistry, this is it. But then, of course, the ending might make sense in this light. But then, further, if the whole point is a movie about a romance that doesn't quite get off the ground, it keeps the movie grounded, too. I prefer a movie that takes off somehow.Except for some movie oddities, the events are told simply, and out of order. There is the dancing in the park (completely out of character, but I liked it because it was a breath of air, fresh or not, just air), and some split screen comparisons (sometimes just a way of layering the plot, sometimes to create plot, by creating a fantasy on one side and reality on the other). And these are good, even if they remind you that a lot of the rest is just plain vanilla.In all, the movie is fun, for sure, a joy even, and without glaring issues. Certain clichés are avoided--the woman is strong and smart, the man gentle and un-macho. They actually make a nice couple. But maybe slightly less interesting than some of your friends, who they don't make movies about for the simple reason they aren't interesting enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What movie did everyone else see?,"(500) Days of Summer (2009), directed by Marc Webb, is riding a wave of viewer adoration. Right now, it's listed in the IMDb top 250 films of all time (113th). All I can assume is that the people who gave the film a 9 or a 10 saw a different movie from the one I viewed in Rochester's Little Theatre.What I saw is a man, Tom Hansen, portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is madly, truly in love with Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. OK--Deschanel has big, beautiful blue eyes, and lustrous dark hair. Right--very attractive. Is she intelligent? Not very. Is she kind and caring? Not very. Is she compassionate? Not very. Is she attracted to Tom? Not very.So, we're subjected to 90 minutes of Summer jumping into bed with Tom, all the while telling him that she just wants to be good friends. I guess that's sort of romantic, and it's sort of funny, so technically that makes 500 Days a romantic comedy. It's just not very romantic or very funny.In addition, just to bring the hilarity to a boil, we get Tom's friends, who are a Greek chorus of losers, and Tom's precocious kid sister, who dispenses worldly wisdom in spare moments while she's playing for her junior varsity soccer team.My suggestion--if you want a really good romantic comedy, rent ""Must Like Dogs,"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle."" If you like funny, romantic movies, stay away from ""500 Days of Summer."" (At least, stay away from the version of the movie that I saw in Rochester.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

(500) Days.. that everyone can relate to.,"I was blown away by this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love these kind of movies (more of an indie feel), but I never could call one of them a must-see, besides maybe Juno, but (500) Days of Summer surpasses that by far. The acting is superb, the story is great, but it's the ending that sold me. However, behind the scenes is what really gives this movie an extra edge; the directing. The layout of this movie, the camera shots, just so much is so different, but so good! There is one instant when you're watching two depictions of the same scene, the main role's expectations and the reality. So smart. In the beginning, the narrator says that this isn't a love story. In more ways than one, it truly isn't. However, in that one aspect it's a love story that everyone knows...that first love. Or that love you're hesitant about. Everyone should take an evening to watch this, you will honestly not be disappointed.

(500) Days of Summer subverts all those expectations with the most realistic portrayal of a relationship I've ever seen on the big screen.What makes this movie even more unique is just how depressing the entire ordeal is despite the fact that it's upbeat for the most part, probably because it so aptly dissects the anatomy of a relationship that's growing, waning, then dying to the point of causing discomfort. I can't honestly say I particularly enjoy watching this movie for this exact reason.

The coldest summer ever,"(500) Days of Summer is an evocative film that skillfully captures the bittersweet realities of love. It's not a story about heroes and villains but about two people who want different things, which makes it all the more relatable and haunting. Though I didn't cry, I found myself in a state of quiet reflection, feeling an almost overwhelming sense of emptiness and recognition in the story's honest portrayal of unmet expectations.The characters of Tom and Summer are uniquely compelling in how they challenge and reflect one another. Tom's attachment issues-the way he yearns for love and connection-are painfully relatable. He just wants someone to make him feel valued, while Summer embodies a completely different perspective, prioritizing her autonomy and freedom. She lives in the present and isn't interested in conforming to anyone's expectations, including Tom's. The complex, bittersweet dynamic between them is fascinating, even if it leaves you feeling unsettled, especially when she unexpectedly decides to marry someone else.Visually, (500) Days of Summer is iconic. Its use of black-and-white sequences, side-by-side montages, and meticulously styled wardrobe gives it an almost dark academia vibe that's both nostalgic and immersive. The clever choice of using seasonal motifs-like Autumn following Summer-adds a poetic resonance that perfectly mirrors Tom's personal journey after their relationship ends. The film's setting and atmosphere often feel as if they exist solely within Tom's perspective, especially in scenes where Summer is absent, and the world around him feels isolated and muted. This stylistic choice beautifully highlights how one person can become the center of another's emotional universe.The dialogue is another high point, capturing both the innocence of idealism and the painful moments of realization. Some quotes linger long after the film ends, encapsulating the raw, often unspoken truths about love and expectation. In the end, (500) Days of Summer is both clever and introspective, but it left me feeling hollow-less a movie to revisit, more an experience to ponder.Ultimately, it's a brilliant film, though not one I'd easily return to. It's a testament to how love, even when it's over, can change us in lasting ways, and sometimes, the best way to move forward is to accept the emptiness and keep going.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Love And The Frustrated Architect,"Ah, office love. What could go wrong? A lot, it turns out, when one person's notion of a love to last a lifetime clashes with another's idea of the same situation as a like that will last a lunchtime.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a trained architect who has spent his last three-plus years awash in sentimentality, writing greeting cards as he pretends to be satisfied with his life. Enter Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a beautiful receptionist who takes an interest in him, one that blossoms when they discover a passion for some of the same things, like karaoke and theme music from the TV show ""Knight Rider.""As much a launching pad for a thousand debates as a twisted take on romantic comedy conventions, ""(500) Days Of Summer"" raises a question it never quite gets around to answering about the nature of true love. Still, its ambling quality offers up much pleasure.So does Deschanel, working her usual magic to less gentle affect than normal. It's impossible to dislike her, with her killer blues or the way her nose crinkles when she laughs. But you can't help feeling frustrated by her, a frustration that the film builds upon by presenting their relationship in a series of non-chronological episodes. Tom the frustrated architect is trying to make reality of his fantasy, but Summer isn't really going along. It's here that the film rubs against familiar romantic comedy conventions and carves out some unique emotional territory.""I need to know you aren't going to wake up in the morning and feel differently,"" he tells her.""I can't give you that,"" she replies. ""No one can."" Especially not her, though.In addition to the two leads, the film is strengthened by the supporting cast, especially Tom's two buddies, loyal office wingman MacKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and the more wistful, happily married Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler). Together they provide a hip Greek chorus to Tom's troubles.Gordon-Levitt is a fine, charismatic center for the film. He's part Ahab and part Cary Grant here, getting into a bar fight one moment, the next trying to cover his embarrassment when Summer challenges him to yell the word ""penis"" in a public park as loud as he can. The more he reaches, the more ground he loses, but I think even female viewers will empathize with his concerns. It's funny that the actor himself has said he thinks his character doesn't merit the rooting interest; he may be the only person who thinks that after seeing the movie.The issue here is not one of gender differences, but different takes on life. I go back to him as a frustrated architect, trying to make the rules he understands work in a situation that doesn't allow for them. She's not one to be tied down by anyone else's plans.I realize I'm taking the same approach many others take in regard to this film, by focusing on the dramatic issues and ignoring the comedy. It's pretty funny in places, and well-observed, like when he agonizes over how she answers a simple question about how her weekend was. I love one scene early on when he meets her at a company function, and she tells him she had heard he wasn't showing up. ""You asked?"" he blurts out, beaming triumphantly.The more elaborate comedy sequences don't always come off so well, especially when they become street dancing scenes or parodies of Swedish cinema. These are funny moments, but they don't connect to the main story and become distracting. Worst of all is a rather pat ending, though even that works well enough to let you out with a smile.What really makes ""(500) Days Of Summer"" work is the bracing way director Marc Webb and writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber raise questions about the nature of love. They don't do as good a job of answering them, but do leave you thinking, success of a kind most rom-coms never attain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet Disposition,"Truly one can understand the differences found in peoples disposition. Not one person is replicated, or has the same mindset to react, and perceive life exactly the same. On the topic of intrinsic love it is a part of our very nature to idealize, and long for something that appears so perfect. However, just because something may appear perfect at face value does not mean that it truly showcases the entirety of that something.Oftentimes, it is our expectation of what could be that clouds our judgement. Oftentimes, it is our expectation of what should be that disappoints us. Sometimes we create a false sense of hope in the things that have already been spelled out to us in letters because we are inclined to fulfill an expectation.That being said, if we choose to take what is ideal without recognizing the truth of what is real we will find ourselves indignant to an unfulfilling outcome. Surely, it is troubling to long for something to the point that a passion is put on thin ice for a cold embrace. One should expect the cracking of thin ice to break when the force becomes to unbearable. Therefore, being receptive to a change of pace and setting can allow for us to reach our full potential.Once we truly focus on what allows us to thrive we will find that life itself can be pretty rewarding; and with the changing of the seasons we are given the opportunity to reinvent ourselves within the days that implore for us to live in the moment.

Perhaps the greatest romantic dramedy ever made,"It's the rare movie that leaves you gushing in your couch and at the end you just know you're going to watch that movie over and over again. 500 Days is one of those movies. An absolutely delightful story about love at first sight with a person that tells you up front ""we're just friends"". A love you're told you can't have but you go all in, ignoring the early warning because you've finally met the person of your dreams and you've instantly fallen deeply in love. The movie skips forward and backward in time but does it well by informing you which day of of the relationship it is. Masterfully written and spectacular performances by DesChanel and Gordon-Leavitt. Even if you don't like romantic comedies this movie will be on your list of favorites. So much story packed in to just 90 minutes. Perfection that we just don't see with todays movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a really miserable film,"Well I had high hopes of this film, yet I was totally disappointed. I knew what to expect in the movie, but nothing prepared me for the utterly awful character played by Deschanel. She plays a hideous, self-absorbed, self-important user who endears herself to no one, and she is a totally hypocritical liar to boot. I know she is 'of a type' but that doesn't mean anyone is going to like this character. I certainly didn't, and I found this to be one of the least life-affirming films of the year. The male lead (played by a lifeless doormat) really needs a reality check from the first minute. Avoid this unless you enjoy feeling miserable. Its not big and its not clever.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cute Days of Summer,"Joseph Gordon Levitt is very likeable in this whimsical, fun story of his unrequited love. He does a good job of capturing and expressing the yearning that an unrequited loves creates in a someone. The film does unfold in some unusual ways and ones that I generally found light and fresh, just like a summer day. As for Zooey Deschanel, she does a decent job as well but her character Summer is one that I never really quite understand, I think her Summer is a little flat and underdeveloped. Something is missing with her portion of the story. Despite some minor shortcomings I still found 500 Days of Summer to be a fun, fresh, and a delight of a film and one that is worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Why i love this movie:,"I love this movie not only because it's incredibly well done but because I relate to the main character,Tom. Throughout the movie he is in love with the idea of a girl. Not the real human individual. That's a situation I have found myself in many times. The movie shows how dangerous it is to create those fantasies of people. Often witheout realizing we are doing it we end up hurt. It's a self destructive self sabotage. The movie portrays a realistic personification of this phenomenon.

The relatable intensity of falling in love,"500 Days of Summer is the story of falling in love and the infatuation of it. What it nails is the intensity of falling in love. Zooey Dechanuel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt make for a very relatable couple.The film labours slightly as they fall out of love but the rekindling and eventual move on is also sensational in how relatable and accurate it feels.Something to be said about remembering the good time and it gives a feel good ending speaking of possibilities.I love the musical references like The Smiths, Summer on the whole is lovely.There are a lot of unique elements to this film and not all of them land. The mature little sister feels slightly unbelievable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The most perfect visualization of relationships ever put on film.,"Some films feel like genuine masterpieces that cannot nor ever will be topped by similar films. 500 Days of Summer is such a film; it is so perfectly crafted in its writing, direction, acting, editing and other major departments that after seeing it one feels off kilter, wondering if they had seen a fictional movie (as the title cards read in the opening) or a portal in which the inner workings of a young man and his quest for true love was connected directly to the audience. So strong and powerful was my emotional reaction and connection to this film, it could in many ways alter forever my view of relationships. Is that good or bad? As an indie-budget production, there are really only two sections that can make or break this type of film: writing and acting. The script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is as close to perfect as I've ever seen in any film of any genre. The dialogue feels completely accurate and true to the context of the situations of the characters, the situations themselves are real and totally believable and the nonlinear narrative works extremely well in bringing the audience not only into a deeper sympathy with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character but also in convincing us that a number of these scenes may be dreams. First-time director Marc Webb keeps the tricks to a minimum, using only what is necessary to support the story and not divert from it. The film is tight in its pace, which builds the tension and emotion all the more.This now brings us to the acting which is, needless to say, flawless. Gordon-Levitt has been a star-in-the-making for a while now but combining this performance with his in Christopher Nolan's Inception proves he is truly one of the best young actors of this generation. He so perfectly handles both the funny and serious moments of Tom Hansen's journey through love, completely believable in every single frame. He is a nice guy so we root for him, but his pain is visceral and tender so we identify with him. He creates one of the best protagonists I have ever seen in a movie. Zooey Deschanel is an actress I have loved ever since she played the perky, blonde singing elf in Elf. However, her game has been raised significantly from such trash as Failure to Launch. She creates a sympathetic character as well but in an entirely different way. Summer is a woman with many events in her life that would lead to her feeling about relationships the way she does. Therefore, it is understandable that she would do what she does in this film. Yet, there is no excuse given to properly and completely understand who and why she does what she does. We only get glimpses; we see her through Tom's eyes and despite her great beauty and quirky personality, there is always the feeling that something deeper lingers below. Needless to say, the chemistry between the two leads is something to behold. It may be a stretch to compare them to legends such as Bogart/Bacall or Grant/Hepburn but I felt completely comfortable and enchanted by both of them, together and individually.Getting down to it, why is this quite simply the best portrayal of relationships ever put to celluloid? Many would question that statement and it may not be true, but it is most certainly true for this generation that Tom and Summer represent. Here are two people on different paths that happen to cross. Is it fate or coincidence? Each has different views of that and by the end their views are slightly askew. The film would say that it's a little of both. I think that is the best statement the writers and director could make. I have heard many detractors of the film say that it is too sad, that Summer is an unsympathetic person and the ending is completely false. I would simply remark that life is quite often too sad, Summer is sympathetic in a much different way than most romantic-comedy girls and the ending rang true in the sense that Tom's journey isn't over. Many, if not all, guys have been in Tom's shoes. This makes it the best story about love for guys. It also makes it the type of film that when you see it, you feel changed inside.The vast majority of films in this genre are totally dead and unrealistic. Films like Adventureland and 500 Days of Summer show that with the right script and the right cast, a story can be told that is funny, sad, smart and completely, utterly, totally, indubitably: perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Peak of Flash Mobs,"A unique film in that it tells you what it is and how it will end from the get go. Though it is a love story, just not the typical ones we see in film. Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is confused through much of the story and isn't sure why. He see's the world through a certain set of rose coloured glasses that have been placed upon him from outside influences such as movies, and pop music. During his 500 days with Summer, this whole idea gets flipped on its axis. As he works through this, you can see that by the end he is better for it.One thing for sure, the film is obsessed with being trendy. The indie music is set on repeat almost making it numbing, and the injection of a flash mob just made me ask why? Oh yeah, because it's 2009.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A delightfully refreshing take on romantic comedy.,"What a delightful film. From the opening screen, which offers a very funny disclaimer, it is clear that 500 Days of Summer dares to be different. And as the opening sequence clearly states, it is not a love story. Except that's only a technicality. It really is. Sort of.Writers Scott Neustadter and Michael Webber, along with director Marc Webber, have put together a charming, fresh and very funny romantic comedy. Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) start an office romance when Summer comes to LA from Michigan for an internship at a greeting card company. Tom writes cards, although he quietly aspires to be an architect. Tom is a romantic idealist who has never found his soul mate. Summer is a disillusioned pragmatist who doesn't believe in love. But Summer immediately takes to Tom, Tom is smitten with Summer and their relationship proceeds as so many do in the movies.Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt play their roles well, although it occurred to me more than once that they lacked chemistry. But remember, this is not a love story, which is what makes 500 Days of Summer more realistic and poignant than what we have come to expect from the movies. But it is a refreshing and thought-provoking take on what we often describe as being in loveabout taking risks, dealing with disappointments, finding yourself and bumping into fate when you least expect it.The film includes a couple of movie-making devices that some might find distracting. It uses a timeline to tell the story, but jumps forward and back, which still manages to effectively provide a narrative without feeling like a contrivance. In contrast, the film also pays homage to a number of classic movies, including several clips and snippets, which feels out of place and doesn't quite fit.As currently constructed, 500 Days of Summer will get an R rating. If they can edit it to a PG-13, which would be quite easily done, it could do nicely at the box office.Notes from Sundance: At opening night at the Eccles Center, Deschanel commented on how attracted she was to the script. Director Marc Webber made the point that he wanted to shoot on location in LA, but show a bit of the city's architectural heritage, which did very subtly separate 500 Days from typical Hollywood-Indie fare.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Embarrassing mediocre,"Somebody said that the film is told in an ""innovative and clever narrative style"". I wouldn't acknowledge as a big innovation a non-linear story with a voice over (copied from The Royal Tenenbaums). But I agree on the fact that this is the best part of the movie. Full of most poor clichés like the musical scene after Tom gets laid and the visit to Ikea (sorry, was that advertising?). I couldn't relate with any of the characters, too superficial, too weak. The soundtrack could be inspirational for a teenager, absolutely boring for anybody that has a minimum of knowledge of indie and alternative music. No edge, no inspiration, pure mediocrity.

"An ""Annie Hall"" for the New Millennium","An utterly engaging bittersweet romance about a boy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a girl (Zooey Deschanel) who want different things from one another during the course of a gradually waning relationship.This is ""Annie Hall"" for the 21st Century. The film is funny, brisk and entertaining, but it's also fairly serious minded about young love and the pitfalls it's prone to. Both actors give terrific performances -- Gordon-Levitt is proving himself to be one of our best up-and-coming actors, while Deschanel bravely gives us a heroine who we end up not really liking all that much.Despite some overly cute elements (the several scenes between Gordon-Levitt and his little sister, who gives him romantic advice during timeouts at her soccer game, for example), ""(500) Days of Summer"" feels one hundred times more authentic than the usual romantic comedy fare churned out by Hollywood. It suggests that some of our most significant relationships are more valuable for what they teach us about ourselves than the fleeting emotional connections they give us to another person.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Finally reality shown,"A really solid movie that didn't sugar-coat what forcing feelings and expectations into someone else and the relationship shared with said person, and mostly ended with a complete explanation on why most people fail at having a real relationship, a healthy one mostly... because of reciprocity always lacking of course.Here, we had Tom actually in real need to figure out his own self and be more honest with himself and people surrending him before pretending to be real and sincere with someone else; and the comparison of the way he abordes Summer for the first time and the way he did with the second girl one the 500 days of Summer finally have came to an end was fabulously talkative of it. From his very first lines of dialogue, I thought I was facing a Ted Mosby bis, therefore perfectly aware about the fact I would have to follow a quite intense delusional guy through the entirety of the movie, and let's say I didn't get disappointed on that one.Here, we follow someone completely out of touch with himself, until in denial : his real desires and aspirations in life, what really could and would fulfill him etc. The fact that so many people based their views of love through contents media offers us since day one - meaning music/books/movies/TV shows and so many others - well, it does explain why so many people never have experienced a real healthy relationship, and sadly might never, and I'm not talking exclusively about the romantic ones. Why so many people relationships end in complete debacle. Objectively, this movie offers us a really consistent happy ending, however in real life let's say that majority never succeed yo quit that vicious circle destroying and sabotaging themselves and all the relationships they would have, until their professional life.That movie perfectly portrays how someone expectations would never align with reality, and actually thanks God, if that's the beauty of it. Nothing's written or predestined, we are at the helm of our own destiny and the ones (significant other AND friends) really good for us
and that we really are going to be good for, they'll come to us naturally, simply by getting out of our comfortable zone and actually be honest about what we desire with the person and give it a try, again in any type of relationship with a peer. And so, in the romantic ones, the one we choose and we are chosen by for living our life as a team, and built together, well the built of your own person and same for your SO ones should not be sacrificed over it, in the contrary it should compliment it... and when you click, you click, chemistry can't be forced, neither feelings. They just come, you're not supposed to condition them into it, if not you're rather living what majority of people are living: conditional love, the ultimate illusion of what real love really is, knowing that real love is unconditional and selfless, and if you're lucky enough to meet that person you'll knew it, no explanation would be needed. No need to put it on faith, mystical signs, destiny or whatever. It will the one for you because, just because. Aside romantic relationships, you love someone because of the said person been herself, regardless of any other conditions involved, that's what real love is, an sane a sincere one. Hence falling in love goes like that as well: two souls meeting and connecting, almost immediately, endless entanglement of two essences, only fuel needed to love that person: her existence and her full happiness regardless how, and with whom... and all that be reciprocated at the same degree.That's what loving and been in love is and that movie portrayed it perfectly, therefore I'm really thankful to have randomly stumbled on it and would recommend it to anyone in search of the realness of the beauty of what real love could be if finally decided to let go of those dull flat and tasteless fairytales media stuck us with since childhood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Raw Take on Love and Expectations,"500 Days of Summer, offers a refreshing and honest look at relationships, challenging the usual romantic ideals. The film follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) as their romance unfolds in a non-linear fashion, highlighting the gap between Tom's idealized dreams and Summer's more grounded reality.Tom falls for Summer with a vision of a perfect relationship, while Summer is upfront about her reluctance to commit. Tom's refusal to accept her true feelings sets the stage for his eventual heartbreak. The film's emotional depth comes from Tom's struggle to align his fantasies with the reality of their relationship, showing that the real issue lies in his unrealistic expectations.The film is both poignant and eye-opening, illustrating how our personal ideals can cloud our perception of a partner. With strong performances and a unique narrative style, ""500 Days of Summer"" is a powerful reminder that understanding and acceptance are crucial in love, and sometimes, the real problem is our own unwillingness to face the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Joseph is such a great actor!,"A simple drama story yet creative, created by the rising director Marc Webb and played by a rising star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a talented actress Joey Deschanel, and other qualified actors/actresses.One unique point about this movie is that its story is told in a non-linear plot during 500 hundred days.I realize that this movie is not something commercial. Many people will state that it's not enjoyable; however, for me, this is one of kinds that suits my taste.Of course, two thumbs up goes to the story idea writer and screenplay, Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

"Mediocricity, Banality and Hype","500 Days of Summer is a film that does not contain a single interesting idea although it tries so hard to say something. Films without a great message, even simple love films, are fine but the problem here: even a Hugh Grant film contains more humor, originality and soul. The events in 500 days of Summer are predictable (and even the narrative device of jumping back and forth in time cannot conceal it), the relationship between the protagonists are completely superficial, and there is not even one single interesting scene or even detail in this film. Summer and Tom are running through IKEA stores, singing Karaoke and sitting in the park. They talk about boring things in a pseudo-philosophical tone. To give a bit of an ""edge"" to it you got some reference to 1980s alternative music and Bergman films. Everything is in vain: the lack of chemistry between the lead actors (and their lack of talent) and the highly in-original script make this film a failure.

It was almost like falling in love.,"I loved Chloë Grace Moretz's character. It was funny and interesting how the main character kept going to his little sister for advice, and she was actually really insightful. Having just finished a human development class, which is basically a psychology class, I don't think I'd have understood the ""organized anal girl"" joke without it.The movie is heartbreaking and tragic for a large part of it. I liked the narration, which explores expectations versus reality. The main character saw things the way he wanted to see them and ended up breaking his own heart. Despite how it ends, it was a bit of a downer for me. It's not a fairytale story; it could be considered a realistic portrayal of love and relationships, especially if you've ever been ""delulu"" in love lol.The movie can be understood in different ways, which is why there are so many posts, articles, and videos titled something like ""hey, you misunderstood the movie."" I've seen a bunch of these posts over the years, showcasing different perspectives. I think it all depends on your own personal experiences. There are lessons everyone can take away, like not being blinded to reality by love or understanding that just because someone shares your interests doesn't mean they're your soulmate.It's kind of weird because the movie left me emotionally drained, yet it felt upbeat. That could be due to the soundtrack, or the title being ""500 days of summer."" Also I do like the soundtrack, but I feel like my friends would say I only feel that way because I like ""white people music."" The movie shows how amazing love can be when it's good to you, but also how devastated it can have you. It was more depressing than I expected.

A few complaints...,"-the tonality is a bit awkward. The comedy, even the 'highbrow' stuff, is really, really silly, and while that's not a problem at all, that the next scene is supposed to have a strong dramatic impact on the audience comes across as jarring and not in a good way because the transition is so clumsily handled much of the time.-the movie thinks it has more gravity than it does. The Henry Miller quote (""the best way to get over a woman is to turn her into literature"") explains this to me. Clearly that's what the screenwriters have done with their past relationships, but as a result, as I suspect such an attempt by most writers including myself would, the movie attaches a little too much gravity to what is really another office-born half-romance. The movie treats the subject matter with a sense of irony and there are scenes which plainly show the reality of the matter, but I really found it hard to care that much when watching it again. They never seemed all that compatible. They had just met and had some fun times. Tom got too attached. Why Tom's obsession should make for earth-shattering drama I don't understand. I couldn't help but think about the relationship I'm in and think how trivial this 500 days of events seemed next to the years invested mutually in a friendship then romance, the incredibly tumultuous events we've weathered together. Then I think back to ""Annie Hall"" and recognize that relative to my experience, that relationship can be seen as trivial as well. That I can, for the length of ""Annie Hall"", feel like that relationship is the summation of humanity's history of existence, says something about the quality of execution in that movie relative to this. The awkward dramatics (I RLY HOPE U R HAPPY SUMMAR, and the godawful Big Speech about how bad greeting cards are, wow, writers, feel good about writing what millions of bitter anti-mainstream sorts are talking about at this very moment... I've never heard that before!) and cheesy narration don't really help much at all, and betray at times the superb performances from basically all the actors in the film, but especially Gordon-Levitt. Even ""Adventureland"" from earlier this year, with its summer fling at an amusement park, feels more important somehow than this portrayal of half a billion corporate office 'romances' going on right now, maybe because it's predicated on the smoldering sexual energy of the leads instead of attempting to deal (and clumsily) with stuff like fate and true love and that.-the characters really, really are lacking in depth. Summer can be read as an interesting subversion of the manic pixie dream girl character, but Tom is a cultured version of a sitcom character and everyone else in the movie a caricature. The screenwriters appear to be cultured themselves, but only manage to loan this characteristic to their characters on a temporary basis, turning them right back into regular, plain, dull corporate annoyances who shop at IKEA (but go to cool-looking record stores and to see The Graduate!) in a matter of seconds. They're all too reminiscent of people I meet every day with the pretense of cultural interest and all the snobbery attached to it (including instant dismissal of sports culture, to my great annoyance), but very little actual knowledge of anything beyond the absolute mainstream of the underground (Smiths and Bergman references galore, but try talking to them about The Trash Can Sinatras or Jacques Rivette).-that final scene. Oh god, that final scene. Oh god, that final scene.All that said, I still liked it, just because it's a tremendous, very quotable comedy and genuinely clever at times, unlike Juno and such, and has some great movie scenes like the split-screen one and the musical montage and what follows, the art movie/Bergman parody/homage etc. etc. The comedy's great, too bad the drama's so clumsy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Made me wanna cry,"Coincidence, that's all anything ever is
Nothing more than coincidenceThis movie was a hard hitter to say the least. With stunning performances shown by Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Zooey Deschanel, and a beautiful theme and story. Even though hard at times it really has a powerful and lasting message.The movie is about Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) a young man who is working at a greeting card facility, when one day he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel) his bosses new assistant. The plot thickens and they eventually both confess to liking each other and the story takes off.This movie is a very touching watch to say the least. It really shows what love feels like, it makes you feel it through the screen. It also shows you the feelings of depression and grief that happens after you lose that. It also just tells the story of life, and how it just happens. Everything is a coincidence and nothing happens for a reason.I totally recommend this movie. It's very pretty visually, has a great set of memorable lines, and is beautifully written. Please watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazon says this is a comedy,"This movie does have some funny parts and cutesy parts; Funny because of Geoffery Arend nd cutesy because of Joseph and Zooey, obviously. However, I wouldn't call this a comedy by any means... I wouldn't even consider this a dark comedy.Maybe from a misandrist's perspective this is a comedy, but all around this move is pretty effed up. This movie wouldn't be funny to me regardless if the genders of the lead characters were swapped. Regardless, this is a good film, but I felt mislead by Amazon saying it was a comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a romantic comedy that actually works,"""(500) Days of Summer"" is not the first movie to tell a love story using an unorthodox chronology - with ""Two For the Road,"" ""Betrayal"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" having done brilliant trailblazing work in this area long ago. Yet, while ""Summer"" is not quite in the same league with those three earlier masterpieces, it's certainly miles above the formulaic nonsense that too often passes for romantic comedy these days.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who in ""Mysterious Skin"" delivered one of the truly searing dramatic performances of recent times, here displays a similar adeptness at light comedy playing Tom Hansen, a greeting-card writer who falls head-over-heels in love with Summer Finn (the adorable Zooey Deschanel), a newly-hired assistant in the office.While Tom is dead-set on having a meaningful, permanent relationship, Summer feels no compulsion to throw herself into any kind of long-term commitment, determined to savor the freedom that comes with being attractive and unattached in a buzzing metropolis like Los Angeles.Rather than following a strictly linear chronology, the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Mark H. Weber freely jumps around in time, a technique that allows us to observe the various stages of the couple's courtship simultaneously. But fear not, for the writers are careful to identify, through numbered title cards, which of the 500 days any particular scene is taking place on so the audience doesn't become disoriented. This ""dramatic irony"" approach of letting us in on where the relationship will eventually wind up - beyond what even the characters themselves know at the time - adds an additional layer of poignancy to the romance.Astutely directed by Marc Webb, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is marked by smart writing, perceptive storytelling, charming performances, occasional flights of fancy and a rich attention to detail. And there's a scene on a park bench near the end of the movie that is absolutely heartbreaking.A quick FYI: for a far more somber version of pretty much the same story, check out the equally fine ""The Hottest State"" by Ethan Hawke. Together, these two films would make for an interesting double-bill.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"At the end, the life goes on with love and with memories of love","Sometimes we have memories, the incident that caused that memory hurts like hell, but eventually it gets easier and the memory becomes a better part of life. But actually is that fate or just a coincidence? Tom felt love for the first time when he saw Summer and he knew it. But is he the only one who felt it? However Summer decided to spend time with him because he is funny and makes her happy. The spent time happily for a while and suddenly Summer just decided to quit. Is it even possible?Like I said Summer didn't know what she is feeling with him and she couldn't label it. But not Tom. For him it was love and she is his gf, partner, soulmate etc etc. Suddenly after getting away from Tom, she fall in love with a guy who askes her what book is she reading? It's not fair. She already knew someone that cares for her, kinda obsessed with her and make her happy. Why did she choose not to think about him? I mean he was not selfish at all, he was clearly a good partner. Why she chose a random guy over the good guy she knew so well? Why didn't she choose to label the nameless relationship to something meaningful? The most important thing, why didn't she care about the guy who made her happy?Nope I cannot accept that. Yeah, I know, the pain will go away and eventually Tom will be ok and he will find a better one eventually blah blah blah. But it's not only about Tom. It is just a character in the movie. The audience may feel the pain sometimes and that is not something fictious. God I cannot just label is it one of a good 1 and 1/2 hours of my life or one of the worse. But I do know one thing. I enjoyed that 1 and 1/2 hour. And I don't care the fact that I felt 10 times pain than happiness during that time. (Maybe that's how Tom dealt with it)...",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"37 views. Every time you watch it, it gives you a great feeling.","I haven't seen a romance this touching since I was the same type of single sad sack as depicted by the hero of (500) Days of Summer.Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has his radar up for ""the girl of his dreams"" when he meets Summer (Zooey Deschanel). Too bad for Tom Summer is stuck on friends-with-benefits mode. Let the tension begin.Director Marc Webb captures the feeling of innocent, naïve love expertly. Anyone who has taken the lyrics of the Smiths too closely to heart, would be moved by the idea of the person they are crushing on sing to them: ""To die by your side/is such a heavenly way to die."" No wonder Tom soon falls head over heels for this girl.As events unfold out of sequence, you know all along Tom has fallen for a time bomb of a woman, and he can't even see the countdown. When that bomb finally blows up in his face, it unfolds with powerful simplicity-- no exposition or dialog, just two juxtaposed events that capture the heartache of reality hitting a person who sees a person through the filter of deep-seated emotions that were planted at too young an age.So many romantic films nowadays concern themselves with cute ideas; take 'He's Just Not That Into You' or 'Serendipity' for example. Even movies like 'Knocked Up' where a pot-smoking, video-gaming, narcissistic slob tries to turn his life around to try to be a father feels more contrived than real. These movies forget about human feelings. Who cares about stock or cartoonish characters in love. The couple in (500) Days of Summer have true chemistry. There are some beautiful, subtle moments of tenderness as well as some heart-rending moments of disconnectedness between the two that never comes across as heavy-handed. The movie constantly reminds you that these are two different people with different ideas of a relationship, yet they stubbornly continue dating, and they remain lovable all the same.An omniscient narrator sets the film up early on by noting ""this is not a love story."" And, in a way, it isn't. It's a story about feelings. It just so happens (500) Days of Summer captures the sensation of falling in love better than most movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
just okay,"not bad, but I never felt involved in his film. Maybe it's the lack of an attractive leading woman, or that they barely filled out her character beyond ""quirky"". Really, it's hard to understand why he's so in love with her with what I saw in the film. Seems like many of the best lines were in the previews.At times it also felt like many scenes were just pop tunes and scenery. I did like the happy scene where he dances with people in the street and the bluebird of happiness shows up, that was good.Overall, though, it felt a little contrived to me. Also, why does every guy in the movies now have two friends who give him advice about relationships? Is this now a rule of comedy that 3 guys have to get together throughout the film and talk about relationships?",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Zooey Deschanel is sweet and lovely, but lacks a bit of punch in her role. The chemistry between them is very believable though.The story has some decent humour, but was never as emotional as it should have been.

The best romantic comedy I've ever seen- And it's not even a love story!,"*** out of (****)Hollywood is typically known for throwing those nightmare inducing chick flicks that are heavily appalling to endure. How inconsistent, artificial, and non-relatable those pieces of drivel are. Take two A-list actors, a mammoth of a budget, heavy advertising, an A-list actor, and Hollywood automatically thinks those aspects make a decent film. Films these days have fallen so short of substance because of the unappealing character development, the paint-by-numbers plot, and the predictability level is off the charts. Shoot, even mentioning the aforementioned ways of Hollywood is already cliché and by-the-numbers in itself. Albeit, (500) Days of Summer is so shockingly realistic, that one may seem to think that in reality, one such romance would never end on such a hard punch to the abdomen. One would also predict that the film would come off as a pretentious, over-the-top mess that screams ""desperate"", just to appeal to the hipster crowd. Fortunately, (500) Days of Summer is so overbearingly real that it is a thousand times more relatable than any other romantic comedy you've ever seen. Also, how it manages to side skirt every ""chick flick"" cliché and comes off as anti-pretentious, is just remarkable. (500) Days of Summer is not just the best romantic comedy you'll ever see, but probably one of the best movies you'll see in the last five years.(500) Days of Summer revolves around Tom (Levitt) who's outright admiration goes to Summer (Deschanel). Summer is like a pin point on a map that takes Tom's life to another adventure. Fortunately, Summer is Tom's ""luck-be-lady-tonight"" , although, things don't go as planned. Summer gives Tom a lecture on love and how artificial it is. How ""love"" is just a textbook topic that is a gimmick. However, Tom sees love in a different light and thinks it's a beautiful treasure. Albeit, Summer thinks Tom as a friend with benefits, while Tom thinks he has a bright future with Summer. Will the spotlight be panned on Tom or Summer?The one of the many things that makes (500) Days of Summer play out like a commentary on life rather than a quick-buck cop-out, is the script. Just the dialog puts emphasis on how brutally honest this film is. The words the characters blurt out and the situations the characters encounter, is like a prime example of a documentary. Furthermore, the characters are just phenomenal. Their performances are so strong and realistic, it's like the viewer's life is projected onto the screen. To top it off, the film, stylistically, is a blast. The director uses a few tricks that are up his sleeves like the split screen. The film has a very ""indie"" feel to it. What's the icing on the cake, is the direction. This movie could have gone the inane and complete slap-in-the-face route, but it took the road less traveled by. Additionally, the soundtrack is just awe-inspiring. There's no cliché love songs or any mainstream sell-outs. Every music piece hits strong like a dodge ball does at a prepubescent kid in P.E. To add to that, the pacing is also flawless. No scenes feel tedious or too abrupt. Everything moves by at a rather smooth pace.You know the times, whether prepubescent or adulthood, where a man has had a dream girl and thinks everything is going to be pinpointed on a map right in front of his face, although, things take a turn for the worst? (500) Days of Summer demonstrates the cold truth. The performances are raw, the script is rich with reality, and the direction is bold. This is what filmmakers should be doing. Instead, most romantic comedy directors are stuck in their sandbox love memories tinkering with their fantasy world, rather than reaching for the truth tinkering with reality. (500) Days of Summer is definitely a copy and paste of the average person's life, but I mean that in the greatest way. If there's only one romantic comedy you'll see this year, make sure it's this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

However, the character was written in a way that viewers are forced to hate it to some extent. Like Cersei of Game of Thrones. You hate the character, but you know Lena Heyday was great.The story was good. And the non linear way of telling it also made it a movie of somewhat different taste. The ending (of the story) was also good, not something predictable like many other romantic drama (it's not a spoiler as at the beginning you are informed how it is gonna end).Overall an enjoyable movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Watchable,"After watching(or avoiding at times) all the sugary romantic movies that seem to try too hard to get its message across, 500 days of summer comes as a pleasant surprise. The movie doesn't aim for the sky and maybe it doesn't need to. It's a simple tale which is well told. Perhaps the most striking feature of this movie is its unconventional approach. The acting is consistent with the overall tone of the movie. No histrionics demanded, no histrionics delivered is the way i'd put it. The soundtrack is refreshing. The direction is adequate. What stands out however is the screenplay of the film. At a running time of just over 90 minutes, the editing is crisp. The fact that it does not take itself too seriously is its biggest advantage since that is precisely what makes it an easy watch. The movie might not feature in the list of 'top 100 movies' or 'movies you must watch before you die' but it's a nice way to spend a not-so-busy evening.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie of your life.,"Only in a few ways is, ""an off-beat romantic comedy"" a fair description. It does little to embody the true nature of this film, which, is far greater than what can be said in a few words.Rather loosely do I consider this film a ""Rom Com."" By comparison to others, yes -- you may call it ""off-beat."" However, in ways that mere words will do little to express, I found it incredibly ON-beat. If your heart beats at all like Tom Hansen's, you will be in awe at how perfectly this film mirrors and embodies your deepest experiences with girls like Summer Finn. In this way, the story is amazingly realistic, and the connection that is carefully crafted between viewer and movie is absolutely profound. It reaches out to you blindly, KNOWING it will grab your hand.The scenes between Tom and Summer are virtually perfect. Perfect in the sense that they form the core essence of the film which is based on a true story -- that story being your life. In this way, I consider the movie non-fiction. Everything about it is so archetypal. The experiences, the characters. Summer Finn is the EPITOME of those her type, and if you can relate to this film as much as I can, you will INEVITABLY think of certain girls from your past. Even more profoundly, certain scenes may trigger flashbacks of your past -- it's THAT relatable.By comparison with it's artistically liberal nature, its cinematic approach is a bit uncomplicated and perhaps at times slightly sub-par. On one hand, I consider it a very realistic movie and in that way, less is more. On the other however, I feel the camera work and editing could have been a bit more interesting. There were some sweet spots here and there, likely inspired by the French New Wave approach of ""The Graduate,"" but ultimately the cinematography had a lot more potential to lend itself to the emotion of the movie.All in all, this is a phenomenal film. It plays in an odd time signature, experimenting with key, scale, and tempo changes, but again: If you're like me or Tom Hansen, you know that it plays to the beat of a broken heart, and that's beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Different, quirky, real and honest","I won't attempt to outdo some of the excellent reviewers on this site. But, for the record, it seems to me this is more of a ""coming-of-age"" story than a love story. Perhaps I just have yet to accept Mr. Gordon-Levitt as an adult. (He was 26 when this film was in production and still appears so damn youthful.) Whatever... he delivers a near-perfect performance as the wanna-be architect turned greeting card designer. (Makes sense in this current economy.) Falling in love with co-worker, Summer, the screenplay bounces back and forth over a 500-day period of their friendship/love story mainly from Tom's (Gordon-Levitt) point of view. Summer Finn's intense self-center absorption captivates Tom to near crazed, self-destructiveness. Ms. Zooey Dechannel's portrayal is good, but most scenes are carried by Gordon-Levitt. I imagine the part of Summer being played better by a score of actresses and perhaps the director intended this rather uneven pairing.I think many of us will identify with these characters. The rather young, lost, soul-searching young male falling for the girl/woman ""wild-child"" beauty of a Summer Finn. Most likely during a college romance - not in one's mid-20's - but our world is an ever changing social order. The new 50 is now 40 and so on, and so on.If for nothing else the film is worth your time and thought. Again, kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Different from modern romantic movies,"A rare gem with non-linear story telling that is, indeed, different from the usually appealing romantic movies or love stories. It starts with the line, ""This is not a love story"", that set my expectations about the romance-comedy genre low. The music was so good and appropriate.

This is not a love story,"""500 Days of Summer"" is a refreshingly honest and quirky romantic comedy that delves into the complexities and nuances of love, relationships, and heartbreak. The film tells the story of Tom Hansen, a hopeless romantic and aspiring architect, who falls deeply in love with Summer Finn, a free-spirited and charming woman who doesn't believe in love. As they navigate their 500-day relationship, the film takes us on a journey of ups and downs, twists and turns, and moments of pure joy and heart-wrenching sorrow.Through its non-linear storytelling, the film cleverly weaves together the highs and lows of Tom and Summer's relationship, expertly capturing the all-consuming nature of love and the pain of heartbreak.

I'm not sure. Not Bad. Not Great.,"Okay, I'll be honest - I'm not sure how I feel about the movie. The narrator did warn it wasn't going to be a love story, but everything almost felt like a love story? It's filled with heartbreak but then the ending almost makes up for it? I can't blame Summer (Zooey Deschanel), she did mention to Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) that she's looking for something casual but I can't blame Tom either, he's love-struck. It's not a bad movie, it's not a good movie either. I purely watched it because I needed a movie below 100 minutes and this one fit the bill.The five-star rating is because it's the mid-point.

I agree with this guy who wrote the following,"""The point is that this is REAL. I don't know why people are saying she's a liar when she isn't. She's very upfront about what she wants because that's genuinely what she thought. But then things escalated. That's how it works sometimes. Just because we think we want something doesn't mean it'll work out that way. And people get caught up. And by the time she was too far in she realized it was too late and he was in love. That doesn't make her a liar, it makes her human. Summer could've handled it better. Hanson could've also handled it better. He knew her intentions going in, but he got caught up. Just like the rest of us. It happens. There's no villain here, just human beings. If you're just gonna watch this movie and cry about how all women are evil because you're a pathetic excuse of a human, then please exit. This movie is heartbreaking, but also a good lesson. It may not be for everyone and that's ok, but no need to blame an entire gender for something a fictional character did (even though she didn't? Still confused where the ""she's a liar"" thing came in...). Watch this if you've ever gotten carried away with love, and hopefully you see the beauty :)""I recently went through a similar experience in my relationship. Where my girlfriend of roughly 6 months at the time started to realize she didn't really want a relationship. Unlike Summer she never said she never wanted it, and she believed that she did want it. Then after a while she realized she didn't. It sucked so much for my sad ass, but I understood her. If anything that jsut hurt more, cause I genuily believed were where meant to be in so many ways. But I always knew we were too young(She was 18 and I 20) and combine that with a long distance (She was german and I'm from sweden). Loved her to death and she loved me. And she realized it was too early and too much, and perhaps that she never should've from the start. We don't chat, and we both miss each other's best friend. After watching this I've accepted the situation more, god it was relatable, but not in a sad way. It was a reassuring experience I suppose. I know we can be friends again, with time. Who knows, maybe one day we can try again. But who cares? What happened happend, and what will happen will happen!. Even though I would never want anyone else, I'll perhaps find my Autumn soon.This is not a horror movie, a love movie or a tragic movie. This is a happy movie about life.

As good as a ballad by The Smiths,"I missed ""(500) Days of Summer"" earlier this year at Sundance (it was one of several 2nd choices for me), but thankfully I just got the chance to see it as it finally came out in my town.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) are a lot like Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) from ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", and the object of Tom's desire has a lot in common with the mother of modern complicated muses, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton in one of Woody Allen's masterpieces, if for some reason you haven't seen it yet). You can say, then, why bother seeing this? It's been done before...Not exactly. Love and relationships are eternally confusing themes, and ""(500) Days of Summer"" manages to be fresh and witty enough to deserve your time. Reasons: Newcomer Marc Webb (who was a post-production assistant in 1996's documentary about grunge music ""Hype!"") shows promising talent behind the camera; the script, by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is sharp, honest and hilarious; and, last but not least, the wonderful chemistry between two incredibly cute figures who can also act their asses off: the versatile Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Mysterious Skin"") and the indie muse Zooey Deschanel (""All the Real Girls""). It's impossible not to fall in love with one of them, or most likely with both of them, like I did.

"Refreshing, original romantic comedy","500 Days of Summer starts off as the classic love story: boy meets girl, he thinks she is the one and things are great for a while ... until they aren't.The movie has many things going for it that make it stand out: the back and forth narrative, the showing of two versions of the same event (reality and expectations), the pop culture references (The Smiths, Belle and Sebastian, or the scene where Tom goes to the cinema alone and sees himself in various movies such as The Seventh Seal, or the scene with his happy street dance, a homage to Ferris Bueller's Day Off) and, probably above anything else, how realistic, honest and relatable it is, as it avoids the cliche happy ending, but remains optimistic.Great performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his chemistry with Zooey Deschanel is key to the success of the movie.If there's a complaint to be made, it lacks a bit in the comedic aspect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

She's alluring and desirable while maintaining a flat, detached affect that only makes her more desirable to all who come in contact with her. Words float from her mouth when she speaks as if to denote a subtle indifference. Holding her hand could cause yours to feel empty. Like holding the hand of a ghost. It's her way to be there, and not be there. She likes it that way. It's safe.Deschanel is brilliant at this and totally believable as Levitt's, unattainable, object of desire. Levitt is wonderfully lost in love for this ""perfect"" girl. He is confused, bedazzled, and depressed - he's in love. He navigates all of the roller coaster stages of his characters head on collision with love with deftness and poignancy. I can not imagine any two other actors doing this movie greater justice.There are so many good moments in this movie it might be inappropriate to single out just one over the plethora of others. But I will anyway. It is a beautifully subtle scene with Summer and Tom sitting in a theater watching the final scene of the movie ""The Graduate"" with Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross. Hoffman and Ross have escaped the chaotic world around them. It's just the two of them now, holding hands, moving ahead into the sunset. Seeing this, Summer (Deschanel), becomes emotional, surprising both herself and Tom. What happens in those few moments is at the heart of this film. And it's importance could almost go by unnoticed because it's done so delicately. As this moment is unfolding we already know everything about Tom. He has no secrets. From the start of this film his chest cavity is wide open with his beating heart on full display. Summer, on the other hand, is all secrets. But when the clock strikes this moment, we learn one of them. It's sweet. It's sad. It's revealing. And, I thought, very powerful because it changes everything we think we know about her up to this point. It also sets up perfectly the beautiful, but perhaps not ""happy"", ending that is soon to come.In the opening credits, the narrator explains that this is a ""boy meets girl"" story, but that it's not a ""love story"". Well, I don't know about that. I think this is a love story. And a good one. The script is genius. The direction is sharp but never heavy handed. The music plays through the action in perfect accompaniment with the story. There is nothing not to like about this gem. Everyone in the world has lived through this relationship at some point in their life. It's the one that makes you stronger, as it almost kills you. Yes, that one. Here's what it looks like as a movie. A good movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pandering to the Hipsters,"Straight out of the Juno school of filmmaking, here's another bitter- sweet, off-beat romantic comedy with a quirky, off-beat girl, an ironic sense of humor mixed with sweet romanticism, and tons of cultural references and name-dropping from Ringo Starr to Ingmar Bergman to Oscar Wilde, a sure way to appeal to young proto-intellectuals and hipsters.It works, to a certain degree, especially thanks to two very effective leads. Having had my own little celebrity-crush on Zooey Deschanel ever since her short but unforgettable performance in Almost Famous almost a decade ago, it was easy to relate to the character portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's growing up to be quite a decent actor by his own right, even if he still looks sixteen (I was hoping to see some stubble in the scene in which he's depressed and doesn't leave his bed for a week, but nada).500 Days of Summer has a lot going for it, and a lot of the right elements are in place, but it doesn't achieve real greatness, not even mild and humble greatness like that of solid, intelligent romantic comedies (Jerry Maguire, When Harry Met Sally, High Fidelity etc.) It's just not that memorable, and stylistic elements like the non-linear storytelling serve mainly the purpose of being cool and contemporary than any real one. And even though the actors are great and they do their best, they do it with characters that aren't very complex to begin with. It's an enjoyable movie, and a fantastic date-movie for a couple of young cynics, but it's not one that will stick with you for long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A unique film,This film was one of those that slowly became more and more popular upon release and is one that certainly deserves to be hunted out because it succeeds in being a warm and funny film that manages to add a different dimension to the rom-com genre.The simple plot eases the viewer in and the two leads are very likable. It's not the type of film you could watch in a passive manner due to the jumping around in terms of narrative but I like that this film again is trying to be different.There are some very nice moments throughout the films 91 minute run and the ending in particular is very well handled by first time feature film director Mark Webb.The film is a little slow in places and the supporting characters are not well fleshed out but it does not stop this film being worthy of the praise it gains!,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
(500) Thumbs Up for Days of Summer,"An opening disclaimer sets the tone for the rest of the movie: ironic and so true. The movie is fun, frustrating, simple, difficult, triumphant, and depressing, much like the nature of any loving relationship. (500) Days of Summer is a traditional love story told in a nontraditional fashion, combining and contrasting over-the-top fantasy with harsh reality. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, boy loves girl, girl doesn't love boy because her divorced parents destroyed the very idea of true love sending the boy into a downward spiral of sorrow and recklessness.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect that writes greeting cards for a living. Of course, he has an even greater aspiration to one day find true love, a curse and a blessing that was embedded in his innocent mind after watching ""The Graduate"" at a young and tender age. His life changes completely when a new Executive Assistant joins the office: Summer Finn (the beautiful Zooey Deschanel), and she's like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn. Who wouldn't fall in love with an Audrey Hepburn? A drunken office karaoke session and a long-awaited kiss later, Tom and Summer Finn are goofing off and holding hands at an IKEA. (Aww, Tom and Finn. How cute.) Their relationship is reminiscent of Joel and Clementine from ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind."" Like Eternal, their story is told nonlinearly. We ping-pong between different stages of their relationship, from Day (1) to Day (500), revealing both the beauty and the tragedy of Tom's pursuit to win Summer Finn.The difference is, Tom doesn't have a machine to erase any trace of Summer, but must instead live with the pain that scarred him so deeply. What Tom does have is a great support system: two close buddies who care for him sincerely but have no clue how to handle this unhealthy situation, and a kid sister who happens to say all the right things.Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are perfect in this movie. He is tossed around both emotionally and physically, from extreme highs to terrible lows, and if you don't cheer for him, then you have no heart. She just owns the screen, and everything about her makes it easy to see why a guy would spend (500) days pining for this woman.There are some amazing moments in this movie, beyond the content. Like Eternal's Michel Gondry, Director Marc Webb started his career making music videos (""All That I've Got"" by The Used and ""I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"" by MCR, amongst other countless greats). It's no wonder why his feature film debut is as artistic and as entertaining as it truly is. This is Day (1) of a film career that is no doubt going to be an enjoyable one to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Different Breed,"There are quite a few movies out there, that try to convince you that they are not your typical romantic movie/comedy, as this movie also states at the beginning. But in this case, you can really be sure that it is different. More related to the movie ""Swingers"", although quite a bit lighter, this really works great.Apart from the fact, that you have a twist right from the start of the movie (which you may know, either if you have watched the trailer or read other reviews, but I'm not gonna spoil that), this also has a very crazy story-/time-line going for it. Having really great leads helps too.

"Rashômon, the rom-com","In the first 2 minutes, the narrator warns us ""This is NOT a love story"". I knew this beforehand but still thought it would be a good date movie, so I asked a hot chick to watch it with me. Why am I telling you this? Mostly because I wanted to brag about finally working up the nerve to ask out a hot chick. But also to let you know that ""(500) Days of Summer"" isn't exactly a hot date movie.So much better, it's a very clever story about perception and particularly how emotions affect perception. In 1950 Kurosawa gave us the legendary film ""Rashômon"" which defined the technique by using multiple narrators to tell the story of a murder. A few years ago, the French film ""He Loves Me... He Loves Me Not"" took the same basic idea and applied it to a love story. Here we have yet another innovation. It's a lovestory highlighting different perspectives, but they're coming from the same person.How did the director accomplish this? By jumping around the timeline. ""(500) Days of Summer"" begins at Day #488, then back to Day #1, then forward, then back, etc. It can be slightly disorienting at times, but I believe that is the intent. By departing from the standard linear storytelling, the director accentuates the bipolar jumps in perception experienced by a guy who's alternately in & out of love.I don't know if this has been done before (several people have compared this film to ""Annie Hall"" which I haven't seen), but for me it was a thoroughly original experience.The acting is great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers yet another charming performance as the handsome nerd who's desperately trying to get a grip. Zooey Deschanel plays a challenging role: one minute lovable, the next minute not-so-lovable (in keeping with the theme of the film), and she truly delivers. You just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about.If you liked ""Rashômon"" or ""He Loves Me..."" you should definitely check this out & see what you think. I'd also compare it to another great offbeat romcom ""Adam"" and a really offbeat French romcom(?) called ""The Girl from Monaco"".""(500) Days of Summer"" has spots of comedy & a light-hearted presentation, although its primary focus is the drama & the underlying theme of ""reality vs. expectation"". Again, not the perfect date movie. Although we both liked it, I don't know if I'll get a 2nd date with the hot girl... quick can someone suggest a good Hugh Grant flick?",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Summer is okay...better than winter.,"I didn't know what to expect from this, but I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and it got some good reviews, so what the hell...Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best thing, but it does try and that's a good thing. JGL is very good in this, he makes a good leading man, but I struggled with Zooey Deschanel's character, she seemed just a little too kookie and perhaps the romantic in me wanted them to work out. The film looks good as well, Los Angeles has never looked better, in fact I thought it was perhaps Seattle. There are also some various techniques employed to make the film a little different: There is the drawing of the park with has the number counter, although the clacking noise used really grated my nerves. I liked the 'fantasy' sequences, the one where Tom dances his way to work was great. Also the scene where the picture changes to a drawing. Another technique used was a split screen to portray the real and fantasy events of when Tom sees Summer at a party after they have broken up. Potentially distracting, it worked well, but I did begin to think at that point that maybe the film makers were trying a little to hard to be 'indie'.The ending for me was a particular let down, it just seemed too contrived and convenient, the fact that the woman's name was Autumn made me cringe. But in all this is a good Sunday sofa DVD, which has a lot to enjoy, including some great music such as The Smiths.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A delight,"Prompted to investigate this seeming little film after reading a highly critical piece on another site, which was followed by a vigorous bout of those expressing support and opposition. Always a good sign in cinema! Well, I loved it. Clearly some found it pretentious but I delighted in the believable and funny dialogue and loved the non linear construct imposed by the 500 day counter which is always advising on what day we are in the developing relationship as we are taken back and forth in the most audacious manner. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are the leads who portray the central couple, be it in or out of love. Or are they just friends!? It is a simple enough tale but most convincing and references The Graduate and the films of Ingmar Bergman along the way. A delight.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Love, love, love it, Best Picture 2009","If the story is not a love story, than it is also not about the story, but more, the source of story, which is always, character. I would love to tell you that this film wasn't about a break-up — but it is. I would love to tell you that this is a magical love story (which it kinda is) where ""boy meets girl (which happens), boy falls in love with girl (which definitely happens), and they both live happily ever after (which actually also happens, sorta)"" but like real life — it's a bit more complicated than that.This is one of those films where you simply fall in love with the characters both because of the performances and the writing, and in the case of Levitt and Deschanel, their odd, sexy total package.

A unique and experimental film. One of the year's finest!,"500 Days of Summer experiments with the pain and the happiness that romances bring. It deals with the expectations of a hard-in-love young man, and how his whole reasoning behind his feelings is about to be tested with who he believes is his soul-mate. Her name is Summer, and she is beautiful, charming, and honest. She does not believe in finding love for the first time, and does not see love in the point of view Toms sees it in. That is why when both Tom and Summer start being closer with each other, Tom is confused about what kind of relationship they are in. It turns out, Summer leads him down a path that will inevitably make him learn about how real life works. He believed that Summer was his one true love, and is even abstruck when it turns out Summer is the one that found someone she can call her 'soul-mate'. This reinforces his ideas that love is unexpected, and like the final scene says, there are just 'coincidences' that lead to it.The film is directed by first-time film director Mark Webb, and he did a fantastic job. Thanks to the great screenplay, music, and editing he creates a sort of fairy-tale tone to it, but as the film goes along, we realize that that is not the case. There are many inventive scenes in the film, most notably a dance and music sequence, and a split-screen scene where Tom's expectations are met with the reality of the scene, and they are quite simply brilliant. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic as Tom, and Zooey Deschanel really nails her character. Deschanel embraces all of the reasons why Tom falls in love with her, making the audience as awestruck by her as he is.Overall, this is quite simply the opposite of most romantic comedies these days, and for that I am very pleased. The film deserves high praise and honors!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sweet Disposition,"500 days of summer blew my expectations. ""This is not a love story"", expressed prominently by the narrator in the opening scene. This single sentence pique my interest early in the movie as that was my initial expectation: a love story. This movie is lovable, its enjoyable, it makes you feel good (not everybody), everything that makes it fun.I'm usually never impressed my rock or indie soundtracks played in movies as unless I'm a fan of that genre of musician I'll never really get into it in one listening. However, the use of music in this movie is phenomenal, it plays with the tone, mood and general emotion. It guides the audience and moves them along the pacing of the movie. Really good work. Acting is fantastic, I loved both Zooey and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this film. Nothing much to add here, they both acted really well and it helped the immersion.This movie is fun, that's what I love about it. Sometimes we watch film to loosen up and this movie is for that, it helps us think about things other than our lives for a second and that really helps. It's also helps that the film portrays things that have meaning rather than superficial jokes and gags without substance. It dwells on our life, we can relate with the humour because we understand his predicament. It plays on our habits and our expectations. That's why I love this film. Go watch it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Cleverly composed writing; execution a bit shaky,"A self absorbed greeting card writer thinks he's found ""The One,"" a newly hired co-worker. She's a non-committal type, who ""doesn't believe in love,"" yet paradoxically flirts with him aggressively. More than flirts, sparking a weird and rocky relationship. Artistically, this lays a great foundation for an amusing, offbeat tale. Not quite a romance story (even though a relationship is at the center of the story), but more a character study with optimistic and pessimistic beliefs colliding.Zooey Deschanel's portrayal of the flighty Summer is spot on. Her eye expressions and carefree delivery of lines convey the once-hurt-twice-apathetic attitude remarkably well. She commands the screen every time she is there, and her complex character's insulated insecurity seeps out in perfect measure for the audience to understand. She's blurry on what she wants from life, but she's brutally honest. She appears oblivious to her inadvertently hurtful behavior.The guy playing Tom weakens the film. He ineptly attempts a dull ripoff of an early Dustin Hoffman role. He has the knotted, sweaty hair, all right, but not the acting talent. His bombastic approach makes the character inaccessible, unsympathetic, and irritating. No convincing chemistry with the female lead, or anybody else in the cast, for that matter. Tom's a Loser (with a capital L for emphasis), and goes obsessive emo-psycho. For the sake of both the movie and the audience, I wished somebody would smash those dishes over his head. No such luck: instead, we get the tiresome cliché of a precocious wise-cracking 12 year old giving advice. At least she's a good actress, something that cannot be said for Tom's two annoying side kick buddies. They reminded me of two talking Beevis and Butthead dolls that need their batteries replaced. Or their brains replaced.Characters are always in theaters, one of many metaphors launched like a missile attack. Some of the metaphors work, but this overindulgence lacks purpose or comedic finesse. It seems the whole thing is attempting an amalgamation of stuff ""borrowed"" from the movie industry in general. ""Self analysis"" dialog (a la Woody Allen) is humorous but overused. The director has a music video background, and it shows with the intrusive soundtrack. Also, expect music video staples such as overly expressive acting, sultry close-ups, black-and-white imagery, and split screen vignettes.The non-linear construction of the story telling is a narrative style obviously beyond this director's capacity. Instead of using dialog to establish the time line, he amateurishly resorts to ""day number"" captions. The setting of a greeting card company offered a treasure trove of one-liners, plus a great battlefield for the story's whole dynamic. Some of this potential is utilized, some squandered. The film settles for a predictable outcome, with no surprise whatsoever.In summary: thoughtful idea, cleverly written, but with some flaws in execution. It's entertaining enough to warrant a viewing, and has a thought provoking message to consider.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Enjoyable comedy,"I think I enjoyed this movie for the wrong reasons, mainly the fact that I was able to relate heavily with the main character's personality and situation a little too well.The comedy in this movie was good, didn't have me burst out in tears but definitely made me chuckle a lot.I know the main character is supposed to be an terrible person but at the same time, the circumstances/ his background set him up to be that way and that's a super common occurrence in real life and I think his actions were okay because he didn't know any better. Same with Summer, her background made her the character she was.Also neat little thing they did in the end with Summer leaving and Autumn coming. Shows that even the hopeless romantic with a sort of twisted sense of love can be given a second chance and that made me feel good about myself. I have a lot of regrets.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Another fake deep movie,"This movie tries to be deep but it ends up becoming the most pretentious romance movie I have ever seen. The message itself was actually not bad but the way it was handled was so banal it almost made me want to throw up midway through.The plot itself is very messy and the narrative jumps are annoying as well as pointless. It would have functioned better as a linear story but that's not even the worst part of the film. The worst part is the fact that the film has no sense of direction in the sense that it does not know what it wants to be. It somehow hits all the clichés of a romance and yet it tries to be a deep movie which is where the problem is. If it stuck to being a romance then it would be tolerable but I think the issue is that it is a romance but it pretends to not be one which is not something that can be done, especially since it hits all the characteristics of a romance.The humour falls very flat and there's pretty much no aspect of this which I found funny. At best this is a sort of failed mish mash of ideas wrapped up in pretentiousness in the hopes that the message of the film will distract the audience from how bland and banal the movie is and to be fair, it did work for the vast majority of the people.It's actually a shame about the execution because the premise of the film is good. When watching a movie, there's a shared idea that we'd suspend disbelief in return for a good story and or engaging characters etc, this movie took those expectations and stamped on them. It failed horrendously in terms of pacing, it felt both too slow and too quick and it failed in making the philosophy and ideas clear.Overall it was a pretty boring movie which is simply pretentious.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Refreshing and Realistic Spin on Romantic Comedies,"""500 Days of Summer,"" directed by Marc Webb, is a distinctive and engaging romantic comedy that stands out for its unconventional storytelling and realistic portrayal of relationships. The film explores the complexities of love and heartbreak through the non-linear narrative of the relationship between Tom Hansen, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Summer Finn, portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.Gordon-Levitt delivers a relatable and heartfelt performance as Tom, an idealistic young man who falls deeply in love with Summer. His portrayal of Tom's journey through the various stages of his relationship is both honest and poignant. Deschanel's Summer is charming and enigmatic, effectively capturing the spirit of a character who challenges the conventional expectations of romantic leads.The chemistry between Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel is one of the film's strengths, providing a believable and compelling foundation for the story. Their interactions range from the whimsically romantic to the painfully realistic, encapsulating the highs and lows of modern relationships.One of the most notable aspects of ""500 Days of Summer"" is its innovative structure. The film's non-linear approach, jumping back and forth across the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship, adds depth and perspective to the narrative. This storytelling technique allows the audience to see how memories and emotions can color one's perception of a relationship.The screenplay, written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is witty, intelligent, and often emotionally resonant. The film avoids the clichés typical of the genre, opting instead for a more realistic and sometimes bittersweet exploration of love and compatibility.Visually, the film is stylish and creative, utilizing a variety of cinematic techniques to reflect the emotional states of the characters. The use of color, imaginative sequences, and a playful soundtrack adds to the film's unique charm.However, ""500 Days of Summer"" does have its shortcomings. Some viewers might find the non-traditional narrative confusing or the characters' motivations unclear at times. Additionally, the film occasionally struggles to balance its more whimsical elements with its attempt to provide a more grounded take on relationships.In conclusion, ""500 Days of Summer"" is a refreshing take on the romantic comedy genre, offering a realistic and thoughtful examination of love and heartbreak. Its creative storytelling, strong performances, and unique style make it an enjoyable and memorable film. While it might not resonate with everyone and has some minor flaws, it deserves a solid 7 out of 10 for its originality and emotional depth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It was an Inception of Dating films,"There is a reason why I gave this film a 7/10 which is pretty high rating and the reason is, because it reflects the reality of dating world way too well, but problem is, the film is kind of a self fulfilling prophecy, as it is likely that films like this one have crafted the psyche of modern women... There could be a million reasons why Summer decided the relationship wasn't working, but the reality was she was toying with the guy all the way through... She initiated the kiss. Summer insisted that they are just friends and that she does not want to have a girlfriend title... There were moments when Tom thought he was going crazy because he thought it was wrong she is not officially his girlfriend, but she said generic stuff like ""this is life"" let it be as is, aren't you happy? Essentially she manipulated him and he followed along... The most important moment might be when they were sitting at the bar and there was a dude trying to pick her up, every normal guy would say Tom did the right thing hitting him in the face, while Summer acted as if she wanted to have that option of giving her contact to another random dude right in front of him ...

Few of us can identify with Romeo and Juliet, or Don Juan, but I believe that most of us have at least once experienced something similar to this, and this makes this film much stronger and more lifelike than most love stories.

Here Comes Your Man...,"Recently I commented on the woefully mediocre 'I Love You, Man' and argued its case as a romantic comedy for men. The infinitely superior (500) Days Of Summer could be pitched in a very similar way as it attempts to exchange typical gender character traits. The always excellent Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom, a sensitive singleton drifting in dead end job (he writes hokey greeting cards!) waiting for something to happen, waiting to fall in love with 'the one'. Enter Zooey Deschanel as the beautiful yet distant Summer who firmly upholds the belief that love is a myth and is considerably better off without the emotional baggage a relationship brings. One is smitten, the other interested yet coolly detached.Whilst Zooey's performance is inarguably great (good enough to forget about 'The Happening' thank god), the film is centred on Tom and Gordon-Levitt is instantly likable and effortlessly carries the picture; a good job as there is barely a scene with out him. Whilst he is 'the sensitive type', he's not effete or sappy but instead familiar and convincing - your firmly on his side.What transpires is a unique, realistic and entertainingly insightful movie with a great (if a little over-used) soundtrack.

Too bad, really, because Tom's Act IV epiphany confronts the idea of sacharrine sentiment and contrived expressions as substitutes for real human emotion.I appreciated that Tom's tween sister was an old soul, but many of her scenes were too hip, too snarky. I wish someone would write a memo explaining that it's not necessarily comic when seniors and juniors use profanity. Copy it to every filmmaker on the planet.Favorite scenes included the wacky IKEA store, the karaoke bar, with quirky moments throughout most of the film. The stylization using graphics and flashbacks was interesting. I relished the huge dance production number complete with marching band and old-style animation.I understand that ""500 Days of Summer"" was trying to capture some of the whimsy associated with the romantic comedies of the 60's, but the narrator's voice-overs were annoying.The film is good enough, but frankly, I was hoping for more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 Days Of Summer,"500 Days Of Summer is a new comedy drama that examines and probes deep into your normal average romantic films and gives us it's own look at relationships and why they do sometimes work and why sometimes they don't. Just briefly it is about a young man named Tom, who falls for his new co-worker Summer and while they begin to bond and become good friends, he wants a much more committed relationship, whereas she wants it to be casual and sometimes seems to be giving Tom the brush off, so to speak. With the help of his friends and little sister, Tom tries to put all the pieces together to win Summer over, but along the way he does discover a lot more about himself, her and how tricky relationships can be. 500 Days Of Summer is not your typical film about love and I am hoping that that fact will not put too many viewers off. If you were hoping to see a predictably happy and schmaltzy head over heels in love film, then you should probably check for a different film to see, or if you are a little more experimental than give this one a try. By the end of the film it reminded me a lot of some of my favourite Woody Allen relationship comedy dramas of the 70's like Annie Hall and Manhattan. They both offer up some of the most witty, human and realistic looks at love and relationships I have ever seen and both sets of films do so in a quirky and sometimes offbeat kind of way and also blends comedy into the mix to make things interesting. Even the character personalities of Tom and Summer reminded me of a lot of the male and female leads in those Woody Allen pictures as well. A lot of the times because of how real and believable they seemed and because they were actually smart and well spoken characters who knew what they were talking about and what they wanted. They can get a bit high strung and over analyze things at times, but I also enjoyed that perspective of the film as well because honestly speaking, which of us does not do that at all in any sort of a difficult situation? I also really liked Tom and Summer because while watching the film I felt like I got to know them better and it were like watching everyday average people and even with their quirks and sometimes stubbornness that at times drove them throughout the film, I still really liked these characters, flaws and all. Not to mention that Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel who play these characters do a fantastic job. I also must mention the low key yet interesting direction of the film's director and the brilliant dialogue and look at human nature and relationships that felt like the most honest film about said subject I have seen in awhile. All this may sound like a heavier and more depressing film, but it is anything but. At times it was very cheerful and always left the door for the characters open to new possibilities and outcomes. Some of the humour in the film works quite well also, so it is not a depressing experience at all. I think if anything the film will offer couples who go to see it a lot to talk about. Not necessarily concerning ruining their relationships, but perhaps in some ways to make it better and discuss things about it that they normally might not have. For it's depth, insight and charm 500 Days Of Summer is a definite winner and one of the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A disappointing romance,"""(500) Day
""(500) Days of Summer"" is a film that promises to tell an unconventional love story, exploring a man's perspective on the end of a relationship. However, the end result is a disappointment, with shallow characters and an unengaging narrative.One of the biggest flaws of the movie is the lack of character development. Tom, is introduced as a hopeless romantic, while Summer, is depicted as an independent woman who doesn't believe in love. However, these initial traits seem to be the only ones the writers managed to develop.The dialogues between Tom and Summer are superficial and add nothing to the story. There is no chemistry between the characters, which makes it difficult for the audience to empathize with their relationship. Furthermore, the lack of development of the female characters beyond being Tom's love interest is disappointing and displays a limited view of women.The non-linear narrative also hampers the film. The story jumps between different moments of Tom and Summer's relationship, but this technique doesn't add depth or insight to the story. On the contrary, the lack of continuity makes it hard for the viewer to emotionally connect with the characters and understand the motivations behind their actions.Another problematic aspect of the movie is how it portrays Tom's obsession with Summer. Throughout the film, we see Tom chasing after Summer and idealizing their relationship. This obsession is depicted as romantic, which is disturbing and problematic. The film doesn't seem to acknowledge Tom's behavior as inappropriate, which is a significant flaw.The soundtrack, although acclaimed by critics, also fails to compensate for the film's shortcomings. While the songs fit well with the scenes, they don't manage to elevate the weak narrative and uninteresting characters. It's a wasted use of a talented soundtrack.Overall, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a disappointment. With shallow characters and an unengaging narrative, the film fails to deliver on the promise of exploring an unconventional relationship. Despite a few positives, like the soundtrack, these aspects are not enough to compensate for the fundamental flaws of the movie. There are much better romances out there to spend time watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
It's a beautiful and immensely satisfying film,"In (500) Days of Summer, music video director Marc Webb transitions into the feature world by telling the story of Tom, a man who firmly believes that true love and happiness are mutually inclusive, and Summer, the woman Tom falls hopelessly in love with but who does not believe in the idea of love herself. The two set out on a tentative relationship, undefined on her insistence, and the story follows the 500 days from when they first meet each other.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Tom with a fantastic blend of awkward shyness and modest charm. His earnest pursuit of Summer, played effervescently by Zooey Deschanel, unfolds with equal amounts of hilarious courtship missteps and gracious charm. For this story to work, the audience has to fully believe in Tom and his budding relationship with Summer, and Gordon-Levitt makes that all possible. His performance here is stellar, crafting a character that the audience not only wants to root for, but in which they can see a bit of themselves as well. He idealizes without being impractical, and broods but not to annoyance. Hopeless romantics typically can come off as desperate or extreme, but Gordon-Levitt plays him with more than enough charisma to win us over.Deschanel is excellent too. She's played a lot of the same roles over the past couple of years, that of the too-commonly seen manic pixie dream girl, and frankly it's an element that is definitely present here as well. However, there's also a grounded-ness to the character, an honesty to how she was written and the way Deschanel plays her that makes Summer so much more successful than the Happy of Gigantic. Sure, she's alluring and enigmatic, but she's also selfish and temperamental, even occasionally cruel. On the spectrum of MPDG's, she's more akin to Kate Winslet's Clementine from Eternal Sunshine than Natalie Portman's Sam from Garden State; in other words, she works here both as that tantalizing creature who ""exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive writer-directors to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures,"" as Nathan Rabin coined it, and also as a rounded woman who we recognize and can relate to from our own lives.That edge of ""realness"" to the characters is something that is most refreshing about (5oo) Days of Summer. Full disclosure: this movie is full of whimsical and fantastical moments, and has more than a fair share of cheeky, 4th-wall-breaking winks at the audience. However, not only is all of that executed with a finesse and restraint that would put Ferris Bueller to shame, there's a surprising candor to the story. Despite an at-times wacky cast (Chloe Moretz, however, deserves special mention in playing Tom's precocious kid-sister Rachel with a level- headedness that always eluded Dakota Fanning), the lead characters feel whole and fleshed-out. The relationship between Tom and Summer is treated respectfully and sugar-free, taking on its often messy turns with a sincerity and eloquence that doesn't ever feel forced or overly contrived.That relationship is also what obviously drives the movie, and it is carried by the chemistry between the two leads. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel play off each other so well here. There's one particular scene in the copy room at the company where Tom and Summer work that just comes together completely naturally and hilariously. The audience goes through the stages of their relationship and buys in to their ups and downs because it never feels like two Hollywood actors reading lines off a page, but rather two people actually sharing an experience.Marc Webb does an amazing job here, weaving together so many elements that could easily be jarring or alienating and instead turns it all into a brilliant mosaic of love in life. He's knocked his feature directorial debut out of the park, and even the few flaws are easily overlooked for the deft touch he brings to a playful and touching tale. His background in music is clearly evident here, as he's populated the film with a soundtrack that is an eclectic mix of classic tunes and catchy indie melodies sure to get the hipster crowd all atwitter. It's probably only the second film this year after Star Trek that was so enjoyable I wanted to watch it again right away. But while Star Trek was an amazing and pulse-pounding thrill ride, (500) Days is more the insightful and memorable road trip, packed full of laughs and good-feeling.(500) Days of Summer tells us from the start: ""This is not a love story."" In that statement, the wry and observant narrator is not entirely correct. (500) Days of Summer is a lot of things - it's both funny and moving, as refreshing as it is honest, and thoughtful in one wave and provocative in another. It's a unique mix of whimsy and real, a genuine portrait of a relationship embellished with the colors and soundtrack that only emotions can evoke in our lives. It's a beautiful and immensely satisfying film, and so I endeavor to amend the above misguided statement to just an understatement: ""This is not just a love story.""Roy from http://www.cinemaverytasty.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Overview,"(500) Days of Summer, a 2009 romantic comedy-drama, offers a refreshing and unconventional take on love and relationships. The film cleverly deconstructs the traditional romantic comedy formula, presenting a realistic and often bittersweet portrayal of a relationship that doesn't necessarily follow the expected Hollywood trajectory.The story revolves around Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a hopeless romantic who falls head over heels for the enigmatic Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). Summer, however, is a free spirit who doesn't believe in love and prefers casual encounters. Despite their contrasting views on relationships, Tom becomes infatuated with Summer, projecting his idealized notions of love onto her.The film's non-linear narrative structure, jumping back and forth in time, allows for a more nuanced exploration of Tom's emotional journey. We witness his initial infatuation, the highs and lows of their relationship, and the painful process of heartbreak and eventual acceptance. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the complexities of love, highlighting the irrationality of emotions and the difficulty of reconciling expectations with reality.One of the film's strengths lies in its honest portrayal of heartbreak. Tom's descent into despair is both relatable and poignant, reminding us that even the most seemingly perfect relationships can come to an end. The film doesn't offer easy answers or a neatly tied-up conclusion, instead encouraging viewers to embrace the complexities of love and the importance of self-growth.The performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are both captivating and nuanced. Gordon-Levitt effectively conveys Tom's vulnerability and emotional turmoil, while Deschanel portrays Summer as a complex and enigmatic figure who remains somewhat elusive throughout the film.(500) Days of Summer is a visually appealing film, with a distinct aesthetic that complements its unique tone. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of indie and classic rock songs, perfectly captures the film's melancholic yet hopeful spirit.While some may find the film's deconstruction of romantic conventions to be somewhat cynical, it ultimately offers a refreshing perspective on love and relationships. (500) Days of Summer is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that will resonate with anyone who has ever experienced the joys and pains of love.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Propofol,"I was ready to sleep after 10 minutes of this dreck. The characterization of the ""men"" in this film were far from developed and as for the story - fine, a little twist in the romance comedy theme is welcome but this film offered a sleepy boring rendition of ""it's not you, it's me"" and the narrative voice-overs; increases the IV drip now!! I will say that visually it's well done film making. Nice camera views and angles with maybe an overdone design sensitivity. The non linear sequence of time tries to keep you from dozing i.e. you need to pay some attention to the juxtaposition of scenes. My wife left the room before I did so maybe it's an appealing storyline to a 20 something something... avoid unless you need a good night's sleep.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 Days of Summer Movie Review,"I got to see this film for free, in an advance screening and the Denver premiere (because of my membership in the LTFC and DFC). It was a full theater, and I almost didn't make it in, because only the first 120 people got in. To top off a full theater, the air conditioning was broken, so my sunburned back worked up quite a sweat, but that's already more than you need to know.The tag line says, ""This is not a love story, this is a story about love"", which couldn't be truer. For all of the lame romantic comedies (rom-coms) that believe they have something fresh to offer, I have yet to see one that does, until now. This is for a number of reasons, but most obviously, this is about the man, not the woman. And this is an ordinary guy, not some Hollywood hunk. They're also all very formulaic, and from the very opening scene of the film, in which we learn that our two leads are in a sticky situation, we know that this isn't the case. ""Summer"" offers everything with a fresh and very indie plate, but one that tastes good as well.The story follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) who is a greeting card writer, and a talented one at that. One day his boss gets a new assistant, Summer (Zooey Deschanel) who is sort of the typical indie girl (the only generic part of this film). We learn about their relationship in a mixed fashion, we scan through the titular 500 days in a jumbled order, started with 250- something and moving to 1, then going back to 260-something. For the first 30-odd days Tom is too nervous to talk to her, other than small talk in elevators and such, but his crush on her is ever-present to the audience. Finally they meet, and when they do it's movie magic, despite that we already know that something major goes wrong. Now that description does no justice to the brilliance of the story. I can't describe it without revealing much, but it's a carefully woven story pattern that is top-notch, and just as important, feels more realistic than any other rom-com I've ever seen. I could relate to Tom so much on his struggles with his woman, and that coming from a kid it extraordinary. I imagine it will click even better to the lonely 20-something men out there, who I'll join before I know it. Mind you, realistic is different than plausible, but that's a topic for a different post.Did I mention that this film is hilarious? Not rom-com funny, laugh out loud hilarious. And that's another element that's missing from these romance flicks. Realistic problems and confrontations are much funnier than the silly slapstick ones in the long haul.Marc Webb's direction feels like a good indie music video, and that makes sense seeing that's all he's done before this. He alludes to his background with a very funny dance number that puts most movie musicals to shame. The editing is also fantastic, and some of the best I've seen on this type of work (comparing it to Thelma and Bourne isn't fair). And the actors are fantastic, and let's pray for some Golden Globe nominations for Zooey and Joe. But of all the elements, the screenplay deserves the most praise. Creating a realistic, funny, romantic, enjoyable, feel-good, and out of order story is incredibly hard to do. I will remember this film on my roster in the Best Original Screenplay category, even if it gets out shined everywhere else.Overall, it's a fantastic, funny, and memorable film, and it puts all other romantic comedies, indie romances, and feel good-flicks to shame. Don't let the mediocre trailer deceive you – this film is a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not your average romantic comedy,"(500) Days of Summer is not your average romantic comedy. In fact, I don't think it belongs in the same category as a romantic comedy - it has a completely different feel to it.

I liked this movie and I would recommend it to others.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good but painful perspective on love life,"Situationship before it was even a thing. I've only become acquainted with this concept a couple of years ago. I guess before that it was just people not being serious about somebody. Whatever.I know I saw this movie many years ago and I wanted to see it again because people are saying it's about something else entirely than I remember so I thought I'd see it with fresh, certainly more mature eyes. And yes, it's an entirely different perspective now. Summer makes things clear from the very beginning. It is Tom who is making it a lot more than it is. He is doing a lot of projecting. And spewing hate when reality contradicts his wishes. He and his friends are also kind of sexist.As for Summer, she is a beautiful girl who has a sixties kind of style and vibe so of course she would appeal to most male fantasies out there. The only thing that bothered me was that she wasn't really that honest, not even with herself. After living and promoting a casual approach to dating she ups and gets married just like that. That makes no emotional sense to me. But I have heard of people like that. People leaving solid relationships and getting married to a complete stranger in a few months' time for instance. It happens. They are out there and they're not that rare. I guess Summer is not really the focus of the movie here. It's about Tom's growth. And Summer is more of a object onto which he does a lot pf projecting. Summer is her own person and we get glimpses of her, but not much. As a woman I didn't get that much about her. The movie is constructed that way. In most of the scenes she is as seen by Tom.So I guess I remember loving it at the time. I didn't love it now really so I downgraded it a little. Not really the movie's fault, it was a little depressing and unpleasant. Much like life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A romantic comedy that even a schizoid could enjoy.,"I'm glad to see Joseph and Zooee reunited after their gripping performances in Manic(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252684/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ).I sense that if I were clued into the extended emotional spectrum better than I'd give this film a higher rating though I can only review on my own personal basis.The great thing about film is that emotional scenarios even if complex can often be broken down to fragments and analysed on the fly by even those like me. In the closed system of films such as this I see it as an experience of the scenes in front of me and in this films case it doesn't raise any questions outside them.The film travels in a series of short truncated movements and gives full drama and irreverent comedy value without including dull bits, like Alfred Hitchcock said ""Drama is life with the dull parts left out."" So unlike A boring TV soap that makes 6 months of redundant script out of a single conversations worth of content you don't have to be anxious that the filler is coming down upon you.If you're a guy that's not a fan of ""chick flick"" romantic comedies and liked 10 Things I hate About You than I definitely recommend this film as an exception to the rule.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Young romance at its best,"Bittersweet story about young romance. Young people can fall head over heel for a perfect stranger. Probably it is the hormones and lack of experience coupled with expectations too high. Of course, falling for someone does not guarantee your love will be reciprocated. This is what happens to Tom, a romantic boy, slightly disconnected from reality, who thinks he met the ""one"" only to find out she was not. The ""wrong"" girl is Summer who - allegedly - does not believe in love, but in practice might be just looking for Mr Right.The story is told in non-linear fashion, which for once enhances the quirky narrative. However, we can easily reconstruct the story, from the day they met - Tom filled with romantic and naive expectations, Summer disconnected from her feelings. When Tom and Summer get together, she feels ""happy"" and finds him ""funny"", but he is convinced she is Ms Right (no explanation is given about the reason of Tom's obsession that Summer is the ""one"").Things fall apart quite abruptly, when Summer gets in a bad mood and dumps Tom after having watched ""The Graduate"" together. Summer seems a selfish, immature girl who has no clue about what she wants. She lies to herself and to others. Rather than intentionally evil, she just seems frivolous and uncaring, pursuing her own happiness and disregarding whoever does not satisfy criteria she cannot even define.Tom seems to be a naive victim of literature and music about romantic love. The concept of the ""one"" seems to be a torture device for American audiences, who need to be constantly reassured that such a person actually exists. Unfortunate, romantic concepts are purely fictional. Long-lasting relationships are based on more solid ground than physical attraction and common interests (""We both like Magritte and Hopper"" gushes Tom enthusiastically, as if this is further proof that Summer is his twin soul).This comedy deals with emotional matters so important for the young in the most charming way and the script, editing and soundtrack are absolutely brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

After The Boys of Summer Have Gone,"The only thing that carries this film is the sweet-natured hope of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character that he will find his love returned by Summer, aka (in his romantic mind) THE ONE. Without this universal desire for love, the filmmaker has no hooks in the audience to sit there for the manipulation that ensues. For a bit I thought this rom-com was going to buck the trend and end up worthwhile. No, it fell apart completely the more you thought about it. Summer was ""honest"" with Tom about her unwillingness to commit, but then she just proceeded to toy with him right up to the final scene in the park. Why was she even there (married and pregnant)? ""I've always loved this place since you showed it to me."" Then the bitch rubs his nose in how she came to know he wasn't ""the one"". Oh, and be sure to clasp Tom's hand one more time with wedding ring glistening you demonic little twit.Disaster all around, but not the type you wind up wishing for.

Redefining the genre,"Love. One of most confusing words in the English language. A person can love another person, a sandwich, a car, a feeling, and a host of other things, people, and places. Love. Just four letters that mean so much.In Marc Webb's directorial debut (500) Days of Summer, we find out exactly what love is. A while ago I saw the trailer for this film and it came with a warning: ""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" This could not have been a truer statement.Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Tom Hansen. He is currently employed at a greeting cards company in Los Angeles but dreams of making it as an architect, someday. His life is rather ordinary until he meets his boss' new secretary, Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. After their first encounter, Summer is the only thing that Tom can think of. He knows that this is the girl, this is ""the one"". Tom believes that love is out there waiting for him. Summer on the other hand feels the opposite, that true love belongs in songs and fairy tales. What happens when these two ideals collide?The resulting relationship the two embark on is unlike any other put on celluloid. It's a beautiful, tragic, comic, musical, whimsical tale of love, heartache, and life lessons. Each era of film has ""the couple"" that reflect the ideals and mannerisms of the time. There was Roman Holiday, The Graduate, When Harry Met Sally, Singles, and up until now, Garden State. Here comes the next generation of lovers. This film shows the intimate details of a modern day romance from dating to the bedroom.There is so much I want to say but can't because it would spoil not just the story but the fun. Webb employs some unique storytelling techniques. Each scene offers something new both stylistically as well as changing the direction of the film ever so slightly. Along the way we bounce back and forth in Tom and Summer's relationship showing the highs and lows and everything in between.Webb's unique style appears to be influenced by several other directors. There are a few homages to other films and movements, something I enjoyed immensely. I sensed that Goddard, Fellini, Minnelli, and a few others were inspiration for certain scenes.One thing Webb does right is use his actors correctly. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are magical on screen together. They make each scene worth while with their delivery and on screen presence. No lines are wasted, no looks go unnoticed. They nail the mood and purpose of the film.I cannot stress enough how amazing and important the soundtrack is in this film. Like The Graduate or Garden State, we have a great selection of songs, each serving both an entertainment and story telling purpose. Songs from artists like The Smiths, Regina Spektor, The Temper Trap, and Hall & Oates give the film a way to communicate with the audience on more than one level.I can't stress enough how amazing (500) Days of Summer really is. It's a new twist on a tired genre of indie romance films. It has everything you could possibly want from a film. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. It's a remarkable achievement, especially for such a small production. Bravo Mr. Webb. I greatly anticipate your next film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Romance told from the guy's point of view. And done fantastically.,"I'll be the first to admit that I don't like Romance films; I find them to be a bit too fantastical, but in the wrong way, and extremely predictable. When I mean the wrong type of fantastical, I mean that it is an unrealistic play-through of how real life events could, in reality, occur, though only through astronomical coincidence. For example, bumping into the girl you love after you've broken up in the place you used to feed the ducks, and then doing some extreme romantic gesture, like dancing on a rooftop, to win her back etc. That doesn't click with me, because these romantic films are set in our world, our reality. The rules are established from the principal contact - this will not feature any space-monkeys, will be entirely within our realm of physics and as a result, I can't take such implausible coincidences.We enjoy films like the Inception, The Lord of the Rings, because they take place in a world where the rules are established to beyond our capacity to understand in reality. And in that fantasy, anything can happen and suspension of disbelief does the rest. But in our world, things like that don't happen - we've all been in relationships so we know for a fact, film romance is not ever applicable, and as a result, we don't learn anything, we don't grow by travelling these characters, we're just killing time. Although you might call me stupid, saying films would be boring if they only remained within our mundane reality, I say this when taking into account the tired cliché love formula, that pretty much stays the same no matter what route you take or what spin you put on it. We know that everything will be all right in the end and the characters will kiss on a bridge with candlelight and the beautiful lit sky. Not in this film.The film in question takes the tired formula and breaks it over its knee with some of the most inventive story-telling and camera work I've ever seen - and this is technically an independent film. The acting is superb throughout - the two leads Joseph Gorden-Levitt and Zoe Deshcanel are spectacular and their chemistry is contagious. These are not actors - these are real people. We love these people and we want to see their relationship develop.Another rare thing for a Rom-com - it's funny. I can sit through the majority of crap with Hugh Grant and maybe chuckle a few times, this gets you laughing from the get go and then becomes serious at the appropriate moments. This is another film that I call a 'moment picture'. A film that contains these small sections in little moments that are either a stroke of genius, a powerful emotional impact, or something that just makes you euphoric watching, regardless of overall quality. These moments are memorable, and they are the parts you talk about after you've seen it. You can watch any number of films that contain no moments at all or maybe one or two - this is full of them. Combined with excellent pacing and consistent engaging content it makes this film, to me, flawless. The only reason I don't give it a 10, is because although perfect, It's not quite up there with the other films I've rated 10, but that is by no means a detriment to this film.In short, watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Even in Tight Relationships, We All See Things Differently","The proverb says ""perception is reality,"" but if that's the case we're all living in a world of our own. By way of a repeatedly time-hopping narrative, this film addresses the competing perspectives present in every long-term relationship, and how something as innocuous as a smile can be interpreted completely differently by the two people sharing it. With a ton of post-production tricks and stunts in editing, it runs the risk of being over-conceptual and spoiled, but by keeping a steady focus on that one central point that all winds up complimenting the message nicely. Zooey Deschanel plays her typical hip, quirky character (if you're not already a fan of her act, she won't convince you here) and her pairing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt feels fun and natural while it lasts. Both characters are thoroughly rounded, with neither taking all the blame for their relationship's trials and tribulations - a rarity for directorial confessionals - and they're accompanied along the way by a dynamite soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 Days of Summer: I counted them just to stay awake,"In trying to determine how I will write this review, I decided to start off with honesty. Honesty was a big problem with this movie. One person thought honesty opened a direct line to an excuse for escape, while another relied on honesty to cement the relationship that this movie was about. And it was that cement that took this relationship to the bottom. For me, honesty means I am stuck with telling the truth about my feelings for this movie. I am terribly disappointed. In one word, B-O-R-I-N-G.I can never say anything bad about Zooey Deschanel but I hated her character, Summer Finn. At first sight she was cute but one moment later, there was a sense of danger for this charming beauty. She obviously stood out as standoffish at that point but later weakened and became deliciously accessible. It was a cycle that repeated more than a couple times in the movie. I have seen this kind of flipping before and nothing good ever came of it.I have so little to say about Tom because, well, he was indeed the whipping post he was made out to be.While there are so many positive comments about this movie, I have to admit I do not see it. To me this movie was a clinical observation on the process of love - nothing inspirational. Whatever hope you may have for either of the main characters, it is quickly made obvious that only one character deserves the benefits of hope...the whipping post. This movie did more to separate one of the hope for, need and meaning of love than to encourage the feelings of love.If you want to see a reality tainted yet soul-immersing movie that draws someone into the world where love is something that hurts and heals, see About Last Night. It's an oldie but it is what I hoped this movie would be similar to.I give this a 4 out of 10 and all points go to Zooey.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Top of the Line Coming of Age Film - 500 Days of Summer,"This is a very good film. The acting is superb, especially from Joseph Gordon Levit and Zooey Deschanel. The direction is very tight, and the script is the reason the film is rated an 8. It made me laugh out loud eight times. I have a rule of giving a star for each laugh, as long as the writing and acting are up to snuff. There are two hilarious sequences in the film. I loved the serious art house satires of Bergman films and the idolatry of The Graduate. I also like the sequence where several of the physical aspects of Summer that he liked, now annoy him to no end. That is so true in real life. What Joe needed to learn is that women are like buses; there'll be another one in fifteen minutes. Maybe not THE ONE, but at least a decent replacement chair for your broken lazyboy. This film is classified as a non- love story (or love story), but I see it more as a top of the line coming of age film. See it and enjoy, and better to have loved and lost etc.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Sublime love drama movie,Back in 2011 when Marc Webb was announced as the director for Amazing Spider-Man I always read about his movie 500 days of Summer. I was too young to watch now realizing it when I watched the movie yesterday. It's a well written story and unpredictable at times. I recommend this movie to adults since teenagers may not feel the movie the way an adult with experience and emotions could feel. It's amazing I learned so much about myself when I finished the movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a fabulous straight A cast for the role of Tom Hansen. Zooey Deschanel's look and body language was flashing. They both had a great chemistry on set. A movie you should check up at least for once.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Yay! for Marc Webb,"Cheers to Marc Webb for finally doing what the rest of Hollywood has seriously been ;lacking on...creativity,originality. This isn't your average romance/slash chick flick, and to be personally honest i didn't think i would get into it by watching the beginning of the film i felt oh boy another movie i have to sit through for the wife's sake but no it grew on me. I love Joseph Gordon Levitt to death and he reminds me a lot of Heath Ledger (dont ask me why) but he does. He once again does a bang on job of the very confused male (like that is rare) and Zooey Deschanel who i am still wondering how she is going to do when she stars as Janis Joplin in the upcoming bio, is the very confusing love interest here who wants a relationship without labelling it so...or at least thats what i got from her character. either that or she was afraid of commitment needless to say it was a nice change seeing the role reversal here as according to Hollywierd usually has the woman being the jaded one. thats where Marc Webbs genius comes into play. Need to mention Criminal Mind's Matthew Gray Gubler has a small part in this although being nice to see him act another character then Dr. Spencer Reid, that's unfortunately all i kept seeing every time i saw him on screen.

An average story told excellently,"The editing and storytelling for this film is executed in a brilliantly fresh way.

From Love to Heartbreak,"This film is like a romantic comedy with a twist - and not the kind of twist you'd find in a pretzel. It follows Tom, a hopeless romantic who falls head over heels for Summer, the ultimate girl-next-door with a heart as elusive as a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.But this ain't your typical love story. Nope, this is a tale of love, heartbreak, and the harsh realities of modern romance. It's like they took every romantic comedy cliché, flipped it on its head, and then hit it with a baseball bat for good measure. The film's non-linear narrative is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded - confusing, frustrating, and yet strangely satisfying when you finally figure it out. We jump back and forth through Tom and Summer's relationship, piecing together the highs and lows like a jigsaw puzzle of emotions. But what really sets this film apart is its brutally honest portrayal of love and heartbreak. It's like they took a sledgehammer to the rose-tinted glasses of romantic comedies and showed us the messy, complicated reality underneath. And it's not always pretty.In the end, 500 Days of Summer is a bittersweet symphony of love and loss, laughter and tears, a romantic comedy with a twist, or just a romantic tragedy masquerading as a comedy. It's the kind of movie that makes you laugh, cry, and maybe even question your own romantic ideals - all in the span of 500 days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Summer of Love,"What is (500) Days of Summer exactly? Well, it's probably one of the best movies in your movie theater for starters. It's a well acted, beautifully shot look at love, heartbreak, and fate. While it's not your typical summer movie, it's still one that you should see.The not so typical story of the movie follows a non-linear timeline. The title refers to the 500 days that Tom, played by the up-and-coming Joseph Gordon-Levitt, must endure and feel the effects of love and longing. The movie begins with a distraught Tom after Summer (Zooey Deschanel) has broken up with him. When he tries explaining his story to his little sister, she tells him to start from the beginning, and so he does. Throughout the course of the movie, the story unfolds in an interesting manner as we find out what caused the break-up.Though you may be thinking that the movie is hipster trash, it's not. Yes, it's quirky and often includes elements that would attract many hipsters (constant pop culture references, art jokes, the fact that it's a Fox Searchlight film), it's a film for everyone. Some parts of it are so quirky that you're almost forced to laugh.The acting is another great thing about this movie. We feel exactly what the director, Marc Webb, wants us to feel, but only due to the intense emotions portrayed by the characters. As Tom begins to experience depression, we feel it too. It's impossible not to fall in love with Summer's intense blue eyes and lovely personality. This intensity is also due, in part, to Marc Webb's visuals. The best example of this is a scene where Tom first has sex with Summer. The next day he wakes up and sings as he's walking to work. The scene is the only musical scene and yet, it's choreographed better than most musicals.So there you have it. (500) Days of Summer is a charming look at the beginnings of a relationship, the end of a relationship, and recovery. It poses the stunning question of ""What is love?"" through it's well-written script and sweet performances. As the narrator says in the beginning of the film, ""This is not a love story."" and it truly is not. It's a look at what happens after a love story. (500) Days of Summer is the year's most quirky look at love and least predictable romance comedy ever. I think I'm in love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I like it!,"This film exudes an overwhelming charm, potentially ranking among the finest Romantic-Comedies of its decade thanks to this very quality. It takes a quirky approach, revolving around a skeptic woman and the man smitten with her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers his trademark charm in the male lead role, but it's the dynamic between him and Zooey Deschanel that truly steals the show. Deschanel consistently enriches every character she portrays, prompting admiration for her screen presence. Could she possibly be one of the most consistently excellent yet underappreciated performers of the era? While the term ""underrated"" might be debatable given her widespread adoration, it's crucial to recognize her as a top-tier talent.Her character's intriguing philosophy serves as a barrier to her connection with Tom, played by Levitt, who grapples with this realization throughout the film. Their relationship unfolds in a captivating ""cat and mouse"" manner, leading to an unexpected conclusion. The film's structure, employing a ""500 days"" format, is strikingly original within the genre, punctuated by emotionally resonant moments that leave a lasting impact. The impeccable chemistry between the leads, coupled with Marc Webb's adept direction and a sincere narrative, culminates in a resounding success. It epitomizes the essence of heartwarming cinema, a delightful discovery that warrants attention amidst a sea of must-watch movies.While it occasionally succumbs to genre conventions and some scenes may feel less significant, the film's overall craftsmanship allows it to transcend these minor flaws. It's understandable why many hail it as one of the genre's best offerings.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I might have been a bit unfair, so check it out for yourself and feel free to fall in love. Ho Hum back to reality.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Why was this movie made?,"First of all, for all the hoopla by some critics and film festival types this is not a very good movie. It really isn't.The script lacks even the slightest insight to how relationships really work, but still tries to have its cake by having the Tom character make a big speech at the end of the film about how movies and pop songs screw up everyone's expectations of what love is.I'll tell you what love isn't. An emotionally stunted man-boy trying to have a relationship with a girl who is most likely has a borderline personality disorder.The film was not without it's charms, Gordon-Levitt was a very likable and engaging, the soundtrack was pleasant to listen to and the film had a handful of sitcom style ""funny"" lines. But if you've ever watched an episode or two of How I Met Your Mother or Big Bang Theory you've heard them all before.Fortunately for the filmmakers, the festivals types who eat up this drivel refuse to watch popular television on principal and they will therefore think this film is original and clever.But overall, the film dragged on forever, Zoe Deschannel (who I adore) looked old in the film and had almost nothing to do, and the little quirky visual bits were straight out of the Sundance film festival handbook.Fox Searchlight will probably score a minor hit with this nonsense, but in ten years no one will remember this slight, immature little flick.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.","I have hope for the romantic comedy. After enduring February's He's Just Not That Into You, I really started to believe that the future for this particular genre, in terms of any sort of artistic appeal or entries that have any weight to them at all, was dismal. There have been some notable offerings over the last year or so in the form of some energetic indie films, but nothing to write home about.But then comes along first-time director Marc Webb with an enjoyable little number that has, at least for the time being, restored my faith in the rom-com. Remember the bliss that was Garden State? Think of (500) Days of Summer as a slightly more mature, infinitely more whimsical relative of the 2004 Zach Braff hit.The story follows the exploits of Tom Hansen, a twenty-something who grew up with rock-solid faith in the promise that there is such a thing as true love and that it's waiting for that perfect moment to manifest itself in our lives. He works as a writer for a greeting card company: you know, the ones that turn out the same ""Hang in there!"" drivel you often find at your local Hallmark. Things are mediocre as usual until the day Tom's boss hires Summer Finn as an assistant. Tom is instantly mesmerized by her, and does all he can to catch her attention.The cat and mouse game that results is well crafted, funny, and true to life. Though things start to tire slightly at the conclusion, witnessing the evolution of the relationship between Tom and Summer is a real treat, and it shows that screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have a real eye for the nuanced interactions that comprise the modern relationship for many people. The whole thing is intermittently narrated (literally and figuratively) too, which helps provide a decidedly ""fairy tale""-esque panache that both delivers on the promises we're fed during childhood and dashes them by deftly exploring the not- so-pretty harshness of how relationships often play out in the real world. All of this is nicely underscored by the fact that both Tom and Summer's parents are divorced–a key point that plays into their own expectations regarding relationships (particularly Summer's). This is made especially clear in a scene during which Tom and Summer purposely become lost in the maze that comprises their local Ikea. The pair jokingly takes on the stereotypical roles expected of a man and wife, with Summer cheerfully removing imaginary food from an oven and Tom sitting at a spotless kitchen table. He beams with an over-the-top smile, feigning pride in regards to the ""mock life"" that him and his partner have fostered. There's some real subtextual resonance here, and it shows that everyone involved in (500) Days of Summer really wanted to create a film that goes beyond mere entertainment–they wanted to make something that their audience can relate to.There's also an artistic flair to the movie that makes it that much more interesting. Though it's rather infrequent, scenes sometimes transition into rough sketches mimicking those that Tom, who was schooled in architecture (though he chose not to pursue it as a career), pens in his notepad during his afternoon musings in a downtown Los Angeles park. The film even includes some cartoon animation, which shows Webb's ability to work some perfectly appropriate, albeit cheesy humor into the production. There are one or two instances where it seems as if (500) Days of Summer is ""being indie"" just for the sake of being indie, but these are few and far between. They're also instantly forgivable in the midst of the accomplishments the film manages, especially considering the unrealistic convention that so many recent romantic comedies have fallen victim to.If you want an enjoyable night at the movies with your significant other, then go check out (500) Days of Summer. It's entertaining and thoughtful, a combination that's extraordinarily rare in the rom-coms I've encountered thus far in 2009.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A good comedy that ignores the obvious,"(500) Days Of Summer is a movie that poses as a story that is about love but it can't be classified as a love story. Most romantic comedies (that generally get, and deserve a critical savaging) go through a boring and dull formula of a pop music soundtrack and boy- meets- girl, girl finds dilemma and is insecure, they kiss and the end. This movie is different, and it's safe to describe it as bittersweet in some aspects. It's sweet in the romance department mainly due to the fantastic chemistry between Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). It's not afraid to be bitter, either. The non-linear narrative makes the film more complex as well. The performances are believable and it is great film to watch with the humor and the intriguing characters that it posses. Although the film can fill a bit hipsterish at times with all The Smiths references and the soundtrack mixed with indie and folk acts, which is likely to alienate the audience at times and might damage the care factor that the audience have for the characters, it is a good film. It's worth a watch, but it isn't for everyone, and I'm not implying for a second that people who do not like this film are below the ones that like it. Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Marc Webb is one hell of a director and i would be surprise if the movie doesn't end up with the best original screenplay award. but my biggest problem with this movie is that is actually not an hilarious comedy. is like in the vein of eternal sunshine for the spotless mind but still is a great and touching film. kudos for gordon levitt acting in this one. other aspect that i really like was how much the people end up hating summer. im not an expert, but they need to understand that even if she plays with tom feelings, they weren't meant to be. other lil' problem i got is the girl who plays autumn, i mean Minka Kelly is beautiful and i like her as a person but it's no the right choice for this role. still really good filmother similar movies are:the rebound last chance harvey love happens",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good film,"Except for some movie oddities, the events are told simply, and out of order. There is the dancing in the park (completely out of character, but I liked it because it was a breath of air, fresh or not, just air), and some split screen comparisons (sometimes just a way of layering the plot, sometimes to create plot, by creating a fantasy on one side and reality on the other). And these are good, even if they remind you that a lot of the rest is just plain vanilla.In all, the movie is fun, for sure, a joy even, and without glaring issues. Certain clichés are avoided--the woman is strong and smart, the man gentle and un-macho. They actually make a nice couple. But maybe slightly less interesting than some of your friends, who they don't make movies about for the simple reason they aren't interesting enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
(500) Days of Tedium,"I watched this film based on a recommendation- big disappointment.The basic plot- our loser protagonist (Joseph Gordon Levitt, who did an okay job considering he had to play a dull young man) is crazy about Summer (Zooey Deschanel, who is suitably kooky). The actors are not the downfall- the downfall is the director and the screenplay.It is so obvious that this film is semi-autobiographical, a sort of whiny revenge. It's a bit like that clingy new kid who really wants you to like him and hang out and be cool together- but his attempts to be cool and kooky are so forced that the film becomes very strained.Attempts at kookiness include an 'alternative' soundtrack (so we think the film is quirky and alternative, despite it being formulaic and predictable), the play on Summer in the title (it's like a season but also her name, ha ha!) and the tagline (""This is not a love story-this is a story about love."" Actually, it is a love story- just a rather dull one with lots of cod philosophy about love- cos he works in a greetings card company! Ha ha, isn't that funny and cute?). The ending is so sickeningly 'cute', you might actually throw up.The structure of the film is terrible. It's done out like a series of vignettes, which is fine. The technique creates little snapshot moments-perfect for the premise of the film. Conveniently it papers over the cracks the film has as a whole, so you're left with a very bitty film. Sometimes you'll get a good vignette (the one where the couple are playing house in IKEA)but often you will get dull ones. Then there's a countdown of the 500 days, which is done practically a week at a time, but the time gap varies- all it does is drag the pace. Then we have the ill-judged voice-over narrator, an idea which is as awful as it sounds. And the screenplay is incredibly poor- one wonders if it wasn't written by a bad film student, because it is supposedly arty but bears no resemblance to how people actually speak or behave.If you like Zooey Deschanel, you might like this film. If you have low expectations of films, by all means watch this. For an alternative teen/young person film, watch Pretty in Pink. For a negative film about love, you could watch Closer or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?...there's loads of films out there that live up to their promise.

special affection movie,"500 days of Summer, this is the famous film that everyone who loves affection movies would not miss it. Today I want to focus 2 parts in this movie.
The plot of 500 days of summer is very special and its filming technique are unique.
The timeline of whole story is crisscross each other and there are so many memory or fantasy part in movie, so I think it is a little bit hard to watch at the first time. If you try second time, it may be helpful to understand the story.
The plot is talking about a woman who named Summer and Tom (the leading actor) falls in love with Summer, but they don't have a happy ending. Summer says that she was very confused and unconfident about love even though she likes Tom. The more interesting is that at the end of the story, Summer married with another man. Tom's heart was broken and he finally realized that someone are destined to fall in love with each other but not suit for each other. I saw some comments in website talking about this movie are always says that Summer is not good girl or she's cheating Tom, but in my point of view. I think she is really brave to chase her love and what she suit for, and this is why I love this movie because it is so different in contrast to another traditional affection movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"This Is Not a Love Story, This Is a Modern Masterpiece.","500 Days of Summer is a complete modern classic. The fluent story, the acting and the chemistry between Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are exceptional.Also the director, Marc Webb was a music video director before this first movie he made. He directed a lot of emo band's videos like My Chemical Romance and AFI which he gained so much experience from using music in a video. That's why, 500 Days also look like a very long music video with its 1:30 hour time and its largely usage of the soundtrack album. This perfect album is full of modern and classic indie bands with quality.The storytelling is absolutely adorable. If you are a man, you can relate yourself with Tom and love (and hate) Summer. And if you are a woman, well, i don't know lol.In my opinion, the most important thing of a work of art is the ability to make you watch / listen / read again.

Romantic-Comedy with depth,"500 Days of Summer looks at the Relationship of Tom and Summer in a different way than most movies in this genre. From the Beginning you can relate to the main charakter Tom, because of the very good performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt who carries the movie with his great performance. Unfortunatley Zoey Deschanel was not very convincing and therefore the whole chemistry between the main charakters did not always feel very real. Nonetheless the movie did a great job creating emotions. Happy moments were portrayed really well and also sad moments had their one tone and did create the perfect feeling for this moment in the movie. After a while the movie becomes slightly predictable and a bit too overdramatic but still feels very lighthearthed and caring. The ending was sweet and leaves the viewer with mixed feelings. In my opinion the ending was a bit too formulated, but still did deliever the right emotions that were needed in this moment.
Overall 500 Days of Summer is a good movie with some interesting plot elements. The emotions in the movie felt real and consume the viewer from the very first shot. Sometimes it follows to much the formula of a normal romantic Comedy and therefore becomes nothing special in the end. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

the perfect encapsulation of falling in love,This movie while only being a little less than 2 hours really makes you relate to the characters. This movie feels like you could watch it at multiple stages in your life and relate to a different character that being summer or tom or even one of their friends. This is very much a sad movie while also being uplifting depending on who you side with the director encapsulates this so well that I feel as if I was a character it feels very grounded to life and shows our flaws and brings that out perfectly in my opinion. This especially works because of the emotions that Joseph gordan levit portrays it makes you sympathize for him and makes him feel real. This movie is just great it has amazing characters played by amazing actors with a fantastic lead and somehow a even better live story making me want more of this character while making me feel satisfied with were he ends making him a complete character.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Narrator lied, it WAS a love story.","I usually run a mile from these types of rom coms, but the two leads are actors that I like, so gave it a shot, fully expecting to bail out at some early point. However, the quirky flip flopping timeline of 500 days, kept things interesting, along with the two surprisingly non irritating protagonists, and their curiously ambiguous relationship.Plus, it looks good, and has a some nice music tracks included. There are also a few idiosyncratic moments, by way of split screens, animations, and a point where it lapses into a full blown musical, which is thankfully, short, and not to be repeated.Of course this is a Hollywood production, so everything, and everyone is suitably clean and shiny, and presentable. Art galleries, references to classic movies, talk of architectural merits, expensive weddings, nothing grungy or offensively unattractive to see here.It was all very safe and nice, the only peril involved a broken heart or a sore lip. It was OK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Truly Moving Film,"I am not one to like ""Chick Flicks"", I am most certainly not one to put one on my Top 10 of the Year list. But this movie is not a normal love story chick flick. I could not even truly classify this as a said ""chick flick"" because of just how great this movie was. Not only does it move you emotionally, even as a guy, but it adds in much of the aspects that normal ""chick flicks"" do not; mainly comedy and a good story. I would highly recommend this film, not only for its tremendous performances by its actors, but by the sheer emotional power of its story and that it is by far one of the Top 10 Movies of 2009 by far and everyone should make an effort so view this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Interesting movie to say the least.,"The movie follows two people, Tom and Summer, through a story of fleeting love and heartbreak, their relationship being ultimately doomed for failure.The movie is certainly interesting with the plot however it could have been written better, with perhaps more emphasis on trying to bring the spotlight onto the old tropes of the nice guy and the manic pixie dream girl that were common on films of the time.Can't really say i like or dislike the soundtrack because i never listened to it much.The movie's style is certainly vibrant and unique compared to the ones i've seen so far.Overall i'd say that its interesting but i don't like it nor dislike it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I Love the Smiths,"Not a normal love story, the film offers a novel perspective on the romantic comedy genre since it deviates from the standard storyline of a male meeting a lady, they become romantically involved, confront a challenge, and then getting married. Instead, the movie focuses on the difficulties and reality of relationships, emphasizing how they can be both compassionate and devastating.Outstanding performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom, a hopeless romantic who becomes deeply infatuated with Summer, a person who refuses to have any faith in romance. He captures the spirit of Tom's struggle as he strives to align his ambitions of the relationship with gratitude and complexity. The viewers commiserate with the character's sensitivity as they support him while having to confront the hard truths of his circumstance. The person to whom Tom is attracted, Summer, is played magnificently by Zooey Deschanel. Her persona is mysterious, intriguing, and complicated as she sorts through her own beliefs about love and relationships. The film's non-linear narrative, which swings between various periods of Tom and Summer's engagement, serves as one of the movie's finest components. By illustrating how the individuals' emotions and interactions shift as time passes, this framework gives the narrative richness. The audience rarely knows for sure where the plot will continue, which appeals to the sensation of unpredictability.The movie's usage of the soundtrack seems to be another outstanding aspect. Incredible compositions from artists like The Smiths and Regina Spektor are included in the background, which flawlessly captures the vibe and flow of the narrative. The audio provides the film with an additional emotional context that strengthens the audience's attachment to the characters and their path. The concept for the movie is superb and sophisticated, it generally avoids the usual clichés and rather concentrates on examining the intricacy of interpersonal connections and human traits. The people's conversations are compelling and sincere, reflecting the positive and negative aspects of their connections in a manner that seems realistic.Its candor on the obstacles of romantic partners is what makes the film so remarkable. The romance appears in the movie as something chaotic, spontaneous, and even torturous but nevertheless worthwhile to pursue. Even though it doesn't sugarcoat the reality of sorrow and regret, thus it acknowledges and embraces the enjoyment and solidarity that may emerge from experiencing love for the first time. With Summer's personality trying to defy the stereotype of the female companion, the movie confronts sexual conventions and expectancies. Layered and multifaceted, her ambitions, desires, and insufficiencies are all represented by Summer which results in contrast with various other romantic movies.To summarize, 500 Days of Summer is a stunning, comforting, and thought-provoking film that presents an entirely novel perspective on the romance genre. The non-linear plot, remarkable cast, and fabulous soundtracks offer this movie highly recommended to anyone who appreciates an unforgettable romantic story. It will have you giggle, shed a tear, and end up leaving you feeling excited more about how influenced love and interpersonal relationship can be, and it's definitely going to be recognized for many decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
a story of unrequited love,"This is an unusual movie in that the story is really about unrequited love. An uncommon topic for today's ""guy gets girl"" or ""girl gets guy"" genre. The movie is good, the acting believable and I would recommend it. The use of a ""pop up"" to continually alert the audience to ""the time line"" in the main character's life is unique as well. Too many movies have flash backs that are hard to ""place,"" not this movie. All in all, this movie may be worth seeing just to see something that isn't ""boiler plate"" or formulaic (as the most recent set of releases). The ending is somewhat predictable but charming none the less.Tom",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
When putting good stuff in a movie doesn't make a good movie,"When I watched 500 Days of Summer, during the first 20 or so minutes of the movie I thought I had a great find. It was like the characters really had something in common with me. Too much, I understood when I looked closer.It was like the creative team had brainstormed on what is cool with the current generation's intelligent youth - not being members of the generation themselves. Like creating a product for a profitable market. Instead, they got a movie that had nothing natural or convincing about it.The idea is, if you look beyond catchphrases and the music the characters listen to and the rest of ""decorations"", 500 Days of Summer is actually Twilight for hipsters.Hence the grade - 1 out of 10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Its Not A Love Story - MAC Reviews,"Ok so I was not expecting this from this film ''500 Days of Summer''
A beautiful film which would definitely reside in your heart for a long time.+ves : Storytelling. Look the way movie has been narrated & presented before us is really awesome. The director tries something different & unique. Apart from the plot of the film was quite relatable. You might thought that its another typical Rom-Com but no its a complete package of Romance, Drama, Suffering, Comedy & Self Realization. Those comic punches were really great so Writing is a big plus point for this one. Acting performances of Zooey & Joseph were brilliant. Their on screen chemistry was slizzing & top notch. There were no clichés in the entire movie. Another positive is its fast paced screenplay which always keep you glued to your seats & movie screens. The whole movie i.e. 1hr 35mins felt like a breeze.-ves : Tbh, there were none except for one thing. Music & BGM could have been a bit better, better than the one used in this film.To conclude, I reckon it as a must watch for all of you. You would simply love it.

(500) Days of Summer seasons a realistic romance with romantic comedy clichés.,"""There are two kinds of people in this world: men and women"". Aside from heavy-handed heterosexual lines of dialogue (like the above) in an attempt to come across as quirky, this romance often recycles classic love story traits and turns the story into a realistic relationship that questions fate and determinism. Many believe there is a soulmate out there in the big world for us, just waiting to be discovered. Is it fate? Or pure coincidence when we find love? Thomas, a writer for a card company, encounters the wonderfully sweet Summer. He helplessly falls in love and must soon deal with the aftermath of their ""break up"".Using the guy's perspective is an interesting viewpoint, and portrays the idea that anyone regardless of gender can overanalyse a situation and suffer the same heartbreak. Director Webb captures the typical tropes that swamp the rom-com genre, such as happily dancing along the street to upbeat acoustic tracks, but turns them into self-referential devices to highlight the implausibility of true love. The use of on-screen graphics to indicate the narrative time shifts enhance the quirkiness of the film. It works well! Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are cute together, even if the latter lacks the acting talent of the former. Yet they still emit a sense a humanity that makes them relatable as characters.The fleeting romance between them is perhaps underdeveloped in certain areas, and that's partially due to the tight runtime that prevents further exploration into their adorable love. I mean look at him! He is always so smitten and happy. Just want to pinch his cheeks! I appreciate the realistic conclusion, and to be honest, Autumn looks like a catch so it works in his favour. Overall, a refreshing spin on the formulaic rom-com genre that really should've been ""(1000) Days of Summer"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Too real and too close to heart,"I absolutely love this fantastic film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of lost love resonates with me on a personal level. The script is masterfully written and the creative exploration of 500 days keeps the story engaging.The reviews here capture it perfectly especially for every young man who has gazed into the eyes of someone they believed to be their true love, only to have their heart shattered, casting a shadow over their life for what feels like endless summer days. This is a tale of two imperfect individuals just like it happens in real life.This isn't a movie for couples in the early stages of dating. I'd recommend it for those young lovers who have recently experienced heartbreak or for those in a solid relationship who can exchange knowing glances after the film and say 'Love is a rollercoaster and sometimes it takes a movie like this to remind us we're not alone in the ups and downs'",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The love story that's not a love story,"This is not a love story. The narrator tells us so right at the beginning. We meet our two central characters, our two lovebirds, and know immediately that their relationship is doomed to fail. As the film's title suggests the movie takes place over 500 days. But we begin near the end, day 488 to be precise. The love story that's not really a love story has already run its course. We see the end and then we are taken back to the beginning, day one. After that we're all over the place, constantly jumping forward and back in time, a jumbled mess of memories as a man remembers the good times and bad of the love affair that broke his heart.The man with the broken heart is Tom, a man who trained as an architect only to wind up as a greeting card writer. He's a good-hearted guy, a man who is a fervent believer in the idea of true love. And when Summer shows up he's sure he has found the love of his life. Summer's a seemingly sweet girl. She's charming, quirky, offbeat. Kind of like the movie itself. And for that matter like the actress who plays the part, Zooey Deschanel. As you watch the movie play itself out it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Summer. Deschanel is utterly perfect. But as great as Deschanel is, as compelling as her character may be, this movie is about Tom. We're seeing the story from his perspective. We're rooting for him. For the movie to work the actor playing this part was always going to be the real key. Happily, Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a terrific job. Through all the highs and lows of the Tom and Summer relationship Gordon-Levitt captures wonderfully the emotions Tom is feeling in each moment. When Tom's heart breaks yours breaks right along with him.From the moment he first laid eyes on her Tom saw Summer as the perfect woman. That was his first mistake. Nobody's perfect. Summer has her obvious charms but what's really hidden away behind the dazzling smile and big, blue eyes? Right at the start Summer tells Tom she does not believe in true love. Tom ignores this at his own peril. Tom and Summer seem to make a great couple but they want different things out of life, out of each other. Sure there are some good times along the way but it can't last. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. Seeing them together makes you desperately wish this was a love story. But it's not. And the way the movie jumps around in time puts a smart, well-played twist on the story. We can see the best time in the relationship, the highest of highs. And then immediately jump forward to the lowest of lows. A great illustration of how fragile something seemingly so perfect can really be. Where did it all go wrong? Tom's trying to sort it out inside his head and we're right there with him. This is a movie about a doomed relationship, about a man who had his heart shredded to pieces. But, no doubt helped by the two great lead performances, it's charming nonetheless. It's not a spectacular movie but it's certainly enjoyable and clever too. It's a movie which puts some unique twists on the typical love story. The biggest twist being that it's not really a love story at all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Romance Story That Dudes Can Actually Enjoy Watching,"As a guy and movie lover, I view romantic films as a waste of time and a film genre that I'll never touch. Following a typical cliché that combines with an uninteresting tale of boy meets girl or the other way around that is overused and uninteresting. However, what separates this film with other romantic stories is the realistic take of a boy meets girl and presents this in a manner where even a guy like me can enjoy.While this movie is not exactly a break-up film or the typical romantic comedy film, I really liked the story of this film. As said earlier, It is a simple boy meets girl that portrays this in a realistic manner that shows the highs of being in a relationship and the lows of being dumped or separated from your love. What helped boost the story and fascinating was the storytelling. In easier terms, the film presents a yin-yang type of storytelling; one moment you will see Tom filled with joy and enjoying life as he is with Summer, then the story will jump to a different time where Tom is depressed, then the film repeats this process. Watching this is never annoying and succeeds in telling a good story, making it compelling.Every actor and actress were perfectly well casted and portrayed their characters very well. Every character, especially the minor characters have at least something funny to present. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer were great. You can definitely buy the chemistry between these two as you watch their relationship bloom as they are together. I like the fact that the director didn't make Tom the ultimate good guy, making you question his actions that led him to this situation. The beginning will make you think that Summer is evil, but as you watch the film, you begin to realize the flaws and mistakes that Tom had made and will understand the reason of the breakup.What surprised me most about the movie was the humor since I found myself laughing throughout various moments in the film. There are conversations, interactions and dialogue between the characters that succeeds in bringing laughter to anyone who enjoys the plot. Although you do not see them a lot, personally, Tom's friends really helped bring the humor to some scenes. They were never annoying, didn't outshine any of the cast and were great as you see them on screen. Their conversations really reminds me of my discussion with my best friend that leads up to answers and conclusions that is similar to what these characters say in the film; may sound weird, but it worked for me.In the end, I ended up liking this film more than I expected. Bringing a realistic take on romance and to present it with good humor, great acting and likable characters really made this film fun to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An off beat gem,"I have to confess that if there's one genre of films that I particularly enjoy, it's off beat comedies. I love films that are unstructured where the characterisations take priority over the story. I'm pleased to say that (500) days of summer is one of those films and it's very enjoyable.The film focuses on the relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel) over 500 days. The film isn't sequenced however and jumps around over the 500 days. This makes for an interesting effect as one moment they're getting to know each other and the next they hate the sight of each other. The two leads play nice roles and the two characters are opposite from the conventional male/female stereotypes in terms of their romance.

Film review: (500) days of Summer Directed by: Marc Webb Actors: Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt,"This unusual romantic comedy will certainly surprise who sees it. In the beginning of the movie it's said: ""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" And so it is. Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has a degree in Architecture and writes greeting cards falls in love at first sight for Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his new coworker and a girl who doesn't believe in true love.As time goes by, they start to know each other better and a romance begins. Their story is not showed in a chronological order. The days appear to us in a random order, and we can enjoy their happy and in love days and cry with Tom when they have an argument. This delightful comedy directed by Marc Webb gives us the chance to reflect about a real life romance and that things not always happen as we wish. I couldn't imagine a better actress to interpret this character unless Zooey Deschanel. Protagonist of the movie Yes Man (2008) and actually the protagonist of the TV series New Girl (2012), Zooey keeps her sweet and adorable way of act.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, well-known for the roles in 10 things I hate about you (1999) and Manic (2001) is interpreting such a sweet young man that everyone hopes that Summer and Tom continue together forever. This cute and surprising love story will make you feel all kind of emotions in 95 minutes. Get ready!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great, fresh insight into the romance genre","This is not a love story. That is the warning given to the viewer at the beginning of the movie. And it certainly meets the assumption as we wander deeper and deeper into the complicated relationship of Tom and Summer.He is an idealistic dreamer, who think that in order to achieve happiness he has to fall in love with the one, perfect girl. She happens to be his exact contrary female version - she doesn't believe in happy endings and fairy tales. So how exactly do these two very different people end up being a couple for the eponymous 500 days? For all the lovebirds out there, this could mean that sometimes the exception proves the rule! However, I have to blunt right now - sadly, as the viewer is about to find out, the differences and arising conflicts can only produce a disastrous result and drive two people apart.There are many reasons why I simply fell in love with this picture: it is not a typical movie, due to the fact that it connects some aspects of a typical romance with various features of a down- to-earth drama. This process is best shown through the intersection of parts that show everything in bright and positive colors, with the sun shining and the birds singing, and parts that include rainstorms, dark humor, sad faces and deeply philosophical sentences. This cinematic procedure really invites to get a broader look at this very particular relationship, which can sometimes seem as a smooth and joyful one. And then, just a few seconds later, it provides a scene that changes the perspective 180 degree around.Great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. You could certainly see that they had so much fun playing the main parts. What is more, because of the fact that the connection between the two stars carries the whole plot in an amazing fashion, the recognition that they deserve for their wonderful acting should be even bigger.Personally, I am not a big fan of romantic movies, that is why I didn't know what to expect when I started watching (500) Days of Summer. But in the end I was astonished. It provides a new light onto this genre and changes the way we might perceive it. It stand out from the crowd of all those, mostly boring, standard romances and shows that in real life not everybody ends up living happily ever after - sometimes we have to put up a hell of a fight to get closer to a person we admire. And even then, it's a long way home.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Deschanel's presence suggests a more pleasing movie than it is,"""(500) Days of Summer"" finally clicks into gear somewhere just after the halfway mark when expectations clash with reality and Joseph Gordon-Levitt hits bottom. It' here that I really felt something for this character, and and the rest of the movie picks up from then on, right up until the sweet ending - a sweetness I guess I was expecting much earlier, which is why the first half left me cold. Very stilted and awkward. The supporting cast is lacking here (Moretz is the token common-sense friend), but hearing Richard McGonagle (Sully in ""Uncharted"") narrate this thing was very nice.Overall, it's a good (albeit rocky) story about unrequited love and the pain that that entails, but the best thing here (aside from Gordon-Levitt) is that it's not your formulaic romantic comedy. And that subversion helps make up for the rough patches.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Some should be able to identify with,"(2009) (500) Days of Summer
ROMANTIC DRAMAFor me personally, this film is more of a 60 but semantically, I can understand the reason why this film to being an 80 or higher! At the beginning of this film showcases Summer played by Zooey Deschanel in wanting to split up with Tom played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt ! There, is when the story begins to start, is when it reflects back to all '500 days' while they were together, up until they had broken up or stop seeing each other.While I was watching this, you have to tolerate such improvised dialogue such as ""Do you want to see a movie!"" or ""I thought we were meant to be together!"" Dialogue, I see all the time either in books or films, and this film doesn't consist much a lot of thought! The other thing this film doesn't have, are people interventions, except from Tom's co-workers and an underage sister who does not appear very much, but offers him advice in a way of consoling! In my opinion this film works better as a girl's perspective than it would be for any non- athletic guy who want to get rid of people who act like the Joseph Vincent character, because I've actually conversed with actual girls who go out with characters as this film portrayed, and some of these girls be with these 'kind' people because of their persona's and not because they're physically attracted to them. What this film does well is display 'one' of a million ways to break ties with them, and just accept it to just be friends! To explain the reason why this is more of a 60, because this film is a little too shallow, for the film displays too much on how Tom cares about her from his point of view, and not so much for Summer, leaving viewers somewhat oblivious or kept in the dark about this! For instance, after their first fling or one night stand together, you then would see Tom dancing happily on the streets, but Summer on the other hand showcases absolutely nothing!! Does Tom even asks or require her about this, and the answer is 'no', for it's like a narrow minded point of view, making the Levitt character representing into an almost a delusional whiner and poor sap. And then, rather than just accepting it, the film cross-examines a pointless relationship that wasn't meant to be... or should never had happened, meaning that this happens to every poor average shmuck all the time- ""So, get over it!""- I kept saying to myself! Very exceptional ending by the way, but feels somewhat a long time to get there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"It's not some fabricated fairytale of true-love, but something true about love","6/30/09The feeling I got from this film still rings inside me every time I think of the time of when I first watched it. After anticipating and waiting endlessly since watching the first teaser trailer* last year with ""Sweet Disposition"" playing in the background to finally seeing a screening, I was not disappointed. What's so great about this movie is that it is REAL, in the simplest terms it's not some fabricated fairytale of true-love, but something true about love, just like the teaser trailer states, ""this is not a love story, it's a story about love."" Something just as simple as that turn of phrase, I think, brings more of an audience, in, that can relate with the characters Tom and Summer. Zooey as always has that heart meltingly cute charm and excellent singing voice that just captures you where as Joseph deeply plays that hopeless romantic guy, perfectly carrying your heart through all of his highs and lows. In the end, I most definitely feel that everyone is either a Summer or a Tom, and sincerely hope people go out to see this film and embrace its magic in reality.

"A film that stays with you; charming, funny and beautiful","First and foremost it should be mentioned that the film is extremely well-made, despite its crew being composed mostly of first-timers. Marc Webb, the first-time director, has years of music video and commercial experience behind him, which explains how well-made and good looking the film is. But the fact that he managed to craft such a taught and fluid feature-length film is nonetheless quite impressive and almost surprising. In any case, I expect great things from him in the future. Fact is, this is an entirely indie film but without an indie feel; it's very well shot and professionally made, and I think that just adds to its genuineness. The film also features many elements that distinguish it from just an average film telling the same story: split-screen, frequent breaking of the fourth wall, a spontaneous song-and-dance number, animation, and of course the non-linear storytelling (with a number on screen indicating the position of the scene portrayed out of the titular 500 days to boot) are just a few of said elements that lend this film much of its uniqueness.But ultimately, what makes this movie as special as it is are its characters. I have always said that a film begins and ends with its characters, and as far as I'm concerned, a good, plot-less character study will always be more interesting than a great story with uninteresting characters. And in a film like this, which eventually tells a pretty simple, straightforward and mundane story that we've all seen and heard before, the characters are key to distinguish it, to make it stand out. And this film succeeds more than most others in defining and presenting real, grounded, three-dimensional and identifiable characters. First-time screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber do a fantastic job at defining these characters, but the credit lies with the actors for embodying them and breathing the life into them that radiates from the screen. I have been a long-time fan of both of the leads, especially of Joseph Gordon-Levitt who over the years, be it in Mysterious Skin or in Brick, has carved himself a niche as one of the most interesting and consistent young actors of his generation. Zooey Deschanel has always been wonderful, from her small supporting roles in older films such as Almost Famous to her more recent status as a leading lady, but this is the first movie of hers I've seen that really gives her a chance to shine and portray a fascinating and full-fledged character. Both performers really stand out in the film, and the supporting cast does a great job as well.With films like this, it is easy to appreciate the technical accomplishments, from the spot-on cinematography to the fantastic performances. But a true, emotional connection with the audience is something rare, and very personal. This film connected with me. I just felt a very strong affinity to its characters, and to the situations it put them in. What I love about movies of its type is that it portrays circumstances that are all-too-familiar, drawn from real life, and totally identifiable if one goes through similar experiences in one's own life. I think that anyone who has had experience with sour relationships or with unrequited love can identify very easily with this film and its characters. Or perhaps some people will identify with Summer; people who have found themselves in relationships, basically, in which their feelings weren't as strong as their partner's. Some moments in this film are right out of life – the moment shared by Summer and Tom outside the bar, when she's just standing there waiting for him to kiss her but he hesitates and they end up parting ways. And the film flawlessly portrays the characters' feelings as they go through these motions and find themselves in these true-to-life situations.This is an indie film, but it doesn't feel like one. It's whimsical, but never precious. It's stylized but never unrealistic. It's very small-scale but it never feels cheap. Eventually, what makes it work so well as a film is the fact that it takes a very simple story and situation, drawn from real life, and portrays it in a way that is cinematic enough to keep our interest, but realistic enough to resonate and stay true to life. It's a film that doesn't reach for the stars, doesn't feature a meaningful plot or story and doesn't convey some big message; rather, it's a film built on moments, beautiful and wonderful moments that make it so special: the narration, the song-and-dance number, Summer's glances at Tom and her reactions to his behavior, the dialogue, the two lead performances, the genuinely hilarious moments and jokes (I neglected to mention that the film is also really funny!) the music, the Belle and Sebastian and Smiths references, the non-linear chronology, the split-screen sequence showing Tom's ""expectations"" on one side and the ""reality"" as it actually unfolds on the other, the moments that just totally capture exactly what the real life situations they depict feel like, such as the aforementioned bar exterior, or the encounter on the train. It's one of those films that stays with you, that you want to go see again and again, to take that journey with the characters one more time, to get to know them even more, and to look into their lives and see so much of your own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I simply did not like it and do think it was over-rated.,"Movie itself made me fall asleep 3 times in the first 40 minutes of watching it. It could not hold my attention and quite honestly could not get the point of the movie. End result was confusion whether understanding or something new to learn. Inconsistencies in personalities of the girl which she seems had few, simply threw everything out of picture where he is simply begging her to be with him - she does not want it... dull moments are all over the movie and the end movie scene is - he meets another girl... kind of opening for another movie on the same dull moments and no original story.But hey, that's only my opinion - it seems critics liked it since it was nominated for awards...",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The Millennial Graduate...,"I don't know what makes ""(500) Days of Summer"" so compelling and fascinating, there's no secret recipe for that kind of effects.My guess is that with love stories, it all comes down to the way you relate to the struggles of one of the two protagonists (preferably both). Yes, the voice-over insists this is not a love story, but it is crueler than that: it's a one-sided one; and that I could relate to. On a pure personal level, the film -especially the final act- worked so well it was almost painful.Yes, not every love story ends happily. Yes, there are people who sneak into your life and before you know it, you start developing unprecedented symptoms. And at the end, you feel betrayed, cheated and hold a grudge against movies and their earn-your-happy-ending scam (that reminded me of Gena Rowlands' similar rant in ""Minnie and Moskowtiz""). Marc Webb's film doesn't try to tell you how love works, but why it doesn't. And that it sums it up with ""these things just happen"" without making it sound like a copout is perhaps the screenplay's most miraculous achievement.(And I refuse to believe it isn't a heartbreak that inspired either Scott Neustadter or Michael H. Weber)Now, the film isn't deprived of routine comedy tropes: you have the sidekick friends (Geoffrey Arendt and Ian Reed Kessler) who draw a fine line between cynical and dim-witted. You have the precocious kid played by a pre-""Kick Ass"" Chloe Grace Moretz, who delivers the kind of wisecracks worthy of someone thrice her age. You have some savvy musical interludes whose clip-like edge hide the sappiness in a way that would content the MTV generation. And you have some probably intentionally unsubtle homages to directors like Fellini and Bergman and an obsession with ""The Graduate"" (one of my all-time favorite) that plays like the ""Casablanca"" leitmotif for Harry and Sally.But even these stylistic touches are nothing compared to the incredible chemistry between Joseph Gordon Levitt as Tom and Zooey Deschanel as Summer. He's the average-looking boy who learned to develop a charm of his own, relying on humor because he has no athletic package to sell, and she's your bubbly, independent, free-spirited attractive girl-next-door who attract eyes like magnet. Their meet-cute moment couldn't have been truer-to-life, she overhears the music in his earphones, says she likes it and leaves him speechless... I could read his mind instantly. If at that moment, she asked him to marry her, he'd say ""yes"".The film then takes us to the 500-day journey of their relationship with days picked randomly to highlight the irregularity of meaningfulness in a couple, not every day is an emotional momentum and what's left for memories are either the happy or sad or angry moments: the little kiss, meeting friends, sensual intercourses in the Xerox room, traveling together, laughing and pretending to act like a couple, sex of course... with a constant warning sticker: she doesn't want to be anyone's girlfriend. Tom doesn't understand that this actually means she doesn't feel the 'heat' with him, but hanging on the illusion of ""things going well"", he tacitly consents to it.I could relate to Tom... to a degree. I understood his frustration when after getting punched for her, she didn't exactly demonstrate gratitude (what did he expect? ""My hero!"". In fact, the womanizer's line ""I can't believe he's your boyfriend"" might have hit a sensitive chord. There's just a limit to how many punch a man can take. And anyone who went through a heartbreak can see that this is a relationship that is doomed, except for the one who's right inside the tornado's eye.It is not a matter of good vs. Evil, rules of attraction are extremely capricious, there's no more reason for one love to be mutual than one to meet a soulmate in the next restaurant seat... and yet these things happen. Tom, like a Woody Allen younger alter ego, starts looking for signs and then for reasons, which amounts to the same. When the relationship is over, he blames it on the great Hollywood lie and the cult of positiveness. He quit his position at a greeting card company, feeling it would be hypocritical to pretend to inspire people where he's just lack faith.And somehow the film embodies that mission by not sticking to the 'happy ending' and committing a worse mistake; which would have been a reenactment of ""The Graduate"". ... not that the films ends on a happy note, but I liked the ending and its respect to our maturity. It basically made the very point of ""When Harry Met Sally"" before it contradicted it with the happy ending.It so happens that last week, I was recalling what it took for me to meet my ex-wife, it was at a convention and our stands were next to each other. Two years later, we had a child. Two years after, we had moved to her country. Four years later, she wanted a divorce. I found a new job to try to save my marriage and this is where I met my new companion. And I have a second child. And I'm still in another country. That's all it took... if I didn't go to that convention, or if I had picked another stand... my life would have been radically different... I didn't get it first but now, I do. It's one thing to be driven by love but not to take it for granted.I felt entitled. Tom felt entitled. That's the problem with us, millennials.I wish with all my heart that my actual relationship never ends but I know it can.. these things happen... I reconciled with that idea and stopped looking for excuses... that film is about a similar process of a millennial growing up and overcoming his disillusion through a reality-checked that was a failed love story.Well ""(500) Days for Summer"" might not be a love story but it's a great story about love.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Different Cinematic Romantic Drama That Scattered and Chaotic,"17 March 2010. This is a movie that attempts to be cute using a variety of animation, voice-over, split-screen, slow-mo, semi-documentary techniques along with an unusual jumping back and forth from future and past inserts that only results in a series of short-attention span, sound bite contemporary American skinny dipping into relational romance that almost destroys the essence of the deep and subtle, riveting emotional roller coaster of love as it is actually felt and experienced. The end scenes of this movie almost make up for the chaotic, choppy, jerky editing that really detracts from the potential for a more traditional romantic drama that could have been even more powerful because the edgy script in linear form was likely great to begin with. The unnecessary disjointed cinematic technique did not really serve to enhance the fundamental storyline. Many more romantic dramas exist that truly allow the audience a deeper and prolonged journey into this universal and powerful emotion and experience of love. I too know personally of a Summer and Autumn and I too have experienced the casual relational and the make up and break up and rejection and this movie while offering up glimpses of such lofty life experiences is no way reflects the deep rapture and darkness that it attempts to portray in the way it was directed and shot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
relationships comedy subverts the genre,"It would be misleading to call 500 a rom-com. At the very outset we are told, ""This is not a love story."" And so it proves to be, after a fashion, though it is not giving too much away to say boy gets girl, and girl gets boy.Tom is wannabee architect who has strayed from the path and needs to find his way back. Summer is a girl who does not believe in romantic love. Both will prove to be the essential catalyst for the other.So far so generic, but flashing in an ostensibly random fashion between the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship, the film achieves an episodic feel, while at the same time chronologically following the seduction, love gained, love lost, closure achieved pattern of so many other relationship movies. The jump-cutting between days also allows for some fun moments, most notably when Tom enters an elevator on top of the world and exits bitter and jaded. Kudos to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for the range of expressions he employs to pull this off. Zooey Deschanel stays mainly deadpan as Summer and it works, as the woman's thoughts and behaviour keep you slightly off-kilter.I smiled more than a few times. The song-and-dance sequence is ripped from Enchanted, and Bill Forsyth invented the older brother taking relationship advice from his primary-age sister in Gregory's Girl, but in a well-worn, tired genre, 500 manages to be fresh without appearing too contrived.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An unconventional romantic-comedy that breaks down the genre while maintaining a positive outlook.,"'(500) Days Of Summer (2009)' is an unconventional romantic-comedy that exists in its own little universe where one moment a dance number could break out and the next the feature could transform entirely into a pretentious French art flick. It's a story told wholly subjectively with an unreliable narrator who's in straight-up denial about the quality of his relationship. The movie breaks down the tropes of the genre it's a part of without ever feeling jaded or nihilistic, instead maintaining a positive outlook after breaking down the misconceptions perpetuated by years of media misleading. It ends up being a very enjoyable and endearing picture that isn't predictable at any point, one that finishes on an optimistic note where most pictures of the kind would think to begin. It certainly sits on the shoulders of its likeable lead performances and subtly witty screenplay, and works on numerous levels because of it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Terrific, Well-Made, and Very Romantic.","First off, with this film being led by Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon- Levitt, I had high expectations, and I can honestly say that it lived up to the expectations. The premise is extraordinary, and profound, however quite mature. The film focuses on a couple whose relationship is solely dedicated to intercourse, but end up having few moments of true unadulterated love. This is not to say that the film was a sex comedy, or for that matter a comedy. It was more of a drama, and it is quite sad in some parts, but none the less it is an amazing film. The acting is, as expected, superb. The script was very well written, and the film flowed very naturally and smooth. The points that it makes about love, and relationships are interesting and very original. The film is very psychological, and impressively toys with your emotions in a good way. Safe to say one of the best films to come out in a long time, and definitely worth the awards that it earned.

Rom Com for Non-NeoCons,"When a young gift card writer named Tom is introduced to his bosses assistant Summer Finn it's as though the woman of his dreams has walked into his life. But when what started out as a good thing begins to unravel due to differing views of their relationship, Tom soon realizes that he may have lost Summer for good. So when Tom attempts to devise a plan to win her back so begins the recollection of the 500 days of Summer.This is an entertaining film that imaginably most people could relate to in one way or another when dealing with the various situations that arise in relationships. The plot is very well written and uses many flashback sequences to reveal how the characters came into their current situations, and how they choose to handle them. The two main actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel work well together to create a story that is believable and more realistic than many other films in this genre.

Unusual realistic story ended like a fairy tale,"I find this movie instructive on the misinterpretation and overestimation of love. Dialogues are nicely written and both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel act decently in this one. The narrative is disjointed and there are embellishing touches by the director, such as black and white movie sequences, references to Ingmar Bergman's movies and interview sequences like in Agnès Varda's Sans Toi Ni Loi (1985).However, through the ending, the story was wrapping up so nicely when Tom began re-evaluating his relationship and discovered that Summer never truly loved him. But his final encounter with Summer in the park ruined everything in my opinion. It was a bit too much of a coincidence in the first place and, moreover, she told a stupid story in which some man approached her while she was reading a book in a cafe then she suddenly fell in love and got married just like that. This is complete nonsense!! Instead of such a fairy tale, I was expecting her to be honest and tell him she married the other guy because he was rich.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
My favorite horror movie,"I just watched this movie for the first time and all i can think is that the narrator is wrong. At the beginning of the movie he warns the audience that this is not a love story, but he's wrong. This movie is about the most real and raw love story of all time. It may not be what you think of when you think of a love story but it is. Love is messy, difficult, and sometimes not reciprocated back to you. Sometimes no matter how hard you want someone or something it doesn't work bc both people need to want the same thing with each other. I highly suggest watching this movie but don't be surprised if it leaves you feeling different than most love stories do. The ending leaves you feeling more human than any other movie i have watched. It is both depressing and hopeful. It shows that love is real. It may not be the wonderful easy go lucky type of love you think of but its real and whether things work out or not.

Quirky indie comedy is quirky!,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a mopey man in his early twenties, working a soulless job at a greeting card company. His life is pretty meaningless until he meets Zooey Deschanel. They share an affinity for The Smiths. They do zany things like pretend that Ikea is their personal living room and generally flirt with each other.It's a pretty good film overall, I was quite surprised I liked this. The writing was pretty sharp and Deschanel who is usually pretty annoying seemed to be a little more restrained in this movie. Gordon-Levitt is good as well. These are probably the types of movies he should be making instead of crap like Killshot where he was almost laughable as a petty criminal.Maybe this the movie which epitomizes everyone's early 20s or at least their post-university life. You want to tell Gordon-Levitt to stop being so damn mopey in this movie but there's really no hope, you know everyone has to go through something like this and he plays the role pretty well in this movie.The Graduate features prominently in the movie and with good reason because this movie is somewhat similar to that one. It also dealt with a mopey man out of college falling in love with the wrong girl.

500 Days of Summer: A Refreshing and Innovative Take on Love,"""500 Days of Summer"" is a refreshing and innovative take on the traditional romantic comedy genre. Unlike most movies of this kind, the film tells its story in a non-linear fashion, jumping back and forth between different points in the relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel). This unique storytelling approach adds depth and complexity to the characters and their relationship, making it feel more authentic and relatable.What sets ""500 Days of Summer"" apart from other rom-coms is its willingness to explore the messy and often painful aspects of falling in love. The movie doesn't shy away from the fact that relationships can be unpredictable, and that not every love story has a happy ending. This honesty and authenticity are what make the film so compelling and memorable.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are both perfectly cast in their roles, bringing a natural chemistry and charm to their performances. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of Tom is both funny and heartbreaking, while Deschanel's Summer is complex and enigmatic, making it hard to know what she's really thinking or feeling.Overall, ""500 Days of Summer"" is a must-see movie for anyone who's ever been in love.

She's very charming and quirky, which makes it easy to see why Tom is so smitten with her. Their chemistry is really believable, and it's fun to watch their relationship develop, even though you know from the start that it's not going to work out.The movie does a good job of mixing humor with the more serious parts of a relationship. I liked how it showed the reality of love not always being a fairy tale. The scene where Tom's expectations versus reality is shown side by side was particularly powerful and relatable.What I appreciated about ""500 Days of Summer"" is that it feels real. It doesn't sugarcoat things, and it shows that sometimes relationships just don't work out, no matter how much you want them to. It's not just a typical romantic comedy; it has more depth than that.Overall, I wouldn't say it's one of my all-time favorites, but it's definitely a good movie. It's well-acted, thoughtfully written, and has a unique way of telling the story. If you're looking for a romance that's a bit more realistic and not too sappy, I'd recommend giving ""500 Days of Summer"" a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Manic pixie dream girl subverted,"If you know a little bit about movies, your probably know the ""Manic pixie dream girl"" trope where a seemingly perfect, cute, quirky and adventurous girl spices up the life of our boring main character and then disappears.500 days of summer is what it would really be like to date such a girl. Summer is actually a realistic well portrait character and shows how a ""Manic pixie dream girl"" would actually act in real life. She is unreliable and spontaneous in ways to negatively effect our main character.But the best thing about this movie, I think, is how it is a good portrayal of actual relationships. There is no 1 person at fault for the break up. You cant blame Summer for not wanting the commitment, after all she blatantly made that clear. Tom is the one projecting his need for romance onto her.I love how during the times I watched this my natural instinct was to side with Tom, but the older I got I realised that Summer was not the villain. She was just her own person and not there to make Tom's boring life good for him",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great movie! All you need is some relatable life moments!!,I loved the movie. Especially the ending. I saw this movie as piece of some poetry which got wasted in all of its lines but the last line told me that where can you start your next poem. Life goes on even if you feel it ends. You gotta move along thats life. Great message with full of pure emotions and feelings. Loved it!!,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Ugly Truth of Love,"I like Zooey Deschannel. Never watched her movie before, but I like her huge eyes, innocent face, the suitable hair do. When I moved my TV channel randomly, I found there were '500 Summer', and Zooey became the lead actress. Wow, I have to watch it! In the beginning of the movie, we were warn : this not a love story. Then what? But I still watch it, since Zooey in the movie. And, what's more attracted me with the appearance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Why his name so familiar? and of course, his face. When every scene, described as what days in those 500 hundred days, I just knew this was not an ordinary movie. This was something!The scene opened when Summer Finn became new employee at Tom Hansen's office. Tom just grabbed with Summer's beauty and interested to know her better. In karaoke night after office hour, Paul reveal to Summer that seems Tom fancy her. By that time Summer and Tom become getting closer, they spent much time together. They were very closed, but there was no official statement what kind of relationship they had. But Tom, officially, in love with Summer and assumed they had something, while Summer? No, she still tag Tom as her friend. They have floating relation, as Tom find out is there any possibility he and Summer become a couple as he wish?What I love about this movie is the right lighting and beautiful images. It was in sepia color, made romantic ambiance. and don't forget about the playful narrator, and lesson we can take in love matter. Punch me hard and slap my cheek, instantly. :)) You can keep quotes of this movie, to remind you, love is not like a fairy tale, but love is still, something beautiful to fight for. Oh yes, have to noted about Rachel Hansen here. a 12-year old girl, Tom sister, giving him advice in romance. :)) Overall, really recommend movie to watch. :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One big mess,"As someone else has commented I now realise how little credibility IMDb scores really have.Having endured the excruciatingly tedious mess of this film I also wonder what kind of critical faculties people bring to watching films. While I know that we the general public are dubious in our ability to separate good from bad , one would expect the critics to put us straight. When the lead ""adult"" shows less emotional maturity than his 11 year old sister you know you are in trouble. The film irritatingly flips through the scenes of a relationship with an attending cast one would happily avoid any contact with.The bewildering array of sub-themes, introduced and just as quickly dropped, the 1960s, art house films, architecture etc. just add to the confusion of the hotchpotch plot.As a film I would struggle to give it 5, as an experience it is really one I wish I had avoided. Extremely disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Quirky but enjoyable,"If you like romantic comedies, this is an unusual take on standard themes. It employs jumbled-up flashbacks, along with many other techniques, to describe the ups and downs of a young man's 500-day love affair with a girl. It quickly becomes apparent that he is head-over-heels, but she is somewhat cool and unwilling to commit herself to a full-on relationship, though she also likes him a lot. She is quite selfish really. Much of the movie's charm comes from the contrast between his puppy-dog eagerness, and her enigmatic aloofness. She is brilliantly played by Zooey Deschamel, I defy any guy not to fall in love with this girl. The male character played by Joeseph Gordon Levitt (3rd rock from the sun), has to endure a lot of frustration and sadness; however the film never loses its light, playful, upbeat character.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I know what you did with Summer... and vice versa,"This movie is a nice romantic - yet realistic - comedy drama, with the ending different from similar movies. It non-linear narrative structure, with comparisons and flashbacks, provides the movie additional value, and yet it runs smoothly. = Good writing and directing! Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen and Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn - the main stars - are brilliant and their characters are realistic and convincing; such attitudes towards love, relationship, commitment etc. are common among many younger people. And the choice of music is masterful.Together with Paul Dano and Anton Yelchin, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is among the best young contemporary male actors. All movies with their participation - due to the performers' versatility - are pleasant and catchy to watch, remember this! :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perfect Portrayal Of Love And Love Lost!!,"First of all i want to start by saying i judge every film i watch by how it makes me feel when the film ends and them credits roll up, and with 500 days of summer i felt every emotion possible along the films Fantastic Journey! The Film tells the story of Tom Hansen(Gordan Levitt)a trained architect who works as a writer at a greeting card company, Tom (a hopeless romantic) doesn't believe he will ever truly be happy (much like myself) until he meets the girl of his dreams or the one! Tom thinks hes found that in Summer Finn (Deschanel) the new assistant to his boss at work.The rest of the film follows from Toms perspective as he falls deeper and deeper in love with Summer who consistently tells tom she doesn't want to label there relationship and believe's love to be fantasy.All i can do is encourage you to watch this film as it really is the perfect portrayal of love and love lost in every way. Everything from the Amazing Soundtrack to the Brilliantly believability of Deschanel and Levitts relationship, also the Fantastic Director skills of Marc Webbs in his first film!!! 500 Days Of Summer is the best and most realistic version of the trials and tribulations of love that i have ever seen and anybody who has ever been in love will appreciate this film, 10 out of 10 from me Fantastic.This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront... This is not a love story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Realistic romantic comedy,It has been the most realistic romantic comedy movie I've seen for a long time. It both laughs and entertains. He also gives lectures. What more can a movie do?,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
w-o-w good stuff,"This movie is so good, extremely well written also.The scene where Tom defends Summer's ""honor"" and she is less than impressed by his actions is the breaking point in the relationship in my view. Summer sees Tom being brave for her but not for himself (work)....For the most part the gender roles are reversed here with the female being the strong one and the male being lead on a leash. With the exception being Summer's honestly, and Tom's vanity (once she knows me her mind will change).Tom never does anything wrong, like a lot of us, however he lacks that wow factor and by being more into her than she is to him the pain he feels we feel like is our own because he deserves more than he is getting (emotionally at least). Wanting someone and them wanting you is different than wanting someone and them putting up with you, which so frequently happens. The reality of this film is astounding and at a minimum at primer for life in the big city.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This Movie Is One of the Musts!,"What I look for a realistic drama movies is sincerity. I mean I just have to feel some sort of a little touch to my heart then I decide that I am literally enjoying it.This little pathway that lead to my heart is mostly made of acting so proffesional, the details of the plot and most importantly CASTING.Good casting leads to comfortable and proffesional acting then it leads to have sincerity.And this movie, man. The most touchy movie of all time. Enjoyed it, liked it, all of the actors are beatitful. The producing was so proffesional too tho.

Fail,"I thought about filling up 10 lines with all the synonyms for cliché but that would have been way more clever than this movie deserves.In an earlier review someone said that they would put this in their movie collection next to Harry met Sally and thats where it belongs. In the trash next to it anyway. If thats all you want from a movie this one is for you. First of all it was not a bit funny. Not once in the movie did i laugh. The writers tried to be clever but never got past cliché. His friends have no depth what so ever. They were played by good actors but since they were nothing more than props their antics seemed embarrassing at best. She, according to the premise was supposed to be a head turner. Yeah in prison maybe. Not in real life. She is constantly telling him she does not want a relationship but he wont listen which makes him seem like a moron. A waste of talent. A waste of time. a waste of money.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Quite Unique,"This movie is like a book with jumbled pages. This is quite a unique style/concept of presenting a movie. The director & editor have done thoughtful work on this. It's got some great performances. Equally good dialog. Some very nicely pictured romantic moments. Some lovely & situational songs. Nice & Interesting story. All in all, every possible element of an ""awesome"" movie is in it. It's not just a story of ""boy meets Gal"". It explored many possible events – which occurs before/in/after love.

500 Days of Summer,"This story depicts a relationship between a young man, Tom and a young woman, Summer in 500 days. Tom gets to like Summer in spite of her capricious personality.My first impression of the film is that Tom is always twisted around by Summer's little finger, so I thought the story ordinary love story at first. Though their relationship is not true, I was getting fascinated by their performance. Zooey Deschanel performs not only a pretty girl but also a selfish girl very well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also good actor. However the ending of the film is beyond my imagination. I was very disappointed at the ending,but it is a new kind of the ending of love story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Scariest movie I've ever seen.,"500 Days of Summer is a chilling psychological exploration of love gone wrong, reimagined as a horror story. Told through the fragmented memories of Tom, the film becomes a haunting descent into obsession and heartbreak. Summer's seemingly innocent charm takes on a sinister edge, leaving Tom trapped in a web of emotional manipulation and unfulfilled expectations. The nonlinear structure mirrors a fractured psyche, blurring reality and delusion. With its eerie soundtrack and unsettling moments of realization, it transforms the familiar romantic narrative into a slow-burn horror tale about the terrors of unreciprocated love. A hauntingly effective twist on the genre. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Promising beginning becomes an utter bore,"This films begins well. A nice light romantic type film with each character evolving as the film progresses. The two lead actors kept me interested for the first 30 minutes. However, half way through the movie I kept thinking 'this guy is pathetic' and 'she is a real pain in the ass'. I still think that Zooey Deschanel is a fine actress and a very attractive woman but I simply wanted to strangle her during the course of this movie. I would have DUMPED HER in a heartbeat!! The friends of the male lead have been done to death so many times before, goofy, nerdy pals asking the usual sexual type questions at the beginning of the relationship but also there to provide the support when things go wrong. The use of the little sister as the counsel for the male lead (and his dopey mates) only made his character seem more pathetic.I did expect some kind of comedy to emerge but no, it became mindless romantic dribble that made it very difficult to stay awake.

Honest,"I think honest is the best way to describe this movie. It shows the reality that is love, it can be great, it can be sad.

"An extremely funny, cool, unrealistic, slightly depressing but honest romantic comedy very much of it's time","I liked the unrequited love title of another reviewer, and the fact it subverts romantic comedies, with the male (Tom) as the lover of Summer, whos more the aloof, uninterested man.The movie comes from Tom's perspective, Summer does not come across well, but neither does Tom. He does not, and is not learning to want the best for her and seeing her for who she is, but rather what he wants her to be. There is a lesson there.The film is creative, with different filming techniques with every one used working well. The wit and humour is always funny, and the supporting characters are enough if nothing more.The jumping around of timeline does not work well, even if essential to the story. The jokes and humour are crude, and even the hint that Summer is bisexual seems weird and out upon.Watch this film - its honest but not accurate, and not applicable to you. Although living up then, the 2000s were a special time. This film captures the best of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""What Are We Doing?""","This story follows a relationship between Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), which begins on the first day she joins the greeting card firm where Tom works. That is Day 1. He falls for her quickly. She likes him, but does not believe in love. As they get closer, things get more confusing for him.This film is told from Tom's view. We meet his friends and his sister, Rachel ( Chloe Grace Moretz), all of whom give him advice along the way. The narrative is not chronological, making connections between events that happen on non-contiguous days.Though the story is told through Tom's eyes, the tone of the film is dictated by Summer's personality. She is quirky and low-key. Perhaps if another actress had played the role (say, Mila Kunis), the film would have a different energy.Also influencing the energy are the pop songs interspersed. And the script includes moments of fantasy---like montages, daydreams, and fictional film clips---that provide clues to Tom's frame of mind.In the end, this is a film about love and fate. Some viewers may find it hopeful, while others may consider it discouraging.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Fantastic & Misunderstood,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I remember watching it the first time and completely missing the message it was trying to portray. Tom perfectly encapsulates my dating life and the toxic traits I've spent my whole life trying to shed. I've always looked for ""the one"" and made the same mistakes the protagonist makes. Summer is also very flawed but she has continued to grow on me after every re-watch and I think most people misunderstand who the wrong person is in the film. Beyond that, this is just a beautiful movie and an unorthodox romantic tale that doesn't end how most rom-coms in Hollywood finish. The acting was great and the soundtrack goes so well with each scene. 5/5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Self-conscious and stylistic, yet engaging, funny and fresh","Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an unashamed romantic, yet feels unfulfilled churning out simple sentiments as a writer for a greeting card firm. One day, new co-worker Summer (Zooey Deschanel) overhears him listening to The Smiths, a band whom they share a passion for. Summer likes Tom. Tom loves Summer. Summer will never love Tom.What makes this tale of unrequited love so interesting is its telling. The five hundred days of the title refer to the time-span of Tom's feelings for Summer, beginning before and continuing after their affair. The screenplay hops back and forth between various 'days', creating a clever little puzzle of the build-up and breakdown of a relationship. On 'Day 282', for example, Tom refers to a cutesy in-joke he shared with Summer at the height of their romance; she responds impassively. The scene promptly jumps back to 'Day 34' and the birth of this joke, a moment as intimate as they'd ever share. It's an interesting structural ploy, and the various contrasts and ambiguities it brings to the fore reflect Tom's post-break-up obsessive poring over his days with Summer.Director Marc Webb does a fine job of keeping such an erratic structure feeling smooth, adeptly conveying exhilaration and heartache, often within a single scene. His credentials as a former music video director are evident; the film is stylistic, if not quite stylish, as Webb employs a plethora of slick visual tricks to convey the headiness and confusion of romance.Gordon-Levitt adds a more lightweight lead to his roster of rogues. Tom is likable, if not charismatic; injured, rather than damaged. Like the film, his performance is well-pitched and endearing, but in no danger of topping his staggering work in Brick and Mysterious Skin. He invests Tom with just the right amount of vulnerability; his very slight awkwardness leavens rather than encumbers the screenplay's deconstruction of neurosis. He makes for a refreshingly believable romantic lead in the nerdy wish-fulfilment era of Cera.Deschanel is similarly well-cast. She surveys everything with a detached demeanour that is at odds with her big bright eyes. The blending of her lovely features with her disaffected drawl is a potent mix, and makes Summer a devastating force for the men around her. Inverting her typecast role, it's nice to see Deschanel offering us a glimpse of the void beneath the (vaguely irritating) quirky surface.While the synopsis might suggest an anti-romance movie- the film itself opens with such a claim- the bitterness, like the titular time-span, is bracketed. The film is ultimately hopeful, always entertaining and frequently funny.But like every melancholic Smiths fan, one can't help but feel the urge to take it down a peg or two. The intermittent use of an unnamed narrator is jarring and superfluous, while the indie soundtrack is relentless, pervading almost every scene. 'Just because someone shares your interests, doesn't make them your soul-mate', Tom's wise-beyond-her-years younger sister intones (a cloying cliché of a character, admittedly, but her scenes make for some of the film's funniest moments). The filmmakers should take this advice, and resist the need to define their film and connect with their audience with the aid of a mix-tape.Aside from these criticisms, the movie hits all the right notes- and what higher praise could be given of a romantic-comedy, the genre of comfort? It evokes effectively the turbulence of love through an engaging structure, and is anchored by another fine performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Unsweetened (No Sugar Coating); The Most Honest Romantic Movie in my Opinion,"500 days of summer is probably the first in a romantic genre to earn a near-perfect score in my favourite list. It has the perfect, unconventional and almost totally un-clichéd method of telling a love story, which by the way is perhaps the most truthful description of the complexities surrounding relationships with a high failure probability in the end.I also truly salute some of the statements made in this movie -- some examples being the blame on the materialistic nature of the modern world for casting a plastic veil on the integrity of love and why fate is not what it is -- they were so boldly made because they are definite taboos to be mentioned in other romantic movies! Not to mention the ending is probably one of the best i have seen in years! Well, to fall in love with a movie that shows love does not always win but it is not an emotional sore loser either, as one moves on with life from the experience as a better person. Perhaps I may be among the rare breed that feels this is the most honest romantic movie yet.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front this is not a love story.,"This isn't your typical romantic comedy; it could be seen as an unconventional take on the genre. It diverges from many traditional rom-com elements, given that one character embraces love while the other rejects it, and this is where the protagonist faces their central dilemma.The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zoey Deschanel, and their on-screen chemistry is simply remarkable. These exceptionally talented actors have dedicated their lives to honing their craft, and their expertise shines through in this performance. Interestingly, they've previously shared the screen in romantic scenes during their earlier years in the film ""Manic"" (2001).The acting in this film is superb. The story, while occasionally jumping back and forth in time, enhances the narrative's overall flow and provides a deeper understanding of the story.

Fascinating!,"I heard so much positive things about this movie that I never got around to it until the trailers made me wanna see it. Out of curiosity, I bought a DVD copy and it was worth my $3!

Joseph Gordon Levitt is perfectly cast and has a great screen presence. The writing is witty and quirky, which I really thought was a smart move for the filmmakers.

I am astonished; I am literally on the ground, amidst many tears and laughter, and to what extent this film has placed me and left me here with all my thoughts, floating yet so centered within my heart and mind.In total summary, as in the title, I am definitely in love, and this is without a doubt one of the films of my life. I am still speechless to describe how much this is affecting me!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Last half hour was OK,"but I was so disappointed with the rest of the film. I was really looking forward to a treat after reading the glowing reviews on here. Something right up there with Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind in terms of insight fullness regarding relationships. Sadly, it was bland & without any impact. There was no chemistry between the main characters & it was hard to find anything lovable about Summer. She, & the relationship, was just so 2D. I feel the premise of the story was good but the opportunity was utterly squandered. The last 25 mins was much better, as if the director had finally got into his stride, but it really wasn't worth the toe-fidgeting boredom of the 1st hour. The girl who played the kid sister was good, engaging, & worthy of better parts. All in all a big flop for me.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A surprisingly realistic love story.,"this is probably one of the most realistic love stories i have ever seen. first off, you can't help but love zooey deschanel in anything she does. especially in this movie, where she plays summer finn, a realistic woman who doesn't believe in love, who thinks believing in love is like believing in santa claus. and then there's her better half, tom hensen, who never thought he would meet ""the one"" until summer came along.and the movie jumps from day one of their relationship, to the end of it. you get the idea how the movie is going to end when you walk into it, with the narrator (who sounds like freaking james earl jones for chrissake) tells you that what you're about to see isn't a love story, but a story about love. same thing? i think not.the movie is essentially about unrequited love. it's about the missed opportunities. the things that don't work out. it's a comedy, but it covers all of these depressing topics. and that's what i like most about it. as described best in the showtime series weeds, a story can be intensely dramatic and depressing, but have inexplicably hilarious moments that coincide better than you would imagine.it's a movie that's both emotionally devastating and hopeful. it reminds me of something of a cross between the movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and garden state. it's a rare film that displays completely fabulous acting, and it's not just your average love story. it doesn't have a beginning and an ending. it jumps in an indistinct order between the five hundred days of their relationship. and when their relationship is in its heyday, there's a choreographed dance sequence, not unlike the scene in the 2007 film enchanted. and it shows events in an incredibly depressing, but completely true-to-life way, where there's a split screen, one side, what's really happening in that moment, and the other side, what the character tom wanted to happen. and when we're in love, we find ourselves doing things like this.so what can i say about this movie? everything is fantastic, the acting (especially the beautiful zooey deschanel), the writing, and the way the story is told, it's one of the best movies i've seen in 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not at all what I expected.  What a terrific film this turned out to be.,"I came in the theater with no expectations and I have to admit that when I walked out, I was totally blown away by this movie; it was a sensational film!I'm a film maker so I can appreciate a film from many different viewpoints such as editing, photography, directing, etc, and this was a dream team that all came together to make the most unusual and wonderful rom-com that I have ever seen. The D.P. was incredible, the directing was ingenious, the editing was superb. I just don't have enough superlatives for this film. This was truly movie-making at its best.And we haven't even talked about the actors. They were all excellent, but especially Zoey. Wow, she just stood out. This was her shining moment. If she doesn't get some kind of award for her acting, I would be very surprised. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and see it and if you don't think this is creativity at its best, email me and I'll buy you dinner.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
charming and superbly intelligent,"This is one great little movie. It exceeded my expectations and I could feel that the entire room was moved and intrigued as well. It is superbly written, directed and acted. And the soundtrack is awesome too. It is not really a comedy at all. Very highly recommended, though I am not sure if with your partner - only if you are sure one of another!:) The Zoey Deschanel is one fascinating young actress, charming and one of a kind, with gorgeous eyes and sparkling intelligence. One little detail in the script that I found a tad too much was the fact the girl at the end is called Autumn. That was too unlikely and smacked of a too-cute-too be true finale. Besides, she is drop dead gorgeous and also into our hero, what are the odds of that in real life? But apart from that overly optimistic bit the script is excellent, fresh, witty, smart or even profound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
this movie knew how to win over any other recent romance film,"Why was this movie so terrific? Aside from the fact that it was incredibly sincere in its realism while at the same time being very stylistic, it was great for its relevance to romantic experiences.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is such a talent to be cherished? Why is this guy so much more on my respect level than all these other young actors working in Hollywood. Not only does Gordon- Levitt pick movies that have more emphasis in being a good story than being heavily promoted, he is willing to play characters that don't necessarily make himself look like a superstar. He is brave enough to play a part in which he would have to be very insecure in front of massive audiences. For that I commend him.(500) Days is so successful in humor, replicating real emotions and situations and making people (me at least) recall memories of our own. It has countless parts I cannot stop thinking about and laughing over. It is really wonderful. An unexpected film in a summer filled with high budget action films that can't quite get universal praise.For this being the first season the Academy nominates 10 films for the big Oscar, and considering they have nominated past films like Little Miss Sunshine and Juno, they BETTER nominate this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Brilliant Romantic Comedy,"I had high expectations for this film as I have enjoyed Joseph and Zooey's previous work and they didn't disappoint.It is a simple concept for a film, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl but girl doesn't believe in love, but it is pulled off fabulously by the leads, Joseph Gordon-Levit and Zooey Deschanel, who are as quirky as ever.The director, Marc Webb, uses a non-linear story of high and low moments to map together the 500 days of Tom's very unusual relationship with Summer. It is both funny and interesting and it always keeps you guessing what is going to come next.500 Days of Summer is one of the best films I have seen this year and definitely one of the best romantic comedies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing,"(500) Days of Summer had its happy moments, a ton of them. It also had its sad moments. But overall, i call it a masterpiece. It had an amazing script, one of the best movie soundtracks, and a great cast. All the roles are well played and not over acted. It was perfect, and couldn't get any better! In addition to all the romance, (500) Days of Summer also had its hilarious, laugh out loud moments.Sure the movie is a little hard to come across, because of it release in selected theaters, but I hunted it down, drove an hour to watch it, and absolutely and completely loved it and found the trouble worth it.

"An absolute gem of a movie.  Hilarious and true, it should resonate with anyone.","""This is not a love story. This is a story about love."" The following quote is too true about this film, and is the perfect description of it. ""500 Days Of Summer"" is a wonderful tale about love, loss, heartbreak, and dealing with those emotions. The story is beautifully told through one of the most original and captivating scripts of the year, and carried by the phenomenal breakout performance of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I don't really think I've ever seen a movie, or an actor, capture the emotions as well as this movie and its star do.There's no question that this film is the breakout indie comedy of 2009, like ""In Bruges"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"", ""Juno"", and ""Sideways"" before it. But the question is, why is it that movie? Like those movies listed above, ""500 Days Of Summer"" is so realistic and true in its approach that it never feels redundant or clichéd, despite being in the most formulaic and clichéd genre of film. Whether its approach be comedic, tragic, or just all out absurd (wait for the musical number!), ""500 Days Of Summer"" hits every note with perfection, whether or not the audience will like what they see.There are those who simply know Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the kid from ""Angels In the Outfield"" or ""3rd Rock From the Sun"", but from now on, this will be what he's remembered for until he tops this (which, with his talent, is definitely going to happen). Gordon-Levitt's tactful and emotional take showed me something I rarely see: the ability to connect with each audience member on a personal level. It's one of the most emotionally stirring performance I've seen in many years. Throughout the film, I knew I was watching some of the best acting of the year because I not only recognized similar events that occur throughout Tom's relationship with Summer, but I remember feeling exactly what Gordon-Levitt portrays on screen. He really is a gem of an actor that should be watched for years to come (this is of course, something I've been saying for years, (but no one seemed to listen). An Oscar nomination is not out of the question here.I don't know if it was just me and my date, but Zooey Deschanel's performance, while good, seemed more like the script being tailor made to her abilities as an actress. In short, her performance was enjoyable, and at times adorable, but I've seen her do the same thing in almost every role she's played, especially in ""Elf"" and ""Yes Man"" (in fact, her take on Summer is nearly identical to her performance in ""Yes Man""). I just don't think I'm as enamored with her as everyone else, but in no way does she detract from the film at all.Perhaps the only romantic comedy cliché that is present here is the strength of the supporting cast, who I loved. I couldn't get enough of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's friend McKenzie, as he delivers some of the movie's funniest moments (and trust me, there are plenty, especially in the beginning and middle). Clark Gregg hits all the right notes, while Chloe Moretz is the sometimes hilariously great voice of reason that is Tom's little sister. Cameos from Minka Kelly and Ian Reed Kesler are also very well done.If I had to pick out some problems, which would be nitpicking, I'd say that the movie is really short. With a story that literally encompasses 500 days (which are conveniently all in the same season...well, I guess that's Los Angeles for you), you'd think they'd need a little more time to cover it, as the film runs under 2 hours even with previews. I also didn't necessarily like a turn the script took later in the film, but it made sense and worked in the end, so it's really a non-issue.Back to the things I liked about this one. There's a great amount of laughter and smiles in this movie, despite it taking a very serious tone towards the end. My face hurt from smiling so much. I also really loved the music, whether it was the composed music or the songs used throughout. This is a very stylish movie that, like ""Juno"" and ""Garden State"" before it, should spawn a bit of a mini-cult of people emulating the style (I know I want Tom's wardrobe). It's a good natured movie that will bring out your emotions and make you think about love in general, and how you've experienced it. It really is a crowd pleaser at its core, even if it's not a typical crowd pleaser.A question a lot of people might have is, ""is this a good date movie?"". The answer is yes, but only if that date is someone you genuinely care about and/or - shocker here - love. It's not something you want to take someone to unless you know them well enough to see a movie like this, because...remember, it's not a love story, it's a story about love. In fact, it may be the best romance film I've seen in many years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Love it Love it Love it!,"I love this movie for so many reasons. Where do I begin, and I'll try to keep it short...First, the characters. They are just so funny and adorable. You can't help but fall in love with them (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, all grown up and totally swoon worthy! Wonder if he likes tall brunettes? ha ha). They are just characters that you can totally relate to in one way or another. They do normal things like go to Ikea, it's not over the top romantic cheese ball story like all of the others that have come out in recent years. It actually has story lines that mimic real life events. I must say, Tom (Joseph) stole the show! And Summer (Zoe), like always, just plain adorable. In my personal opinion, the best style in Hollywood right now!Second. I love the way that this movie jumps around. It doesn't get boring at all, it is a constant look back and forward in the many stages of this ""relationship"" between the two main characters. It's just refreshing to have a movie that isn't the typical boy meets girl, boy dates girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back, happy ending, roll credits. It went from sad to happy, to funny to all of the in between emotions that come with a budding relationship. And in the end, even though things don't turn out how they normally do in the typical Hollywood movie, it was a fantastic ending to a real life look into the world of dating, falling in love and getting your heart broken.Third. I'm going to buy it the first day it comes out on DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Los Angeles never looked that much like New York,"A great comedy with some minor flaws evenly distributed over the entire length of the film. What fascinated me more than the characters and the action, however, was the locale. Is that really Los Angeles? I wondered every other minute. I have seen downtown L.A., but I have never seen it like that in a movie. All clichés of Southern California are avoided, even in the wedding scene that probably takes place in Santa Barbara (given the train ride and its direction). No beaches, no athletic bodies in sexy outfits, no suntans, hardly any palm trees. Even the final scene, though representing the quintessential cliché happy ending and featuring the only female of outstanding beauty, looks unfamiliar because of its setting in that vintage office building. There is something New-Yorkish about this movie. Some have likened it to Woody Allen, maybe for a reason, but Tom is not really a Woody Allen character--he makes no reference to the Nazis, for instance, and if he is Jewish, it does not matter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
(500) Days of Summer was a nice surprise of a summer relationship movie,"Today, I watched this indie rom-com with my sister before she goes back to her home in Maryland and my best friend who works at this movie theatre showing this film which as a result we all got to see for free. My theatre friend thought it was just okay while my sister loved it while I mostly liked it. There's plenty of amusing scenes between the leads Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel not to mention many heartbreaking ones too. One of the most entertaining ones was the Hall and Oates ""You Make My Dreams"" number that Gordon-Levitt and others dance to with an animated bird that surprised me. Part of me thought Joseph's conversations with that little girl was a bit pretentious. Still, the back and forth of many sequences and the way things end up is enough for me to recommend (500) Days of Summer. P.S. Once again, it's nice to see Clark Gregg outside of his regular role in ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
(500) Days of Summer,"It's an simply she is not that into him comedy. Before watching the film, I cannot stop thinking that what makes this highly-praised indie film of 2009 so unique as its synopsis sounds really banal. Nevertheless after I finish the film, I do love it from the bottom of my heart and it turns out quite educational for most lovers as well.In order to make this ultra-predictable story more delicious and attractive, director Marc Webb has offered us multiple levels of distractions, including the whole random narrative order, the reality/expectation split-screen shots and even animations, which shows that the team behind do esteem their audiences. I think it is also an important reason why Marc has been selected as the director of the upcoming Spider Man IV, as he knows very well how to please the audience and respect them at the same time.Also the success of this film is largely owing to two protagonists' wonderful performances, especially for Joseph, I would give him an Oscar nomination if I was could, unfortunately the Academy members generally overlook this kind of light films. The chemistry between Joseph and Zooey are amazing and sincere, as if they just revert themselves to their authentic lives, sometimes the effect is heartrending, which was like a mirror, everyone could see himself/herself through the film.One of my recurring argument is that it is very difficult to find a great script nowadays, which doesn't mean one could not be able to shoot a great film, ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a perfect example, even with a totally mundane story with a suspense-free script, if only one is conscientious and determined, he still can make a film unique and enjoyable, I think the esteem towards the massive audience is the main factor, which barely can be found in most of recent films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"stay home and read, have $ex or a nap...","Hmmm... Hard to imagine so many people were taken in by this over-calculated, over-worked and relatively minor film. I'm not saying it's the worst thing I have ever seen... there are a few humorous moments, but... here's the thing: I would seriously doubt it if >1% of attendees of this movie will remember it's title or existence a year from now. I like chick-flicks immensely, but there really seemed little meaningful content with a lot of stilted dialog and characters. The wise-beyond-her-years sister? Come on... The friends who have no real idea what the main character is going through? Again, nothing new and really poorly done. About the most interesting aspect of the movie is its chronology, narrator and change of hearts. J-G Levitt (playing the lead role) could easily have handled a far more demanding script. His portrayal of Tom is certainly within reason. Summer Fin's character is more complex and competently handled by Zooey Deschanel. Often trite and empty dialog that is over-baked simply can't result in a good movie, let alone a great one.

"A refreshing, quirky romantic comedy.","(500) Days of Summer is a truly original and refreshing romantic comedy, that feels straight from the heart and relative to almost any audience. Every character, whether it be Gordon-Levitt's embarrassing drunk workmate or the quirky, totally unpredictable Summer herself, feels utterly authentic and any viewer should be able to relate back to the people they know. As well as a stand-out performance from Gordon-Levitt, the movie also offers a number of the year's most memorable and unique scenes. Expectation/Reality is a heartbreaking, perfectly edited split-screen sequence that dashes Gordon-Levitt's hopes of regaining Deschanel's love after they split. The film also perfectly captures that ""first love"" feeling of being on cloud nine with the hysterical dance sequence.Overall, the film is as unique and vibrant as the character of Summer herself, and for a film fitting the description of ""romantic comedy"" in this current cinematic climate, that's some feat indeed.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Not your usual rom-com,"Eight years after starring together in Manic, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt re-team in this offbeat romantic comedy/drama about a woman who doesn't believe true love exists and the young man who falls for her. Let me cut right to the chase -- this is one of my favorite movies so far this summer. It's everything those usually weak romantic comedies are not (see The Ugly Truth review via link below). It's smart, it's unpredictable, it's enjoyable. I had a smile on my face from the opening narrative -- when a voice-over proclaims, ""this is a story of boy meets girl...but it's not a love story.""The film moves in a non-linear fashion from the perspective of greeting card designer Tom(Gordon-Levitt) who falls for his new co-worker, Summer (Deschanel).Over the span of 500 days of their relationship, Tom goes from ecstatic giddiness one moment (even indulging in a classic fantasy song and dance sequence at one point) to crippling depression the next. The question is -- will everything work out and end neatly wrapped-up as most Hollywood endings do? I highly recommend you see for yourself.Gordon-Levitt (Mysterious Skin) proves once again that he has mastered the uneasy transition from child star to adult roles. And Deschanel (so wooden in The Happening) is growing on me -- her quirkiness is definitely better suited for comedies than straight-up drama. But I was most amazed to learn that this is director Marc Webb's first motion picture. Webb, a music video and short film director, does a masterful job in this lyrical portrait of why and how we try so hard to make sense of love.Grade: A-; I review movies @ http://movies-TV-entertainment.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
More than just a worthy successor to High Fidelity,"Reviewing my favorite movie of all time is insanely challenging. Mostly because I don't know what to write about and how much to leave for you to find out. Anyway, I will give it a try simply because this is an amazing movie and shockingly few people have even heard about it. I feel morally obligated to do this! Synopsis : Tom Hansen, played by JGL, is a greeting card writer and is convinced that there is a difference between believing in true love and Santa Claus. Summer Finn, played by Zooey, joins the greeting card company and hits it off with Tom. In between songs performed by Simon & Garfunkel, The Smiths, Regina Spektor and even Carla Bruni, Tom lives through 500 days, some with and some without Summer. No spoilers here since the film's tagline itself reads out, ""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl Doesn't"".What's Good : Right during the film's opening, the narrator sets up the intrigue by clarifying, ""This is a movie about Boy meets Girl. But you should know upfront – this is not a love story."" The movie does not always move in chronological order, which is a very clever screenplay device for portraying pre and post-Summer Tom. The leads are charming and very convincing as twenty-somethings not sure of what they're looking for in life, or love. Their characters are disarmingly likable, have their endearing quirks – and I will go out on a limb and say that its impossible to not fall in love with them. Also of note is the music featured throughout the movie – mostly 60s and 70s British pop but also newer, little known bands like Mumm-Ra, Doves and Temper Trap. Oh and there's also an amazingly choreographed little dance number on JGL.Whats not : Tom's younger sister, played by, Chloe Grace Moretz plays on the wise-beyond-her-years cliché for far too long.There are many things unique to this movie. This, to me, was the most humorous movie of the last 5 years and yet it didn't seem forced like The Hangover. And yet, before the climax its hard to not feel for Tom. There are also a couple of scenes (one being ""expectations v/s reality"") which portray things each one of us goes through everyday and its amazing how well its been played out in the movie.It has a lot of similarities with High Fidelity (break-up movie, 70s music, hero is interested in architecture etc), which is another stupendous rom-com but this one's more grown-up and subtle.Verdict : You will either really like it or you may really hate it :) My Rating : 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Trying so hard it only occasionally works,"Hipster romance/break-up flick starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. At its best, it can be either sweet and insightful or downright heartbreaking. Too bad its best comes around only rarely. Most of the film is made up of wannabe clever moments that make it come off as overly cutesy. Among the aspects the film should have dumped to the wayside: the precocious little sister, the completely useless and unfunny best friends, the constant references to indie music and attempts to win indie cred, the Hall & Oates musical number (an ironic wink to the same people who will swoon over the rest of the soundtrack), the quirky greeting card company and, probably most notably, the final sequence. After excising all that, the film would only run about 45 minutes. About the only bit of cleverness that works is a split scene sequence where, the first time Gordon-Levitt is meeting with Deschanel after their big break-up, his expectations play out in real time against what actually happens. That could have backfired, as so much of the rest of the film does, but Webb directs it so well that the end result is devastating. This happens near the end of the film, and for a while it felt like it was jettisoning cutesiness for real emotion. And then comes the final sequence, which is the worst in recent memory. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has given three of the greatest performances of the current decade in Mysterious Skin, Brick and The Lookout. His character here isn't especially well written, and I think he tries to overcompensate a little. Deschanel, playing the title character, is fairly two dimensional. Webb clearly based the girl on a real ex-girlfriend, and it would have been nice to have this film feel more personal. Instead, it feels like a distant, overwritten indie flick, not too far removed from junk like Juno.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
this movie proof that most of women are selfish,I mean look at the poor guy he was afraid of getting into a relationship with that woman because he was thinking that she is a snooty then she was the one who started talking with him then later he simply fell in love with her and she was asking his for doing all that funny things with each other and then she dumped him and suddenly she began to gradually leaving him then she told him that she don't like the idea of boyfriend girlfriend thing and then it was the biggest surprise in the movie when she got married that was weird I mean while she was having all the fun he was suffering of losing her and lost his job because of that I mean he done everything that he could do for her and she still want to leave him . and what I want to say here that this story happened to one of my relatives before and it's telling almost every detail that happened to him and many other guys I've known . and that's why I see that most of women are selfish I mean that's my opinion any way and I also wanna to apologize about my language I'm not very good with grammar . thanks for reading regards Khaled,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The best romantic comedy ever made ?,"This is a strong candidate for the title of best romantic comedy . Unlike most of the movies of this genre it has at least something to tell . It's deeper and has something to say. It doesn't have the same generic plot – X meets Y , they fell in love,there are trouble , there is conflict , love wins all , the end. It is REALLY FUNNY and more mature than typical Hollywood product.This movie feels real. Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are stars , yet they feel like real everyday people. The idea for movie is simple , yet genius . One of them believes in love, the other not . Can they be happy together ? Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel have great chemistry together and give solid performances. They relationship feels real and makes you care for both of them.The movie makes a great job of mixing humor and sadness . It shows the beautiful and ugly sides of love. It's a good thing that the story isn't told in a linear way . It makes a point how we want to remember some good things and how we intentionally forget about bad things. The editing is really good . The movie is quite nicely photographed. The direction by Mark Webb is full of life. The scene with Gordon Levitt walking around to Hall and Oates ""You make my dream"" is AWESOME.The film shows the good and the bad of love, relationships, and life. It ends realistic . It's very funny and very sad at times movie . It's cute movie and great debut for Marc Webb. I recommend it for everyone, especially for people who don't necessary like romantic comedies (like me).

95 minutes of magic,"""Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."". Starting with the tag-line, it was clear that (500) Days of Summer wasn't going to be a typical romantic comedy. In fact, this film stands out as one of the rare genuine shots in the arm said genre so desperately needs, and that it succeeds is largely due to one thing: it's not really that romantic.As the film's co-writer Michael Weber pointed out when the film was shown at the 2009 Locarno Film Festival (on the opening night, no less), the screenplay is ""loosely"" based on something that happened to his creative partner Scott Neustadter - something that is hilariously mentioned right before the opening credits (a brilliant spin on the familiar ""any resemblance with real events is coincidental"" caption). Not that the information is essential in order to enjoy the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an aspiring architect who writes greeting cards for a living, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's new secretary. Tom falls for her immediately, whereas she doesn't believe in true love. Despite that jarring contrast, the two actually end up together, although Summer's ""allergy"" to commitment is likely to cause problems...So far, so predictable, right? How fortunate, then, that first-time director Marc Webb, aided by the writers, has decided to tell the story in non-linear fashion: the movie begins right after the break-up, and what happened before (and after) is reconstructed over the following 90 minutes. The aim is allegedly to play on the non-linearity of memory (the script jumps from day 1 to 300 or something), which allows the filmmakers to have a lot of fun movie-wise, thanks to clever editing - Tom entering an elevator happy and leaving heartbroken - and genre mixing, with the couple's conflicting views allowing for mental digressions that range from classic musicals to, of all people, Ingmar Bergman (the last time he got mentioned in a comedy was due to Woody Allen). Also, given Webb's music video pedigree, the soundtrack is very good and, unusually for a rom-com, devoid of sloppy sentiment (hello, Richard Curtis).The other winning factor in the film is the combination of dialogue, which is smart yet real, and performances, specifically the two leads: no offense to the fine supporting cast (Clark Gregg, Chloe Moretz, Criminal Minds' Matthew Gray Gubler), but the movie wouldn't be half as charming if it weren't for Gordon-Levitt, funny and vulnerable in equal measure, and the lovely Deschanel, who gracefully charms, laughs and sings her way through the entire film. Ironically, considering the film's plot, they are a perfect couple.(500) Days of Summer is a little film that can, and will, entertain and move audiences everywhere. It's a romantic comedy that intelligently subverts or avoids most of the genre's clichés (including the romance) without ever coming off as a smug or cynical exercise in style. It also manages to overcome the ""I know how it's gonna end"" obstacle beautifully, with what is arguably one of the year's best closing lines. What's not to love?",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Many kind of love,"Usually, love story, a man and a woman fell in love each other. Next they get over some obstacles, or either a man or a woman try to make a boy/girlfriend and the story will be happy story. In this movie's case, it little bit different from other love story. Before I watch this movie, I love love story that is happy ending. However, in the world, there are many kind of ""love"" and we can't choose what is the best. It's my impression of this movie. Also, Zooey Claire Deschanel, she played Summer in this film is good. She played a woman well who is very pretty and very vague. Finally, about title of this movie, ""500 days of Summer(500 nichi no sama^)"", is ""love of during only summer"". It is very romantic in movie or story, I like it.

500 stars!,"OPENING NARRATION: This is a story of boy meets girl. The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met The One. This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie 'The Graduate.' The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief. Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only loved two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing. Tom meets Summer on January 8th. He knows almost immediately she is who he has been searching for. This is a story of boy meets girl, but you should know upfront, this is not a love story.But this review is. I am in love with this film.I have been in love with it ever since seeing the trailer a few months ago. Watching a workprint of the film tonight not only did not dampen my ardor, it deepened it. And this is not an adolescent-crush-love-is-blind love on my part. I have my reasons for it.First, there is Zooey Deschanel.Second, how can you not love a film that starts with the following lines printed on screen before the credits?AUTHOR'S NOTE: The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental.Especially you Jenny Beckman.Bitch.Third, there is Zooey Deschanel.In one pithy phrase, ""(500) Days Of Summer"" is easily the best romantic comedy in years. The writing is fabulous, containing more funny lines per minute than any film of this type I can think of since ""When Harry Met Sally.""And there is Zooey Deschanel. A star is born.Not that Joseph Gordon-Levitt isn't great. He follows up his excellent work in ""The Lookout"" and ""Killshot"" and other films with a film that will probably jumpstart his career as well. But hey! I'm a guy, and Zooey stole my heart just as effectively as she steals his.Besides, it's a story told out of order, which I love. (500) Days Of Summer is exactly what the title implies it is, a tale composed of vignettes from the 500 days of an unforgettable love affair. But one of the things that makes this unforgettable love affair memorable is that these vignettes are presented not in sequence, as they happened, but in the order they need to be in to tell the story properly.If the scale went up that far, I would give it 500 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Standard Sundance,"Remember when independent films were really independent? 500 Days Of Summer is so dull and Sundance friendly that I felt angry leaving the theater. What really made me nuts was reading after that the creators of the film actually thought they were making some kind of radical romantic comedy.Nothing in this entire movie is original, intelligent, or subversive. Most of it was stolen from Woody Allen. And a movie that is angry at women and doesn't understand women fits in really well with all the Apatow comedies coming out. So who is kidding who?Super-stylized, super cold, this movie is great for shallow young people who don't have a clue.Myself, being over 50, if I want to watch great pop movies I'll go watch ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Shoot The Piano Player."" Those movies were fun and had substance.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The feel-good film of 2009.,"This film was excellent. The cast puts on a pure heartfelt down-to-earth expression about the modernisms of relationships and how it is biased from the two people in one. We have the great and charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt who plays 'Tom' (3rd Rock from the Sun, Brick, INCEPTION) who wholly represents the hopefully romantic and perhaps foolish romantic who wants that one great person in his life. He has a lovable geeky mannerism with no time for circumlocution, no time for one-night- stands or other quick endeavours. He rages through all the typical energies of love, angst, hope, determination. His yin to his coherent yang is Zoe Deschanel's character 'Summer' who has an aura of melancholy and nostalgia of previous non-standing relationship surrounding her, whilst JGL's character tries affectionately to break her hard-shell prejudices of there being ""no such thing as love"".There is a level of emotional climax found throughout, but it is up to the audience to find it. It has a the feeling of a warm afternoon summer breeze which starts to fade away into the autumnal currents. Then rise back to warmer weathers only to be pushed back into cold winter gusts.All throughout you want Summer (Z. Deschanel) to *see* love in Tom (J. G-L), but the ending, like most Hollywood films end on, is bitter-sweet. It gives a lasting impression of hope, like a gasp of cheer. With a send off like a pat on the back, feeling fresh. As a film you try to expect where the plot will go and if she will see Tom for what he genuinely is, a guy very much in love with every bit of Summer. You walk out with a glassful of hope in one hand and joy in the other.The most feel-good film of 2009 I reckon. Effortless to enjoy, like a wisp of sugar and smooth like Nutella. 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"""This is not a love story. This a story about love""","An offbeat romantic comedy about a woman who doesn't believe true love exists, and the young man who falls for her.WOW. I came into watching the film with no expectations, and expecting another cheesy, flimsy romantic comedy but got so much more... The film structures by skipping through the days of a couple's relationship. You get to see the start, the happy days of their relationship, and when the feelings start to fade. You also get to see the most depressing parts, the aftermath. The interesting part is that the film doesn't move around in chronological order, it skips around to the most important parts. I loved this, and it added to the uniqueness of the film. The acting in this film was unbelievable. Joseph Levitt is a fantastic actor, playing roles in 50/50 and Hesher. He surprises us in each role, but this one captures realism more than others. The most surprising was probably Zooey Deschanel 's acting. She is a witty girl, playing a role in the new hit show New Girl, and I never suspected real acting from her. But she plays a realistic approach without overdoing it like most other actors. The supporting cast was great too, and I had no criticism in this department... The screenplay was actually handed really well. The humor was not laugh-out-loud funny, but it was actually real. The jokes and stuff were funny, but in a witty kind of way. They are fast-paced and keep coming, just like real life... That leads me to the next part, how REAL this is. I think the film is better if you have experienced this situation before. Summer is a realistic approach of a girl who isn't looking for commitment, but then backfires on you. It makes you feel depressed and betrayed, but it happens. The thing that makes the film unique(r) is the fact is displays Tom's feelings so real. I was believing I was in his situation, and that makes a great film. I think the tag-line completes the film, as the movie really isn't the cliché, sappy movie it looks out to be. It's unique, real, and touching, and I recommend it for all. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Off-beat and quirky, smart and  charming; all around a great  film","I love Romantic comedies, I love everything about them. The atmosphere, the style, the grace and humor(sometimes they got it sometimes they don't.) They are the very epitome of good fun and romance. But over the years this genre(like I said in my review of The Ugly Truth.) Has been stretched thin and mired down by bad and extremely bland Romantic Comedies that you could see what was going to happen before the film even began. But I'm truly and profoundly proud to say that (500) Days of Summer is nothing even close to the formula of romantic comedies, in fact it's one of the most complex and off beat entries in the genre to come out since in 20 years.This movie I had no interest in seeing at first cause I thought it was just another formula Rom Com and I thought it wouldn't live up to my standards. Boy was I wrong! This movie lived up to my standards and then some. 500 days of summer is clever, smart, funny, honest, heart breaking, touching, sweet and oh so much fun, it's the very core of a great Rom Com and it has the heart of a great romantic drama to boot. It's a film that won't disappoint you and it may change how you see life and love . I know it confirmed my beliefs on both. All in all this film was fantastic in it's execution of the story of a boy meet's girl, boy falls in love with girl, but girl doesn't fall in love with boy; it's so unique in it's portrayal of how love and fate sometimes don't come easy and that sometimes you find love when you least expect it. Or even looking for it for that matter. It was great on some many levels it just made me feel so good and feel so bad at the same time( which is unique fro a Rom Com.) And there lies the keys to it's success and it's unflinchingly honest portrayal of how love really works.Joseph Gordon-Levitt( Who I like, but has never made a movie that I liked besides Miracle at Saint Anna's.) really shows his stuff and proves he can really pull off a dramatic and comedic performance( In the same film! Which is very hard.) He brings a warm and very touching side to his character and he doesn't do it with grace or style but with the honesty of a regular Joe, which makes his character more likable. Zooey Deschanel( Who I didn't like until now.) makes her character Summer a heart breaker and a breath of fresh air, her character wasn't contrived or over done Summer was simple and plain and that makes her something of an off beat female love interest, but none the less is very effective. All in all the cast does nicely in this gorgeous and brilliant Romantic Dramedy.(500) Days of Summer is very rare as I've said and it's great and undeniable fun that is really and truly needs to be seen to believe . I don't think in all my years of watching movies have I ever been blown away by a Rom Com, but now I guess I can. This film has gone down as one of the best since Sleepless In Seattle but I'm happy to inform you that this movie surpass Sleepless in Seattle and makes that film look bad. It's a great utterly charming good time that is a film that will be remember and cherished for years to come.

Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't.,"Tom is a greeting-card writer who dreams of becoming an architect and finding his true love. Summer is a vintage-looking beauty whose ideas about love are entirely modern. As Tom remembers his 500 days with Summer, his mind jumps from moment to moment, largely thinking of the good times in their trouble-filled relationship.""This is a boy meets girl story, but it is not a love story."" As the opening lines of the film suggests, this is not your average romantic comedy and while that doesn't always mean it's a good thing, in this case, it is. Because of this, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is one of the best movies of 2009. Not only is this a unique romantic comedy, but the way it tells its story is so ingenious and creative, that it makes this film one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen. I loved it that much.Sometimes, if a film has this really awesome and original idea, it ends up failing because of the way it's handled. However, it seems as if director Marc Webb used his music video side of him to his advantage to create something magical and enchanting. Every song used in this film is so perfect for the scenes they are used in that it puts Quentin Tarantino himself to shame. Webb also uses another technique used in many Tarantino films: The nonlinear narrative. And it works!Another thing that works in this film is the two amazing leads: Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. Gordon-Levitt is an actor I praised before in BRICK. He also starred in another fantastic film, THE LOOKOUT. Now, about two years later, he's better than ever, playing the charismatic leading man! Zooey Deschanel plays Gordon's love interest and she's as great as usual. I love her in anything she's in. Another person I would like to mention is Chloe Moretz. I personally found her to be my favorite character because she's flat out hilarious.If you know me, you'd know I love movies about love. I especially love the tragic ones as well as the clichéd ones. Even though 500 DAYS OF SUMMER isn't either one of those, I was bound to love it. The film is both very funny and sweet. It's supports a great cast, a quirky and brilliant script, a unique style, and a director who has a bright future ahead of him. For those who love romantic comedies and those who have given up on them, 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is a film everyone should see once in their lifetime.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
In the end... A story about nothing,Acting is not bas at all. Story is boring though. Wants to be a clever and interesting film. Just doesn't quite pull it off. A slight waste of time.,5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Breath of fresh air in the romantic comedy scene,"""This is not a love story. This is a story about love.""That is the slogan for the film and it's very accurate. (500) Days of Summer is not a typical romantic comedy in that you can pretty much predict how it's going to end from the very first minute. It's cleverer than that, always keeping you guessing and not revealing its cards until it absolute has to. It would have been easy for this film to fall into a confusing mess and to be unbearable to watch because it tried to be too clever and unconventional. Luckily the writing here is razor sharp and director Marc Webb keeps the film admirably on course even when the plot jumps uncontrollably from one place or scene to another. But this jumping has a strategy behind it, and this is one of those non-chronological films where it doesn't feel convoluted or unnecessary to watch the scenes in the ""wrong"" order.Huge props should also go the leading actor and actress. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a great everyman, a guy who has lost his way in life and is content just to go on, living his days one at a time. And then a woman walks into his life and what a woman Zooey Deschanel plays. She is perfect for this film's needs, naturally playing a girl that's charming and quirky enough that it's almost too easy to fall for her at first sight, yet you get the idea that she wouldn't be that good of a wife if you were to marry her.I also rather like the art style for this film. The director takes time to conduct small experiments with certain scenes, like he's still trying to find his own niche, and while this would usually make the film seem way too artsy, it works here, because there's still an undercurrent of effort. Different experiments feel like they have been thought through and instead of stealing focus away from the main storyline and the movie as a whole, they add to it. Very nice looking piece of film making in general.(500) Days of Summer is a film I'd recommend to anyone, who doesn't exactly like romantic comedies, but wants to give them a shot. It's quirky and unique enough that you won't get bored even if you think you've already seen all there's to see, yet it remains true to its genre enough that you get what you came looking for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Completely Entertaining,"I've made a habit of writing my more recent reviews only on films that I truly enjoyed. Why not? What's the point of clouding the airwaves with my attempts at rationalizing why a movie sucked? It's not hard, however, to rationalize why ""(500) Days of Summer"" was a fantastic movie: it was bold, different, and completely entertaining. THE DIRECTOR: Brashly and uniquely told through the eyes of relatively green music video director Marc Webb, the plot continuously jumps through the 500 days of Tom and Summer's relationship. Webb uses a smörgåsbord of directorial techniques, from split-screens to musical numbers, all beautifully meshing together to tell one surprisingly cohesive story. All of your questions are eventually answered, a beautiful parallel between lives is drawn, and you leave the theater entirely satisfied. THE LEAD PLAYERS: Deschanel and Gordon-Levitt have fantastic chemistry, apparently developed off the set according to Fox Searchlight. Additionally, Gordon-Levitt's charming and off-beat buddies provide comic relief and context throughout the twists and turns of an extremely realistic relationship. THE BIG PICTURE: ""(500) Days of Summer"" is a movie whose intention is to have you watching from between your fingers one minute, and laughing aloud with your friends the next. You support the characters, you pity them, and if you've ever been in a relationship, you certainly identify with them. Enjoy this movie with a date as I did, it will not only renew your sense of true love and destiny, but also raise your spirits in a lackluster summer of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One for the fallen romantics,"Deep down I'm a bit of a romantic that's been burned a time or several and so it was nice to find a film like this. It's not you're usual 'boy meets girl – they fall in love and live happily ever after' type of tale, no, it's much more realistic than that but with a large dose of quirkiness thrown in. I can't say it's my favourite romantic film, but it would probably make a top ten. But I digress, here's a bit about the plot first.Tom Hansen is working for a greetings card company when Summer Finn starts to work there. He is, of course, attracted to her but is afraid to make the first move. His friends, McKenzie and Paul, persuade him to talk to her at a karaoke night and one thing leads to another. She tells him that she does not want a boyfriend and he agrees to just keep it light. But as time passes, it's clear that Tom is struggling not knowing where he is with her. He even asks advice from his street-wise little sister, Rachel. It seems the relationship is doomed when Summer leaves her job, and also Tom. He is heartbroken, but they are destined to meet again more than once.The story is told in a rather unusual way; we start near the end of the 500 days and then jump back to the beginning. This continues throughout the film which meant the audience has to keep watching or they could get easily lost. I found it a different and refreshing way to put the narrative on the screen. Decent performances all round, so honourable mentions go to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom Hansen, Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn, Geoffrey Arend as McKenzie, Chloe Moretz as Rachel Hansen and Matthew Gray Gubler as Paul.There are a lot of comparisons I can draw with other films; for instance, the character of Summer reminded me very much of Holly Golightly from Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961). There is a musical number performed in the street featuring Tom that could be from any musical you could name. At the end of the day I found it a very entertaining film, although Summer was a little irritating at times. But forgiving that, it's pretty much recommended.My score: 7.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Ingenuous and heartfelt movie about love,Initially i thought that it would be like any another romantic movie with unjustifiable trailer but i was wrong. It is a story about a boy (Tom Hansen) shown in 500 days he spent with Summer Finn. The story is clear and simple with complicated relationship. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel carried their role with ease and great chemistry. The soundtrack is too good to resist and it fits with the movie very well.Director Mark Webb's work is sincere and he has successfully captured the best possible reactions.

Better Than Flakes,"I think there are some good things about this movie unfortunately the aspect I was most interested in seeing was the most disappointing part of it. This movie would have been more successful to me if it didn't contain all the ""indie"" clichés and by clichés, they are seriously clichés. A Date to Ikea? (Hello Pavement song, and just sort of a hipsteresque concept, I guess.. they're Swedish meatballs are great and their furniture is angular and cheap).. nowadays Ikea could have been Target as well. Singing the Pixies at a karaoke bar?  yup! Smiths obsession? Check! All of these things can seem sort of dated to some and not very universal to many others. However, it's so deliberately geared towards hipsters it should have taken place in Portland! The story concept I kind of liked many of us know the frustration of being in love with someone in a ""Friends with Benefits"" type situation and I had never seen that portrayed so well in a film. Also the sequencing of the movie itself was pretty cool, however I just wish they'd played down the indie cred stuff. It was way too over the top and cliché. The dancing scene, however, is hilarious because it's so cliché and I get that! And very out of place since that's the only scene in the entire movie that has an ounce of camp to it. It's waaaaay better than Flakes, but that's not saying much. I really want to like Zoey Daschnel but it seems to me she always finds herself in movies that play up the whole indie thing to the point cheeseyness, but not cheesy enough to be funny.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Anti-rom-com,"I admit that I'm not the biggest fan of romantic comedies. Yes, the odd rom-com can be fresh and interesting but I often find them to be reasonably unoriginal and a little clichéd. (500) Days of Summer couldn't be further from the average rom-com.The film twists the stereotypical ""boy meets girl"" rom-com love story formula on its head, in this case, boy meets girl who doesn't believe in love. What ensues is a far more realistic and totally un-Hollywood account of two well-rounded and interesting characters, unsure of what they've got themselves into. Zooey Deschanel shines as Summer, playing the role with eccentric idiosyncrasy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels as a frustrated and confused young lover who believes in ideals such as love at first sight and true love. He portrays a multitude of emotions which are cunningly expressed through his job as a greeting cards writer.The film encompasses numerous other flourishes besides the inspired casting and original plot; the score and soundtrack also suit the film's quirky tone and sharp screenplay perfectly and directorial embellishments such as dashes of traditional animation amongst a beautiful pastel colour palette only serve to garnish this thoughtful and unique film. It may be a little too ""indie"" for some but I thoroughly recommend (500) Days of Summer to anyone looking for something a little different from the typical romantic comedy.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the best romantic comedies ever,"I absolutely love this movie. From the very beginning the movie introduces its very personal sense of humour. I've seen the movie more than ten times by now and I laugh every time just as much as watching it the first time.I usually dislike nonlinear storytelling in movies, since mostly the nonlinear story just ends up ""spoiling"" scenes that would've had more impact when told in linear order. In the beginning the movie tells you that it's not a love story, and 500 Days of Summer's humour justifies the nonlinear story. The movie handles the nonlinearity very well with a plenty of nice scenes where Marc Webb utilizes the possibilities of audiovisual storytelling greatly. With a great soundtrack the personal scenes feel even stronger.The actors do a great job, no matter how small their part. There isn't a single bad performance in the movie, everyone fits the personal tone of the movie. The movie is also very quotable!My only two major complaints is that the penultimate scene at the bench is the only scene which doesn't fit the movie too well. Summer's explanation about her sudden change of mind is left pretty shallow. Luckily the very last scene saves this, since it again supports the basic structure of the movie perfectly with the personal humour and the completion of the day-by-day narrative.The other complaint is that if you don't enjoy the story the movie might feel too much like a series of scenes instead of a solid one movie. I personally enjoy the solution of showing the literal numbered days of Summer, but if someone doesn't enjoy the movie because of this, I undestand them fully.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It felt like reality of life.The centers around Tom(Joesph Gordon Levitt) who believes in true love, and there is Summer(Zoey Deschanel) who doesn't.

Why this movie isn't good,"I always wondered why this movie was highly rated. It is a movie about unrequited love and it is all that this movie is about! it is not exceptional in any way that a movie is not about love but it's about the absence of love. This happens in real life more often than anything else. Unrequited love is prevalent especially among teenagers. To make a whole movie about it, is like watching somebody having constipation for one hour and a half: we know it happens frequently but it's not really what we want to go to the movies for. We want to get out of our reality and be transported into something else. Hence this movie completely misses the objective. It is a failure.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

This couldn't be any truer, and I don't think there's any way I would have improved the movie.Let's just get this out of the way now: I love quirky movies. I love creativity, I love new techniques, I love seeing something I haven't before. Let me also say that I am a romantic, and as a romantic, this movie gave me a fascinating new perspective.Zooey Deschnael and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were both incredible, the latter particularly. He was sweet and charming, and it was easy to be swept up into his world.The soundtrack was also great, and fit the tone of the movie beautifully. The story was awesome and still realistic. The writing was genius; smooth, funny, and cute to boot. There were several severely adorable scenes. (IKEA! for those who've seen it.) And the ending, well.. I'll let you see for yourself.But most of my praise goes to the director, Mr. Marc Webb. This was his silver-screen debut, and I cannot wait to see where he goes next. The whole movie was absolutely stunning, beautiful but still real.The way time moved backwards and forwards was very interesting and despite the jumps in time, it was all still easy to follow because the story became my story.All in all, an amazing movie that comes highly recommended. I cannot wait to see this film again, and even more eagerly await the DVD release, so I can watch it to my heart's content. Because life is not a love story, it's a story about love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

My opinion about the movie (500) Days of Summer.,"In the first time i heard about him, i said to myself: ""Oh, it's seems to be a great movie, lets go see it."" All the movie I was waiting for an something to show up, something like great scene or even just nice scene, but sorry, i didn't really get any.It's a nice movie, but definitely not deserve the score he get.I cant understand how this movie get higher score then ""A walk to remember"", I really cant.The act was good, really. but the movie himself have nothing that you can say ""WoW"" about... regular nice movie, not more then that.If someone ask me which romance movie to see, I definitely wont recommend this movie, don't know why but i didn't love him, he have no punch, no point, just a regular nice movie...Don't know how he get's to the Top 250 here... I really don't.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Words cannot express,"I cried 3 times while watching this movie. It blows me away every time I see it. No words in the English or Spanish dictionary could ever comprehend how much I absolutely adore this movie! Every aspect is perfect. I fit right in with the main character and I'm sure billions of others do to. They spend so much delicate time showing us how important the relationship was, making all the darker moments seem more engaging and all the happier moments all the more enjoyable. I found myself dancing around with it at one moment then literally the next minute being thrown back in a pit of despair. Needless to say the movie ends on a great note and every time I watch it it takes my breath away. It's so creative, so uplifting, so utterly enjoyable that there's no reason it shouldn't be my favorite movie. And it is! 500 Days of Summer is hands down the best movie I've ever seen. I watch all kinds of things, from gore-filled movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" to masterpieces of acting and drama like ""Citizen Kane."" Then this absolute gem of a romance movie comes out of nowhere with such originality and creativity and hits me in the face like a truck going 90! If you haven't seen this movie then shame on you. It's a must watch in my book and will remain that way for probably as long as I live, and I still got a hearty 65 years to go!Thank you 500 Days of Summer for being so Incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Had me a blast,"Perhaps one of the greatest ""Rom Coms"" to come out in ages, this film spins the concept of what romantic comedies are to Hollywood. This film is sweet but tragic. It's endearing and real. The characters are treated like real people with real complex philosophical attractions to things like fate and destiny. It's always disappointing to watch a film of the same genre following its characters as they go through the motions to an ending that insults us and is preordained. In this case the film starts at the end and we see how these two people break up. And we are given insight through a series of flashbacks so we can piece together how the puzzle fell apart. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays it straight and charming. He's not unsure of himself and bumbling like other characters we have seen in similar roles. He's natural and easy to like. Zooey Deschanel also is wonderful in her performance and I have met girls like this before. Each bring their own foibles to the relationship. Both strength and weakness. There's a wonderful dance sequence with an old Hall and Oats song and the film has fun with it's narrations and observations. What a remarkable film and a great study of modern relationships.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Excellent Film,"Excellent film from when Hollywood made real films about real women and if you look Zoey is a glorious Western woman with meat on her body and not one of these oriental almond eyes that 'men' seem to prefer nowadays with no meat on their bodies.When i say men I mean so called men..
This film was one of those that slowly became more and more popular upon release and is one that certainly deserves to be hunted out because it succeeds in being a warm and funny film that manages to add a different dimension to the rom-com genre.The great reality plot eases the viewer in and the two leads are very likable because the man is dumb and the womyn in charge f her detiny. It's not the type of film you could watch in a passive manner due to the jumping around in terms of narrative but I like that this film again is trying to be different.There are some very nice moments throughout the films 100 minute run and the ending in particular is very well handled by the director who is a femynist ally obviously.The film is a little slow in places and the supporting characters are not well fleshed out but it does not stop this film being worthy of the praise it stories.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not Bad >_<,"I must say, I'm not normally one who goes out looking for a ""flick"" one night, so my friends had to drag me out on this one. i sit down in that big comfy theater chair, expecting to see one of those non-realistic, lovey dovey movies, when all of a sudden, the narrator tells me I've got the wrong idea. He says its not a love story, but in fact something very different. boy was he right. this hilarious, yet very emotional film left me with a stupid grin on my face and a butterfly in my stomach. many unsolvable labyrinths of life are touched upon, like the notorious question of 'is there love?' and if so, 'how do you know you love someone?', or maybe, 'how do you know if someone loves you?'... With these questions come a zillion different situations that would provide a zillion different answers to each of the corresponding questions. this creative non- love story gives us a play by play on a very captivating combination of these situations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Exceedingly ordinary boy-meets-girl story...musically intuitive yet with little imagination,"Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber penned this rather basic screenplay about a young man in the greeting-card creation business who falls for his boss's new assistant, a pretty, independent girl who believes love is just a fantasy. The couple meet, get to know one another, date, and part in the course of five-hundred days, while director Marc Webb zips us through different stages of their relationship in a semi-random manner (which Webb probably intended as a fresh way to define the peaks and valleys of modern romance). Age-appropriate viewers, tired of Woody Allen or Nora Ephron-penned romantic comedy-dramas, will no doubt see traces of themselves portrayed earnestly here, yet the film is hardly inventive. The college-rock soundtrack is flavorful, and is usually around to pick up the slack, yet Neustadter and Weber fall back on some very derivative character-driven scenes and dialogue (while the proviso that leading lady Zooey Deschanel prefers being alone to dating is a lazy out, rendered inconsequential by the finale). The picture looks good and sounds good, though it is itself a fairy tale--one topped with a happy bow. Gullible teenagers are its target audience. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Unexpected Hit!,"500 days of Summer is one of those films you don't really know what to expect from. When you actually take the chance and watch it, you wonder, 'why can't I watch more movies like this?' This, after having to wake up at 6am, not having anything to do and coming across this on one of the lower end cable networks. Interesting, because this film actually is based on the idea that 'love' is all about your fate, about being at the right place at the right time. There may be moments where you do not believe that, but after watching the entire film, you really do believe it.

"Coincidences, Opportunities, Consequences","(500) DAYS OF SUMMER is a refreshing bit of fluff about the dance of contemporary courting - with a twist. Writers Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber demonstrate a keen understanding of the bumpy road of romance and have been able to make a film that balances humor and tenderness very well. Director Marc Webb encourages his two fine lead actors to give performances that could just be career boosts for both.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a completely different role than his usual stereotype) is an architect whose line in the job seeking market landed him in the greeting card business, writing inane messages for silly cards. Feeling as though he will never meet the girls of his dreams, he encounters Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a pretty if somewhat evasive and odd girl with her own concept of 'relationships'. Egged on by his friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler) as well as his very bright 'therapist' little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), Tom approaches Summer in a courtship that lasts for 500 days - only some of which are rewarding. It is a back and forth game of ping pong, with Tom the obsessed pursuer and Summer the feather in the wind. There really is no particular linear story here, but instead a series of wonderful vignettes that allow Gordon- Levitt and Deschanel to shine as actors. Webb interweaves drawings with photography in an especially winning way and allows the ping pong ball to bounce to and fro between periods of time in this thwarted courtship. This is not a deep movie, but it is a well designed and acted look at love among the young today. The performances by the lead actors justify visiting this little treasure.Grady Harp",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not what I was expecting,"I caught this on TV last night, and in the absence of anything else on, I decided to give it a go. The likable cast of '(500) days of summer' is headed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, with a good supporting performance by (a girl who seems to be in everything at the minute) Chloe Grace Moretz.The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but standard, as the story hops backwards and forwards during the 500 days of the title.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are both perfectly cast as the leads. There is no weak links in the supporting cast and everyone delivers. The score is another valuable asset to the movie too.Beautifully filmed, it has some genuine laugh out loud moments '(500) days of summer' is a highly professional piece of work with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for a more than enjoyable 90 or so minutes",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""The following is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. Especially you""","How to reinvent the romantic comedy? Filmmakers either bold or foolish enough to attempt such a seemingly impossible challenge have struggled throughout the ages, floundering over the delicate balance between credibly depicting the trials and tribulations of romance while simultaneously satisfying the cathartic desire for a romanticized, happy Hollywood ending. The key, it would seem, as with prior success Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, lies in the filmmaker's daring to strive beyond obvious emotional satisfaction, even to the point of the protagonists' interactions not ending in a happy ever after. And in this regard, (500) Days of Summer proves a similarly rich and rewarding experience, all the more funny, entertaining and profoundly true through its toying with or outright disregard for the worn to death formula, demonstrating the definitive way to deliver a comedy or drama about romance.Rather than using the eventual breakup as a surprise tragic twist, director Mark Webb instead eschews formula by simply presenting the relationship between Tom Hansen and Summer Finn, from start to finish, early, awkward flirtations to subsequent, devastating parting, capturing moments which are happy, sad and just plain strange. Which, of course, proves the ideal cocktail, as Webb's film sparkles with life and the sort of inventive genius in editing and cinematography which only a background in music videos could yield. Webb allows his film to mirror the emotional state of the protagonists both visually and tonally, bubbling with spontaneous dance numbers and animated Disney birds to convey Tom's early euphoria, later fuming with moody artistic scribbles, parallelling the trauma and existential grief of a break up, and eventually the quiet, reflective calm which comes with moving on.It is a remarkable feat to travel such an emotional roller-coaster without feeling swept away in maudlin, excessive sentiment, but Webb's film, despite its inevitable forays into magic realism and storytelling coincidence, feels all the more crushing credible and honest because of its overtly cinematic touches rather than in spite of them. Even more helpful is the wry, irreverent sense of humour peppering the film throughout, with sly touches such as the sardonic narrator and fleeting, winking breaches of the fourth wall seeming to assure viewers throughout, preventing the emotional extremes from ever becoming excessively dour, or descending into mawkish indie cuteness. Completing the delightful package is Webb's sublime collection of soundtrack choices, serving to effortlessly fill in the emotional gaps when words or actions simply cannot capture the sheer essence of the situation.Of course, despite the cinematic mastery on display, proper casting is essential for a successful relationship film, and in this respect, Webb achieves another triumph. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is flat out remarkable as unabashed romantic and optimist Tom, perfectly carrying the film with unshowy charisma, and an achingly credible emotional resonance, whether thrilled or crushed. However, Tom is not a romanticized hero, and Gordon-Levitt is just as game demonstrating his self-destructive wallowing, creating a more balanced and believable piece of characterization. Equally impressive is Zooey Deschanel as the titular Summer. Just as careful to humanize a potential spite-worthy caricature, Deschanel instead harnesses her trademark luminous quirkiness into something far more real, harder to outright love but impossible not to empathize with. Providing welcome support to the lead couple's flawless chemistry, Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler deliver welcome laughs as Tom's hapless best friends, and character actor Clark Gregg steals many a scene as an overly sentimental greeting card company editor.Delightful, charming, traumatic and eventually hopeful, (500) Days of Summer proves the rare 'romantic comedy' (to use the term extremely loosely) or drama which is just as likely to appeal to unhappy singles as happy couples. Offering a slice of rare realism, all the more credible through its fantastic and cinematic trappings, Webb's film is a rare marvel which should not be missed, if only for the sake of redeeming a genre bogged down in painful cliché and falsities.-9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perfectly Adequate,"I think the main and most important trait of 500 Days of Summer is its unique style and originality. From the very beginning, the author warns us that this is not a love story, and he is more than right. This movie just cannot be put into a single genre. You can say that it is a comedy, because that is what I believed after the first ten minutes. But I was wrong, for the following events were rather dramatic than comedic.I particularly liked Gordon Levitt's performance. I felt his pain, I understood his pain, he gave so much life and authenticity to the character. And since Zooey Deschanel just made me hate her through Summer's character, that certainly means she did a fabulous job as well.The movie seemed completely real to me, and I just found it revealing, though painful. The ending was terribly disappointing, completely unrealistic and sort of contradicted the whole essence of the movie in my view. But, hey, they just had to remind me that it was just a movie after all, not life, right? I loved all the elements the director used in the structure of the movie, all the jumps backwards and forward the relation (call I call it relation?). I liked the whole thing that Summer is just a normal girl, height average, weight average, foot size slightly above average. All in all, it certainly deserves a 9, and for the director I have only words of praise. I think he should keep on directing movies, for he is doing a really unique thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Dear Jane, a lady's imagination is not that rapid!","As far as i can remember, i always believed in my beloved Jane Austen's sentence about a lady's imagination: "" a lady's imagination is very rapid, it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in one second!"" and it was always true about me. whenever i noticed that someone might be attracted to me, i lost my mind at once, even if that someone was the DEVIL! and i could never imagine that a day would come when i would learn the most precious lesson in my life from a film! believe me or not, that's true. 500 days of Summer taught me that i'm not supposed to look for love! and i'm not supposed to kill myself in order to love and be loved! and i'm not supposed to love the one that loves me and i'm not supposed to be loved by the one that i love! love is a coincidence and it will arise in the most unexpected way, through the most unwanted person, at the most dreadful moment.

"For once, an original and hilarious romantic comedy","Let me start off by saying that I absolutely can't stand romantic comedies. I think they're unoriginal and boring. However, there have been some good romantic comedies especially the ones that focus more on the comedy and less on the romance. The exception with 500 Days of Summer is that it is told in the male's point of view and that was what was most intriguing to me. This was what distinguished the movie from any other brainless romantic comedies that might as well star Sandra Bullock, Kate Hudson or Matthew McConaughy. 500 Days of Summer was described as an anti romantic comedy. It's not a love story, but a story about love and I think that's why it's so appealing.The main character is Tom, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, meets Summer, played by Zooey Deschanel who Tom believes to be the one. We learn that Summer doesn't believe in love, but Tom does and that can be used to frustrate Tom or anyone watching the film because it is in his point of view.The movie follows the 500 days that they spent together in no particular order. The movie literally starts a 488 and then jumps to day 1 then to 250 then to 4. It sounds like it's going to confusing but it actually wasn't. The story is going to jump all over the place and you have to be aware that this is going to happen quite frequently. This is what keeps the movie creative and original.The performances in the movie were outstanding. Joseph Gordon Levitt definitely surprised me in this whole because I haven't seen him act in anything that wasn't comedic before. I recently saw him in GI Joe as the main villain and thought he gave a terrible performance. But in this I was able to care about his character and feel all of his emotions. Zooey Deschanel also surprised me. The last movie I saw her in was Yes Man, in which I thought that she gave a lazy performance and appeared like she wasn't paying attention for some reason. She plays the character effectively because you start off liking the character and then by the end, you will think she's evil. It's not that often that a I can change my opinion of a character so quickly, but she pulled it off. The only other performances that are worth mentioning are the Tom's coworkers who were there to support him and be humorous, even though their not big name actors. None of their jokes fell flat for me and I was constantly laughing at them. I didn't expect the movie to be so funny.It was directed by Marc Webb and 500 Days of Summer is actually his first film. He actually used to do music videos and he even uses that skill in the film. Half way in to the movie there's a very well choreographed dance scene where everyone is dancing in the streets that felt like a music video. When this part comes in the movie it's very unexpected, but it is very funny to watch.The main problem with romantic comedies is usually a bad script. That's not the case here because everything is so clever and intelligent, that it's so delightful to watch. It's written to be more realistic. When they first meet, it is very awkward and that would usually be what would happen in real life. The script writers previously wrote The Pink Panther 2, which shows that they must not be consistent because that was terrible and dumb. Hopefully, they'll be able to top this film because it was excellent and for a first time director, it's a big achievement.There's one scene in particular that I really enjoyed. Tom was attending a party and was imagining his expectations for it. For an entire 3 minute scene, there is a split screen with the right side showing expectations and the left side showing the reality. It's very interesting to pay attention to both screens and this is the originality I'm talking about.To conclude this review, I'm going to give 500 Day of Summer a 10/10. I think it was one of the best films I've seen all year and the best romantic comedy I've ever seen period. I really hope it gets nominated for a Best Picture. I think everyone should see it because it's too good to miss and I know people aren't going to give it a chance because it's an independent movie and it's not playing everywhere, but I recommend it even if you just want to be put in a good mood for 90 minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story.,"She loves The Smiths. Holy ****.Those are the words that simultaneously grace Tom Hansen's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) synapses just as they explode into a cacophony of euphoria. Left alone to contemplate the implausibility of such a seemingly coincidental happenstance, Tom knows right there that he's in love; that's who he is—foolhardy and quick to romanticise. What he doesn't know however is that she, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) not only doesn't like being someone's girlfriend but that she doesn't believe in love either. Ouch. Like all determined poets however (although, here Tom is a talented aspiring architect rather than some whimsy caricature artist, which is probably for the best), Tom doesn't see how he could fail. Well, he does, but somehow there's just something about Summer that dispels the clouds and offers a ray of hope in return. Ah, poor, naïve Tom. You really can't help but feel for him.You see, right from the opening scene of 500 Days of Summer, the narration quickly gets across that yes, this is story of boy-meets-girl, but that it is certainly not a love story, even if one of the characters tries to make it so. Rather, it's a story about love, and for all the glimmers of sweet romance and blossoming glints of that ever enigmatic force called love, the story is framed in a manner which constantly reinforces and abides by that opening statement. Told in a narrative that jumps back and forth between the beginning of Tom and Zooey's peculiar development as ""friends"" and some ten months later when Zooey skips town and leaves Tom hanging, 500 Days is no traditional romantic comedy. Indeed, in place of all the formulaic clichés and see-through characterisation lies a somewhat humble and down to earth portrait of a notably off-beat but nevertheless modern relationship. There's comedy, but it's never predictable or banal; there's drama, and yet it never comes off as contrived or overblown; and there's the romance that is sweet, but not sickly so.So what you get, essentially, is a movie that surprises and yet feels conventional on the exact same page. Normally, framing a love story as something that inevitably fails is bad idea with no questions raised, however this isn't the case here. By opening the audience up to the fact that ten months down the line—or, 300 days of 500—Tom is going to be miserable once all the rushing feelings of happiness and comfort take their leave with the leaves that begin to fall from their branches at the closing of Summer's days; by opening the viewer up to this fact immediately, the audience is left to wonder ""well, what is going to happen that causes that seemingly infallible partnership to wither and die?"" Of course, Summer's admission is that it's just life; it's what happens, and it always does—and that is essentially the bitter truth behind much of 500 Days of Summer's first two acts.As the movie progresses however, the central timeline which is told from Day One when Tom meets Summer where he works as a greeting card writer gradually gets closer and closer to the point where that ominous cloud of impending doom is right over Tom's head. From here, much of the story is told in a linear, ""what will happen now?"" fashion. Thankfully, the third act stays true to that which comes before in that it stays grounded and realistic without succumbing to predictable Hollywood staples that one expects when going into a romantic comedy. And that's not to say that the movie ends on a down-beaten note either—rather it's even more cathartic and satisfying than your average feature would indulge you with. Again, you're surprised, but at the same time more than comfortable with this change of perspective, and that's key to 500 Days' ability to feel refreshing and poignantly touching.When it comes to casting, director Marc Webb and casting director Belasco hit the nail on the head with his two leads. Zooey Deschanel, who is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses of recent years plays a roll not at all dissimilar to much of her previous works in these genre films, but that's no coincidence at all. There's something about her eyes that just jumps off the screen with every little movement, and Webb capitalises on this at every moment possible, building up the architecture of Tom's inescapable destiny with all but the slightest glimpses in his direction from Summer. Tom Hansen has a much more complex role opposite Zooey in that he goes through many different passages throughout and has to offer the movie warmth that is notably low-key and downplayed in Deschanel's character. For the most part, he pulls it off well, yet it is in his scenes with his co-star that both really shine—so much so that when the movie's romance begins to unravel by the second act, the pity that Webb attempts to emote from the audience is palpable and as effective as it should be.In the end however, the success of 500 Days of Summer largely comes down to the character of Tom and how he goes through one of the most defining points of his life. Refusing to dupe the viewer into a false sense of security, Neustadter and Weber's script indulges in the nuances associated with the often dubious and hopeless endeavours of looking for love with simplicity and heart-felt pathos as a pacemaker. Beating back and forth between The Smiths and Regina Skeptor, and flowing with a subtle restraint and subdued sense of reality imposed by director Marc Webb in his cinematic debut, 500 Days of Summer is a romantic comedy that exists to the viewer as a bittersweet reminder that boy-meets-girl doesn't always end up as a love story, at least, not the way you expect it to be.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Refreshing unconventional indie romantic comedy,"What a nice surprise this was. A refreshing somewhat off-kilter romantic comedy about a hopeless romantic believing in one true love who falls for Summer, the girl who doesn't believe in the concept of love at all and even less in conventional labels. Yet she likes him and they do have a form of relationship. The narrative structure is peculiar going back and forth in non-chronological order during 500 days, of what? I won't tell you. It makes for some fun storytelling showing contrasts before and after certain events. There are some interesting visual finds (such as the split screen between expectations and reality, and the city fading) but overall it's rather conventional in terms of cinematography with ""actors staring straight at the camera"" shots being used a fair bit. The writing was at times quite clever and other times sounded realistic and sincere. I loved the narrator who added both seriousness and whimsy to the proceedings. I didn't care for the product placement of Ikea but I suppose it gives instant recognition as to what type of store it is. The audience I was with really responded to the movie: laughing, sighing and seeming to have a great time. I also enjoyed myself and smiled often. There are some really funny amusing scenes in this flick.The two leads were quite charming, enthusiastic and had a wonderful chemistry. He's been acting since he was a kid but I predict great things for Joseph Gordon Levitt as a leading man. As for Zooey Deschanel as Summer, she has the cool girl next door appeal with something extra that makes her somewhat unattainable yet hard to resist or dislike. She's not bad, she's just honest and doesn't seem to believe in love. The enjoyable secondary characters didn't have big roles but most did have a shining moment with my favorite secondary character being the mature insightful-beyond-her-years younger sister of the main character. The ending seemed a bit forced to me although clever. It could have been better although it does kinda make things come full circle. Actually, watching this again much later on DVD, I think it's close to a perfect ending and it's certainly memorable. I was also forgetting to mention the very nice choice of songs from the likes of Regina Spektor, the Smiths and other cool acts. I see I'm being rather critical but overall I really enjoyed 500 Days of Summer and the more I talked to it with my friend, the more it made me want to see it again. I could see this film gaining a cult following or being a sleeper hit. It's definitely worth watching preferably with someone of the opposite sex, whether you're romantically involved or not.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Exquisit romantic genre - a new approach,"Tom (Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love and is instantly attracted to a new office employee who, because of her parent's divorce has a damaged view on the emotion.5 years ago Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind was released, bringing about a revitalizing and refreshing taste of romance genre, a cutting edge approach which saw Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet struggle to remember when they last met owing to a dangerous memory procedure. Blending an edge of fantasy with the dramatic implications with real life was a stroke of genius, and here we see a similar approach as director Marc Webb uses real life story of guy meets girl and adds a sharp blend of diverse filming.One thing about romantic comedy dramas is that you know what you want from and the expectancy is set. 500 days is very much different from your average Hugh Grant flick though. For starters we see numerous fantasy montages, flashbacks, split screens and a wonderful music parody of the morning after and all will make you smile, laugh and even come the end, maybe shed a tear. The perfect use of justifying the genre is the split screen just past half way through where Tom goes to Summer's apartment with one side labelled expectations and the other reality. Without the aid of the forgettable narration we can see clearly into the young guy's mind, and there is no hint of hyperbole here, I struggle to recall anything that has been so well thought out in a romance film. It is staggering realistic and such a unique insight into a lonely guy's mind.Gordon-Levitt adds the charm to this scene but his quiet dreams and cheeky expressions will have viewers on his side. Deschanel is wonderfully kooky once more and though you may spite her in numerous scenes, everything has reason in the end.Speaking of which adds a wonderful comic touch and thank heavens doesn't go all soppy and conventional on us. Not since Lost in Translation has an ending in a romance been so well thought out.The pair of actors balances each other well with Tom's friends adding the comic touches; though his younger sister may seem funny it is quite unlikely her advice is as profound as she seems to think. As mentioned Mark Webb's directional debut brings about new touches with his ability to take the picture out of context into his own fantasy world without seeming too otherworldly, which is a great credit as these touches really are the keystone to this film's success.Where it fits amongst other big romantic comedies like When Harry met Sally, Eternal Sunshine and Titanic is difficult to say. It has such an adept approach to the genre and its diverse telling is exquisite and with such a likable cast and array of protagonists, it must certainly be up there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 Days isn't enough,"(500) Days of Summer is a simple story of boy meets girl. The boy Tom Hanson (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believed his whole life that he wouldn't be happy until he found the one. The girl Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) did not share this believe. Were told right off the bat that this is not a love story. Its is however intensely personal, for anybody who has ever experienced unrequited love, which is likely to be a large proportion of the people who were sitting in the cinema. Its a romantic comedy for all extensive purposes, but unlike you've ever seen before. (500) Days of Summer reverses the roles usually associated with character tropes and places Tom as its starry eyed dreamer who believes that true love is just around the corner. Summer, played the dude in this situation. She is just out to have fun and as a consequence they both end up in a destructive relationship.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Mark Weber's wry, non-linear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Mark (Gordon Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary Summer (Deschanel), Mark discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love The Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Mark is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Mark believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Mark, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Mark summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real.The film does an excellent job of creating its own sense of style. Before every outing we would see the day we going to. Their break up occurs withing the hundreds and therefore every time it passes that mark were prepared for tears and tantrums. Marc Webb (director) has made an outstanding movie, one that will make my top ten list by the end of the year, mainly due the the raw reality of it. You see a argument occur and its so realistic it almost becomes uncomfortable. Fortunatly the films wins you back round with its quirky sense of humor which had me in sticks constantly. The film seems to have a lot going for it, a great sense of realism, hilarious moments and some impeccable direction and characterization. Its a stunner on many levels none more so than the acting. Both Deschanel and Levitt do an outstanding job at being the fun likable characters the are at the start of the time line and then there almost seamless descent into struggling human beings. They bring life what could have been lifeless characters.Webb's direction is an absolute joy throughout, presenting the story in a series of inventive and original scenes that will stay with you long after you leave the cinema. Highlights include: a split-screen sequence that puts the reality of a party up against Tom's expectations; a French art-house film parody; and a simple but breathtakingly brilliant sequence where Webb uses the same four snapshot clips of Summer to illustrate both things Tom loves about her and later, things he hates about her. The tag line for the film sums it up perfectly: ""Boy meets Girl. Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" In addition, the narration insists early on that this is not a typical romcom; instead it's a beautifully written, modern day reworking of Annie Hall that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever had their heart broken. Needless to say, it also has a terrific soundtrack.Verdict: 500 days inst long enough. The warm friendly glow of this romantic comedy mixed with the harsh reality of life makes for something we haven't seen in a very long time. A charming, funny and wonderfully inventive romcom that's easily one of the best films of the year. It is so absolutely adorable that, as the ending credits were rolling, I had the overwhelming urge to wrap my arms around the movie and never let it go. 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 Days of Perfection...,"Every year, there's at least one movie that makes you reflect upon choices you've made in your own life, one which touches you on a personal level. Last year, that film was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This year, it's 500 Days of Summer. Deeply poignant, original, touching, and creative, Summer is a film which will stay in your mind for weeks to come. Directed by Marc Webb, one of the year's best movies also features stellar performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) believes in true love, in that one special person that everyone will find some day. Summer Flinn (Zooey Deschanel), however, does not. When Tom falls for Summer, a new intern at the greeting card company he works at, he knows it's love at first sight. Summer on the other hand remains skeptical.While there's a whole lot more to the plot than that short paragraph, to spoil it all here would definitely be quite a shame. There's lots of twists and turns, and an ending that ties everything together quite beautifully. The whole thing is done with so much care for the characters, and all of the fantastic realism that shines through just makes it all the better.The acting, for the most part, is what makes a film like this work so well, and this one is no exception. The two leads worked great off each other, showing raw emotion and talent all around. It's simply beyond me how Deschanel can go from a mediocre, predictable crapfest like Yes Man to a beautiful, original indie movie. Gordon-Levitt, as always, never ceases to impress, but he was definitely at his best in the this movie; it's quite possibly his best performance to date.The originality and creativity present in this movie is, honestly, the best thing about it. It's just so damn easy to fall in love with it. The setup of time passing, the cinematography, the inventive narration, hell, even the after-sex dance party in the streets were simply phenomenal. The whole production is just oozing with talent and creativity, and it's astounding to see it all unfold. It's so simple and so effective that it's very easy to be taken aback by the beauty of it all.I could probably rave about this movie for days. It was really that good. Just do the right thing: go out and see this indie film which has everyone talking. 500 Days of Summer is an early contender for best movie of the year. And if that doesn't get you to go check it out then I don't know what will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
after summer comes autumn,"500 days of summer directed by March Webb is interesting. Zooey Deschanel as Summer Finn believes in destiny and soul mates. Summer has no qualms of getting sexually and romantically involved with Tom Hansen (played by Joseph Gordon Levitt)who adores and worships the ground that Summer treads on. Summer is very honest right from the beginning about their relationship. She does not want what Tom wants. She believes in destiny and living a married life with someone she was destined to be a soul mate. It is difficult for Tom to imagine and believe that a soul mate is different from a romantically involved passionate individual. But then when Summer leaves Tom he realizes she believes in what she says. When he meets her after a few days , he is surprised that she is married, pregnant and totally content. His whole life and love revolved around Summer. Love comes in different ways. Love from a soul mate is totally different. It is special. Soul mate love draws positive energy, captures happiness and steadies the soul and the beating heart. This movie is different and very philosophical. Joseph Gordon Levitt as happy boyfriend and lucky to be with girl of his dreams did very well and evokes sympathy when Summer leaves him. Zooey Deschanel as Summer did a great job. Oscar worthy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good movie..experienced a full range of emotions....,"I really loved this movie. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that evoked such a wide range if feelings for me. I was expecting a ""chick flick"", but I don't think it fits that label. As a man I was pleased to see a side of relationships that's rarely really dealt with in movies. Tom was so easily relatable....and Summer accurately portrayed that capricious nature that I believe women often have that drives men crazy. She embodies what men are talking about when we say ""we don't understand women."" Relationships are not driven by thought or reason, but by feelings alone. I think this movie captured that perfectly...It was bittersweet, a satisfying experience in that I am now certain that my experiences in romance are shared, universal experiences that everyone probably goes through at least once in life.To describe this movie in one sentence, I might say ""it is based on several billion true stories"" - the most relatable film I have seen in a long time! The characters are deep, Joseph Gordon-Levitt embodies sweetness and sensitivity without sacrificing any masculinity; Zooey Deschanel is captivatingly beautiful and enigmatic as Summer. I think this movie was cast perfectly. I give it a 10/10! I recommend buying or renting the DVD! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Happiness in watchable form,"(500) Days of Summer is the best movie I've seen all year. It's the best movie I've seen since WALL-E. It just might be my favorite movie of all time. Movies this original, smart, and funny are so few and far between, it's easy to forget they even exist. When they do come along, it's worth celebrating. Which my theater did; the enthusiasm was comparable to that at the Dark Knight midnight showing. There was so much laughter, so many exclamations, and plenty of sighs. As for me, as I headed to my car after the show, I imagined how all the passing drivers must think I'm a strange duck, I had such a goofy smile plastered to my face. I couldn't help it: if happiness itself could be taken and made into a movie, (500) Days of Summer would be the result.I'll start with the screenplay. The nonlinear narrative structure allows for suspense (even when there seemingly shouldn't be) and plenty of laughs thanks to clever juxtapositioning of similar scenes happening at opposite ends of the relationship. The on screen counter, introductory paragraph, and final line all are fine examples of the offbeat but accessible wit which defines the film. The use of music is also fantastic; screenwriters sometimes are afraid to write specific songs into their screenplays for fear of seeming like they're trying to direct the movie, but every musical choice here is pitch-perfect (thus, my recent Amazon order for the soundtrack and newfound appreciation of Hall and Oates).I also really appreciated the unique visuals, whether it involves animated elements, split-screen, or black and white. The latter is used when the film breaks styles, becoming an artsy European film or a documentary, and it adds even more to the film's charm. I love when a movie can use interesting visuals to complement a solid foundation (such as Eternal Sunshine or The Fountain), and that's definitely the case here.Of course, a wonderful screenplay and cool visual tricks wouldn't do much for a romance if the leads weren't up to the task. Both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are extremely likable and funny in their roles. Their chemistry is subtle and believable, and they really deliver an exciting arc. I definitely found myself rooting for the relationship, even with the promise of it not working out.The thing that really cemented this film into a spot on my favorites list was the dance scene. I don't want to go into detail for fear of spoiling it, but the snippets in the trailer don't even begin to show the pure joy I received from watching that hilarity unfold. So brilliant.Basically, don't miss this movie. I drove an hour and a half to see it, and am seriously considering making the drive again. If there was ever a movie worth going out of your way to see, this is it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"A study of emotional maturity, or lack thereof...","I genuinely think this has one of the best screenplays ever. The way it employs the unreliable narration is transcendent, to say the least. Clues to the main character's unreliability are in plain sight, yet we can't help taking every chance to put the blame on Summer, simply because the ""love"" story is told from a one-sided perspective, that of the selfish character of Tom. With a ridiculous amount of charm, mostly derived from the electric chemistry between its two leads, and a slick non-linear narrative structure, (500) Days of Summer is disguised as a Romantic-Comedy with a new spin on the genre tropes, while it actually serves as a clever subversion of them that effortlessly fools us all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'm impressed.,"I'm impressed by this movie. At first I thought it would be just another romantic comedy, then I thought it would be a very good romantic comedy, and finally I found out it was something completely apart from all that. The narrator advised this wasn't a story of love, I grasped that as something they wouldn't play with, turns out he was right, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Not by a mere generic kind of way, the boy loses girl and that's that. We actually feel he has lost something, and something he had absolute chances of getting, actually, it's revolting. The two main roles are played naturally, the girl has a mystery going on throughout the entire film, we never get the feeling we completely understood her; the boy is more of an open book, a shy guy who lost much of his aspirations even though he had lots of potential.500 days of Summers actually refers to a girl named Summer and her relationship with the man-protagonist, from the first day, the day they met, until the last one. I would divide the film in three parts, two of them are the part with them getting along well and the one where they weren't, these two are interchanged during most of the film in no chronological order, for a good insight on their relationship overall. Until it reaches almost the end, the last part, and it starts following the correct order of events to finally come to an end. The support roles are pretty good as well, mainly with the guy's friends -- they share similar personalities with the protagonist. I also thought the comedy moments were great, lately I've been having some problems with comedies, they all seem rehashes and leave you with the feeling that you've heard or saw that one before, sometimes even many times before, that's something never actually occurred to me while watching this movie, even when you think that the main characters' overall personalities don't stray too much away from the romantic comedy cliché, but the way they are presented feels fresh.Well, so much for the heart-warming romantic comedy, even so this ends up being a very touching movie. It's just that it's more of an encouraging ""get out of your seat and so something"" style than it is a ""don't worry, everything's gonna be all right"". Either way, an amazing movie nonetheless, full of freshness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A charming and unique romantic comedy.,"Ah, a rom-com, every guys worst nightmare? Not necessarily, I've much love for a good romance story but I confess most of my favourites are from some decades ago, but I'm an open minded guy who is willing to give the more recent romance films a go (as long as they've got a few good reviews first). From the start the scene is set, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, there is no stuttering Hugh Grant slowly getting the girl of his dreams to fall for him, cue some catastrophe which makes it seem like they won't work but OH LOOK it's all OK in the end!! Nope. This is another one of those charming offbeat rom-coms that aren't afraid to be REAL. (Juno was undoubtedly last years gem). The opening monologue of the film declares this to be a 'Boy meets Girl' movie that isn't about love, however this simply isn't true. It's a story about love, loss and learning to move on.The movie revolves around Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who designs greeting cards for a living, he holds a degree in architecture but is yet to break free from the tethers of his meaningless job. Enter Summer ( Zooey Deschanel), new PA for Toms boss, and being so very beautiful and sweet it's only natural that Tom would fall in love with her at first sight. The films direction is what makes this tale so enthralling, the opening scene of the movie let's you know that it hasn't worked out; this match that is seemingly made in heaven just doesn't have the happy ending you will so desperately want to see. Instead the film swings like a pendulum throughout the time line of their relationship, one moment you will be in the early stages of their romance then you will be zipped forward in time to the depressing aftermath.So there you have the setting, what about the performances? Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fast becoming a favourite of mine, I recently read a quote from him about how he isn't in acting for the money, but rather the quality of the script, and well he may just be making the right choices for me to actually believe this. After picking two excellent scripts in Brick and Mysterious Skin he has made the right choice again, he brings a genuinely charming nature and confidence which makes him completely endearing to watch, but when the time calls he can bring a darker element to his acting . Zooey is sweet beyond words, one portion of the film brings a tongue in cheek testament to her beauty (I think the line was she is responsible for an average of 18.4 double takes a day from men), her natural girl next door looks combined with her dismissive views on love makes her the unattainable girl you feel you must makes yours. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, even in the most fleeting of conversations they have you feel the spark between them.The screenplay here is killer to, Marc Webb is handed a script that gives him much creative license. The breakaway scenes offer a bit of random comic relief, but my favourite is the morning after Toms sexual conquest when he walks down the street and bursts into a random song and dance number; the high fives, rocketing fountains and 'batting it out of the park' had me in complete stitches. Props have to be given to the soundtrack to, you have The Smiths, Doves, Regina Spektor and a few more I've probably missed, but they all fit the tone of the film so damn well.Anyways, suffice to say I really enjoyed this. It's the type of film I think we need more of to break the monotony of the generic rom-com.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
just when you were sure you were the only sad soul,"(500) Days of Summer, is a journey on numbness, happiness and the most profound sadness, love can take someone through. It's not a movie for everyone though, but for those who identify themselves with a heart that has never been one, and who sometimes feel as it a heart has never really been there, I think it's a truly enjoyable film, that gives you a sense of hope, like you're not the only one who feels that way, and gets you thinking that maybe it's not that crazy waiting to find true love.

With an exception to a very over the top dance sequence with an animated bird.(but that was exceptionally brilliant scene.)

Summer Loving had me a blast!,"This is not a movie review, it is my punfested non-linear take on my 95 minute experience viewing & digesting the groundbreaking romantic comedy of the year ""500 Days of Summer"". 26th minute- Wow, I am flabbergasted that this witty romantic comedy does not construct itself with the standard cinematic norm of most other films by continuing to reveal the plot in a non-chronological system. 74th minute- Joseph Gordon-Levitt's starring performance as Tom, the ""hopeless romantic"" greeting card writer has to be considered for a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the authenticity he invokes in the character. 6th minute- God, Zooey Deschanel is so hot! Nominate her for a Best Actress Oscar for just prettiness magnetism alone. 62nd minute- Zooey is not just an ""acquired taste"" bombshell but she also delivers a restrained but accurate performance as Summer, the greeting card administrative assistant which Tom romances even though she does not reciprocate the same romantic stance towards him throughout most of the relationship. 34th minute- How cool! An entertaining Karaoke scene in the movie, you just don't get enough of good ones in movie scenes these days. 80th minute- Director Mark Webb's definitely has me caught up in his atypical web of developing a romance with a foreseeable breakup where boy is much more into it than girl, we as male species have all been there. Mark gets high marks from me for his auteur efforts here. 23rd minute- How cool! That is The Smith's ""There is a Light That Never Goes Out"" that Tom is listening to on his headphones in the elevator. I love that song and so far this movie! 1st minute- I hope ""500 Days of Summer"" lives up to all the hype people have been buzzing about this presumed creative movie. 58th minute- Man, I gotta go pee but I do not want to miss a second of this overwhelmingly creative movie. 58th and a half minute- OK, I am back, wow that was one of the fastest urinal releases I have had in my life; I hope I did not wet my pants with the quick shake (T.M.I. Alert!) 81st minute- Scott Neustadter & Michael Weber's super clever screenplay of this movie is my favorite so far this year in that department. Man, I know I could have revealed my feelings for that in a more witty fashion. I was just flabbergasted with the verbal wit of Scott and Michael's screenplay which has left me relatively punless. 66th minute- Feeling the thespian love of the commendable supporting performances of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's greeting card colleague & pal McKenzie and Clark Gregg as Tom's evenhanded supervisor Vance. 53rd minute- I hope I get at least a semi-nude glimpse of Zooey's left breast in this sex scene between Tom & Summer. 95th minute- ""500 Days of Summer"" will most certainly be in my Top 10 List at year's end! Loved it! 96th minute- Did I valet my parking pass? Dizzy? Sorry! Nevertheless, the right order you should take is to go to the movies and feel the innovative warmth of ""500 Days of Summer"". ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I suppose the film has achieved something, in terms of a reaction, because years after watching it, I still shudder when it pops up as a suggestion on Amazon (which it just did). How feeble minded and stupid does someone have to be to act like he did? Like, wake up, gormless, and have some self respect. And as for her, I despise her so much that that actress, who is never seen in anything before, I cannot and will not watch in anything ever again.

Impressive Non-linear Editing,"Opening narration, ""This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story."" First impression: was the romantic comedy genre being toyed with?—as if what I were about to see was a pseudo, unorthodox love story masked with conventional love story elements? My assumption was right and wrong in two separate contexts. First, the film's non-linear editing style reminded me of the gimmicks of ""Memento""—that is, would the story have been nearly as compelling were it not for its editing? Conversely, play the film in linear motion: would it fall to pieces? Editing has the most powerful effect on the viewer's cinematic experience next to acting. The editing of ""500 Days,"" though thoroughly engaging, did not, however, make the film.Renoir once said that editing is directing for the second time: it makes or breaks your experience. In the case of both films, I believe ""Memento"" would have bombed were it not for Dody Dorn, but ""500 Days"" would have still soared even with an exempted, non-linear style. The answer: the writing was too smart, even though Neustadter & Weber had to earn my respect. I anticipated something cheap and contrived (like the far too sophisticated, purely obnoxious and childish antics of ""Juno""). I had to be converted, and slowly though, I was.The juxtaposition of scenes strengthened the quality of the film. I loved the truthfulness of the characters: first identifying what he loves about Summer (cut with parts of her body), later slabbed against what he hates about her (again, cut with the same footage). It holds true to the platitude: familiarity breeds contempt. The editing also worked with the split screen ""Reality vs. Expectation"" sequence. The differences between both screens were subtle yet terribly sincere, terribly true. I laughed out loud several times. I enjoyed the active participation and socially savvy relationship pedestals the writers invited me to celebrate & mourn.There was also a healthy blend of realism and fantasy as depicted through the expressionistic personification & musically emotive ""after-sex"" scene. Walking out of his apartment, everything is fresh and vibrant: smiles all around from on watchers. Suddenly it breaks out into song and dance and we're watching ""Zippity Doo-Dah."" It was fun! There were moments where the dialogue was cliché but the acting and conceptual vocation held by Gordon-Levitt made it worthy of endurance. Come to think of it, Levitt's on-screen career made some of the cliché dialogue wonderfully ironic and that much more compelling.The editing style, again, brought us back & forth through the polar spectrum of emotions: ""She loves me, She loves me not"" syndrome. Frankly, Summer was young and happy-go-lucky; not focusing upon dating labels or destinations, but purely enjoying the ride at Levitt's expense—very obnoxious but true. I guess that's a reflection of my willingness to fully commit in relationships rather than play the part with all the benefits without the labels. Overall, the film worked. I won't be surprised if it's up for Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
500 days of hating summer,"I am not a romantic comedy fan but this film is something different,Joseph gordon levitz is an awesome actor and i hope he starts getting lead parts in movies now,and the chick who plays summer is good too. But even though this is a great movie the trailer makes it look a whole lot funnier,its actually kind of a bummer movie,it doesn't have a really happy ending and summer is twisted,contradictive,ignorant,unsympathetic and kinda backstabbing bitch,they could have did a better job of making her character likable. I do have to give props to the writer to beable to write the screen play in the narrative he does which goes in the way of switching between timelines during the course of the film,its very interesting and must have been complicated. All in all its a very interesting and original romantic comedy film with great acting ,but its just summer i promise you will find yourself hating her guts in this movie which to me is the downfall because in the end its just crappy you find yourself routing for tom but it never really happens. but i guess the writer was going for realism because i guarantee you will beable to relate to it for sure.Definitely see this movie but be prepared to be a little bummed about stupid summer but also be prepared for autumn.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
