An Epic in every sense of the word.,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A standing ovation for all concerned.,"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Magnificent epic,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A True Fantasy Movie,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"If you're a fan, that's not about to change.","Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Wooded Claw...,"The quest to melt the ring in Doom continues, as two Hobbits and a Gollum lacking sinews, crossing marshes full of dread, towards the Black Gate's where they head, and then they're captured by the brother, of one once dear (although he was somewhat affected by the ring before expiring). After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

My precious...,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep.

The story - and the heightism - continues,"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Hail The Heroes!,"Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An excellent addition to the series,"Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Helm's Deep could be the greatest battle sequence of all time.,"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them.

If there was a spotlight for all time movie reviews it would be this trilogy-to-be-one film,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that),10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My personal favourite of the trilogy,"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here.When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great One,"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"good film, but a letdown","The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.Director Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.Now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies.  The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.Being Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present.  That is not the case.Instead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie.  There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight.  These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.There's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months.  Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out.  But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick.  In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.Complaints aside, this is still a fun movie.  For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not.  Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing.  I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece.  This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick.  Fun movie?  Yes. Great special effects? Yes.  Another classic?  No.On a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.10/10 - On my top 10 of best films",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series.  Oh well--- if wishing were having...Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A magical film.,"Frodo and Sam continue with their dangerous journey, desperately trying to reach Mordor to destroy the ring, aided by Gollum, who is still conflicted about helping the hobbits.Where do you even start to unpick and comment on a film such as The Two Towers?Epic in every sense, this brilliant film will entertain and thrill you, astonish and move you. This one had me gripped from start to finish, I love the journey, but it's the ending that makes this film so incredible.The battle scenes are astonishing, some of the visuals even now are jaw dropping, the assembled armies look phenomenal. It is pretty much non stop action, for a long film, your attention will be held.The acting, as good as it gets, McKellen, Mortensen and Hill are all considered tremendous, and rightly so. I have to give credit to the magic of Christopher Lee, his very presence and delivery still give me chills, what an actor.Andy Serkis, off the scale, every single Gollum scene was flawless, the voice and visuals are tremendous, what an interesting and successful realisation.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
FilmCreature Reviews 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers',"You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.4/4.

Tough to put on film but came out very well,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"This Does Not Improve With Each Sequel, The Second One Could Have Been Better","This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.On the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sméagol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor.Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I'll review all three at once...,"I love J.R.R.Tolkien. I've read the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit...hmmm...at least 100 times. Honestly. From the time I was 7 years old, these have been my favorite books. And all his other writings. Heck, I even speak three dialects of Elvish and can write in dwarf runes and the runes of Daeron.... I'm a big Tolkien geek.And I understand that these books are impossible to adapt completely to film. But c'mon! Make an effort! These are beautifully shot, though filled with lots of CGI (which I detest). Beautiful scenery, able direction and OK acting. You would think I could give it at least 5 stars. I can't, and here's why: Don't make stuff up. Really. Whoever wrote this screen play is a servant of Sauron. What's with all the invention? It's a fantasy FILLED with fabulous work. Tolkien was a master storyteller. This screenwriter (unless there were several, in which case much is made clear. Nothing good ever comes from committee) really needed to leave well enough alone.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest of the Three Rings,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Possibly the best Middle Chapter Ever,"Along with The Godfather Part 2 and The Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers is the perfect middle chapter. While not a perfect film, as a movie with no concrete beginning or ending, it tells a masterful story and keeps the audience wanting more.Some characters are severally underdeveloped (mostly new ones) and it's a bit slow at times. But besides these more major complaints, the film is a masterpiece. As with the last film, the acting is great, the effects are groundbreaking (Gollum changed CGI), and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. The dialogue works really well to. The movie is simply filled with iconic moments.Some complain about the battle of Helms Deep being to long but let's be honest, it is really one of the best battle scenes in cinematic history. I believe that the Lord of the Rings trilogy are the greatest films of this century.

A Shout Out to WETA!!!  Truly Awesome!,"First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever.  However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them.  They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.Bottom Line:10/10!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I'm Glad That I'm Around For This One.....,"I don't know Peter Jackson, and I've never been to New Zealand, but after the experience of this film, I don't need to.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS is one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, movies ever made.Jackson wisely does not attempt to duplicate the books--that would be artistic suicide because Tolkien's trilogy is unfilmable.  Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity.The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell.  J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision.  Every character is a prototype.Frodo is the hero on a great quest.  Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero.  Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth.  Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same.  Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale.  The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed.

The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...,"Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Unbelievable,"This movie is a first rate epic.  From start to finish, it delivers the essence of Tolkien and his world.

He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real.  That's why I think it's unbeliveable.  How could this happen?

LOTR TTT Review,"In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.Picking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.The story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.As before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.The Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...The Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect <> Story: Perfect <> Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Good but not the best,"Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. ""Impossible"", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt,"" admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard.

All Times Oscar for Effects!,"Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.However, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next  time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-)People who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now!It is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Why make movies based on something you don't like?,"The problem with this movie is that Peter Jackson seem to believe that Middle- earth is somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy or on board James Camerons Titanic. Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it ""bigger and better"". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he ""spice it up"" with a ""dramatic"" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like ""Look it's the king!"" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of ""fun"" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A very good, great, fantastic, awesome film!","What a great movie. Through the first movie, we already had the whole story set-up, so in The Two Towers in really pick's up.There is not one thing about this movie that I would change. Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel.This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect. And isn't afraid to use them. The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding.The scene's with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river.The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo.The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part. And he proves to have much to do with the plot this time.All in all, this is a fantastic movie. Rivaled only by The Return of the King.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Compelling,"Thank You Peter Jackson.  These films are absolutely magical.  The Two Towers has flaws, but is still a great experience of a movie.  I looked at some of those who post to slam this film.  One said that when he buys the movie he would use scene selection to skip over the parts he didn't like.  I suppose the irony was lost on that one.  I also saw a lengthy slam where the poster stated that on the two viewings he had of the film people were laughing at golem.  I love this film, but I have only seen it once.So do you see...  this is a great movie.  Even those who hate it can't look away.  Even though it betrays their personal take on the books, there is magic on the screen that keeps them coming.I will buy the DVD promptly Aug 26th.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Pretty darned good but...,"...not as good as Fellowship. Loved Smeagol - more expressive than most of the human actors in the film. But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?Also, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.But, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps. I expected Huey Lewis and the News to kick in.That aside, I will watch the DVD over and over but I'm hoping the extended version, as with Fellowship of the Ring, will iron out the pacing problems and give us more character study to balance the action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Peter Jackson does it again, pure screen magic!","Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Two Towers"". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Part Two:  An Examination of Trust, Intention, and Goodness","The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced  Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent  a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity  Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and  from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"This is short, unlike the movie","A decent movie, worse than the first in the trilogy and equally not deserving of the hype it has gotten.

Tokien's spirit has been exorcised from his story like Saruman from Theodin in the film.,"I didn't realize when I watched Fellowship of the Ring exactly to what degree the whole ""men are weak"" modification would snowball out of control. Faramir is the latest sad casualty to this overall change to the original story.Also the Ents could have been better handled.I could go on with this line of criticism but why bother.  If you haven't read the books (heck, even if you have...) and believe that the Lord of the Rings is your typical superficial, without a shred of subtelty Good vs. Evil story and that the upshot is that some short people need to throw a ring in a volcano, and that entertains you, then you may enjoy this film.If your looking for something more transcendent you will be disappointed. The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in.  Why aren't they more up-front about this?Oh well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Better Paced than the first, the battle for Isengard was excellent","We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense.The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing.  The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

*Epic Resurgence: The Two Towers and the Heart of Middle-earth*,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is not merely a sequel; it is a bold crescendo in a grand symphony that echoes with the trials and triumphs of good against evil. From its breathtaking landscapes to its profound character arcs, this film is an immersive experience that cements its place in cinematic history.Peter Jackson's masterful direction takes us deeper into J. R. Tolkien's rich world, exploring themes of hope, betrayal, and resilience. The unparalleled visual effects transport viewers to the depths of Helm's Deep and the lushness of Fangorn Forest, creating a visual feast that amplifies the emotional stakes of the story. The battle sequences are nothing short of monumental; they're not just displays of brute strength but a testament to camaraderie and the sacrifice of countless souls-blurring the lines between victory and loss.At the heart of The Two Towers lies the evolution of its characters, especially Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Frodo. Viggo Mortensen embodies Aragorn's internal struggle with destiny and leadership with nuance, while Orlando Bloom breathes life into Legolas, his agility and wisdom perfectly complementing Gimli's boisterous bravery, played by John Rhys-Davies. And then there's Gollum-a hauntingly complex figure brought to life with groundbreaking CGI and Andy Serkis's brilliant performance. His duality captivates and evokes sympathy, representing the darker sides of desire and obsession.The film intricately weaves the threads of hope amid despair. As our heroes face insurmountable odds, The Two Towers reminds us that the bonds of friendship and courage shine brightest in the darkest of times. The emotional depth is heightened by Howard Shore's sweeping score, which resonates long after the credits roll, evoking a lingering sense of wonder and reflection.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an extraordinary cinematic journey that transcends the conventional sequel. It captures the essence of Tolkien's work-an enduring struggle against the shadows that linger in our hearts. Masterful, monumental, and truly unique, this film is not just a chapter in a saga; it is a revelation of the indomitable spirit of Middle-earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Middle Earth goes to war,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in ""Return of the King"" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The ""Two Towers"" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

With that said, the special effects were brilliant, and the cinematography superior. But for the life of me, I cannot understand the affection for the main Hobbit characters, they're boring, boring and more boring. The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show.

"""The stories that stay with you""","Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty ""wow"" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough – or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Good - but far from perfect.,"Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film.  It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production.  That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows.  Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into.  You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.Anyway.  CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right.  Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer.  I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime.  CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?).  Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done.  However, the artists could have done with actually ""looking"" at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film.  Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&Dragons this isn't much to brag about.  However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable.  Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly ""Dragonlance Chronicles"" (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.It's an 8.

More action-packed than the previous movie...,"First of all, I must say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was significantly more easy to sit through than ""The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", as this movie had more action, and wasn't as slow-paced with as much storytelling and setting the mood as the first movie did.Needless to say that you need to watch the first movie prior to watching this 2002 sequel, unless you want to be missing out on a great deal of information about the characters and the storyline.As a direct continuation of the previous movie ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was a nice upscale in pace, and I must admit that I was enjoying this a lot more than the previous movie.While ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is driven by a solid story and character development, much like the first movie, then ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" adds a much needed element of action and fantasy battles.It shouldn't be necessary to say that you are in for a grand adventure when you sit down to watch ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"", especially if you are a fan of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre, which I happen to be.And it was marvelous to have the original cast return to perform their roles again, making for a wonderful continuation of the storyline, and not having to adjust to a new face on an already established character.Definitely well worth taking the time to sit down and watch the extended version. Just keep about 4 hours free for it. I am rating ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" a well-deserving seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The movie is an insult to the book.,"The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers, simply put, is a travesty of monumental proportions. This may sound like a tired cliche but so is the production of this movie. The sheer arrogance to mess around with the greatest story put to print is unbelievable. The changes in the story and characters go far beyond interpretation and seem to suggest that Mr Jackson simply feels that Tolkien got it wrong. Peter Jackson's movie embodies all the disdain that Tolkien had for Hollywood, but I guess the money makes it easy to live with, and he claims to be a fan. Read the book, miss the film.

Life enhancing,"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better","I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: ""Gollum"" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A visual masterpiece and better than the first,"So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.When we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking ""tree herder"" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.These three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.The pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.Still, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My favorite of the trilogy!,"The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books.The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.Out of 100, I gave it 88.

One of the greatest movies of all time,"This movie was simply amazing. Great casting, great acting. The way this movie stuck to the book is hard to match by any movie.

Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious.

Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy,"Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Boring,"The only redeeming quality of this film was the epic battle sequences.  A pornography of violence is the only thing that saved this film from being terribly boring.The characters were very flat.  Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books).  For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche.  From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.The only interesting character was Golum.  He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.The dialogue in this movie offered nothing.  It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.Well.  I don't want to think much more about this movie.  I think it was terrible.  The fighting scenes and animation were cool.  Perhaps the ""acting"" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The worst of what is ultimately the best trilogy of all time,This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Raises the bar,"This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Freeking amazing Movie, review from a movie pro","The people who vote against this movie or didn't see it, or just hate it for hatred. This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with ""political"" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
As good as the first,"Actually, it's better than the first!First off, see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" or you won't be able to make heads or tails out of this.

The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.

What is Jackson smokin?,"Let me just say to the Tolkien fans out there that love Jackson's treatment, yet, with the same breath, blast Bakshi's version. What is wrong with you?? Yeah, Bakshi took SOME liberties but at least he kept to the story of FOTR and TT. Jackson, at points, seems to be telling a completely different tale and re-writing characters when it amuses him.I didn't think it was possible to make Tolkien boring but, unhappily, Jackson's TT proved me wrong. I wasn't the only one checking my watch many times during the film. I noticed several people in the audience doing the same.Now, I will say I did like the Director's Cut version of FOTR. However, I hated TT so much that I doubt I will even find the DC version appealing.Please, don't label me a purist, as that suggests unwillingness to accept different visions or interpretations of Mr. Tolkien's work. I do not mind changes being made to the story --- when they are good ones. However, Mr. Jackson and his gang of ink flinging scribes are not sophisticated enough writers to make these changes work or ring true.The wafer-thin melodrama he adds into TT, in order to build suspense, is laughable and obvious. Aragorn getting carried over the cliff edge was nothing more than another Hollywood cliche, already seen hundreds of times in other films, meant to keep the viewing masses on the edge of their seats.

"Second installment, great DVD, story a bit muddled, a movie mainly for ""Ring"" fans.","Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary...""As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. ""I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the ""Ringheads"" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long.

The film picks up where its predecessor, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, with the Fellowship broken and scattered and the forces of darkness closing in on Middle-earth.As the film unfolds, we follow the separate journeys of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) as they make their way towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, and of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they try to rescue Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) from the clutches of the evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and the orc army.The film is a masterclass in world-building and visual storytelling, with Jackson and his team of talented artists and designers bringing to life the breathtaking landscapes of Middle-earth and the terrifying armies of orcs and uruk-hai. The film's action sequences are thrilling and intense, with standout moments including the epic Battle of Helm's Deep and the tense confrontation between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog.But what really sets The Two Towers apart is its exploration of themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the power of friendship. As the characters face impossible odds and grapple with their own doubts and fears, their bonds with one another are tested and strengthened, creating emotional moments that are both heart-wrenching and uplifting.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a riveting and unforgettable chapter in one of the greatest film trilogies of all time.

It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.The creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories.

From storyline to metaphor, costume to makeup, background to scenery, sound to music, cast to crew, cinematography to acting, there's not a single box it doesn't tick.Storyline has rugged layers (often interpreted as conflicts) which movies rely on. A journey to Mount Mordor is fraught with dangers, perils and treachery. All these are amplified by each and single character's struggle and pain, which are finally overcome by love, trust, courage, determination, friendship and companionship.Seasoned and accomplished actors have undoubtedly demonstrated those traits. Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving and many others have all played an exceptional role in living their characters, so much so that the strong cast in LOTR trilogy has made its The Hobbit trilogy sequel a lackluster.Costume and makeup are well toned in that they fit perfectly with the characters. Women's dresses, men's armors, cookware and even the cute lembas bread all resemble those in ancient Roman Empire times. The acoustics of its sound and music and the grandeur in fighting scenes are simply breathtaking, striking a remarkable resemblance to Troy (2004), making it literally a legendary ancient war movie.As usual I would like to touch on the metaphor of each movie simply because good films should always do more than just describing the story. They need to convey the underlying message. Human's greed and craving for power is demonstrated throughout, not just by the evil spirit but also by those with a good heart. After all we live in a real world full of deceit and temptations. Yet it is those characters like courage, determination, caring and compassion that see us through. A lot of people say Samwise Gamgee is the unsung hero and I totally agree with that. His unfailing loyalty and faithfulness to his friend Frodo Baggins unchallenged bring a tear or two to his audiences. He just has an adorable chubby face I want to pinch - in a fond way of course.Once again I must mention the filming locations that inspired me to re-watch and re-review this show. I want to give special thanks to Hobbiton Movie Set Tours for showing me the cute Hobbit village. The Hobbit houses, the hills, the trees, the grasses, the bridge, and the water mill are all fondly reflected in the movie. That is probably one of the reasons for traveling the world to stamp those filming locations. One goof I must point out though - in the closing scene when Samwise Gamgee walks back to his house with his family, the actor actually bends down over the door frame because the hobbit houses are quite low while the actors are in real size...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I screamed so many times,"When Aragorn falls off the cliff, when legolas jumps on the horse, when legolas slides on the shield, shooting arrows, when Gandalf advents with Eomer's army, and so many other times. I cried at many scenes: when Sam tells that he fights for something good left in the world, when Haldir's army arrives right before the war, honoring the alliance, and when Haldir dies in Aragorn's arm. I laughed at any scene with Gimli in it (He's such a joy in this whole series) and with Ents being so slow. 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' makes you feel so many emotions.Of course, the movie quality is just perfection: story, camera, setting, acting, and everything else. Especially, longs shots of nature and wilderness is majestic and brings the whole story to its root: Middle-Earth. War sequences overwhelm me every single time. However, the strongest advantage of this movie is that it invites viewers into their journey. I am in other place at other time fighting the war with hobbits, elves, wizards, men, and dwarves. Portraying the war in this movie is fantastic technically, but making me feel like I AM a part of this war is just perfection.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Wow, absolutely fantastic","I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". Needless to say I was pretty excited because for as long as I can remember I've been a great admirer of Tolkien and huge fan of the first Lord of the Rings film. I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. The story line picks up where Jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (I'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.)Merry and Pippin have managed to escape from the Orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: Ents, trees that can move and speak.Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to rescue Merry and Pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, Gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. After being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of Rohan where Saruman holds the King in an evil spell. After freeing the king they must prepare for Saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. The Battle of Helm's Deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (Peter Jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.)Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mordor but find themselves lost. After an encounter with the creature Gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, Frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let Gollum guide them. Gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called Smeagol. In the movie 'The Two Towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within Gollum. Smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and Gollum the bad. These scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level.And of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal Arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved Aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of King Theoden, the strong and noble Eomer who will do anything for Rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister Eowyn who develops feelings for Aragorn; and lastly Faramir, the brother of the late Boromir, now Captain to Gondor.This movie didn't feel like a movie. I honestly felt as though I had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. It was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'The Two Towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. It is perfectly carried through. There was not a moment I didn't savour - I didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance I get. If anything, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. And although I understand this movie isn't for everyone, I still highly recommend it to all. I give it a 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Magnificent second part,"The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
As good as the first one!,"And that's saying a LOT, seeing as how I rated that a 10+/10. And I normally have little interest in the whole ""Sword & Sorcery"" genre, so my high praise means even more than usual. They were wise to film all three LOTR movies at the same time, for it means the 2nd follows the style of the first seamlessly. These are truly labors of love, every aspect of these films are crafted with exquisite care, it is obvious that all the people involved, from the producers, actors and directors on down wanted to spare no effort to pay full homage to Tolkien's classic works. There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here. And, just as with the first, the sheer amount of detail, the vastness of the story, is almost overwhelming, these clearly are movies that can be seen many times because there's so much to be absorbed. It's a shame this (like its predecessor) will probably be snubbed for Best Picture Oscar because it's obvious to anyone other than a complete dullard that these are landmark films whose appeal will long outlast the other Oscar contenders10+/10",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Impressive looking,"This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""a good-looking creation albeit not much else""","The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"With strong world building, emotional gravitas, and excellent action, The Two Towers is another good example of a well done sequel","(Merry Christmas, everybody!)Taking place where The Fellowship of the Ring left off, Frodo and Sam journey to Mordor together to destroy the One Ring before making an alliance with Gollum later on. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli follow the orcs who took Merry and Pippin while also making an alliance with the Riders of Rohan. Later on, they would make plans to escort the people to Helm's Deep were they will fight against them.The story in this movie is not only a very faithful adaptation like the last film, but it's also effective in it's emotional gravitas and world building. That way, it helps you learn the situation the broken Fellowship are into and their plans to fight back against the Orcs. Plus the themes of family and overcoming their prejudices are well executed. Howard Shore continues to make haunting beautiful music that enchanted the action and atmosphere of Middle Earth.The production design and costumes are as beautiful as ever, the direction and editing are very sharp, and the action choreography is superb especially in Helm's Deep. And then there's the strong acting from everyone involved.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin go great together as did Andy Serkis as Gollum (in his solid motion capture). Viggo Mortenson, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys Davies, Ian Mckellon, Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan also did great. Other actors like Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Bernard Hill did very superb job.Overall, The Two Towers is a great continuation of the cinematic trilogy and still holds up after 20 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Surprising premiere...worth the waiting!,"Who could ever imagine that the audience in Indonesia would be the first to watch The Two Towers? No one, including me. I have no idea why, maybe by mistake, maybe on purpose, it played this weekend on screen in one theater in Bandung, Indonesia. Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than ""fellowship of the ring"" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic,"There is one word that can describe 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' : incredible. The best epic movie of all times. The stories blend in with each other, forming the scenery of Middle earth in war. The characters, tempted by the power of the ring, straggle between the good and the bad. The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning.

"Spectacular, Surpasses ""Fellowship""","My wife and I saw this film at a Carleton College benefit in Minneapolis December 13 (one of the executive producers, Barrie Osborne, graduated from Carleton in 1966).  We saw ""Fellowship"" at a similar fundraising event last year.  Like ""Fellowship"" the attention to detail on this film was exquisite and the whole affair was masterfully produced and directed.  I was never a big fan of the books, but I would say that ""The Two Towers"" was in every way a better film than ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  When the battle of Helm's Deep began, I was certain that the film would end there; and that we would end up with  a ""cliff-hanger"" ending, and a film that was only a come-on for the next installment.  But ""The Two Towers"" was, on its own, complete and satisfying.  The Battle of Helm's Deep was an astonishing cinematic achievement all by itself; and that is only 1/3 of the movie.  If you liked the first one, you'll love this one.  If you loved the first one, get some friends to go with you so they can carry you out of the theater.  You'll have the time of your life.  This is grand, epic filmmaking.  This is why they invented movies.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I rally wanted to love this movie.,"I really really wanted to love this movie.  I loved Fellowship, I found it nearly flawless.  I give a 10/10 for the acting and the special effects.

Some of the changes detracted from this movie, but not terribly.But the fundemental changed made to Faramire (compare him in the book to the movie - not merely changed but the opposite) seriously undermined the whole plot of the trilogy.Still, I have this an 8/10.  On its own merits, it is excellent.  But changes were made that weakened the story for no good reason...",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great on several levels,"""The Two Towers"" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in ""Fellowship"") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as ""actors"", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic ""sweep"", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as ""Smeagol/Gollum"" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.I think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the ""dullness"" comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's ""dullness"" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called ""filmmaking"", along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Number two with two (towers),"Peter Jackson and his mission - well not his mission, but the mission of our Fellowship (well you get the picture and no pun intended). This is part two and it holds up pretty well to say the least. The movie has the New Zealand landscapes and tries to put as much of the book into the movie as possible.I never read the books, I did try to read the Hobbit before the movies came out ... which I failed to do - but the movies are really well done. Yes Peter got money, but the work he did for it ... not sure if he has health issues because of all the planning and work he had to do for the Tolkien universe he created ... but he did a really good job to say the least.This begins where the first movie left off - and the group will have more adventures, but also has to go different paths - to cover more ground (no pun intended), but also have different stories and people to meet. In the extended edition I watched (actually rewatched because I had seen the theatrical and the longer cut back in the day), you can see even more stuff - and new characters ... well new in the sense that in some cases you get a character that otherwise only pops up in the third movie. But the whole thing makes more sense that way.If you listen to the old commentaries (which are fun and plenty), they do talk about DVDs - if you are baffled: they are discs that look like Blu Rays or 4K discs ... but had way less capacity on them ... also a weaker overall image and sound. But while that part may not have aged well - the movie itself has aged well - it really looks good to say the least. And if you are into Fantasy movies ... well the only thing that remains to be answered: you want to read the books first if you haven't or dive into this? Of course then there is also the new Prime show - which I will dive into sometime in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My favorite of the 3 movies,"I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy.  Why?  I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us.  Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it.  Very well done in this sense.  Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background.  When Eomer delivers the line....""Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands."" it still gives me goose bumps.  Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...""Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone."" Awesome....Some other awesome things I loved about this movie:-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!!  I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)I think I'll watch it again tonight",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Epic, spectacular and thrilling, but also flawed.","In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'7 1/2 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Vastly better than the first film - Jackson's Empire Strikes Back!,"The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up.  Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin.  However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden.  Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard.  Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.The plot sounds plain confusing.  And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it.  But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well.  He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better.  On top of this the film's pace is much more even.In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy.  Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax.  It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first.  Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well.  All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work.  Also the comedy was inserted nicely.  Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters.  The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur.  The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character.  However the animation is superb.  Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast.  He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous.  After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others.  In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo.  I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped.  The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick.  Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly.  Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!?  Generally the acting is very good.  In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with.  Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film.  Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch.  Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around.  Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The weakest of this trilogy is still excellent,"Admittedly, I think The Two Towers is quite easily the weakest movie in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's cursed to sit as a stopgap between the immensely satisfying and exciting first installment, and the epic and emotional final film. However, when its inherent disadvantage is taken into account, it's pretty incredible that it's as good as it is.And The Two Towers is still very, very good. Everything that was of high quality in the first movie is still on display here, as far as all the technical aspects go. It does also have an amazing final hour, with the Battle of Helm's Deep being one of the best single large-scale battles depicted in recent film history. It's exciting no matter how many times you see it. The Two Towers is also the film that introduces Gollum, and it's impressive how well he holds up as a CGI character over 20 years later.The only way The Two Towers suffers a bit is through its pacing. It expands the scope of the series considerably in a very short amount of time, and it always feel jarring being introduced to so many new characters while also coming to terms with the fact that all the previously established characters are off doing their own thing.It makes The Two Towers feel a little messier and less compelling when compared to the other two movies, but if you watch all the films within a short amount of time, it fits in well with the other movies. Assessed as its own film, it probably has the most flaws, but if judged purely as a stepping stone between film #1 and film #3, it's absolutely a success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
As good as the first.,"This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great.  It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time.  This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters.  The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best.  The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story.  I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf.  Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1.  I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3.  I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite.  It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Best of the Trilogy,"This part of the trilogy has the lot and as good as the other 2 parts are...Two Towers just delivers delivers delivers.
Just a quick note this review relates to the extended addition which is (as they all are) the superior version of the film.There is drama, action, romance, humour, mystery, fun, delight and...The Battle of Helms Deep.This is a magnificent piece of film that is wrapped up within the Two Towers....its like finding bonus bacon inside a cheeseburger.Mmmm cheeseburger!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Disappointing,"As a fan of LOTR before it came out in paperback and of the first film, I was disappointed in the sequel. Tolkien gets lost in all the mugging for the camera, uglified folks, and computer-battle scenes.

Frodo Baggins and the other members of the Fellowship continue on their sacred quest to destroy the One Ring,"The second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is two stories - one is that of Frodo and Sam making their painful way to Mordor with Gollum as a guide and that part is tedious to the extreme while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are having a much more exciting time at the Battle of Helm's Deep. In true middle-volume form, the tone of this movie is quite dark. The Fellowship has been broken, and things seem to grow ever worse for its fragments as they pursue their separate quests, until the plot ends abrubtly with yet another turn for the worse. It may be typical of trilogies for the second volume to take the story ever-darker, but here the story gets more complex. This one has the war of Helm's Deep, and you know things are going to get worse before they get better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"too much of a ""good"" thing","I have to say, up front, that I really liked Fellowship of the Ring a lot.  But that movie was three hours long, as is Two Towers.   Return of the King is three and a half hours.  I understand Peter Jackson considers this to be ""one"" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended ""special"" editions) hour movie.  That is simply excessive, IMHO.  Anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason.  When you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- I don't care how good the original was.  Maybe Godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception. But FOTR and TTT are not that good.FOTR had a more captivating story line.  It was about a small band of brothers on a difficult and daring quest -- to destroy the dangerous ring of power.  TTT doesn't have as good of a story line.  There is a fundamental problem from the start.  It makes no sense that Frodo and Sam would be left to go to Mordor on their own.  Why would all three of the fellowship's best warriors -- Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli -- go off to save Pippin and Merry, and not one of them stay with Frodo and Sam?  This makes NO SENSE, and the fact that Tolkien wrote it that way is no excuse.  Isn't the destruction of the ring more important, in the scheme of things, than saving Merry and Pippin?  Why not send at least Aragorn with Frodo and Sam -- or send Aragorn alone after Merry and Pippin and send Legolas and Gimli with Frodo and Sam? What on earth were Frodo and Sam supposed to do when they got to Mordor on their own?Where FOTR was a story about a quest, a mission, TTT quickly becomes a tiresome story about a ""war"" between ""good"" and ""evil.""  There are so many endless, repetitious, humorless pronouncements in this movie about the stakes of this battle that the theme gets very old very quickly.  If I had been the editor I would have excised every line by Theoden, Aragorn, Treebeard, Sam, et al. about all that nonsense, cut the movie down to two hours and made it almost pure action.The forces of Saruman are presented as so relentlessly, unmitigatingly evil that they are hard to hate.  The orcs (or uruk-hai, I assume that's the same thing) are slimy creatures like Jim Cameron's Aliens.  They ride CG beasts that look like dinos from Jurassic Park.  Sauron is some weird flaming eye on top of a black tower.  The only human villain is Saruman himself, who has about two lines in the whole three-hour flick.  I don't need a lot of motivation for the villains, but I'd like to get at least some idea of why they act as they do.  Why do they fight?  Why are they so evil? What's the point?  Meanwhile, the good guys are all white, the men do all the fighting -- in fact boys of as young as ten or eleven are thrown into battle but not a single woman is.  It's just a tiresome, cliched battle of ""good"" against a straw man ""evil.""  Why are the good guys so humorlessly good while the bad guys are so insanely, relentlessly evil?I was led to believe that Smeagol/Gollum was the best CG character ever, but in fact he seemed less realistic than Jar Jar Binks and no improvement over the dinos from Jurassic Park.  The only bright spot in the movie was Miranda Otto.  I felt no tension in wondering whether Aragorn will choose her or Liv Tyler -- I assume he will choose Tyler, and think he is crazy for doing so.Oh, I forgot one other human bad guy -- this ""Wormtongue"" fellow. How hard is it to figure out a guy named ""Wormtongue"" is up to no good? That's as bad of a name as ""Darth Sidious.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not up to my expectations.,"Though many would say that The Two Towers was excellent and some would say brilliant, I have different opinions.  I have seen this movie four times, and each time, my opinon changes.  The first time I saw it, I had no idea what was happening, so I basically slept for three hours.  However, the second time I went, I went with a Lord of the Rings fan who was explaining the story to me nonstop.  It was better that time, but still not that good. The third time I understood it completely, but the fourth time I got bored of it.  I think it would have been a better movie if it was a little easier to understand.  Most people enjoy these movies because they have read the books, but the producers have to realize that some of us don't.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Still Incredible,"The second film did not loose any steam... instead it keeps building. No matter how many times I see these movies I still get the same thrills that I did at first viewing.This film is a bit dirtier, grittier than the first film... due to the war torn areas and great battles involved. CGI used for a lot of these scenes but not misused.. which is nice. I'm kinda picky about CGI and Peter Jackson's films are always done in good taste - never abused.Like the first film, the 2nd film leaves you craving more - which we get in the 3rd in the series ""Return of the King"". I can say that for movies that are around 3 hours in length - the films seems short to me... the time goes by so quickly when watching.Another film I would highly recommend for fans of High Fantasy.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It's the middle child of the movie.,"This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do.

A trilogy with performances that will always be remembered,"I remember the first day I saw the first Lord of the Rings. I was seven. I was so captivated by the performances!! I fell in love with all these new actors I've either heard of, or never knew them. I loved it so much, I watch all of them 1,2, and 3!!! I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud! All of a sudden this creature named gollom comes down this mountain above frodo and sam... I don't think I had been so creeped out by this hideous thing, I even remember leaning against my father! I cant ever forget all of them! Elijah wood (frodo) Sean Astin (sam) Viggo Mortensin (Arigon) Orlando Bloom (Leagolas) John Rhys Davies (gimli and Treebeard) Ein Mkellen (Gandalf the Grey/white) Christopher Lee (sarumon)Billy Boyd (pippen)Cate Blanchett (galadriel)Liv Tyler (Arwen) Hugo Weaving (elrond)Dominic Monaghan (Merry)Miranda Otto (Eowyn)Bernard Hill (theoden)I loved all of them but I just think... personally The One actor who blew me away with his performance and worked soo hard for the film.... the one and only Andy Serkis. I don't understand why just because it was CGI that he couldn't get an academy for best actor... it gives me chills that he came that close to getting it!!! And yet he works so hard all those expressions and body movement are his.... that voice,HIS!!!!!!!!! For those who commented that they were surprised to see him act well out of the CGI well in order to do CGI you have to be a good acter with good expressions. Smeagal was him!!! cant you see that!!?

The best second part in the history,"When I first saw The Fellowship of the Ring, I got really disappointed. But, The two Towers is completely different. The plot of the movie is interesting and their characters are really complex. Besides, the special effects of the movie are unbelievable, specially in the battles. In my opinion, the best actor of the movie was Sir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf the Wizard. The soundtrack of the film was also great, especially the one that is used in the Kingdom of Rohan. In conclusion, this movie really made me change my opinion about The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and made me a fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
sadly disappointing,"as a fan of the books and a really big movie buff, i was nonetheless disappointed with TTT. maybe because the first one was so excellent, especially the extended version, which unfortunately one can only watch television-size. it seems to me that a pattern in emerging, where you leave all the quiet, but very important, scenes between actors out of the theatrical version, and instead concentrate on the action pieces. but the tenth shot of an uruk-hai bellowing or of women and children looking frightened becomes boring or pathetic pretty soon. and of course there are the story changes: most of them totally unnecessary and not helping the plot at all. i dont mind the scenes between elrond and arwen (although elrond is really painfully miscast) and the conflict of mortality that arwen faces. in fact, those dream-love scenes were a welcome respite from the action pieces. speaking of which, the whole warg-attack was so useless and stupid! it reminded me of star wars, not a good comparison in my mind. and that aragorn drops off the cliff was dramatically ridiculous. not even people who havent read the book will believe that one of the main characters would die like that in the middle of the movie. furthermore it just mirrored gandalfs fall in the first movie, but at the same time belittled that event. i could go on and analyse the whole movie like that, but whats the point? the addition of laborous action pieces seems the main intent, and not staying closer to the book in terms of story-telling. i think its wrong to consider those movies as pure action-flicks that have to cater to teenage boys. after all, the books are very much loved by men and women alike.so i can only wait for the extended version, where all the really important scenes might have been put back again.... i really love the first movie, but after TTT im sadly pessismistic about part three. the filmmakers left out so many important story-elements, they will never be able to finish the story in any way that resembles tolkiens book!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A compromised vision.,"Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Poorly scripted, painful to watch and quite a letdown","I'll keep my comments short and sweet:1) Terrible dialouge. I lost count of how many times I cringed as lines were spewed forth. See the King of Rohan and the burial mound scene.2) One dimensional characters. See Gimli's painful and never ending ""jokes."" Jar Jar Binks was given better material and more dignity.3) Schizo order of the scenes. The best example of this mistake takes place during the final battle at Helms Deep. Highly intense moments of fighting would suddenly shift away to Merry and Pippin. Disconcerting and as it was done throughout the film, the pacing was tarnished.4) Plot holes. One glaringly obvious one was when Frodo almost gives up the ring to a Nazgrul and THEN Faramir, who up till then had had the hobbits in chains, lets them go. That and the many others lead one to wonder where the script supervisor was.5) While a bit harder to point out, this film didn't seem to have any ""magic."" It seemed flat,coarse and underwhelming. For example one thing I rememember while watching ""Fellowship"" was not wanting the film to end as it was so enthralling. In TT I couldn't wait for the film to FINISH!To sum up, if you're still in Jr. High I'm sure this film will fit your view as being ""the best movie of all time"" as previous comments have indicated. For the rest of us however this film was pretty wretched. Note - I'm quite a big fan of JR.R. Tolkein's works so my distaste for TT was not due to ignorance. At the same time let me remark that I had no problem with the foreknowledge that a film of the LOTR would necessitate some changes from the books.

confusing but enjoyable,"I would give the film a 8.5/10 but it comes with a warning of advice.  For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings.  I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which.  I also found it hard to understand the thick ""Middle Earth"" accent.  Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago.  In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions.  ""Who's that? What did he just say?""  There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story.  I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category.  A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact.

Great,"It is freaking hard to make a movie out of a book,. The main problem is that the book inspires as many visions of the story as there are readers reading it.

Remember when you read the books I mean it was your story it was your vision it was your world. Now there's someone stepping in here and telling you it's different from what you thought it was. Well of course it's not gonna work. I think Peter Jackson has created a film that reflects a book as good as possible, especially an epic story like TLOTR, which at one point can be looked at as a mythology of England. So do the Nibelungenlied or homer's Odyssey with an equal amount of success. I don't think so! It is art and not everybody is an artist.

You 'd better stick to the book,"Major deviations from the book. The sad thing is that most of them take plot out of the film instead of adding to it. There was no need for instance for poor Theoden to be mentally substituted by Saruman himself (does that mean Saruman could multitask?). A mere plot by his treacherous consultant, finally exposed by Gandalf would do (as in the book). What about this semi romantic and semi metaphysic scene with the elven woman? How does it stick to the plot and what's the relevance with book 2? Nor was it necessary for Gimli and Aragon to anihilate hundreds of orcs, just on their own. And where was that huron tree intervention to save the Helm's Deep? Frankly, I had this feeling I was watching a set of visually impressive video clips, due to the very loose plotline. And that can get tiresome after an hour.

"Jackson should have called it ""Middle Earth Stories"" - It has nothing to do with Tolkien except the names and places","After watching the Two Towers, I was so disappointed that I left the theater resolved not to buy the DVD and to sell my current copy the Fellowship (which I bought in the hope that it would be redeemed by the later movies.) To be fair, my frame of reference for the movie was based entirely on the books, which I have been reading (over and over again) since I was nine. It seems as though Peter Jackson takes some perverse pleasure it making the characters do exactly the opposite of what they did in the books.  I understand it is difficult to transport any book to the screen, but Jackson's changes were not even remotely consistent.  This... of course... is the heart of my disappointment.  Tolkien wrote a story that seemed to peer into another world - not just of fantasy, but a worldview that is in essence pre-modern.  Tom Shippey (Journey into Middle Earth) explains it as a reconstruction of the Middle Ages and its psychology - with priorities, duties, and responsibilities appropriate to that era.  C.S. Lewis talked about it as a ""Discarded Image"" that we once knew, but now no longer fully understand.  The Lord of the Rings is a fascinating glimpse into a world where honor and virtue (the immaterial world) stands always higher than the temptations of the material world (such as greed, selfishness, pettiness, etc.)  Peter Jackson captures none of that.  More importantly, his free reconstructions not only confuse the story on the surface level, but also run completely counter to the spirit of the book.  Jackson's characters have no concept of higher duties or responsibilities - they are portrayed as weak creatures constantly at struggle with their base emotions (with no room for higher ideals).  In fact, this movie was especially dark and pessimistic. True... this may reflect the modern mindset - in fact, it probably mimics it perfectly.  The problem is that I love Tolkien precisely because it does not pander to the modern mindset.  It speaks of higher things.  I have friends who have never read the books who liked the movie, and I suspect that my love of the books has significantly shaded my perspective.  Indeed, if viewed completely on its own terms, the movie is probable fine.  But... what I find continually disturbing is Jackson's repeated claims that he has remained true to the book - that is an outright lie!  I know he does not want to offend the Tolkien fan base (like me), but I find his pleas of innocence to have exactly the opposite effect.  He did not stay true to the book, in either its letter or its spirit.  It would have been less startling to me if he had simply called it by another name and made no pretense of turning the book into a movie.On an altogether separate, more technical, note; I found the movie to suffer generally from poor direction.  I realize this goes against the grain of almost of the critics, but honestly, I have a problem with Jackson's style of directing - this is completely apart from his editorial abuses. Specifically, he does not give the characters time to consider or reflect on the events; the cuts are too quick and unsatisfying.  And this is not just a problem with too much material in too short a time - he could have lost the entire sequence with Aragon and Arwen freeing up 30 minutes or more (without any loss to the story).  Also, Jackson so desperately wants this to be epics that he throws in giant panoramic scenes - unfortunately, he does so with the frenetic energy he puts into the scene cuts, which means that the scenes are constantly in dizzying movement.  A sustained shot would be nice, and might give the viewer a moment or two to take in the context of the events. But alas, Jackson's sweep do not allow you to catch in any details, or even any of the magnitude.  This leads me to the final technical complaint; for all the buzz surrounding the special effects, Jackson's team seems unfit for the job.  I suspect he is constantly moving the panoramic shots because the scenes would not hold up to closer examinations.  Elsewhere, the CGI characters (with the exception of Gollum, who was created and performed very well) were shallow fascimilies.  There were several places during the final battle sequences, where I could almost see the blue/green screen overlays. If Jackson wants to create a competitor to ILM, he will be disappointed. The special effects were both unsubtle and immature - they did not blend well into the story, and were, occasionally, simply distracting.Of course, if you have not read the books, these problems are minor and you may well love the movie.  If you have read the books - but only so long ago that you can't remember the storyline, then you might like the reunion with old (albeit completely different) characters.  If you love the books, their stories, and their message - this movie is probably not for you.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"LOTR was not only great, but it was inspirational....","To me, I personally think that this movie is inspirational. It shows how far someone can/has to go to achieve there goals. It shows that you have to fight for what you believe in, and make a commitment. Also, friendship is a big factor in this movie. Sam is willing to risk his life to help Frodo, and expects nothing in return. For me, that was very devoting. LOTR shows that once you start, you can't just give up. You have to work to get what you want, and you have to embrace your future. And to me that is very inspiring. It also teaches you to be happy with what you have....don't be selfish. This movie has changed my outlook on life, and I think it had changed me as a person.Not to mention that pretty much everone in the movie is a total stud! That helps a little.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Smashing Second Film,"Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best 2nd part to a trilogy ever,"9 out of 10  (Like its predecesor, LOTRTT gets a little windy in places)Discounting the StarWars trilogy (forever tarnished by the crap that Lucas is making now), this film is the BEST 2nd installment of a trilogy I have ever seen. It really makes me believe that filming all 3 at once was indeed the only way to do this trilogy.Jackson takes some liberties, but all in all the film is a success on several levels. Characters are maintained and strengthened, The plotting does well not to be too dreadful without inserting lightheartedness or breathtaking action, and the special effects absolutely blew me out of the water.To all the Star Wars fans out there, take a look at Gollum, and see Yoda could only hope to be.  Gollum is so life like and well portrayed.All in all a great movie, albiet with some minor flaws,...  very minor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
something worth fighting for,"Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"after the Fellowship, this was a bit of a disappointment","This could have been as good as the first part, if Jackson had more respect for Tolkien. Those scenes of Aragorn dreaming of Arwen or utterances that may appear good in script but sound stupid on the screen (running heavy breathing Legolas speaks to himself: red sun rises, blood has been spilt this night) have pretty much harmed this otherwise good film into something that one can't watch without a very unpleasant shivering sensation down one's spine. Fortunately, there are still more good parts than those bad ones, so this is more or less a fine movie. Hope that the Return of the King ends up better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Disappointed and Angry,"After the wonderful realization of ""The Fellowship of The Ring,"" I was greatly anticipating the next installment with ""The Two Towers."" As a writer I can understand that some changes need to be made to adapt a book to a film; however, I think the title given to this movie should have been ""Peter Jackson's Two Towers."" The plot changes and additional scenes with Arwen were absolutely unnecessary for translating the book to film. These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.There was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace."" Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the ""Two Towers"" book! Ugh.I'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry.  I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Here's why this movie fails...,"Just read this ""fun fact"" from Philippa Boyens, some bimbo Peter Jackass picked up to hack a screenplay of one of the most intricately crafted pieces of literature ever written. She actually BELIEVES she can improve upon Tolkien...On changing Faramir in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) script: ""If you're trying to up the tension, you don't have your main characters captured by someone who sort of interrogates them, but, not really, who then offers them a cup of tea and says, 'I'll do anything I can to help you.' It's death on film. And it's not just the effect that the character out of the book has on Frodo and Sam's journey, it's the effect that character has on the Ring. You've just been desperately trying to establish that this is the most evil thing ever created, it's tearing apart the mind of your main character, it's reduced this other character to this miserable creature Gollum, and now you come along someone who says, 'I would not touch this thing if it lay on the highway.' You've just stripped the Ring of all its power.""Miserable, just miserable. Any wonder that this film is completely shapeless, dramatically?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The tree special effects were not very good at all, but in contrast the Smigel CGI was astounding.  I felt Samwise Gamgee was a little too smart in this film in comparison to where he was when Fellowship left off.  Overall, I gave this movie a seven.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but don't expect too much.  Peter Jackson appeared to think that it would be too much drama for viewers to handle so he softened it up.

An Abomination,"Oh, merciful heavens, what a horrid film!  I had serious problems with Fellowship, but I was able to overcome it eventually, and enjoy the movie on it's own terms.  But this...   this....!  To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was ""Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,"" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece.  I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,""Let's hunt some Orc!""  (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!)  but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself.  Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect.  That was mistake number one.  Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book.  Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess.  Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that.  Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is ""possessed"" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, ""The power of Christ compels you!""  Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him.  Then there's the time that... Ugh!  I give up!

Superb,"In order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours long, tie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall plot, is no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers believe Jackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard to have some studio fund one movie that would require cots. Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers.

Give Gollum his deserved Oscar!!!!,"The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.)

Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves.This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam.

A new power is rising,"A story generally consists of three acts; The first act is the beginning where you introduce your story & its characters. The second act is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends & bring your entire tale to a satisfying conclusion. Before penning down these stories, almost every writer has a very clear conscience of how to begin & end their tales but the most troublesome part for each one of them is always the middle act. Because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing. And that's true for whether you are writing a book or a play or a movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga. And because, just like the novel, The Lord of the Rings is meant to be viewed as a single film edited into three parts of which The Two Towers is the second part, there is no definite beginning or ending to this film. Plus, what's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike the first film, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple storylines & has to make each one work efficiently in order to accomplish its goal. Nevertheless, the great news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel's story as faithfully as The Fellowship of the Ring did, it still succeeds as one rare sequel that improves upon the original and, just like its predecessor, is one of the greatest films of its genre.Picking up right from where The Fellowship of the Ring signed off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three storylines. The first plot line concerns Frodo & Sam, who are continuing their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring but soon their peril deepens as there is another who hunts the ring. The second plot line deals with Merry & Pippin, who were captured by Uruk-Hai in the last film but manage to escape, meet Treebeard the Ent & help to plan an attack on Isengard, where Saruman is breeding a massive army. The third plot line covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, while pursuing the flock of Uruk-Hai that took Merry & Pippin hostage, meet an unexpected ally and then make their way to Rohan where Saruman has King Theoden under his spell while an impending war looms upon those free lands. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad-dûr, fortress of the Dark Lord Sauron & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.The direction by Peter Jackson doesn't lose any of its potency for this sequel as The Two Towers manages to live up to all hype & expectations, which was even more this time considering the massive critical & financial success of the first film. And not only it delivers everything it promised but also shows major improvements in almost all filmmaking departments. The three story lines are extremely well written & narrated and enough time is given to develop every single one of its new characters, without interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast. Also, the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers and the decision to conclude this film at a different event from the novel makes sense for it sets a perfect stage for the finale. Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but Peter Jackson has done it again & what's even more admirable is that he gave equal importance & value to all three storylines.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress as the miniatures used to represent Rohan, Helm's Deep & Osgiliath are meticulously detailed down to the smallest of things, thus making art direction & set decoration a winning aspect, once again. Still, what makes these sets look even more appealing is their ideal fusion with the beautifully photographed landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography immerses the viewers into Middle-Earth just like its predecessor, and the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the film's action sequences. Make-up & Costume Design stay true to the timeline it depicts. Sound feels more authentic this time & is spot-on where it matters most. Editing trims the film down to 179 minutes & although it's very effective in that 3 hours of runtime, I recommend the extended version instead as it adds 45 minutes of new & extended scenes and further develops the film's characters, adds greater depth to its plot & enriches the overall experience of The Two Towers.Weta Digital made history with The Fellowship of the Ring when it brought alive Middle-Earth in breathtaking detail but the enhancements it brings in the visual effects of The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely computer-generated & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Another scene where visuals really shine, but doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, is the Flooding of Isengard sequence, which undeniably is one hell of an eye-opener you don't see in cinema very often. Finally, the background score by Howard Shore introduces new tracks for Rohan, Gollum & many more sequences while the music heard in the first chapter further develops & expands into new realms. Splendid where it is meant to be, touching where it needs to be & magnificently pleasing to the viewers' senses, the soundtrack of The Two Towers is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor and continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers doesn't disappoint in this aspect & adds even more strength to its ensemble cast. The new cast is no let down but another right step in the right direction while the reprising cast continues to evolve with their respective characters. Everyone from Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin to Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli has a stronger sense of their characters in comparison to the last film. However, Ian McKellen, who plays Gandalf, gets a fresh makeover in this film & has a new dimension to explore. Amongst the new cast, making their presence felt are Bernard Hill as Théoden; King of Rohan, Miranda Otto as Éowyn; Théoden's niece, David Wenham as Faramir; Boromir's younger brother, Brad Dourif as Gríma Wormtongue; Saruman's agent at Rohan, Karl Urban as Éomer; Théoden's nephew & John Rhys-Davies as voice of the Treebeard; Leader of the Ents. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum / Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & show-stealing performance that it's impossible to not love as well as pity this wretched character. Easily the finest performance of the saga, so far.Director Peter Jackson & his crew, in spite of deviating greatly from the film's source material, not only succeed in making the middle part of The Lord of the Rings a smooth continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring but also a worthy expansion & evolution of Middle-Earth. The artistic license taken by Jackson, Walsh & Boyens does alter the overall tone & style of the film but they still manage to keep everything very much within the realms of Tolkien's world & true to its spirits. Also, if one envisions this second chapter as an adaptation of the middle act of Tolkien's complete novel rather than conceiving it as an adaptation of only the second volume, then the writers' decisions start to make much more sense. And honestly, apart from few purists, most won't even mind this tweaking because, in spite of all the modifications, The Two Towers makes up for another successful, spellbinding & engrossing epic that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering masterpiece. On an overall scale, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another landmark film of its genre that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor, breaks many filmmaking barriers of its genre with its revolutionary production and signs off as an extremely satisfying sequel which sets an even higher benchmark for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Just as spectacular as the first installment of the Trilogy.,"I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" movies and thought the ""Star Trek"" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing.  But after watching ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.This film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved.  Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created.  The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.The battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.Gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.Like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways.  At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like ""Snow White.""These films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have.  ""The Return of the King"" should be awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Almost as great,"The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was a great film. Far superior to those dull films about a galaxy far away. Expectations were high for the second film in the trilogy and The Two Towers (TTT) almost made it. Perhaps the battle at Helm's Deep went on a touch too long and uncanonical scenes like Aragorn being lost were unneccessary but these are only minor flaws in an engrossing three hours. There was much to praise.Part of the success of TTT depends upon the Gollum as he is now a key character in the story and as other people have said, you forget that the character is a CGI. It is extraordinary. The interplay between Gollum and Frodo and Sam is brilliant, not just physically but emotionally. If Gollum had been another JarJar Binks it would have been disastrous but he is a real character, at war with himself.The acting varies from mock-epic to perfect. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's pain so tangible that you feel every difficult step in his journey. Sean Astin's speech near the end about finding good in the world made my eyes moist. Viggo Mortensen is better in TTT than FOTR. Liv Tyler looks the part. Bernard Hill is Theoden come to life. And Miranda Otto is my kind of shield maiden.The production values are wonderful as ever and if it is eye candy it is of the superior kind. Well done Peter Jackson and team. My only real complaint is that we have to wait another dratted year for the third part.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A New Power Is Rising. Its Victory Is At Helm.,"Every film consists of three acts; The first is where you introduce your story & its characters. The second is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends to bring your entire tale to its conclusion. Almost everyone has a definite idea of how to begin & end their stories but the middle act is always the most difficult. Because no matter how great the other two acts are, if this part isn't handled well, then the overall experience ultimately amount to nothing in the end.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga & just like the novel, it has no definite beginning or ending. What's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple story lines & all need to work. And the good news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel as faithfully as its predecessor did, it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that improves upon the original.Picking the story right from where it was left off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three story lines. The first concerns Frodo & Sam who, on their journey to Mordor, find their peril deepen for there is another who hunts the ring. The second deals with Merry & Pippin, who were taken as hostages in the last film. And the third covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, along with an unexpected ally, head to Rohan to warn them of an impending war. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad- dûr, fortress of the dark lord, Sauron, & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but director Peter Jackson manages to do it once again & what's even more admirable is that he gives equal importance & value to all three story lines as the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers & the decision to conclude it at a different event from the novel sets a perfect stage for the finale. Also, it is extremely well written & narrated for enough time is given to develop its new characters, without ever interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast.Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress with its meticulously detailed sets & is ideally fused with the gorgeously photographed landscapes of New Zealand. Camera-work is at its absolute best during the action sequences, Make-up, Costume Design & Sound retain their qualities and Editing trims it down to 179 minutes but just like the last time, I recommend the extended edition for it adds 45 minutes of new footages which further enriches its overall experience.Weta Digital's VFX team made history with The Fellowship of the Ring but the enhancements it brings in The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely CGI & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Howard Shore's magnificent score continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure & is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor.As far as the performances go, The Two Towers adds even more strength to its ensemble cast as the reprising actors once again chips in with faithful performances while the new ones instantly make their mark felt. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum/Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & jaw-dropping performance that it's easily the finest acting of the saga, so far.On an overall scale, The Two Towers is a smooth continuation & a worthy expansion of the world that was brought alive in The Fellowship of the Ring. There are a few artistic license taken but it all stays within the realms of Tolkien's world & remains true to its spirits. Succeeding as another spellbinding & engrossing masterpiece that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering epic, The Two Towers is an immensely satisfying sequel that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor & signs off by setting an even higher bar for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium.

"A great movie for the eyes, not the mind.","TTT should be taken for what it is, a visually attractive, popcorn fun, crowd-pleaser.  In this respect, the movie does it perfect.  The action is well choreographed, and very interesting to watch.  Peter Jackson is very good at this.  He makes movies interesting.  He makes movies fun to watch. This whole movie was a big story, with really no inner message.  My mind did not go through any thought process this whole movie.  I just sat in my cushioned seat, and absorbed the action/adventure fest this movie gave me. And as I said, this movie does that well.The cinematography was amazing.  You could tell that most of the time making movie was spent in a little room, on a computer, animating Golem, who felt like a real person.  Also, considering most of the background and sets were made by computers, they did a great job with that.The story also was very good, mainly because it is from what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.Also, the movie is very eye-catching, and you can tell Peter threw in some things just to make sure you were watching (Legolos jumping onto his horse is a perfect example).  This makes the movie feel like ""The Matrix"", which is something many directors trying to make an epic DO NOT want.The love story could have been done without, as I forgot every part of the movie with that in it.  I can't even remember who was in love with Liv Tyler.  This felt like they were trying to add more meaning into the battle scenes with whoever she loved, but I could see no connection between the two.Also the character development... wasn't their.  Unless you consider Gandalf becoming ""White"", or Frodo becoming woozier, character development, i felt none in the movie.There are many movies that I sit and wonder after, not because of I being confusing, because that is what the director wants you to do.  The Pianist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, 2001, A Clockwork Orange and others all made me do this.  After seeing this in theaters, I was right out of the theater, and discussing how ""cool"" the battle scenes were.  Wow. Gripping.But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  Throughout the whole movie, my eyes were fixed on the screen.  I mean, almost any male, despite how ""inner"" they say they are, can't resist 25 minute battle scenes with fire and ogres.But this movie was easily forgotten in the thoughtful part of my mind. But it will always be in the ""Wow!  Look at that!  Once in a lifetime!"" part.I give The Two Towers:  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I mean seriously WOW Andy Serkis get an Oscar!!!,"When I first saw the first lord of the rings film in the cinema at Easter I loved it and said I have to go and see the second one. Before seeing the second one I had my doubts, thinking it might be dull (it could be that I was used to the first one)Ive seen THE TWO TOWERS and I just have to say WOW!!! This is 10 times better than the fellowship of the ring. The first one was all talk and little action. This one is all action and little talk.The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves.This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence.Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece.Although the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.Overall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield.10/10!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"My second favourite film, my first being the Return of the King.",Still in 2021 it looks amazing. I know the battle of Helms Deep strays away from the book but honestly it makes it alot more tense and the cinematography is amazing.

excellent adaptation,"In regards to the previous of those people who hated the film, this is NOT a literal adaptation of the story.  It's an adaptation which concentrates on character development, continues to show a masterful command of the medium with its stunning photography, brisk editing, and quite wonderful special effects.  It's NOT a real tale, but based on real human qualities and flaws. By the way, ""The Godfather"" is good, but it's not REAL, either. By the way, movies are supposed to entertain and teach us a few things, and some of us should try a little harder to do just that. If you like the book better, that's your option.  Some of us like to keep open minds and enjoy things for what they are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

This movie is the second in a series, so be sure to watch the other one first. When we saw the first movie, we were not sure if the sequel could come close to topping it.

Best Sequl ever!!,"It is impossible to make me chose a favorite over this and Return of the King. I have seen the last hour of this movie more times than I can count. This movie is incredible in every way. It takes the world and characters from Fellowship and gives it all more depth. Gollum is amazing. Andy Serkis is easily the standout actor of this movie. Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin are close seconds. You get to go on the journey with Frodo and Sam and see tge triumphs of Rohan and spend time with the Ents. All the storylines are perfectly balanced to create an amazing watch experience. And the last hour. Don't get me started. Helms Deep is the best battle in cinema history. The last march of the Ents segment us one of my favorite scenes in the trilogy. And Sam's speech makes me cry everytime I here it. This is amazing.""There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo.And it's worth fighting for.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A review on The Lord of the Rings: The two towers,"Starting with a general idea about The Lord of the Rings, I should mention, predictably that the film cannot reach the book's level. The book has much more details and it can be even more attractive. However we all know it is impossible to bring too much information of the book just in a trilogy; therefore Peter Jackson, the director, did his best. Perhaps this issue would solve if a Tv-show had been created instead of a trilogy.
Anyway, many people believe that just two or three great and epic scenes make the movie memorable and this is the factor that the two towers does. In my opinion the 2nd part of this trilogy is the best one. Certainly this film is great In terms of technical things like filming, music, special effects, acting and so on. Apart from these, what really I noticed and enjoyed were the dialogues; very beautiful and impressive and also full of metaphors. At the beginning of the movie, Saruman has a sinister speech about ruling the world by a new order. ""The old world will be burned in the fires of industry,"" says Saruman. I was shocked as soon as I heard these words. By the way, this speech is a good one to just have some fun moments and let our mind have some Conspiracy theory.
In this episode, existence of poor Gollum, who is seriously involved with his two characters, adds to the attractiveness of the film. Gollum was cursed by spirit of lasciviousness. Furthermore, he was defeated by his own carnality.
On the other side, Frodo tries not to be cursed by the ring because he does not want the Gollum's fate for himself. So he has an odyssey in order to destroy the ring. Sam, a friend of Frodo who is accompanying Frodo in that odyssey, has a strong will and personality. Despite hydra-headed problems in their path, Sam always helps his friend.
Another thing which I noticed is about Ents and walking trees. They were victims. The gloomy point is that the situation in the real world is not better than the film at all; even in some particular cases, it could be worse. For instance, considering that problem about cutting down trees in the film, believe it or not, I would say in the reality is much more worse than the film. Statistically we cut down over 15 billion trees each year in reality, trees moan louder and they are much angrier. Trust me.
Anyway, there is an epic war in this film, called battle of Helm's Deep, which is designed beautifully and professionally. Among all these we have Merry and Pippin who create some fun moments. Actually they do not let the film be saturnine. There are plenty of things in this trilogy and I absolutely recommend that to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Feast for the Eyes,"I read Tolkien's trilogy 2 years ago and, like millions of others, was engulfed in a new world - Middle Earth. So there was much expectation surrounding the film release. And i must say that i am impressed at what has been achieved. Critics have it that the film is heavily layered with special effects and that many of the characters are unexplored. In other words, more food for the eye than for the heart. However this is totally acceptable and expected. To incorporate most of the books' fantasies and characters is already an arduous task. Some aspects had to be cut off otherwise Jackson would have had to make 20 episodes to keep faithful to the book. If one wants to feel the whole range of emotions, then the only true bible is the written version. The film is mainly a feast for the eyes, and a damn good one too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
aesthetically grim,"This is a worthy sequel as I enjoyed myself as much as with part 1.  I still haven't read any of the books, but I have to say that the story and plot twists develop in a way I could never have imagined.  Some of it was even reminiscent of 'Throne of Blood' (Kurosawa, 1957) which was of course a brilliant adaptation of MacBeth.  See that film to figure out which parts I mean plz.The art direction is of course still great as they shot the movie together with part 1 and 3.  Here the CGI has become fingerlicking good: Gollum puts Jar Jar Binks AND Yoda to shame!Let's wait for part 3 to drop some concluding remarks about this trilogy. For now it feels great to experience the premieres of these movies and be a part of the hype as well, I might add.    The videogame should be Everquest I guess (never played it though).

Because even though the movie was beautiful to watch -- New Zealand IS lovely -- that was the only thing that was worth looking at. The characters were boring, the dialogue unremarkable, and the plot -- well, what plot? Mostly it consisted of people running from one spot to another, badly in need of showers and shampoo. My concern isn't with what they left out, it's with what they put in! A lot of herky jerky camera shots of impossible to follow battle scenes and boring scenes with boring characters. I spent most of the movie asking my poor husband what time it was. We would've walked out, but  thought the couple we were with wanted to stay, and they thought we wanted to stay, so instead all four of us ended us wasting three hours -- a total of 12 --  and $32.!

"A fantastic MOVIE, and we must all remember this...","This movie is so good. It gives me that feeling I used to get when I was a kid and a new Star Wars flick was coming down the pipe. All of the modern technological advances in moviemaking find raison d'etre in this saga without smothering the story in large production 'pomp and circumstance'.Yeah yeah, we can all get p***y about how the story wasn't followed to the letter and how license was granted in the embellishment of certain characters but we have to see this work for what it is, a MOVIE. MOVIES are not BOOKS. Anyone who uses this argument to downplay their opinion of Jackson's (et al.) attempt needs to revisit my previous statement. You cannot compare the two works as if they were the same variety of fruit and one is lacking in bouquet or has artificial color or flavoring. This reasoning is inherently flawed. Let's all give credit where it is due. Tolkien is the master of his world. Jackson is obviously a maestro in his own arena. I am so stoked that he has accomplished this with such aplomb. If we want to get upset at modern movie adaptations of excellent stories, why not pick on the Grinch or Interview With The Vampire or the impending Alexander The Great movie(s) (I may be jumping the gun on this last one, but why anyone would highlight the sexual practices of the greatest, most accomplished leader of ALL time as if it meant something is moronic especially considering the common practices of the day (I urge Baz and Oliver to read some J.F.C. Fuller on Alexander, please!). I would venture to say that, in the distant future if movie-like entertainment exists, no one would make a big deal out of how our modern leaders conducted themselves outside of the diplomatic/political/militaristic arena.)Hollywood misses the mark in so many ways. Why we would get so wrapped up in this silliness is beyond me. Three cheers for Jackson and Company!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The Greatest Continuation of All Time,"If you're going to see this movie, please be sure to watch Fellowship of the Ring (or reading the book works too). There is no reminiscence of the first, save for the opening scene that is shown in a different perspective than in Fellowship. The movie cuts right to the action, much like the books, because of the mere fact that its just 1 big, long, continuing story. All 3 of the movies/books could fit hand in hand without interuptions and would still flow smoothly if it was shown all in 1 sitting. The mere title of The Two Towers caused a considerable ammount of commotion, with a lot of people thinking that it had a sort of reference to 9/11. Those are the kind of people who didn't know that the books were written over 50 years ago, still sporting the same title. However, the title stuck and the controversy has quieted down to maybe the avid ranter still complaining about it. If, by chance, you are that person, there's a little thing we people call 'acceptance'. Figure it out.Acting: 11/10 The acting is still straight on and well depicted. The introduction of an extremely large variety of characters in 1 movie was nicely done, and didn't put a restrain on the film. That pairing of actors with their roles was superb, aside from the character change of Faramir, however, I didn't mind it much and liked the changes. Once again, to any ranter reading this, the word acceptance pops up again. The original cast still holds true to their characters. Bernard Hill did a great performance in this movie as Theoden. I'm surprised he wasn't nominated. Only a few actresses could play Eowyn, and Mirando Otto is one of them, and struck the character right on. Opposite to Eowyn is Eomer, played by Karl Urban. Despite the lack of line's and appearance in the film in comparison to the others, he still played his part well. Faramir, played by David Wenham, had some of the most well spoken lines in the film, and portrayed his role well even though it was changed from the book, but it does make sense, considering he is one of the character's brother from Fellowship. Then we get to Gollum, the tormented creature driven mad by the Ring. Gollum alone crosses over to new boundaries in both acting and computer animation. I could write a whole paragraph on Gollum, but I won't. Andy Serkis deserved Best Actor.Story: 10/10 The same story as Fellowship of the Ring, seeing as how its all a continuation, but now there's a twist. The Two Towers, which the title is named after meaning the Towers of Orthanc and Barad-dur, have officialy united in Saruman's and Sauron's assault to rule Middle-Earth. The war begins in Rohan, where Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas still pursue the Uruk-Hai who captured Merry and Pippin.Music: 9/10 While the movie, in a retrospective view of Fellowship, is considerably darker, the music as well ties in with this darker theme, and tends to get darker as the story progresses. There are some moments which the darkness subsides for a while and a little bit of light shines through. When the sad feeling of despare overcomes the screen, the music ties in perfectly. When the battle begins, the music is there and sounds just right. However, it doesn't end with the emotional song Fellowship ended with. Now it ends on a sad, depressing note with Gollum's Song.Visual Effects: 10/10 Once again, the MASSIVE program is put to full use in this. The masses upon masses of Uruk-Hai are all so real, its threatening. The Ents are amazing, however, the occasional twitchy movements of the Ents makes it seem that MASSIVE had a little glitch in it.Final Score: 40/40One Word Review: Amazing",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

An unparalleled Epic,"Because this one was built on the foundations of the first one. And it used that advantage to show all the epicism of the Tolkien story. A non-stop story (with the only exception being a sequence to reinforce Aragorn's love story). The scenes either advanced the plot at a brisk pace or were action sequences (that also advanced the plot in one way or another). There's not a lot of character development and that's not a fault. The story and characters remain PG, therefore complexity and nuance storytelling aren't the focus (there is a tiny bit more of light politics with the realms and their conflicts though).Another great thing is that stop abusing the same resources (slow motion with no music and echo voices) in the ""heart fealted moments"", either because there aren't as many or because the editing changed. There is a fair amount for a 3 hour Epic, but not more than necessary, like in the first one.Last thing that makes this movie perfect is, of course, the larger role played by Gollum's Andy Serkis, which steals every second he's onscreen. The rest of the acting is equally good than in the first movie, with a special mention for the great David Wenham (Faramir), replacing the great Sean Bean (Boromir)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"A fine attempt, but too long!","Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon that this is the greatest movie ever made.  I disagree.  First, let me say that I have read all three books in the trilogy twice, and I love this story.  However, this was too long.  It may just be that Tolkien's books are too much to try to put into a movie.  I will say that this was probably the best effort that could be made by a human.  But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books.The battle sequences were not emotionally engaging.  And the orcs are too ""over-the-top"" scary for my taste.  I did like the sequences between Frodo, Sam and Gollum.  The portrayal of the ring's effect on Frodo was well done.All-in-all, this is a downer of a movie.

Extended Excellence!,"I enjoyed the theatrical Two Towers even more than the first - it was darker, more suspenseful, more action-filled, and introduced some of my favorite characters. The extended edition gives viewers even more of the same - more heart, more comedy, more action, more character development, more sorrow, and more of a conclusion. My favorite scene in the extended edition is Faramir's flashback to a time spent with his brother and father. It really shows more insight into this character, making him seem less like Boromir-lite. It also shows more insight into Boromir himself, before he left for Rivendell, and introduced viewers to their father, Denethor, who is important to the third part of the tale. There's a lot more Merry & Pippin, Treebeard, and Gollum. The DVD extras are fantastic, as we've come to expect. Watch ""Cameras in Middle Earth,"" ""Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth,"" ""From book to Script"" and the entire special on Gollum and music and sound in The Two Towers. (With 4 hours of extras, these are what I found to be the best) Really fascinating stuff here. The downside? The wait for ""The Return of the king"" seems even more unbearable now!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great,"I think I've always seen this as the best one in the trilogy. At least I've seen it the most times. The excitement and tension before the battle at Helm's Deep is one of the most memorable sequences in any film for me. The more I watch these movies I come to the realization that I practically just can't stand the scenes with Frodo, Sam and Gollum though. Their whole storyline from when they part with the fellowship at the end of the first movie is just so boring compared to everything else. Of course it was intriguing the first time, but now I would just give it a 6/10 while the rest of the movie is 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"At dawn, look to the East.","Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, whilst Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go to Rohan.This is the very cinematic middle part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.From the opening flyover shots of the snowy mountain peaks, 'The Two Towers' is fantastic to look at and full of perilous adventure.As with the first movie, if you have read the book, it will likely influence your enjoyment as it puts a lot more focus on the non-Hobbit characters and turns the source material into a Hollywoodised action adventure. The script moves the established characters along their journey, introduces more characters and stages some very spectacular events. To do this it splits into a number of directions as it follows different groups through various paths and obstacles. Some scenes put the foundations in place for what is to come in the next movie, whilst most of it leads towards the centre piece of this movie, the Battle of Helms Deep. This unfolds at a relatively uneven pace, but all scenes are technically well made.If you compare the battle to the various spectacles of the modern era such as those in Game of Thrones it feels pretty standard, but at the time of its release it was groundbreaking in terms of the scale of the set-piece and use of CGI. A huge theme in the trilogy is hope in the face of despair and the battle portrays it with some wonderful sequences. The arrival of the elves, King Theoden riding out to meet the Orcs, and THAT moment when sun rises still makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.Is there too much CGI? Yes, I think there is. As epic as it makes the battle look, it is distracting when you know most of those vast Orcs legions were generated by computer programmers. That being said, a major success of the movie is it's CGI depiction of the character Gollum by the animators and the work of performance-capture star Andy Serkis. This character is central to the depiction of how the ring corrupts the souls of those who possess or seek to possess it and his scenes are some of the best in the trilogy.Generally the visuals are phenomenally good. The cinematography, lighting, colours, editing, locations, set design, costuming, makeup, props, and general art design are some of the most iconic in movie history. For me the visual spectacle is so powerful it actually detracts my attention from the characters, who are good, but sometimes feel they have come along for the ride.It is a movie that could have been perfect if the characters were better and there were performances that (aside from Serkis) were truly iconic.Saying that there are lots of solid performances, with the best for me being Bernard Hill, Brad Douriff, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, and David Wenham. Nobody feels less than adequate for the role. However, I get the feeling that the focus was so much on the animation and the general look and feel that Peter Jackson might have been satisfied with not capturing that many truly memorable character moments.For me it's an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A good film becomes a great one,"I enjoyed The Two Towers when I first saw it in the theater.  I even went back to see it 3 or 4 more times.  Still, I didn't think it measured up to Fellowship of the Ring.  There seemed to be too much emphasis on action, and not enough on characterization and story development.  The film also felt a little rushed in places.With Peter Jackson's ""extended version"" re-release of The Two Towers, it has gone from a very solid film to a truly great one.  At times I felt as though I was watching an entirely new film.  Critical story and character details have been enhanced, the timing improved, and a couple of important scenes were added.  I now rate The Two Towers slightly above Fellowship of the Ring, which I still consider one of the greatest films of all time.There is no question in my mind that Lord of the Rings, treated as a single epic film, *is* the greatest film ever made.  There are no weak points now that The Two Towers has been raised to the pinnacle.  Here, at the end of all things, I am glad the DVD is with me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I'm tired. And I'm not alone.,"This is it.""The Two Towers"" has just opened. One can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. At the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all I can say is, let it be...I have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Like that much loved film, I do not judge ""The Two Towers"" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. I look upon it as a further unveiling of Peter Jackson's LOTR mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. But that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as I'm not a believer in ""taste-dictatorship"".Notice I stated Peter Jackson's and not Tolkien's LOTR. With all due respect for JRR Tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), I think that LOTR should by now be just as much a labour of love for Jackson as it once was for Tolkien. Judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what Jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right.Dissenters of LOTR movies, we know who you are. In an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. But in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. For good or evil, I have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. I will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments TTT will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead.I have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. That I love the LORD OF THE RINGS movies, is but a given. That I am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. A choice which I pray I will have the strength to honour. Consider that my leap of faith.In conclusion, the story is far from over. Like Gandalf's famous last words in TTT (the movie), ""The battle for Helm's Deep may be over, but the battle for Middle Earth has just begun..."" Till then, I shall breathe, while I wait for ""The Return of the King""...peace and out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Visually stimulating - but TOO LONG,I saw Two Towers yesterday with my 9 yr. old and 12 yr. old.    It was visually stimulating and action-packed.   But... I would have liked a bit of editing in this film.    Too Long!   Especially too many fight scenes.   I know it was in the book... but made for quite a boring time.   The trees were cool and so was Gollum.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Take out 5 chapters, put some made up rubbish in and you have Peter Jackson's The Two Towers","This film isn't just missing small parts of the story; it's missing five plus chapters!!!The Fellowship of the Ring pleased me in that apart from small pieces it stayed, true to the original book. It was, I thought badly directed. I say this because I believe Jackson is at heart a producer. His organizational skills are amazing that at least is evident from the sheer amount of info LOTR holds within its pages. But he has no visual imagination whatsoever. Fellowship and The Two Towers are badly shot and badly edited. To put it in short I think Jackson is a second rate director who only got these films through blind enthusiasm, rather than ethical ability or quality of work.The two Towers is an insult to everything Tolkien wrote, Peter Jackson for some unexplained reason has gone from following the book of FOTR pretty well to just doing what he wants in TTT. The first half of the film is more or less true to the book and I was enjoying it. Gollum especially, but about half way through just after King Theoden and his people left for Helms deep in anticipation of the attack of Sarumans army, THE STORY WENT OFF THE RAILS LIKE A SPEEDING TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! With Aragorn falling over the cliff after the fight with the Wolf riding Orcs (WHICH WASN'T IN THE BOOK) as if that wasn't laughable enough, then the plot goes off into a dreamland about Aragorn and Aowhen's (sorry if her names wrong:) love affair and the choices they must make for the greater good. Well nice try in giving the story more depth BUT STICK TO THE BOOK!!!!!!I don't know about any of you but I went to see J.R.R Tolkiens The Lord of The Rings, not Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings. Ok it's still an adaptation, but FOTR was more or less the same as the book, why ON EARTH insult Tolkein's fans and Tolkien himself by taking one of the greatest works of fiction ever and changing it in any way you want. I think it was an attempt to fool everyone who haven't got the sense to read the books and make more cash on the side.THERE'RE AT LEAST FIVE CHAPTERS MISSING AT THE END OF THIS FILM. Now the people who I was chatting to today about it said well you cant have it all in the film it would be about 9 hours long. GRRRRRR! I said the annoying thing is if Jackson had left out all the rubbish he made up and put in the parts of the story, which should be there, YOU COULD HAVE FITTED IT ALL IN. I am of course referring to Shelob the great spider, which bites Frodo and then Sam takes on the Ring himself and the bookends on a cliff-hanger. He's chucked that out and put it in the next film, The Return of the King, which is already the longest book anyway, without putting huge chunks of story in from the other films.If you ask me Jackson has quiet literally lost the plot and in some style, instead of creating a realistic and accurate film on Tolkein's book he's done what he wants with it and I'm sorry but I think he should be slapped for even having the nerve!!!!!The only people who will totally enjoy this film are the ones who haven't read the books AND SADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.BUT I'M DREADING WHAT HE'S GONNA CUT OUT AND EVEN MORE SO WHAT HE INVENTS TO STUFF INTO THE NEXT ONE....A YEAR OF DREAD IS AHEAD",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An amazing continuation,"This movie is kind of underrated just because it doesn't start nor ends the trilogy, but this movie is as good as the other two or even better, it has some memorable scenes and it has one of the best war battles of all time. Great movie that aged very well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Gloriously epic,"This is the continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).This film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. In fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize Tolkien, an English writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't English or don't speak English as their mother tongue. Suddenly, not only everyone spoke of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages ​​and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation.Epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization. In fact, make an epic film in the old fashioned way, with hundreds of participants, large and elaborate scenarios etc. it's extremely expensive, more than resorting to the modern digital techniques.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Extended DVD version is excellent and better,"This is a review of the extended DVD version.I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.So, just like with the ""Fellowship"" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of ""King"" next year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A film for our time.,"This franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. The question then commonly asked becomes, ""Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?""The answer to that question is, really ""deserved"" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.However, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.I never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a ""1"" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A horrible atempt at entertainment.,"I had high expectations when going to see this film so as you can guess my disapoinment was insurmountable. I watched as my expectations crumbled onto the theatre floor and nestled next to a box of half eaten popcorn and spilled soda. I tried in vain to put it back together but it slipped through my fingers like sand. I slumped back in the theatre seat and surpressed sleep. I watched Elijah Wood's strugle with his one expression and attept at Homersexual flirting with Sean Astin, the miscast fat American. The dialogue sounded like it was being excreted. The dwarf is now just comic relief in the tradition of jar jar binks. I had to shut my eyes every time Peter thrust the camera in Aragorn's face. Golumn was horribly unrealistic. Puppets look light years better when used properly. I want to believe what I see. The line to the effect of ""I hope someday someone will write a book about us"" had me cowering under my seat in embarrassment. The battle scenes tried to be too flashy and as a result you can't get a scope of the battle or see what's going on. The fact that its rating is almost nine says almost too much about todays generation (to which I am also part of). LOTR above Citizen Kane? come on! It is just Blockbuster drivel from the Hollywood machine. You can only take this film on face value, there is no depth. I say go back to Braindead.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One ring still rules them all,"After seeing LOTR The Two Towers I only regret that it takes another year to see the final ending of this epic saga. Of course, having read the book several times, I know how it will end, but I'm very curious how Peter Jackson will adapt it to the screen. Judging by this second installment I imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. Watching TTT was an amazing experience with many highlights. First of all there is of course the creature Gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. Other highlights include the battle at Helms Deep as well as the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog. For the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from Gimli. There are however also some parts that worked less for me. Personally I was not fond of the side-plot with Treebeard in the book and I don't care for it much in the movie. However, it is essential to the story, so who am I to complain. What I also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of Elves?All these little things aside, Peter Jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against Mordor and survival of Mankind and Middle Earth. Jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. Rightfully so, I would say, because if you have not seen The Fellowship there is no real point in watching The Two Towers. There is some reference to some loose ends The Fellowship left (what happened to Gandalf, who is Gollum etc), but never too much. Anybody who enjoyed the Fellowship will also enjoy The Two Towers. The movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. And that is good news. I wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. Therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... Bring on 'Return of the King'!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Great adaptation, but one flaw","At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material.  It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.:  Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me!  In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and deliberately uses it to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring.  In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Good Tokien story,"Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Good movie; incredibly overrated,"""Lord of the Rings"" continues to disappoint. The entire trilogy has never had any real effect on me; when I saw ""The Return of the King"" in the cinema it was the closest I came to loving the series -- the last hour was really gripping stuff... then the conclusion went overboard and I couldn't wait for it to end.Before I saw ""RotK"" I thought ""The Two Towers"" was going to be my favorite from the series -- it's certainly more entertaining than the first film, even if it doesn't contain as nice scenery and cinematography (it's not as lush).My concerns in regards to this trilogy (and specifically ""The Two Towers"") is that it tries too hard to be an epic, creating far too much overblown, dramatic material that fails to equate into poignancy. Case in point: I'm sure the entire trilogy contains about an hour of footage entirely of Frodo and Sam crying in each other's arms. There's a certain point where too much is simply too much and I grew weary of the constant drama-queen syndrome. Put a female's wig on Frodo and he's a transvestite. I mean, seriously. He cries more than Halle Berry at an awards show.The better parts of ""The Two Towers"" follow Aragorn's story, but then there's too much exposition: ""I ride at dawn to Minis Tirith in search of the mighty plot MacGuffin!"" Just do it already! Half the film is wasted because the characters tell us what they're going to do, and then we spend more time watching them do it. Once is enough. Example: ""I'm going to kill that monster!"" (Aragorn kills the monster.) ""I'm going to walk over to that cliff and pretend to jump!"" (Aragorn walks over to the cliff and pretends to jump.) Overall I feel this is incredibly overrated because a majority of the voters are those who are duped into buying this as the ""epic of our times"" when in fact there have been far better so-called ""epics"" made and more relatable ones, too. I found the human story of ""LotR"" quite weak and because Peter Jackson spends so much time exaggerating it to such overly-dramatic effect... it leaves a bad aftertaste.It's worth noting the only people I know who love this film are those who infrequently watch films, and/or are under the age of 13.

Almost equal to the first.,I enjoyed The Two Towers almost as much as Fellowship. I liked the Helm's Deep battle and still think it is better than any of the battles in Return of the King. However as with most epic movies I find the little moments are the ones that define it as great. A tree with it's leaves on fire rushing towards an oncoming torrent of water to put it out. The obvious happiness of Smeagol as he finally rids himself of Gollum. Even Frodo's gradual slide into darkness as he spits venom every now and then at Sam. These are what make up a great story and that's what made Fellowship so great. The Two Towers are full of these as is the whole trilogy. The only disappointment in this film is the Warg attack.

"More adventurous, more unforgiving, more everything","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a masterful adaptation in continuing to deliver the wonders and horrors of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantastical saga.The returning cast are all great, with character dynamics allowing more development, especially between Dominic Monaghan's Merry and Billy Boyd's Pippin, who feel more relevant to the story this time around. The new additions to the cast are all also very good with notable mentions being Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, and Bernard Hill. But now, with the increased budget to do so, the execution of Andy Serkis' Gollum is nothing short of remarkable, as the special effects really enhance the expressions without ever coming off as cartoonish or silly, and feel completely necessary in bringing such a starved and deformed creature to reality. Moreover, the set design and landscapes are all still breathtaking, the cinematography continues to capture the utter scope of every scene and sequence, and the score is still just as powerful, especially in the battle scenes. And on that note, the battle of Helm's Deep makes for an excellently thrilling and captivating climax that not only delivers part of what the story has been building to, but ends in a way that neatly sets up the third and final chapter.In short, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic second part that leaves both those familiar and unfamiliar with the source material eagerly anticipating as to if Jackson can now cap off what could be an epic trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Another Year!!,"Well what can i say that hasnt been said before. I love this film, so what if Peter Jackson doesnt have every inch of Tolkiens book down because he's got most of it, and he expands into areas which i personally felt were missing or bunged off into the appendicies, and i cant see what all the uproar is about. Remember people its a film, a film of a long book, which i can honestly say is not without fault in itself. Some areas would translate very difficultly onto film. The Portrayal of Faramir disappointed me a bit, because i liked his character of a noble man in the book, but his greed and power lust is there to show that men are not without fault, and he comes good in the end. The battle scene with the Wargs is a very nice addition, and Legolas does that cool thing on the horse.

Its true brilliance, in my opinion, lies in its groundbreaking use of CGI.While CGI had been used before this trilogy, none had revolutionized it quite like Lord of the Rings. The epic battle scenes, colossal creatures, and meticulously crafted kingdoms, with significant assistance from miniatures, were all made possible by the groundbreaking technology they embraced. The brilliance of Andy Serkis cannot be overstated; he brought computer-generated characters to life in a way that had never been done before. His contributions have truly transformed the game for the better, and no one does it as masterfully as him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
9 - Excellent,"Some see it as the lesser entry of the trilogy. I see it as the vital bridge which allows the characters to develop. Samwise and Frodo spend more time with each other. Gollum gets significant character development as his dual personality leaves the two main characters split on whether he is helping them or not, weakening their loyalty to each other.Merry and Pippin, with the help of Treebeard, get to where they need to go in a subplot that adds humor and character to an otherwise rough movie. Saruman and the surviving Gandalf are also in conflict. And there's plenty of meaty battles. The Two Towers combines immersive setting, intense action and strong storytelling together in an overall essential experience for fans of fantasy..",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"If you haven't got your Elf, what have you got? A better movie!","I am in the ""purist"" camp and find Jackson's work to be almost unwatchable. I have read the entire Lord Of The Rings sequence at least 20 or 30 times through my late childhood to adulthood, and for all it's flaws it is still a masterpiece.It is unfilmable, in Jackson's own words, so he has set himself up for failure.  For all his technical prowess, and the amazing achievements by his creative team, this work lacks the depth of Tolkein's vision, and instead of requiring of us some imagination, it blinds us with special effects.Omissions are to be expected in a work of this scale - you can't take such a large tome and condense it, even into three movies, without losing some of the plot.  But why make up plots that aren't there?In Jackson's middle earth, men are weak, prone to corruption, that is why Isildur takes the ring for himself and that is a theme that Jackson seems to catch onto and run with.  Why?  There are other themes of Tolkein's which were valid and valuable and would still speak to a modern audience.I appreciate that Tolkein's work lacked strong female voices, and have no problem with Arwen's character being built upon and extrapolated to a degree - her ""rescue"" of Frodo in Fellowship is quite thrilling I suppose, but this whole dream sequence in TTT with a whinging Elf princess and her overbearing father - characters I don't recognise whatsoever from Tolkein's work - add nothing to the story.The sacking of Isengard by the Ents brought a tear of joy to my eye, but otherwise I found this middle movie dull, unimaginative, and very much a victim of ""hollywood spin"".Let's hope the Return Of The King offers some satisfaction.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film. Like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'The Two Towers' uses the beautiful scenery to convey the burdens of the journey and the beauty that there is in the world gradually succumbing to the evil wizard.

A terrific follow up to the first film,"Out of all of the LOTR films, this one is definitely the weakest but it still holds up as an amazing continuation from where the first film left off.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the story with Frodo and Sam getting closer to Mordor with the aid of Gollum whilst the rest of the Fellowship go up against Saruman and his army.The Two Towers really steps it up from The Fellowship of the Ring in terms of scale. Once again, this film looks absolutely stunning. Peter Jackson's direction is terrific. So many gorgeous shots conveying the beauty of Middle-earth and constantly reminding you how epic it is. I view The Two Towers as more of a build up film. It sets a lot of things in motion for the events that will take place in the third film. Due to that, the film does feel slower than the first but not a single minute feels wasted. It is three hours long but Jackson manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout it with the characters and scale of the world.A lovely addition to this film is Gollum, who we got a glimpse of in the first film. The motion capture work on Gollum is really well done and Andy Serkis's performance helps the viewer feel connected to him. By far the best part of The Two Towers is the ending. The battle at the end is simply breathtaking. It's shot beautifully and the sheer scope of it all makes it one of the best battles in film history. Hats off to the special effects team. They worked extremely hard and it all paid off in the end.The performances are great all around. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortenson and the rest of the cast from the previous film all did well. The new additions like Bernard Hill and Brad Douris played their roles exceptionally well and contributed a lot to this film.I like The Fellowship of the Ring better but The Two Towers continued the LOTR story brilliantly.

The Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers,"LOTR intentionally or unintentionally weakens the existence of magic. Because LOTR aims to convey that even ordinary people can change the course of events, and even the most insignificant character can change the fate of many people. However, the influence of magic on the process of things is gradually diluted in the actors' authentic performances. This is also why in the trilogy, magic only exists as a certain tone to depict the psychological changes of characters, rather than targeting the entity of a certain thing.

The middle one,"IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
EPIC!,"As difficult a feat as that might seem, Jackson delivers an even better film than The Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers is the grandest spectacle that has ever graced the screen. As near-perfect as a film can possibly get, no longer comparable to other genre pictures, but to the great classics of the art.The sheer scope of The Two Towers makes its predecessor look like an idle stroll in the park. It starts with a bang and doesn't quit for the whole three hours of its duration. And like in the first part, Jackson doesn't fall victim to all the eye candy (and there's more than plenty), he injects the endeavour with a sense of humanity and gravitas that transcends fantasy film-making.Perhaps the greatest surprise is Gollum, a CGI creation that is guaranteed to make your jaw drop. Acted by Andy Serkis and replaced in the final version by a marvelous computer creation by Wetta Digital (surpassing all previous digital characters by miles), he delivers the best performance in the movie. Dynamic, incredibly expressive and ultimately conveying a sense of real pity for the character. And that's no small achievement in a film filled with actors of this calibre.It all concludes with what is probably the best medieval battle scene ever shown and will leave you with a hunger for more.The Two Towers is what film's all about. A true masterpiece. And we still have one more film before the trilogy is completed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Overall : The Two Towers stands out as one of the greatest sequels of all time with its incredible battle and palpable suspense.,"Each of the Lord of the Rings movies is a masterpiece: the cast, costumes, sets, effects, storytelling, scale, directing, and cinematography are all the best of the best. Picking one above the others can be difficult, but The Two Towers rises to the top because of its final battle. The moment the rain falls over the hushed armies in the last minutes before the conflict erupts is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen in a war epic. The overwhelming hopelessness of the remnant of Rohan as they attempt to survive the endless enemy hordes is incredibly powerful, and the tension is tangible. Despite knowing a third movie comes next, it felts as if anything could happen. LOTR: The Two Towers edges out the rest of the trilogy by avoiding the weight of beginning or ending a greater story and can be present in the intensity of its own journey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Even my friend who never read the book guessed (always correctly) what surely wasn't in the book: like that ""exorcism"" of Theoden...

"Poor in places, but an enjoyable 3 hour diversion","There is something mildly offensive about people in this forum taking issue with `nitpickers'. This attitude is wrong because it takes as its assumption that a work such as The Two Towers is beyond criticism, and how dare anyone find fault with it?There are two threads to the pro- and anti- TTT arguments: those who compare the film with the book, and those who comment on just the film.A body of work such as Tolkien's trilogy is bound to have a plethora of devoted defenders, and their opinions on the divergence of the film plot from the books are valid. The issue I have against this argument is that a faithful reproduction of the books onto film would have been tedious: the council of Elrond from the Fellowship of the Ring was over 10,000 words long!; the battle of the Ents on the film of TTT took place in real-time, whereas in the book it happens in retrospect (arguably, like in the conventions of classical Greek drama, adding to the sense of surprise by having minor characters describe something that has happened in the past).Jackson's treatment of TTT is good, but not brilliant. The other breathless reviews of this film reflect an unquestioning readiness to be seduced by overwhelming spectacle. There are nevertheless some elements for which Jackson deserves praise: the rendering of Gollum into a genuinely pitiable character; the beefing up of Faramir's character and role (the antithesis of which works well in the book, but would have made this episode pointless in the film if he hadn't been seen to be a more aggressive character - probably a Jackson decision to darken Gondor's predicament prior to the climactic conflict in the final film); the warg battle and Aragorn's interlude; the suspiciously Arab-looking human allies of Sauron being both mysterious, mute and menacing; Grima Wormtongue's tears when he sees Saruman's army; and my favourite bit - the representation of Fangorn Forest as something mildly sinister and the genuinely quite sweet looking ents.The battle of Helm's Deep could have been shortened, though my main gripe is with the absolutely pointless introduction of Haldir and his doomed elf stormtroopers. Jackson's adjustments up to this point can be explained away under the protection of dramatic licence i.e. to speed the plot along, but what was the point of the elves? That they didn't appear at this point in the book is a minor point, what is unforgivable is that in an already over-lengthy battle scene, their introduction served absolutely no dramatic purpose. I would even go so far to say that it spoiled this episode: it pointlessly lightened the mood as the forces of darkness were closing in on the refugees and small force of human soldiers. Maybe Jackson has a thing about bows and arrows.On paper, the climactic battle of Gondor reads better than Helm's Deep, and I am hoping that the film of the Return of The King will be as thrilling as the literary version.Overall, TTT is a good film, but the Fellowship was better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This Film is REALLY Awful,"I just watched the DVD wondering if my impressions would change.  They did. What I thought was bad in the theater is now terrible.

The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good film.

Slower paced with much less action and a lot more talk.,"When watching the Lord of the Rings films, one has to keep in mind they were filmed simultaneously. Therefore the good cinematography and groundbreaking visuals are consistent. The same applies to the good performances.'The Two Towers' is my least favorite of the LOTR films for a number of reasons. Firstly, they deviate too much from the original premise. The attention shifts away from Frodo on his quest, and he is absent for large parts of the film. A lot of new characters are introduced, and I felt the cast became somewhat cluttered. With so many new characters and story lines, I found myself easily losing track of the story. One of the new characters is Treebeard - a boring, uninteresting character. Yup, talking and walking trees abound!! (*insert WTF here*!!).The film revolves mainly around the kingdom of Rohan, under threat from Saruman. But what does this have to do with everything? Why is Rohan so important? They loose focus on the matter at hand; that being Frodo on his mission to Mordor. At least the attack scene on Helm's Deep in Rohan was exciting!The black riders are also back, although only for a short while. They no longer ride horses; they now ride on giant birds that look like Pterodactyls - or are they dragons?? Who knows? Unfortunately, as a result, they are no longer creepy. The film's highlight - by far! - was the Gollum, Smeagol. He is an entirely CGI character, yet unbelievably realistic. And he steals the show!! He is the most interesting character with his split personality, and devious grin.'The Two Towers' is significantly slower paced than 'Fellowship of the Ring' and not all that interesting either. There are way too many back stories and characters that the film really has no need for. Unlike 'Fellowship of the Rings', 'The Two Towers' feels like a 3-hour movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"An awe-inspiring, literate thrill-ride.","I just saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" at a preview screening, and it was every bit as good as I expected it to be.  The technical elements are cutting edge, and as in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" perfect examples of special effects expertly used in the service of the story.  This film will leave you breathless in places, awestruck and bowled-over with the fast-paced action and excitement.""The Two Towers"" is certainly darker and grittier than the first film-- as it should be.Obviously, the question with this new Peter Jackson film, as with the last, is: Is it true to the book?  Yes, it captures the spirit of Tolkien's writing, and in many places surpasses the dramatic tension of the books. Does it stray from Tolkien's plot: Yes, to a degree.  To those that love the books, the differences will be obvious-- and maybe a little jarring-- but once you weigh the changes against the dramatic & visual impact the changes make, you reach the conclusion that these were the right choices for the movie.  After all, this is the movie, not the book.  Don't go expecting to ""see the book,"" with every little plot detail and line of dialogue on the screen verbatim.  It doesn't work that way.  What Jackson has again given us is his visual interpretation of the spirit of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and the results are grand, epic, stunning, literate, surprising, vivid and unforgettable.  A vastly entertaining film.  Sadly, we now just have to wait another year to see the end of the story-- but that film, like this one, will surely be worth the wait.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing,"Watching ""The Two Towers"" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like ""The Tempest"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways.  The film begins with a powerfully audacious image:  Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, ""You shall not pass!""  As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you.  Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.This happens over and over in ""The Two Towers"", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination:  the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments.  We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level.  This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time.

The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers - Saturday Night Review,"Peter Jackson delivers again. In style.The Lord of the Rings : The Towers, is the next installment, or rather the continuation of the Fellowship of The Ring. The story continues from the Great River, where Frodo and Sam part away from the rest of the Fellowship and embark on a journey never to be forgotten: that of destroying the One Ring, by taking it deep inside Mordor, into Mount Doom.Elijah Wood and Sean Astin once again steal the show with supreme performances of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee respectively, while the return of Gandalf is welcomed appreciatively. The story takes on two difference courses, both of which are equally vital and are given almost the equal amount of time throughout the movie.Peter Jackson has not disappointed one bit with the visuals. The screenplay is simply magnificent and war sequence of Helms Deep will always be one of my favorite scenes in the Lord of The Rings. Faith, trust, loyalty and friendship is shown throughout the movie, as in the epic book of J.R.R. Tolkein. The music is wonderful, quite similar to its previous installment, but nevertheless a hundred percent effective. The fall of Isengard is shown in a splendid way and Jackson shows it takes more than mere directing to achieve it. A great effort taken by the entire crew for the movie and full appreciation deserved.Quite a few would be of the opinion that The Two Towers is relatively disappointing with respect to the other two movies. I beg to disagree. The movie has been fantastically captured, and pays tribute to the book perfectly.Overall, it is a captivating movie, taking the story to its final part, the epic ending of the Lord of the Rings. A must watch for any movie fan, let alone an The Lord of the Rings fanatic. It is a visual treat, great story telling and great performances. A 10 / 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Waiting for Frodo: The Epic Journey Continues,"Understandably darker and heavier than 'The Fellowship of The Ring' while being absolutely unforgiving to its already scarred characters, 'The Two Towers' feeds off its predecessor's pure energy and glee to widen the scope of the story and drain every last piece of hope that was built. Flawless in its structure, the second installment in the Lord of the Rings saga manages, in the first 120 minutes, to wisely, although sometimes clumsily, blend multiple storylines within the same quest, only to reach its culminating point in the last hour - an event so grand and so massively epic in scale that it left me astonished, a cinematic accomplishment in the likes of few others, the very epitomy of what fantasy and adventure films should eternally strive for: the Battle of Helm's Deep. In this day and age defined by the dullness of sequels, 'The Two Towers' has a purpose, a meaning, a pulse that never stops growing through the few ups and countless downs of Frodo and Sam, of Aragorn - of Middle Earth.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
BEST SOUNDTRACK IN THE WHOLE SERIES,"The soundtrack of this movie is my favorite out of the three. It is so epic and makes me want to ride into battle majestically on some white steed.For a lot of people, this is their least favorite movie out of the three as well. And I can see why if you are only watching it for the battle scenes. But if you are here for the character development then you LOVE this movie.You see so many great things with all the characters in this movie. You begin to know them more personally and you care for them. It makes watching the rest of the movies so fun when you feel like you actually understand the motives and reasons why behind a lot of the characters.And also I mean.... Aaragorn's door-opening scene is iconic, and it is the reason I will forever have way to high and unreachable standards when it comes to men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Awesome sequel!,"In my view the two towers will go down as my second favourite film of all time behind (obviously) LOTR: Return of the King. The film proved to be a much better film than the fellowship of the ring mainly because of two things. Helm's Deep and Gollum.Helm's Deep proved to be the most exciting siege film since The Alamo. 10,000 urik-hai against a small guard of farmers, old men and stable boys proved to be like David against three Goliaths. At the end of the battle mass audiences were stunned to witness a battle sequence as stunning as Braveheart in the part where Gandalf rides down the steep mountain with the Rohirrum as they attack the Urik-Hai to win the battle.This film had a bit of funny moments such as Gimli telling Legolas that he could have picked a better spot to see the mass army. Plus the same two characters counting how many Urik-Hai they were killing during the epic battle scene.New characters in The Two Towers included Miranda Otto (from War of the Worlds) playing Aragorn's secret love interest, Bernard Hill (Titanic) playing King Theardon and David Wenham (Van Helsing) playing Boromir's brother Faramir.But the new character who led well was the CGI character Gollum who joined Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the one ring. His mutters of 'my precious' had giving cinema a new movie line to join others.Also impressive where the tree ents who helped hobbits Merry and Pippin to destroy Isengaard with an exciting action sequence.Overall I preferred this film to Fellowship of the Ring and would say that it is my favourite 'second film' to a trilogy!

Are you people nuts? what's with the 9.1 average rating? Not a good movie at all!,"To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I""m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings  ahead of?ahead of the....Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic moviesI mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, ""Did I gain anything from watching this movie?"" The answer is no2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This is the tale of the battle for Helms Deep.,"This story picks up where ""Fellowship of the Ring"", left off. The fellowship divided in its direction and even though the immediate purposes diverge and converge the urgency of getting the ring to Mordor is ever-present. We are lucky in the fact that J. R. R. Tolkien will completely follow each participant's path from beginning to end. All the wars are covered in detail and the progress of the ring bearer is chronicled. New creatures and old vermin reveal themselves.As with the Ramayana, we find that every creature has his/her function and that there is no black and white in this purpose. Frodo (Elijah Wood) alludes to this when he thinks of Gandalf, Aragorn, and Gollum. Even Gandalf tells not to hurt Gollum as he may play a larger role in the story than one could imagine.Now let us continue the tale and see where it leads us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Timeless movie!,"Words can't even begin to describe how in love I am with this next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one was one of my favorites to watch while growing up and this one also seems to have some of the best laughs that the trilogy has to offer. The characters, the locations, the story line, the musical scores, the intensity in almost every scene, the magic, the battles both big and small, everything about this next big step in Frodo's journey is so compelling and fantastically made. Peter Jackson is a complete genius! Even the mysteries and questions that come from this one are very intriguing like what really happened to Gandalf after his fall in the mines of Moria and is he ever coming back, is there still hope left for Middle Earth as the One Ring is taken closer to Mordor and Mount Doom, can Frodo and Sam really trust Gollum when they cross paths with him, what will happen next now that the Fellowship of the Ring is divided and split into separate groups, where is the next battle going to take place or even will the Kingdom of Rohan survive when they soon come under the line of fire and also will the memory of Boromir still be kept alive after losing him in part 1 of the trilogy, the list of questions and mysteries continues to go on and it all makes the story even more compelling, captivating, intriguing and fascinating that you can never help just going back for more. If you haven't seen this sequel to the first film yet whether you've seen the first film already or not than you're missing out on something fantastic and completely mesmerizing, my sister and I will continue to watch this film long into our golden years and continue to love and treasure our favorite butt kicking boys and how amazingly they always work together, Legolas still for me and Aragorn still for my sister. Even the actors behind the characters will continue to amaze us forever, from Elijah Wood to Sean Aston to Billy Boyd to Ian Mchellen to Orlando Bloom to Viggo Mortenson to Miranda Otto to Bernard Hill to Christopher Lee to Liv Tyler to John Rhys-Davis the list goes on and on and we are forever impressed by all of them and the hard work they put into these kind of films with Peter Jackson behind the whole wheel. After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to love this sequel and all that it has to offer before the big and astounding conclusion in part 3, can anyone ever stop me from watching this film for the rest of my life no matter how old I get?

Good but not perfect,"I vividly recall watching this in the theater for the first time and having a shocked reaction to Faramir announcing that he was taking Frodo and Sam to Gondor.

There are many reviews that complain about Faramir being ""darker"" than in the book; that may be but it didn't bother me that much -- the point was still made that Faramir was the better brother.Another problem I have is with Mordor's economy. Yes, you read that correctly. How are the orcs and human armies fed? Mordor is a barren wasteland. Moreover, they seek to make ALL of Middle-Earth a barren wasteland. What's the motivation for Sauron's forces here? Seems like everyone will starve, except for the Nazgul I guess.I gave FOTR a glowing review and 10 stars, but this gets 9.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"As the penultimate film representation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book series ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Two Towers"" was a blockbuster hit in theaters worldwide. Besides the fact that it was the film that would tie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to ""The Return of the King, ""The Two Towers"" closely and effectively portrayed the text of Tolkien's book ""The Two Towers"" which helped to rake in a large audience - particularly those who knew Tolkien and his story of the Ring from his books. In terms of the film, Peter Jackson's excellent directing as well as the award-winning performances delivered by the star-studded cast allowed for the attraction of millions of viewers. Also, ""The Two Towers'"" epic battle scenes and constant sequences of action contributed to the film's overall attractiveness. Perhaps one very important characteristic of the film to note, however, is its special effects. Through the use of special effects, Jackson generated a film that stimulated the imagination of the audience, especially those who had read the book series, and brought them into a place where they could easily imagine themselves in Middle Earth, watching Frodo's quest omnisciently. The quality of the film combined with its accurate representation of Tolkien's book series both contribute to the epic nature of ""The Two Towers"" and also leave fans with an incredible story to remember.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Great movie and continuation of the journey,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" (2002) is a great sequel and movie to the great ""Fellowship of the Ring"".

The action sequences still looks spectacular even in 2024. And sure, while some of the Gollum effects does not look as it was cutting edge 22 years ago, the performance by legendary Andy Serkis more then carries it.

RELAX! This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book.,Everyone who read the books over and over will most likely hate these movies. Because they do not 100% follow them nor your imagination. It is impossible for them to. This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book. In all honesty if you never read the books and enjoy epics like Braveheart you will love these films.I grew up playing Dungeon and Dragons for fun and have played many RPG PC games. No movie to date comes closer to what these experiences are then these Epic Movies. I mean people complain about LOTR? Have you people seen the crap Dungeons and Dragons movie?There is a point where you can over analyize something. The LOTR book readers have done just that. I'm not one to read books over and over but I can enjoy a movie again if I am watching it with someone new or it has been along time. You guys need to Relax. This movie is beautifully shot and casted well. Peter Jackson is not known for anything but these movies and he will be known forever for these. The backdrop of New Zealand is perfect for middlearth. LOTR is scored by music that engulfes you into the scenes. But what makes these movies so great is the story by Tolkien but adapted by Jackson. It works Period.I'm sure you guys are mad that page 56 of book 2 has a character pausing for breath when they forgot to show it in the movie! Oh the horror. Get over it move on you have your books read them enjoy them. I judged this movie based on it being a MOVIE. I don't even want to read the books after hearing the comments made by their fans. You guys need to ask yourself is this movie REALLY that bad? Or do movies like Excaliber and Conan do it better? I think not.

It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.,"Leaving you off at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, it continues will no background of what had happened already. It makes the movie flow better. It also gives you A reason to see the first installment. Out of all the trilogies I have seen, never have I seen the second installment better than the first one. It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, ""Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy."" In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, ""she will do it."" But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
great movie!,"With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien. The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. ""The Two Towers"" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic scenes save Towers,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""Why am I here with these actors?"" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Perhaps the most overrated movies I have ever seen.,"Now don't get me wrong, I thought it was great. The atmosphere was right, and Gollum was unforgettable, but I was really shocked to see people get so ecstatic about it.I mean, the movie has no sophisticated idea, the acting, besides maybe Gollum and Gandalf was pretty medium, and some aspects in the script really annoyed me (poor Gimli.. they turned him to a clown..).I found the movie very entertaining, but it was defiantly not 'the greatest movie of all time'.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
walking and more walking,"This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Another phenomenal achievement by Peter Jackson,"Similar to the first Pete Jackson mov tloie, I watched this entry a lot as a kid whenever it aired on television. Now in 2024, I can see that this movie is another epic.Positives for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002):
Similar to the first movie, Peter Jackson has crafted a masterpiece from start to finish. The directing, writing, production design, costumes, cinematography, makeup, musical score and CGI are all top notch. This movie takes advantage of its lengthy runtime and expands upon the excellent foundation set up in the first time. The movie also does a fantastic job at balancing it's three main plotlines to where they all get their time to shine in the spotlight multiple times. Everyone in the cast once again do an exceptional job with their performances including yoursome of the new cat members with Bernard Hill as Theoden, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Brad Dourif as Grjma Wormtongue, Karl Urban as Eomer and u as Denethor. This is also the first time we get to see Gollum and on-screen and once again Andy Serkis for hm this performance voice. The action forsequences are even more spectacular in this movie And finally, the movie ends in a place where all of the main characters are on their way to destroy Sauron and the One Ring.Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) is a fantastic sequel, another phenomenal entry in this cinematic trilogy and I can't wait to rewatch the finale to this trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I could go on watching forever...,"This second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. It ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer Christopher Lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: ""What? Is it over already???""I watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night I was not one little bit tired. All I wanted was the movie to continue right now - but I guess we'll have to wait another year...Compared to ""The Fellowship"", this movie has fewer epic moments (as Boromirs death, the Hobbits being hunted by the Nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. The shifting between the three different storylines (Rohan (Aragorn), Rohan (Merry/Pippin) and Mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. This way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. Certainly, the story in Mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but Jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in Rohan.As for Gollum: I would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! The facial impressions of Gollum were tremendous, at first I really was appalled about how ugly he was, but Jackson really captured the essence of Gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. An Oscar for Gollum? It's an opportunity!Many of the other characters were developed further like Aragorn, Sam or Gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: Not too much, but certainly right on the mark!The only thing I cannot really fathom right now is the way the Arwen character goes, how Eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the Rohan storyline ended right after the Helms Deep battle instead of in Isengard.Oh yes: And the attack on Helms Deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the Rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste.Not to mention the reality check when Aragorn and Gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of Orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am I to criticize :-) ?",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Another Great Addition to a Perfect Trilogy,"The Two Towers is another movie I really don't mind the extended version of. 4 hours of amazing dialogue, fights, and storytelling that I love so so much. There's so many memorable scenes, and nothing to complain about. While I do find it a little odd that Frodo isn't included as much in this, he still has his key moments and the movie's still full of amazing scenes. The visuals are really something I enjoy, with plenty of places that look some kind of cool. I can't get enough of the strong, visible pulls between good and evil that hammer each other back and forth, and it leaves this feel of giddiness when something good happens. This is just another great addition to Peter Jackson's perfect trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Absolutely 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Masterful rendition of Tolkien's vision,"In 1994, when Houghton Mifflin Company published a single copy of The Lord of The Rings, Douglas A. Anderson wrote a 'revised note to the text' making it clear that J. R. R. Tolkien's famous epic novel was 'often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes'. The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings). According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume. Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself. However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.All of this background is not for want when reviewing Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers. In spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second. The Two Towers immediately picks up right where the Fellowship of The Ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced. The Two Towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to Mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged, while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron and the traitorous Saruman. New characters are introduced, notably the Ents, Grima Wormtongue, King Theodon and the creature Gollum.The film is undoubtedly mythical, just as Tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions Tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests. In many ways Gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder.It is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that Jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Excellent, but different feel","I can say without any morale reprehension to rush out and see The Two Towers.  While comparing it to Fellowship would be nearly impossible. The way I see it these films are two different types, while Fellowship was character development with enough action to keep you excited, Towers is action with enough character development to keep you caring.  It's hard to say which is better because I feel that I have reached the middle part of one fantastic nine hour epic film, and you don't find people saying what third of a movie they liked best.  The acting in Two Towers is top notch, as it was to be expected. But the true stand out wasn't who you would have expected, it was Gollum.  If ever a CGI character deserved an Academy award or at least a nomination, it is Gollum.  The CGI is so beleivable its creepy and the acting really lets you see whats going on inside of his head.  This was a difficult job you could tell but Serkis pulled it off with style.  The action will keep you begging for more as Jackson never ceases to amaze you with what he can do with the camera.  So go now, stop reading and then wait a year until you can watch the extended edition in preparation for Return of the King",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
WOW!,"I happened to be one of the luckier people out there. My school, La Salle University, was giving away passes to an advanced screening here in Philadelphia. This was free, so I can't say I got my money's worth. Instead, I was repaid GRACIOUSLY for trekking down to the theater. (A harrowing experience in the snow.)Anyway, I want to keep this brief.  I have to give props to the animation department for their very accurate emulation of human movement on Gollum. He interacts with the characters and environment so fluidly, so amazingly, I forgot instantly that he was digital at all. Gollum's movements are scary and unnerving... and scarily accurate to the book's telling of Gollum's conduct.You think the environments in FOTR were good? Put it aside. Helm's Deep is ridiculously beautiful. As an artist, I've come to appreciate environment, but the scenery on and around Helm's Deep are so stunning it took me forever to soak it all in. I woke up the next morning and I was still commenting to myself on the power of this scenery.Talk about epic. This movie outdoes itself. If you had any quavering doubts about the direction of the series after watching FOTR, give TT a chance... the sheer power of this movie is overwhelming.Legolas fans get more insane stunts, and Gimli fans get the best lines in the movie.

An epic bridge weighed down by uneven pacing,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, directed by Peter Jackson, is a visually spectacular continuation of Tolkien's legendary saga. Expanding the narrative across multiple storylines, the film dives deeper into the conflicts and alliances shaping the fate of Middle-earth. While ambitious in scope and stunning in execution, it occasionally falters under the weight of its sprawling narrative.Elijah Wood continues to deliver a compelling performance as Frodo, whose journey grows darker with the increasing burden of the One Ring. Sean Astin as Sam provides heartfelt support, while Andy Serkis's groundbreaking portrayal of Gollum is a highlight, capturing the character's internal struggle with remarkable nuance. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, and Orlando Bloom excel in their respective roles, though the divided storylines leave some characters underdeveloped.Jackson's visual direction remains exceptional, with breathtaking battles like Helm's Deep showcasing his mastery of large-scale action. The detailed world-building immerses viewers in the grandeur and peril of Middle-earth, with CGI and practical effects seamlessly blending to create iconic moments. Howard Shore's score once again enriches the emotional and dramatic weight of the story.However, the film's narrative suffers from pacing issues, with certain segments feeling overly drawn out while others seem rushed. The constant shift between storylines, though necessary, sometimes dilutes the emotional intensity and momentum. While the themes of loyalty, courage, and the corrupting influence of power remain strong, the film feels like a bridge between the more focused first installment and the climactic finale.The Two Towers is an ambitious middle chapter that expands the world and stakes of the trilogy but struggles to balance its intricate plotlines. It's a visually stunning epic that sets the stage for a grand conclusion but lacks the narrative cohesion of its predecessor.Rating: 6/10 - A visually impressive but uneven continuation of the saga.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy,"The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen.

This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A strong second act,"Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Dead Alive"" did not exactly have mega-credentials.When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's ""By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)"" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a ""10""). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Great,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My favourite movie franchise ever,"This is my favourite set of movies, return of the king (3rd lord of the rings movie) being my absolute favourite movie I've ever seen. The CGI and special effects are brilliant for something of this time, the cast couldn't have been better. Elijah Wood was absolutely superb, along with Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, John Rhys Davis and Dominic Monaghan. They were all absolutely excellent, start to finish. They are like the books in so many ways and really managed to take the books and put it onto a screen in such a wonderful way. The storyline was very strong and advanced. The way the turned Andy Circus into Gollum was epic for something that came out at that time. It, by far, had the best battle scene in the whole franchise and better than the majority of films I've seen. Those who've seen the film will know which battle I'm talking about but I don't want to give spoilers. I've lost count of how many times I've seen these films. The dialogue was awesome and there wasn't a scene where I spotted a huge mistake that ruined the film. I think there was the odd CGI error but it wasn't major. The make up was extremely believable, especially the orcs and the hobbits' feet. The whole world was just so great. Overall, this was my least favourite out of the three but it is very close. Peter Jackson did a great job and I have no idea how many times I've rewatched these films!

The Outstanding 2nd Installment in a Magnificent Trilogy,Cinematic perfection. What cant you say about Jacksons Trilogy. The two towers is a feast for the senses. As I said in my review of TFOTR. Those who are comparing its accuracy to the books need to take a long look at themselves and stop being purist Tolkien fanboys/girls. I've read the books and in their purest form would not make a good movie. Taking 20 pages to describe the shape of a hedge doesn't make for an easy translation. A picture says a thousand words and the extended versions of the Trilogy provide ample satisfactory elements of the story. Again it looks amazing and the sound track is outstanding. Simply unforgettable and enormously revisitable. Superb. 10 easily.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Decent movie, read the book first","The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Best of 3!,"Having followed the entire production from green-light, I was entirely pleased with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. However, I did prefer the extended versions on DVD, with the voice-over commentaries and all. The shorter theatrical version of THE TWO TOWERS holds a very special place as perhaps the most exciting film ever made. True, it is not 100% accurate to the novel. It stands on its own. Theoden's speeches, the lighting used, the great Warg battle, and of course Gollum working as well as he did all contributed to an eminently satisfying experience. Every actor has taken their role and made it completely their own. The spectacular sets, particularly those of Isengard, blend so well with the natural beauty of New Zealand to provide both eye candy and attention to the fine details of model-making. The dramatic changes of scene to the approach to Mordor are dynamic. And Brad Dourif gives yet another creepy performance, being one of the finest living actors who has carved out his own niche.

"Good, but not Great","Clearly, the Lord of the Rings fanatics are taking over ImDb. They have managed to voted ""The Two Towers"" into the number 4 spot on the all-time list. Ridiculous. Certainly, ""Two Towers"" is a good movie, but it has several problems that prevent it from attaining the greatness of its predecessor, ""Fellowship of the Ring"".First, all those useless, lingering shots of Liv Tyler make me conclude that Peter Jackson, as great a job as he has done on the series, could not resist the Michael Bay-like tendency to use his film as a platform for admiring the goddess-like qualities of some members of the fairer sex. Second, the slow-motion, close-up shots of the women and children cowering in the shelter of helms' deep, anticipating a gory fate. I certainly understand their fear, but all of these sequences seem manipulative and heavy handed. Frankly, I was plenty worried about the fates of the defenders without having to be reminded (repeatedly) by Mr. Jackson that there were mothers and children present, too. Finally, in ""Fellowship"", Mr. Jackson had a little less confidence in the patience of his audience, and he was therefore much more economical in his translation of Tolkien's narrative onto the screen. In ""Two Towers"", he throws economy out the window, and the film suffers as a result. When your film exceeds three hours AND you find yourself cutting in numerous slow-motion sequences, a little self-examination is in order. I am not calling for elimination of crucial elements of Tolkien's story, but successful adaptation from page to screen requires some clever narrative devices to truncate long passages into digestible visual material. In this regard, ""Two Towers"" is far inferior to ""Fellowship"". I hope that Jackson, in ""Return of the King"", shows more self-control.Still, Mr. Jackson is on the verge of one of the most extraordinary achievements in film history. He deserves all of his success.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Very disappointing,"As someone read the book, I found the film version pretty disappointing. The film maker made a number of deviations from the book, and it is not obvious why. Does Peter Jackson think he is a better story teller than Tolkein? I don't think so. He made plot changes, like having Theoden actually possessed by Saruman (!) and having Frodo actually offer the ring to the Ringwraith (!). Why? He also developed characters differently, which was sort of annoying. All of a sudden, Treebeard was a menacing zombie, Faramir was mean-spirited, and Gimli was comical. Again, why? I thought Jackson did a much better job with the ""Fellowship of the Ring."" Here he took way too much license.

The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning.  But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others:  Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be.  It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature.Never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Huge improvement over the first installment,"I found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. It was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. The second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. The cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. The plotline of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas defending the people of Rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. I'm actually glad for that, as I'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. I turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. Pippin and Merry, the two Hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. This plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention.The third plotline, the one with Frodo and Sam, is by far the most interesting. Gollum, the former owner of the ring, now obsessed with it, attacks them and is captured. He soon becomes their guide when Frodo begins to sympathize with his downfall. Gollum is by far the most interesting character in the film, like Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back. This is the first computer-generated character to work completely. Except for his eyes, I'd accept him as a physical entity. And his story and performance are just so tragic that these parts were nearly overwhelming at times. It's too bad they don't award voice characterizations (and I can't find who did it on imdb). The special effects guys really, truly deserve to win an Oscar for their work here. He was so interesting, I wanted the whole movie to be based from his point of view for a lot of the film.Fortunately, the other two stories do begin to work after a while. There's a great, kinetic battle scene with some wolves that was apparently not in the novel, which, of course, angers all the nerds. This leads to some material about Liv Tyler's character which was also not in the book. My LOTR nerd friend admitted that these scenes were good, and, in my mind, that was the first real scene that got me to give the slightest care for Aragorn, who seems so important but, to me, seemed so uninteresting in the first movie and a lot of this one. The elf and dwarf also begin to come into their own, although the dwarf is often used solely for comic relief, and it's not especially funny. A lot of the movie focuses around a huge battle fought by these characters. They have armies now, so this battle scene is much less ridiculous than the ones in the first film. It's actually enormously entertaining. Pippin and Merry also become more interesting, although they're never going to be, I fear, as interesting as anyone else. The ents whom they hang around with are really cool, though. The ents' attack on one of the towers (I do have to admit that I didn't even realize there were two myself) makes for a very neat scene.My biggest complaint is about the same as my biggest complaint about the first film. Why are the villains so boring? The orcs and their kin are just dull, faceless villains. They're fodder for the good guys' armies. They run around and yowl, and that's about it. Why can't there be a few generals or something that have interesting things to say? Christopher Lee, who did make a bit of an impression in the first film, is totally shafted in this one. He does little more than sit in his tower and watch his troops march away. There's also a new villain, an Ozzy Osbourne-looking guy named Wormtongue, who is controlling the king of Rohan with magic. Do you really believe that they would allow a guy named Wormtongue to come into their palace, let alone advise the king?Despite this film's numerous flaws, I can't think of another film of 2002 that really entertained me more than this one. 8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Greatest Fantasy Film of All Time?,"Quite simply, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best fantasy film series ever made. This is surprising for people who are familiar with Jackson's earliest work (""Bad Taste"", for example). But give the man a decent budget and he can command a film. Of the three films, this is possibly the strongest (though the third is also good). Generally, fight scenes tend to bore me, but here Jackson makes them interesting, fun to watch and ""epic"" in the best sense of the word.Although coming in at three hours, the extended edition adds on another forty minutes. I have not seen this, but from what I hear it is a must-see. And I cannot disagree. The three hours is all killer, no filler... if the remaining scenes are just as good, there is no reason to miss out on them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The middle film from Middle Earth.,"The Two Towers is my favourite film from the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts with my favourite scene of the trilogy—Gandalf's breath-taking battle against the Balrog in the bowels of Middle Earth; ends with the best action scenes of the trilogy—the epic battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard; and features many of my most memorable moments from the trilogy, including Gollum's schizophrenic conversation with Smeagol, a hilarious discussion between orcs about whether they should eat Merry and Pippin, and Legolas shouting 'They've taken the hobbits to Isengard!' (check out the dance music remix of this on YouTube—it's hilarious!).A few minor niggles prevent me from awarding The Two Towers top marks—the rather slow scenes with Treebeard in Fangorn, Legolas surfing down some steps on a shield (a portent of the excesses of The Return of the King), and the fact that it took me three viewings to completely understand all that happens—but on the whole this is an excellent film. Did I mention it was my favourite of the trilogy?",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I will give them spectacle and they will love me for it,"I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself.Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of ""Spartacus"" and ""Ran"".  Do computers make this any better?  Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say ""yes, they do"".  The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like ""Fellowship"" did.  Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time.Oh well, watch this if you have time for it. I'll go back to ""Empire"" instead.Overall: !!! out of !!!!! time-wasting viewings.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"An Indepted Fanboy's Love Letter to The Lord of the Rings: A Critical Essay on the Film Trilogy, Part Two","(click on my name for Part One)Okay, that's that. Now for some deconstruction.First, to the visual side of The Lord of the Rings. Visually, it is indeed ravishing in every sense of the word. Its scale and technological wonders make it heaven on your eyes, and in every frame there are so many beautiful things to look at that with every viewing you notice something there that you never noticed before (something that defines any true classic). The design is so richly detailed and by turns shimmeringly beautiful and powerfully arresting that you feel like you can just reach into the screen and touch the rainforest treetops of Rivendell or Lothlórien, or smell the gritty underbelly of the almost dystopic caverns of Isengard. Much of this is due to the many spectacular New Zealand locations on which the movie was filmed  indeed, Jackson's choices of locations were so beneficial overall to New Zealand's tourism industry that then-New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark stated, ""Peter Jackson has done more for New Zealand's tourism industry than any man since Captain Cook!""Still on the visual aspect of The Lord of the Rings, overshadowing the sets and costumes are the indisputably awe-inspiring special effects. They have the same effect as the sets and costumes, however they overpower other technical aspects of the production when we learn there was much more at stake with the special effects. And the special effects are, it must be said, nothing less than special. In fact, what am I saying? To merely write them off as ""special"" is both an understatement and an injustice. It's almost as if Peter Jackson has made a 3-D movie that you don't need to watch while wearing those stupid glasses, to get the adrenaline rush that 3-D brings. The dragon firework; Frodo's blurred and almost otherworldly vision when he puts on the One Ring; the dormant demon erupting out of Cate Blanchett's Queen Galadriel when she sees the Ring; the river flooding Isengard to the ground; Mount Doom blowing its top and the tower of Orthanc collapsing to the ground, causing an earthquake after the destruction of the Ring; and the afore-mentioned showdown on the Bridge of Khazad-dum to name but a few. All become indelibly etched in your memory forever. And then there's Gollum (played to sheer perfection by Andy Serkis), the first completely lifelike (if that's the right adjective to use in relation to a non-human character) computer-generated character ever committed to celluloid. Gollum was the main reason as to just why the realism of the visuals in The Lord of the Rings was so critical to the outcome, especially in The Two Towers and The Return of the King, because he is the character through which the story's moral of how power corrupts is delivered. Visually, The Lord of the Rings is, to put it lightly, a dream come true.Another visual plus is Andrew Lesnie's exhilarating cinematography  indeed, the effectiveness of the picturesque New Zealand locations in the overall look of the movie has a great deal to do with his camera and he deserved every gram of the Academy Award he won for Fellowship. Two photographic shots in the entire piece that never fail to leave me awestruck are the tracking shot of the butterfly flying along the caverns of Isengard then up and over the tower of Orthanc (despite that shot being mostly computer-generated) and the haunting mise-en-scene (following Arwen's (Liv Tyler) vision of Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) passing) of leaves floating over Aragorn's casket to show the withering passage of time. Sublime.Click on my name for Part Three!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The Trilogy continues, and it's just as good as the first...","...with even more action pumped in; the final battle sequence is an astonishing feat from Jackson and his team, making an entire fleet of Urk-Hai completely computer animated, seem totally convincing.  And while the second part is exactly as long as the first, it's even more eye-grabbing with it's visual wonder, the scope of Middle Earth the most impressive thing about Two Towers (it's deserved of an Oscar).  Another impressive feat is the computer animated creature of Gollum, a schitzophrenic, deformed Hobbit who finds Frodo Baggins his new master, alongside Samwise Gamgee, and he may just be the most compelling of the characters, along with the somewhat downsized role of Gandalf the Grey, er White, played still with skill by Sir Ian McKellan.So, for the fans of the Fellowship, and for Tolkien's core audience, they may find a few story strands missing from the original novel, but it is highly reccomended viewing anyway, and if those are concerned about not seeing a scene they visioned from the book, keep in mind that probably a year from now will see the release of the Two Towers extended edition on DVD.  Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
an Odyssey of three,"Like most good flower children, I read the trilogy, but I cheated and read the Similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. First, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than JRR did, and JRR used a lot of words-three big books. Tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. Now the movie. In this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the Bridge on the River Kwai holds the children in us in interest with Hawkins, Holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. Likewise, the scenes with the interaction of Frodo and Samwise with their enemy-guide Gollum, captivate the viewer. The little bits of humor with characterization, such as when Samwise cooks the rabbit. Gollum responds ""Oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!"" That whole bit is priceless. No wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing Gollum if the movie ever came out. A role you could literally get your teeth into. A delightfully depraved character. The adventures of Merry and Pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. They play a minor role, and it is directed as such. The adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. It makes sense that Gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of JRR's world from the beginning of time. One wonders why he can't actually do more. However, why some smart Uruk Hai doesn't just slice off Aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. The battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. Never does Aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. The bit where Wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. But the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. All in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. Quite enjoyable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest Movie Of All Time-Part 2,"Another fantastic layer to the film is the art direction, which is not only elegant and organic at times, but rugged and industrial. It also fabricates a realism into itself that creates infinite impact on the audience.The cast is also very good, they play off each other perfectly, different nationalities keeping each character fresh and interesting. Due to the huge number of characters in this film, I will only mention the most notable performances: As far as Hobbits go, Elijah Wood gives us a brilliant transformation from a wide-eyed innocent to a paranoid ring-junkie. Sean Astin gives us a beautiful portrayal of boundless friendship and unlikely courage. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd provide delightful comic relief when together, compelling character development when apart. Ian Holm has only a small amount of screen time, but in it he is incredibly memorable as Bilbo. Ian Mckellen is powerful as Gandalf, as well as providing hope and exposition along the long journey. Now we come to the miss-matched Three Musketeers: Viggo Mortensen is powerful, rugged, and tortured as Aragorn, where as Orlando Bloom and John-Rhys Davies are both simply awesome when they get to play off each other. When it comes to Sean Bean as Boromir, during the course of the story, he does a villainous deed, but we still feel sympathy for him, as we do for his younger brother, Faramir, played to perfection by David Whenham, who strives to please his father by emulating Boromir. I see no reason why John Noble, who plays Denethor, the tragic, corrupt father of the two sons mentioned earlier, should'not receive an Oscar for his Shakespearean performance.The film also holds its own brand of visual amazement. Combining fantastic lighting that further effects the tone of a particular scene, elaborate sword fights that give each character their own method of fighting, incredible action scenes including a single warrior climbing a giant elephant and single-handedly taking him down, 2,000 horses sliding down a hillside, a giant staircase falling down a chasm, a man and a fiery beast fighting while falling miles down a tunnel into an underground lake, and a mile-high tower falling and exploding on it's way down, and dynamic camera moves, that include something of a roller coaster ride through massive tunnels, a minute-long shot of a moth flying over a tower, or a pan past a mile-high life-like statue of a forgotten king.In a film with so much spectacle, CGI is expected, but here, not even noticeable. Giant monsters, CGI sets and landscapes, and fabricated armies, all flawlessly integrated into the film by a computer, looking as real as if they were all there right in front of the camera. But for all the films technical achievements, they hail in comparison to one: Gollum. His movements are flawless, his voice perfect, his amazingly realistic flesh tones breathtaking. Whether you hate him, pity him, or identify with him, is your decision. The film portrays him in such a way, unbiased, unprejudiced. But one thing we can all agree on, he is quite simply, one of the greatest technical achievements of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A gritty masterpiece,"I'd say that this is the most action oriented film of the trilogy. It has so many CGI achievements that it isn't even funny. And, in terms of action, tops the Fellowship by a long shot.This is a much more gritty war film, though, and doesn't have the cheery magical feel that the first film has. This is an action packed film that is pretty long. The only problem is, though I wouldn't really call it a problem, that it is kind of slow until we finally get to the big battle at the end.The Merry and Pippin story is, obviously, the slowest because they are with tree-beard. But I enjoy watching those scenes. They are so awesome from a animation point-of-view.But once you get to the battle and when the Ents start destroying Isengard, it's awesome!! (Not that the whole film isn't).I think, though, that this is of the three films has the worst replay value. This is an awesome film to see in theaters and, maybe, watch it on DVD once or twice. But you can't watch it all the way through like you can Fellowship without nodding off a few times.But still, this is an epic film that I love and wouldn't change a thing.-Chris",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A staggering achievement in cinema.,"Quite simply, this is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema ever committed to film.  From the very first moment the direction and action grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until long after you've left the cinema.  The film's epic proportions and feel as well as it's intense emotion are perfectly controlled by one of the greatest director's that cinema has ever seen.  As an adaptation it's not without it's flaws, leaving many of us -who've read Tolkien's novel- with questions still unanswered, even having watched the special extended edition.  Yet, over all, the changes made and omissions from the book are used to good effect in the exciting retelling of this chapter of the classic tale.Superlative acting from a perfectly cast body of actors adds to the magic of this already classic film.  A score to die for and Jackson's sweeping direction create a world that is utterly involving and even believable. 'The Two Towers' is unparalleled in cinema history -except, of course, by it's predecessor 'The Fellowship Of The Ring'- and sets new standards in film effects and story telling.  The film is a cinematic journey of rich emotion and spectacular action which can not be praised highly enough.  Of course, it does have it's faults in storytelling and even the odd CGI shot, but these pale in comparison to the depth and magnitude of the overall picture.Unlike some recent film successes, 'The Two Towers' rightly deserves it's place among any list or collection of cinema's greatest films.   Only the most threatened critic or hardened cynic could fail to be moved by this stunning movie creation.  Sheer brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A great cinematic achievement!,"Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers stands out as the second best of the Trilogy, the first being The Fellowship. The directive skills of Peter Jackson and how he managed to draw up nearly six units working together, is really awesome. The cinematography of Andrew Lesnie is very enthralling and I think he must have won the Best Cinematographer award for all the three movies. The guys at Weta Digital are really marvellous. Its because of their imagination that we got to see such a spectacular portrayal of moving images on the screen. Hats off to Stephen Regelous for creating the MASSIVE CROWD DEVELOPER software, which was used in the battle scenes. The soundtrack by Howard Shore is mind-blowing and the track, Gollum's Song by Emiliana Torrini stands out.The creation of the fully computer generated creature, Gollum is the highlight of the three movies. Its really amazing how such a character can be created using the keyboard and mouse of a computer. Each of its facial expression seems to be so realist, just like a human being. Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum is awesome. Gimli, the dwarf provide some humour to the movie, when all the other characters speak only serious stuff. I liked the Helm's Deep battle scene, where he asks Aragorn to throw him into the crowd of Orcs at the gate, provided he does not tell the Elves about it.Frankly speaking, I have never read the Lord of the Rings Books before watching the movie.

Disappointing,"Had I never read the trilogy, I would've enjoyed this movie more.  The screenwriters basically slaughtered it.  One of the noblest characters in the book was Faramir, who did what his brother Boromir could not do, and let Frodo leave for Mordor with the ring.  In the movie, Faramir is as bad as Boromir and wants the ring for Gondor. Arrrrrgh!  Letting Frodo go shows that even though a man can be tempted, he can overcome.  The movie eventually got it right, but only after Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath.  What a crock!The scene with Saruman's orcs riding the cats (or whatever they were) had no business being in the movie.  The screenwriters could've used the time to show more of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard, but they just glossed over this very important part.Also, what's this crap with the almost love triangle among Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond? Yuck!  If I'd wanted a chick flick, I wouldn't have gone to see The Two Towers.I saw ""Fellowship"" several times in the theatre, but ""The Two Towers"" was a dud.

Fate would have it that The Two Towers is the quintessential post 911 allegory;,"Faceless world altering evil being stood up to my the united grieving good of the little person. When Gandalf or Sam or Merry or Faramir speaks they're speaking using Tolkien's words through time and talking directly to us. Undoubtedly the success of this and the other Rings movies are that they are lovingly and reverently adapted by teams of indie creatives at the height of their passion and the tops of their game. However, it's enduring legacy and legendary status owes itself to the fact that The Two Towers had, and still has, a reason to exist in the world. It speaks to what fantasy was made for and it bolsters the human spirit and champions hope and understanding, forgiveness and love.There's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of CGI and characterisation of Sméagol/Gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. It gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to Return of the King. His arc from Gollum to Sméagol and to Gollum again is sad, important and due to Andy Serkis also hilarious. It does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. The battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one.The extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. Boromir and Faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of Théoden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Slightly better than the first,"The plot of this movie is about Barlago from Garganda who needs to get to Margalala before the Embligs reach it and try to destroy the Ziglwigs... or something like that.  Maybe if I had immersed myself in the trilogy and attended sci-fi conventions beforehand, I could've actually understood the story.  Instead, it plays like a big, spectacular video game.  Admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it because it is visually the most amazing thing we've seen on the screen yet, especially the computer generated character with the big ears (Grogglegorf, I think).  All the names sound alike, most of the characters look alike, and there are too many of them to care about any of them.  The scene with the H.R. Puffenstuff trees was mildly humorous, although I don't think that was intentional. So the plot is probably even less penetrable to non-geeks than the first one, but it is oh so fun to watch.  If you are not a sci-fi geek, go for the visuals.  Computer graphics have reached the promised land -- it is a landmark movie in that regard.

Don't bother if you're not a fan of the books,"The most fervent of LOTR fans seem to be those who have read the books. Having not read any Tolkien I will have to review the movie as a film in its own right.Although I have seen TFOTR (which I gave 4/10) I still found TTT somewhat of an overload of characters, races and politics.  If you like the books and you liked TFOTR then there isn't any point in reading a review that doesn't declare TTT as the best movie ever...but for those fans of films I will try and point out the main flaws.The biggest problem for those not fans of the books is that we simply don't care about the characters and nothing is done to make us care.  People are introduced to us and 10 minutes later when they are killed/revealed as having unrequited love/had their lands taken from them, we are actually supposed to care.  But why would we?The other criticism would be the overuse of trying to make you believe that the main characters might actually die, only to reveal later on that *gosh* they haven't.  To my count this was done three times and is rather cliche and boring.  Quite childish to be honest.To make it on its own strengths as a movie it needs to lose an hour at least, but I realise that would simply disgust people who avidly boast at the number of times they have read the books.  I said about the first one what I'll say about this...if you need to have already read the books to like the movie and care about the characters then it is *not* a good movie, and this is not a good movie.  I gave it 4/10 also.On the plus side, yes the scenery and computer effects were all wonderful. As were the effects in Terminator 2 but I don't hear anyone claim that as being the best movie of all time.

One of the Best Films in the history of LOTR,"The one thing about this movie that really catches my attention, is the special effects. THe director really did everything that he could, and what is needed in this movie, and made a movie from the book spectacular, and beyond stunning. This is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie of them all, and I have watched the 3 hour Extended version of the movie about 10 times over, and watched the extras on the DVD, which takes about an hour to complete. I must say I am one of those Lord of the Rings geek.One of the best movies of all time, and the best movie I have seen in all my time. The actors are so good with their roles it's unbelievable that they were acting, and not actually feeling it themselves, because I definitely did. This movie also housed a lot of my Favorite Actors, and they picked perfect people for all of their roles. Elijah Wood played an excellent role of Frodo Baggins, his character being the small, lost Hobbit in the movie, wandering with his one friend Sam Gamgee, who was also very perfect for his role. They made the elves look so real I wondered sometimes if they were born with those ears or not. The fight scenes in the movie also blew me away, especially the last one.This has to be the only movie from the book where I liked the movie better than the book, and I am not a person like that. I believe you get more involved with the movie than the book, and that is not normal for me. I am glad they haven't ruined the book with the movie, like a lot of directors do. Take a look at something like that Da Vinci Code, or Eragon, and you will see what I mean. The book is very good though, but also very long.I can easily just sit through 3 hours of this movie whenever I want to, and watch it over and over again at my pleasure, I know few people like me who can do that, and a lot of people watch a movie once and throw it away and never watch it again.

Epic Movie,"An outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects can be found in the opening scene of The Two Towers, only to be matched (and far exceeded) in the final half of the film. Despite the fact that the first two hours serve well as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour of The Two Towers. This is because they focus on Helm's Deep's battle. During the first two hours, the audience is merely teased and tortured. Although such a gap must exist between the beginning and the end, I have no reservations about saying that the final hour will make the wait entirely worthwhile, regardless of how you feel about the first two hours.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Hugely epic and well-made, The Two Towers is another success for the Lord of the Rings.","The Two Towers dwarfs The Fellowship of the Ring in size, scale, and the grandeur of the action scenes. While FOTR followed Frodo and co. as they started their journey across Middle Earth to destroy the Ring, TTT is our first glimpse at what happens in the bigger world as the Fellowship breaks - a war is being fought over this Ring, and the war is starting now... Needless to say, TTT is a bigger film than FOTR. Instead of about 100 Orcs and a troll against nine men, we have armies of thousands of Orcs and Uruk-hai, against armies of thousands of Men, and proper big weapons. And the results are amazing. The battle for Helm's Deep is brilliantly done - Braveheart can pack its bags and go home, this is the new champion of sword-fighting epics. The way tension was built up to the battle was brilliant - you found yourself practically drooling by the time the Men were gathered on the outer walls of the castle, ready for battle. And besides from ending with the smaller fights and starting with the larger wars, this film also started off some new plots - the story of King Theoden and Eowyn and the first meeting with Gollum (we got some glimpses of him in the last film but this film is his real introduction) - and develops these plots sufficiently for them to be continued and ended in the next film - the epic close to this great trilogy. This film definitely did not pass on anything, and though the relatively slim budget (believe me, $93,000,000 is not much for a film of this scale) tells you that a lot of it is CG, it is still bloody impressive, and builds more on the LOTR trilogy's status as an epic series. The Fellowship has broken, but the story is still far from over... 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Now this is what Film making is all about!,"What an excellent film. Again, I will point out that I was not a fan of the ""Lord of the Rings"" books.I saw the first movie and was blown away.

I was so captivated by the battle scenes, they were real. If anyone really wants to see how a war is waged and how it is fought (anything goes!), this is a place to start.I am saddened that this installment did not get named Oscar Best Picture for out of all of the Nominees, I would have chosen this over the MUCH overrated 'Chicago' any day.

Here we go again...,"On one hand, it's an improvement over the first chapter. On the other hand, that is, unfortunately, not much of an accomplishment. Like most movies that run more than two hours (in this case, a LOT more than two hours), it would have been vastly improved by aggressive editing. Once again, we have wooden characters (although they are starting to show some signs of life), settings that suffer from a deplorable excess of styling, and a story that really isn't all that interesting or coherent.In it's favor, we again have nice effects, but it still feels too much like Xena, Warrior Princess with a better budget, and probably less interesting characters.

A too long travel to a too short battle,"This movie presented me with a dilemma. I read and loved the book, and I sure did like the first one. I realize that to make a movie you can´t just follow the book (that would take at least a 20 hour movie) but why waste time in details shown in the book while discarding some important effects the book causes? For example, Frodo´s journey becomes unbearable in the book, here it only seems like a long walk, only uncomfortable. And the story, honestly, becomes to slow and long for a movie. It´s ok for the book to be slow because it gives us time to enjoy the details of Tolkien´s work, but in the movie is just a waste of time. Besides all it´s downsides, it has most of what people should expect: Absolutely AMAZING special effects, Gollum is as real as it gets and the battle scene it´s marvellous, but it comes too late. My girlfriend didn´t read the book and thought the movie was allright, not as surprising as the first one, but good. So, to sum it up, for me it can barely make it. It has a 10 in special effects, but a 2 in the plot.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Does not match up to ""Fellowship"", but nonetheless great.","Over a year ago, during my winter vacation, I was surfing through the internet for movie showtimes. I had wanted to watch a movie with a cousin, and did not know what to watch. Curious, I looked up for this very movie and asked my cousins if it was okay to watch. My feelings towards the Lord of the Rings trilogy has never been any different since then.Having watched this before ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was introduced to a completely different world and at an awkward time, mind you. I was amazed at the many creatures, all the battles, and other bad things going on in this distant world. ""The Two Towers"" displayed many wonderful things on screen, including all the special effects, which was amazing to many audiences.A bit of advice: Do watch ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" before taking your time to watch this movie. In my opinion, ""Fellowship"" was a more joyful and more fun movie than this one, which was more appealing to me.

The lesser in the trilogy,"As I already said in the review for THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of their reputation and the many reviews for them here. I finally saw them last summer and I loved them all, yet this (the second) didn't win me over like the others. I don't say it's bad, just not on the same level of the previous or THE RETURN OF THE KING.Needless to say that this chapter follows three stories: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Samwise (Sean Astin) continue their journey towards Mordor for destroying the only ring with the company of its original owner Gollum; Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies) and then Gandalf (Ian McKellen) go to rescue Rohan that is ready for the battle against Saruman (Christopher Lee); and Merry and Peregrine (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) plan an attack on Isengard while in the custody of Treebeard.The sets are great, and you can see that they spent all their money for having them so big. The soundtrack is nice, no surprise here. The performances were good, nothing to rave about, and Gollum was very funny despite a bit scary (and I won't recommend this movie to very young or sensible viewers for this reason alone). The problems were that the pace was slow in the second half and made the performances stilted, and the battle scene with those ancient elephants seemed a bit too long for my taste.Still, not the greatest in the trilogy but I think the director did it on purpose for making us wait what was in store for the third chapter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

They all gave outstanding performances again. Brad Dourif created a sinister Wormtongue and Andy Serkis really brought Gollum to life. I feel that if Serkis didn't portray him, to character wouldn't seem as real.All the special effects were superb. The use of 'bigatures' really improved the environment. If Peter Jackson and his team used CGI instead, i feel they wouldn't have captured it right. The CGI which was used was also very impressing. Trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are CGI, can be a real challenge. The character of Gollum was also a CGI masterpiece. Andy Serkis together which the characters looks, really brought him to life.The music was a wonderful treat again, and Howard Shore did another great job again. He really added to the characters and moved the story along.If you haven't seen any of the film before, i would highly suggest you catch them, as they are really a HUGE part of cinema history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

And you thought the first one was good,"Man, director Peter Jackson is 2 for 2 for Lord of the Rings.  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second part in what many are already saying is the greatest trilogy in film.  LOTR: TTT  is just as good as Fellowship if not better in some aspects.New characters are introduced and they are just as interesting as the great cast of the first film.  Bernard Hill is noticeably good as King Theoden who has a powerful scene at the grave of his son. I also liked Faramir.  Yes, he is different from the book but I thought David Wenham's performance was heartfelt and real.  Miranda Otto(Eowyn), Karl Urban(Eomer), and Brad Dourif(Grima Wormtongue) round out the great new cast.The special effects  are more frequent and extremely impressive.  Gollum is a great acheivement in computer effects and definitely the most believable computer generated character.  Treebeard and the ents also look fantastic. And the computer generated warriors at Helm's Deep are a sight to behold.This film is filled with so many great moments that it's hard to pinpoint just one.  Gollum/Smeagol's duality, Ents storming on Isengard, The Battle of Helm's Deep, Frodo offering the Ring, Gandalf's ride to victory, and Sam's final speech are all fantastic.  See this film.

Another half exciting movie,"This movie fails where Part I failed too: only about half the movie is interesting.  This time round the boring bit was Sam and Frodo who seem so stupid (they get into mortal danger each time we see them) and their journey tells nothing interesting.  Even the appearance of Gollum can't save this dreadful story. The second of three stories is Aragon and friends who meet humans and then battle it out with orcs.  This is quite interesting, but the battle and the end takes too long too keep me awake. But then there's the third story with Merry and Peppin and their fantastic story in meeting Treebeard.  This part definitely saves the story from boring me to death and the end with the destruction of Saruman's Lair (the name escapes me) by the ents is one of the most impressive scenes I ever saw.Overall not a bad movie, but could be a bit more exiting in the Frodo Sam story line, I almost hope when they do something stupid again  they just get killed or featured much less in Part III.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
no no no,"""The Two Towers"" is a mediocre action film. there, i said. go burn my effigy.the people who are giving this 10 are the equivalent of the Star Wars fanboys who will try and convince you ""...Phantom Menace"" was a good film. it wss not a good film and neither is this.the pacing for this film was awful, for the first half i was wishing for a remote control to skip to something intresting. the re-introdution of Gandalf was moronicly done (was ANYONE fooled by the whole Gandalf/Saruman thing?), Theoden was laughable, the whole Aragorn falling over a cliff stank of trying to eat up running time (in a three hour film! why did they need to eat up running time in a three hour film??) and the Aragorn-Arwen sub-plot was slow and pointless.the problems continue, Gollum had his moments but they were few, and the annoyance factor of him otherwise was just not worth it. Sam is just as annoying as he is in the book. not a good thing. Frodo is a wuss, even more so the Theoden. the fact that the three most irritating charcters in the whole film share nearly all thier scenes together doesn't help. i was hoping the orcs would catch them.Liv Tyler is an awful actress. i don't know why she delivers all her lines in that stupid goddamn voice but i wish Jackson had told her to knock it off. it dosen't help that she's given awful dialoge in a pointless sub-plot either.some of the CGI was good, but the Wargs were crap. and what were the Nazgul riding? they looked like aborted dragon fetuses.300 guys against 10,000 orcs? maybe they should have got Steven Segal to play Aragorn instead. and in the best action film tradition, the Orcs are treated as cannon fodder, thus destroying any credable threat they represent. nursery school infants could take down an army or Orcs in this film.the constant onslaught of short jokes did not help. i'm convinced Jackson has something against short people, look at how he's pushed Merry and Pippin as far away from the story as he could. i'm convinced he would have written them out entirely if he thought he'd get away with it.Faramirs change didn't serve any purpose. i suspect Peter Jackson was just running out of ways to make Frodos journey intresting (theres only so many shots of Frodo, Sam and Gollum walking and occasionly looking over things that you can put in one film) so used Faramir to liven it up. at least it's more worthwhile then the time-wasting romantic sub-plot.i suppose i should mention things i liked; Gimli was cool, even with Jacksons best attempts to undermine him. the Elves coming to Helms-Deep. the occasional good moments with Gollum. most of the cast turned in pretty good performances (with the notable exception of Liv Tyler)hey i didn't like it but you should probably go see it anyway. just don't expect anything more then a bog-standard action film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Stunningly good movie that's unforgettable,"Like the fellowship of the ring, this movie is great in almost every level. It is as good as it and as well it's good in different kinds of ways. It's really hard to to a second part of a trilogy and make it just as awesome as the first and better in certain ways as well. Peter Jackson definitely has talent in his directing and you can definitely tell when you see this movie.The special effects are better than in the fellowship of the ring and the stories keep jumping around from the different people at different places. It takes off right where the fellowship of the ring left off focuses very heavily in each and every one of the characters in their different paths. The story is excellent and the acting is wonderful. Andy Serkis as gollum takes away this movie with his excellent acting ability for doing gollum's voice and stuff. There is a battle scene in this movie that is just unbelievably well done with outstanding visuals and special effects.This is continuing the great trilogy of the lord of the rings and making everybody just dying to see the return of the king. I can't I absolutely can't wait for it to come out. It's gonna be the closing to the trilogy and gonna be and awesome ending to it as well. Frodo started changing and becoming more effected by the ring in this one so he will probably be even worse in the last one. The battle for middle earth will be absolutely incredible and it's definitely gonna be at least as good as the other movies in the trilogy.This is an overall stunning movie. Lord of the Rings are my favorite movies and I think a lot of people will agree that this is the best movie of this year and the best movie anybody has seen in a long time. A great movie full of even more wonderful creatures, special effects, an equally good story line as the first, great plot and character development and even better acting. A little less adventurous than the first but not by too much. Still an equally good movie and my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Better than the first? Hard one to judge....,"When i had seen this movie i felt pretty blown away and immediately thought that it was better than the first movie. Then after a while when the movie had sunk in so to speak i found myself only remembering the action-parts of it, and there are a lot of them believe me. The first movie had more heart and soul to it. Of course Gollum had a very good performance as a CGI character and Gimli makes you laugh at times, so there is heart in it.The fact that it didn't follow the book i had been warned about so that didn't effect me except one HUGE thing, to me anyway: The absence of Narsil in Aragorns hands. In the book he uses this white-glowing sword in the battle at Helms deep. I don't know how and when Peter Jackson is gonna ""give"" him it.

"`The book is a great book, but it is unfilmable'","`The book is a great book, but it is unfilmable'That's a quote from Peter Jackson.And I strongly agree. Shoot the film from page to page and u get a cinematic piece of junk. The film is not here to replace the book, some Tolkien berserk Fanatics don't seem to get it. The film is not perfect, I agree, but perfection doesn't exist. Some things are changed from the book because it is a different media. Yes, Arwen has more scenes, the elfs join men in the battle of helm's deep; it's all part of the adaptation process. Arwen brings the emotional depth of the movie to another level. The elfs join men in the battle because there would be no tension if the audience thought there was no hope at all for the people of Rohan. Peter Jackson and his wife have done a fantastic job. I can't wait for the extended edition of TTT. The extended edition of The fellowship of the ring was much better than the theatrical version in my opinion. It said a lot more about the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Amazing sequel.,"One of the best sequels of all time, and that's saying something when the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time.The Two Towers picks up pretty much where the first one left off: Frodo and Sam are traveling on their own to Mordor, Merry and Pippin have been taken by a band of Orcs and Uruks with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli hot on their tail. Saruman is now building a great army, Merry and Pippin run into a giant race of Middle Earth, Aragorn and co. go forth to save the kingdom of Rohan, and Frodo and Sam have some unexpected company in the form of Gollum. New paths are crossed, old ones are found; each and everyone of them as captivating as possible.Once again, everything is exceptional. From the sets to the acting to the visual effects - everything is top notch.Peter Jackson and crew have done a tremendous job of topping the original in terms of storytelling. The lines are bolder, the cinematography even better, and the direction spot on.Throughout the film, you can see Frodo being taken in by the Ring's power. It is also obvious that Sam is trying hard to keep Frodo from falling into the Ring's power, whilst Gollum's character arc is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie.Aragorn's struggle as he comes to face the realization that he must take on the responsibility of his forefathers' is done extremely well. Comic relief comes in the form of Legolas and Gimli's relationship (Elves and Dwarfs don't usually get along), and how hobbits Merry and Pippin react to the ways of the Ents. By no means aren't they informative, because they are, but they are at the same time humorous.The action pieces are once again on par with the drama and have clearly gone beyond what was done in ""Fellowship"". From the Warg attack to the climactic battle at Helms Deep, Peter Jackson truly shows his imagination is leaps and bounds beyond any other director.The cinematography is once again superb, and it deserved every bit of the Oscar it won. Sets are realized on a greater scope than Fellowship of the Ring. Edoras is truly a magnificent town upon the hill, whilst Osgiliath looks like it really has been war-torn.I didn't mention Howard Shore's score in my review of ""Fellowship"", but my thoughts on his music for the first film are the same for this one: It's amazing. Simply amazing. The score is now synonymous with the term fantasy. A melodious orchestra piece highlights the drama, whilst the trumpet sounds as the the bodies pile up during the fights.Like the first film, my gripe is that this is quite a long movie. This is necessary for an adaption which source is amazingly detailed, and besides, you won't get bored easily. Also, major characters could be off screen for over half an hour, almost as though they have been forgotten. But you'll be so intrigued by what's going on screen, that you too will forget about the other characters. It also helps that the change in character plots are seamlessly changed from one to the other.Peter Jackson has once again made a must-see movie. This will be loved by the most die hard Tolkien fan to the most ignorant of fantasy. As Saruman said in The Two Towers: ""A new power is rising"". With hindsight, we now know what that means.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Much better than FOTR,"Perhaps it's the lessened necessity for basic exposition, perhaps it's Jackson's greater willingness to depart from the precise events depicted by Tolkien, but for whatever reason, THE TWO TOWERS mostly (but not entirely) overcomes the superficiality and rushed feeling that marred its predecessor.That's not to say there isn't a misstep here and there: in particular, Aragorn's fall and recovery is utterly pointless, and the Ents lose much in the translation to film. And TTT inevitably fails to capture the depth and richness of the world Tolkien created, simply because no film possibly could. But as a movie, this one succeeds very well.I may actually go see ROTK in the theater now.8/10(Addendum: Full series only 6/10.

Gloomier follow up to Fellowship of the Ring,"Some people prefer this second part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the first. I am not one of those people. Where the first movie's strength was in its exploration of a magical fantasy world, this one is – albeit necessarily – more gloomy. I would guess that it's primarily thought highly of for two main reasons. Firstly, for its epic recreation of the battle for Helm's Deep and secondly for the character Gollum. These are two pretty persuasive reasons to be honest. The battle scene is truly massive in its scale and execution, with a lot of painstaking detail; while the character of Gollum is even more revolutionary in cinematic terms. Andy Serkis famously played the character with motion-capture devices all over his body but Gollum was a fully CGI created creature. It's pretty remarkable, therefore, that this character has so much believability and empathy. It's a testament to both Serkis acting and the artists who created him that this is so.Other than this, for me, The Two Towers suffers a little from neither being the start nor the end of the story. It doesn't have the variety of tones and locations of the first film, and overall it did get a little tedious at times. But this is in no way meant to be a criticism of Peter Jackson's efforts. This was after all merely a recreation of what was actually in the book; it's just that my sensibilities are not so in line with this one. But it's pretty obvious that this is another loving recreation from Jackson and his team; and, like before, it has a great ensemble of actors to do it justice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Boring, confusing, and highly overrated","If I had to name the most overrated movie, this would be it. While it features some nice eye candy, it falls totally short in the plot.I can imagine that this movie may have some interest, if you have read the book. You may recognize bits and pieces you remember and have some fun comparing the visualizations with the way you imagined things. And as in the first part, some of the scenery is breathtaking. But aside from that, the movie is simply boring and confusing.It's boring because it lacks a coherent, compelling story. In a nutshell, this movie is about a bunch of people wandering around rather aimlessly. To disguise the simplicity of that 'story', many names of people, places and things are thrown at you constantly. As a consequence, I was rather annoyed than entertained.It's no use arguing about taste, but I cannot begin to understand why this mess is considered by so many to be one of the best movies of all time.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Grima Wormtongue rules!,"If you ask me, Grima Wormtongue is the coolest character in TTT. Gollum is great too, but Grima takes the cake.

I did not know the name Brad Dourif before, turns out he's the voice of Chucky too! Awesome.What makes the LOTR trilogy so great to me is all the supporting characters in small roles, such as Grima. ""The Mouth of Sauron"" in the extended version of ROTK is another favorite. And Denethor, too.All in all, the cast is doing a pretty incredible job. My only complaints are Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Boromir (Sean Bean), and, of course, the fact that Cate Blanchett talks like a man. She's supposed to be this breathtaking elf, the most attractive female you'll ever find. And here she is with a voice like somebody's grandfather who's been smoking for fifty years.

Absolutely Incredible,"This is a fantastic movie, incredibly filmed without a detail spared. The action sequences are among the best I have ever seen. While it's easy to say that the development of the familiar characters does not hold up well as a film would be by itself, if you take this film within the context of a second installment of a larger series it is a flaw that can be easily omitted. 	The parallel editing sequence that occurs between the major battle scene and that of the hobits talking to the tree people is also oddly paced, making you wonder why Peter Jackson chooses to cut up a fast-paced action sequence with a slow, drab monologue. However, the pace of juxtaposed sequences definitely heightens the feeling of general anxiety that grips you by the throat as the film approaches its climax. The dialogue can also be trying at times...the Sam/Froddo dialogue about being ""brave and strong"" towards the end of the film is trite and cheesy. However, there are also times in the film where we find wonderful prose emitting from the same characters, allowing me to forgive their occasional verbal blunders. 	At the end of the day, I can forgive the film's tiny flaws for the greatness that shadows over it. This film will take home some major awards next year. I have to say...seeing this film on opening night, I felt like a kid again. This is the Star Wars for a new generation. Let's just hope that Peter Jackson will keep this story sacred, and will never have the temerity to pull a ""Lucas"" and to rehash these great films into Hollywood train wrecks 20 years later.

Amazing would be quite the understatement for this wonderful epic of a film!,I am completely in awe as of now as i'm still trying to catch my best. I was very lucky to see it a private premier; and i walked out in cold chills as did the rest of the audience. Think of the impact 'The Empire Strikes Back' had - and double it ... this is the magnitude of this film. The fantasy and realism mix so perfectly well it's a completely believable the brilliance of the novel is brought to life flawlessly. I'd say much more; words alone cannot do this film half the justice it deserves!

Part 2 of the most epic trilogy of all time,"After the fantastic Fellowship of the Ring we wait a year to finally get Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Just like the first this film is just fantastic. The acting is still great, the writing is still great, the characters are still great, and it is even more epic. It is just great. Many people consider this to be the weakest of the 3 films, but I think that this stands with the first in excellence. In this film we are introduced to Gollum. Gollum is the thing that most people remember about this film. His visuals are fantastic, and the character's split personality is commonly parodied. This great film continues the trilogy, and sets us up for the great end of The Lord of the Rings.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Famous Last Words,"Yes, I too was duly impressed with The Two Towers. I found it a better film than Fellowship, and still found Fellowship to be a great movie, so my impression of The Two Towers is that it is a great work.It's the second of three, and has not had the advantage Lucas had with The Empire Strikes Back. Potentially it suffers the same fate as Titanic, where everybody knows the outcome.(I was very surprised to hear Jay Leno broadcast that he has never read LoTR - that he has not read it is no surprise, considering who he is; that he should admit this is amazing: He's telling the whole world what they might not already understand about him.)Understanding that it takes jumping through quite a few hoops to pull off makes it all the more interesting to watch, but Jackson's sense for the dramatic is great. There are scenes leading up to Helm's Deep where the editing does it all - scenes that had the public in our theatre wrestling with themselves and their emotions, and there is no way Tolkien himself could have brought out such matters in the book itself.I think the music got a bid grandiose at times, a bit overpowering, but on the whole it was a good score, unlike the 'art' of composers Arnold and especially Williams who have this uncanny ability to totally ruin a movie.Gollum was a major feat. Many have said it's the best CGI ever, and one would be hard put to not agree. It certainly shames ILM thoroughly.Woods' Frodo is still a disappointment. One reviewer in the UK praised Astin for saving the scenes where Woods looks like he's going to make a pass at him. I agree: Woods more or less looks the part, but I don't think we're seeing great acting here. Astin, however, does a remarkable job - he does impress, and much more than in Fellowship.The girls love Orlando Bloom. His is a bit of Errol Flynn. My hero is Viggo, who doesn't have a clean face in 179 minutes. The portrayal of Strider brings home the gritty reality of a story that in book form was cloaked in niceties.The sex angle is mostly lost in the book too, but here we have lots of it, and a possible love triangle as well. This is well done of Jackson in my opinion: LoTR is otherwise too much of a 'guys story', and it makes it all so much more real.Time and again I found myself in a position - a predicament - unlike that of the reader of the book. Where the book offers a fantasy with lots of cool characters and a derring- do plot, the movie, with its incredible realism, makes you a part of the story, and you can't really close your eyes and fall off to sleep - you live in this world, a world that is basically an evil, threatening one.I think Jackson has transcended Tolkien: He's taken LoTR and given it a vision, and I am sure he and his crew have studied the book meticulously, and therefore been able to bring out detail most readers did not notice or soon forgot.Elsewhere at the IMDb one can read of dissatisfied surfers who don't want to wait another year for the finale, who think that six months is too long to wait for a SE DVD; and I think the irony here is thick.For starters, JRR Tolkien was a professor and expert and lover of the English language; and yet here we find some of the worst abuses of it ever. And no one seems capable of even reflecting on the themes presented by JRR; it's more about how good the CGI is, how good other special effects are, or in the best possible case how well the movie follows the book. And yet JRR had something very important to say. Here's a message that could be debated for a long time, with the human race the great benefactor.But no. We shall instead agree that Smeagol is well done and that some of the helicopter landscape shots are well formatted and that Treebeard is convincing, Mr Greenleaf is still the swooner, and that Aragorn son of Arathorn is a fitting successor to Middle Earth.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not as good as it is presented to be,"Everybody talks about The Two Towers (TTT) and I must agree that this is one of the top movies this year. But... I regret to say that I am pretty disappointed. Why? In TTT, compared to the Fellowship, there is more action, the story is faster, but... Forgive me but this movie is simply more ""american"" than the first part. There is a lot of computer graphics, a lot of characters, a lot of... everything. It is pitty that all this stuff draws attention away from the point. I encourage everyone to read the book (and to think about it not just ""eat"" everything they serve you).",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A true masterpiece, despite what Tolkien purists may say","Reading over some of the IMDb comments on this film, I am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book.  Film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible.  Tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as I have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie.  Jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle.  Almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'The Godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Bridge On The River Kwai', 'Apocalypse Now', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Raging Bull' and 2001.  And yes, I have read all these books so don't doubt me when I say it.  Literary structure is different from the structure of movies.  And any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie.  So the ending was changed. It will be in the next one.  So Arwen's appearance was an invention of Jackson's.  It created a bridge in her character between the first and third films.  Okay, I can understand the argument about Gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way.  In no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when I hear such comments as 'Like Merry And Pippin would ever let Frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', I get really bothered.  Menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled Tolkien purists, many of whom I feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly.  The smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else.  I myself have read 'The Lord Of The Rings' about 6 or 7 times, and I agree it is a great book.  Yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way.  And I apologize to any Tolkien fans I am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado I must say that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is Tolkien the greatest writer.  His mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning.  I shake my head when I hear 'The Lord Of The Rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. Despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to Joyce's 'Ulysses', Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov', or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  I love Dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'The Brothers Karamazov', and 'The Grand Inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, I would not damn the director, and insult the film, for I realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray.  If I may parody a line from 'Inherit The Wind', The Lord Of The Rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Stunning visuals but story leaves to be desired,"Quote: The Good: In terms of cinematic and visual scope - astounding. The camera sweeps and the battles were awesome. I really felt like I was there. Gollum was probably the best aspect of the whole movie (his inner struggle was nicely done). Gimli's comic relief was nicely done too.The Bad: After watching it, I just kinda sat there going, ""ehh..."". I dunno, the first one has this magical appeal to me (seen it 4 times already) but this one just kinda fell flat. Maybe I set my expectations too high.For one, the musical score failed IMO. I could only discern one new musical track... everything else was either from the first or too ambient (Enya-like female choirs)Character development was nil for the new characters. It was too hard to get any feel for them. It just felt like, ""here's blahblah, son of blahblah"" and that was it. Grima appeared to come out of nowhere. The King's son also had barely any development and there was one other guy that I had NO IDEA who he was the whole movie (he was always around the King, helped put his armor on).I could tell that the main focus was the Helm's Deep battle. While that was awesome, the rest just felt kinda shallow and long winded. The first half was especially slow and the last was all fighting w/ no story to back it all up. What was with Gandalf riding in the last scene? Where did he find King Rohan's son? How did Rohan's son's army turn that big??? (in the beginning he said only him and his small legion still fought for Rohan). How did they manage to kill off like the remaining 2,000 or so of Sauraman's troops. Why did that Rohan lady fall in love with Aragorn... they only met for like 2 seconds.All in all it left me awed but a little unsatisfied. 6.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Good movie, but the weakest of the three","The Two Towers is a good movie, but out of the three LotR movies it is by far the weakest.Peter Jackson's terrible choice in casting Elijah Wood as Frodo (a truly terrible choice that you would realize if you have read the books, given Wood's weak acting ability) is overlooked due to the mesmerizing performance of Andy Sirkis as Gollum, and Sean Astin's increasingly strong performance as Sam Gamgee.Other weak points include the Battle of Helm's Deep, which is completely changed for the simplistic cinema-goer having only a dozen remaining men ride out on horses (absolutely done for Hollywood's sake)as well as being poorly designed strategically. Then there is Peter Jackson's choice to make Faramir tempted by the ring, which completely changes the character from the book. As well, having to have Treebeard actually see the cut down trees to make him go to war (I can only suppose that having it this way instead of all the Ents deciding to go to war at their meeting, as done in the book, was done to accurately reflect the views of many people today: don't go to war unless it's right in your face, don't do anything to prevent loss unless it affects you). Then making Rohan look pathetic and having 2000 elves show up to help out was a little weak.Overall though, this movie is strong, and anchored by Gollum. Good but not great, though I would still place it above most movies these days.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This is a fantasy masterpiece and an absolute must see,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - The Extended Edition (2002) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline picks up where the Fellowship left off with the friends going their separate ways and facing their own perils. Sam and Frodo continue with the ring but add a new companion, one very familiar with the ring. Meanwhile an army is forming, led by Saruman, that looks to conquer Middle Earth. A reluctant king and white wizard will need to rally the troops and ally's if there's any hope for the world to not be plunged into darkness.This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Viggo Mortensen (Eastern Promises), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Liv Tyler (Armageddon), Christopher Lee (Dracula AD), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Sean Astin (Goonies).This picture obviously has no beginning or end but it is a brilliant continuation from the first movie. It was greatly aided by the outstanding addition of the character Gollum. The special effects, settings, attire and creatures are all brilliant. The battle scenes are perfect, unpredictable and the storyline has remarkable villains and obstacles that appear impossible to overcome. This film is 4 hours and you're still glued to every second and it leaves you begging for more.Overall this is a fantasy masterpiece and an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Really good, with qualifications","Epic filmed version of the second (and weakest) volume of the Tolkein Trilogy. The first time I watched this I got about half way through and said, this movie is so damn good I can't believe it. The acting is great and the scenery and effects are awesome. I'm not quite as excited on later watchings. What has me bothered (particularly during the second half) is when the movie strays from the source material. The original story is one of the great fantasy works ever, why go off in other directions? It's not just that the movie is unfaithful to the book, it's that there's no reason for it to go elsewhere. I'm quite sure there's no one working the script with credentials approaching Tolkien's. So I just don't get with the point of following the books 80% of the way and playing with the other 20%, but I'll reserve final judgment until Return Of The King. Post script: I should have qualified my reservations about the changes - Haldir and the elves coming to Helm's Deep is a Jackson invention and the coolest thing in the Two Towers. Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Three glorious hours of spellbinding adventure.,"I give TTT a 10, not because its perfect, but because its strengths so far outweigh its weaknesses.  Like others it was disappointing to see the divergence from the Book, particularly regarding Faramir and the Frodo/Sam's trip to Gondor.  It didn't make Faramir more real to me, as the screen writer argues, only less like Tolkien saw him (its sad that some people can't believe that there are those who resist temptation).Otherwise the film is such a pleasure to watch and become immersed in. You really get to see the world of Middle-Earth and experience the magic that originates from Tolkien's Masterpiece.  Peter Jackson should receive every award available for his beautiful depiction of TTT.  I was left only wanting more and would have been willing to sit through another 3 hours to see ROTK immediately after, as I hear they are doing in some theaters the day before ROTK comes out in December.Golem was the best supporting actor ever in any film.  Yes he was CGI, but he was a compilation of many hours of human effort and expression -- brilliantly done.

The middle,"The Two Towers continues almost straight from where Fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are going towards Mordor, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).I was amazed by the special effects of the Fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in The Two Towers. I was gravely mistaken. In the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in The Fellowship, Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast.Small skirmishes of the Fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in The Two Towers, when orc army of Saruman attacks towards Rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king Theoden (Bernard Hill), who is mislead by his councillor Wormtongue (chilling Brad Dourif), while his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth.Theatrical version of The Two Towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. All this was fixed beautifully in the Extended Edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. I personally enjoyed all of the extended and added Ent sequences. Also EE introduces us one new character, Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir (David Fenham) and Boromir (Sean Bean).The battle of Helms Deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. Fall of Isengard, home of Saruman, is shown as Tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat.Peter Jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the Warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like Elves coming to help defend Helms Deep. Some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either.Overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. It all just shows, that The Two towers is just a middle part of a longer story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"""You Shall Not Pass!""","This may have been the 40th time I've watched it, but even discounting that fact, I usually find it grabs my attention more. I think perhaps I may just be getting bored of Frodo constantly getting in to trouble and having to be rescued by Sam, whose character has far more substance and strength. Maybe it's how Elijah was directed, but he's so weak and feeble, I'm shocked he even made it out of the shire.
The other two hobbits are a bit annoying and brat like in this one too and Bernard of Rohan annoys me with his sulky attitude. ""It's my kingdom and I'll do what I want with it.""Also, despite the fact I like the addition of romance to the trilogy, I think it's a bit of a distraction in this one. It breaks up the flow a bit too much.Despite this slating and a reduction in its rating from 9 to 8, I still enjoy watching it and I won't stop watching it in the future, because there are things like Andy Serkis' superb performance as Gollum, the back and forth between his two personalities is outstanding as is the CGI used to create the character.

The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003),"""One Ring to rule them all,
One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all
And in the darkness bind them""Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" is a book that has introduced me to the world of epic fantasy and, while no longer in the top of my favorites, will forever hold a special place in my heart. I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of ""The Lord of the Rings"" just fly by.It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Proven correct yet again,"This review contains no spoilers (these are generally only typical of amateur critics)For those of you priveliged enough to have read my review of the film ""Lords of the Ring"", you will remember how I concluded with a clever prediction of ""imminent inevitable sequels"". Once again, I have been proven absolutely correct. However, I must concede that I didn't expect a sequel so soon (within about a year)!The good news is that this movie ups the ante on its predecessor with a considerably greater emphasis on action. It's a swords and sorcery roller-coaster ride with battle scenes of epic proportions. Once again, the fine landscape of New Zealand is the true scene-stealing star, and Mr. Jackson has impressed me considerably with his burgeoning directorial talent.It is an impressive film; probably amongst the very best of the large blockbuster films of the last decade. However, I do not agree that it should maintain position 9 on the IMDb top 250 where ""Jean de florette"" makes little impression at 246. For this reason I gave ""The Two Towers"" a 1, hopefully to bring it down a little. I implore the amateur movie critics of the IMDb to consult my greater knowledge and experience before making their own embarrasingly ill-judged opinions.Owing to the continued popularity of the subject matter, I believe this particular movie franchise could run and run.

That's a Mighty Gray and Brown Movie You've Made There Peter Jackson,"Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough.

Foo.  This cannot be born.,"These films are little more than eye (lesser eye) candy. There are hideous omissions by Jackson. `A director ought to know better"" Jackson DID know  better. There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with Jackson's and his movie!' - Book II, paraphrase. How many people will NOT read Tolkien because of this 3 part film fiasco? Jackson could have stayed close to the text.  The first glaring departure from it was when Gandalf did not use his staff to create a flash when Bilbo put on the Ring at the party.  This allowed for many sins. There are worse faux pa, but I shall not mention them here, except for one other particularly nasty flaw... the mis-attribution of lines both to and by movie chaarcters.  This is unforgivable. Here's a bad one- Wormtongue: `Ah, but you are alone. Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in? So fair, yet so cold like a morning of pale Spring still clinging to Winter.' I mean really, what have we here?  Wormtongue the White?  Grima the Poet? Gandalf said these words to Eomer.  And there is worse to come. Alas that Peter Jackson does not drink from the chalice of  misattribution folly and horror as we who have read Tolkien well! In sum, this quotation from Denethor II will suffice: `Have I not tasted it (the vileness of his straying from the written word) now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so!' I even fell asleep during the second flick...in the heat of the Battle at Helm's Deep.  I do not think I care to see the third installation. One's imagination is brought to life by the words of J.R.R. Tolkien and said images are precious to me.  Jackson's works are a denigration -- not an enhancement for me.

Truly my Favorite out of the 3,"I still find this my favorite one even though Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments).Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard.Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two persons, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Awesome spectacle,"This second introduction into the LOTR trilogy is a magnificent success. The journey continues onward and onward. It continues the story of Frodo and his friends. And it continues those remarkable special effects. The story is alas supplanted by the spectacle but what a spectacle it is. It is beautifully conceived. The battle for ISengard matches anything Sergei Einstein has done as well as the sequences from Bondachurks ""War and Peace"". It is gloriously realized piece of cinema. Something like this will never be seen again. This is a must have for everyone of this generation. There is no movie lover in this day and age who has not viewed this film at least once.

"Not the best of the trilogy, but still pretty good!","I've seen all the original parts of ""The Lord of the Rings"" on DVD. I thought ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Return of the King"" were the best of the trilogy, but what about this one (""The Two Towers"")? Obviously, I didn't think this was as good as the first and the third parts of the trilogy, but it was still good. The battle sequence near the end was pretty much the high point of the second movie, but everything before that didn't have a whole lot of action attached to it.Of course, I would never, ever, ever give any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies anything below a seven or so, so I am giving this an eight.

"""The Two Towers"" is the finest of the epic trilogy","While I do cherish and enjoy all three epic parts of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, I do prefer ""The Two Towers"" over its prequel and sequel films. It's not as cleverly made as the first one, not as heart-wrenching as the third one, but it is overall the most powerful of the three.What mostly motivated me to give it a 10/10 was the fact that it is the only one of the three films where I can sit down and watch the entire film without thinking ""This could've bit just a little bit shorter"". That was the reason why I only gave the other two films 9/10, because they were a little bit too long to keep me fully interested in their three-hour runs. ""Two Towers"" is also three hours long, but it has the energy and motivation that can keep me interested to watch the entire thing without thinking afterward what scenes were expendable.""The Two Towers"" has the most action of the three films, which is one of the biggest reasons why I can stay entertained without getting the slightest bit of boredom throughout its running time. And the final hour of the film has one of the most epic and well-made battle sequences ever brought to the big screen.All viewers need to see the Lord of the Rings trilogy in chronological order, but ""The Two Towers"" is the best of them all. Great performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, and all the others involved in this masterpiece. Good job, Peter Jackson.

A worthy epic successor,"I anticipated this film like none other, and was not disappointed. I believe the LoTR trilogy to be the greatest of all time and of course this movie was brilliant in all of the same ways that the first one was. In this review I will not list all of the good things about this film because there are too many, although the adapion of Gollum was breathtaking and wonderful. That said, I did have some complaints.1) In my opinion the battle scenes were not as cool as they could have been: too much hacking and slashing not enough impressive feats of strength and dexterity.2) Gimli was turned into a walking punchline. While it was very funny and provided moments of comic relief, I think he should really be more of a badass than a comedian.3) Distorting the book. I know this is bound to happen but Jackson did it less in the first movie.That said, it was an incredible experience seeing this movie. Not a perfect masterpiece (like the first one) but an absolutely worthy successor.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Could have been better. Should have been better...,"I believe anyone who read Tolkien's masterpiece will be disappointed with this second installment of the trilogy. If you haven't read the book though, then this movie may be pure entertainment.Why I don't like this movie? First of all it is not completely true to the story (you can very well argue it doesn't have to be), and unfortunately the additions made by Jackson and his screenwriters consist of childish, cliche scenes or dialogues. The new lines sound like they have been written by Kevin Costner rather than Tolkien.The action scenes are exaggerated and overacted (with Legolas surfing down the stairs on a shield while firing arrows etc etc). The characters are all the time overcome with emotion, which toward the end of the movie makes you sick (Why is Frodo on the verge of tears all the time? Why does everybody hug and cast meaningful glances at each other every other minute?).The background music gets to my nerves after the first hour. There should be a substitute to this Nordic chorus singing at extremely high pitch whenever something grave happens.And then, back again the changes in the story are unforgivable for someone who loves the book. The removal of some parts of the story is, of course, necessary. But fiddling with characters (Oh Faramir!) is not.What you have is a Hollywood blockbuster based on a great book. I guess it could have been worse, which is the only good thing I have to say about this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Over-long and dull.,"I have a sneaky suspicion that many, not all mind you but many, of the people going to see The Two Towers are watching it with blinders on.  Seeing only what they wish to see and not seeing what is being presented on the screen.For years we have been told that The Lord of the Rings is the defining work of fantasy fiction.  It is no doubt very thought out and well written but when you come right down to it the novels are very often quite dull and over-long and that is brought out magnificently in the second installment The Two Towers, which is itself quite dull and over-long.The Two Towers is a great looking movie and very well acted, the problem is it isn't very well paced.  Overall the movie doesn't even need to exist for all it accomplishes.  As has been pointed out it bridges the gap between the first and third films however it doesn't justify a 3 hour running time.Is The Two Towers an action picture?  I certainly hope not!  If it is the film makers need to take another look at the first two hours of the film which are only lightly peppered with action sequences and to make matters worse contain fewer pieces of important/interesting plot.  The final 45 minutes is loaded with action footage and does pick up the pace of the rest of the movie quite nicely.  The battle at Helm's Deep is a magnificent spectacle but alone cannot save the movie.  The battle of the Ents is also visually impressive but, as with the Helm's Deep battle, ends rather unsatisfyingly.  Instead of being climactic battle scenes both battles instead play as saviors to an otherwise dull movie.At 3 hours The Two Towers is over-long but even with an hour shaved off the running time I don't think this movie has what it takes to be truly ""great"". Although I do think special notice should be made of Gollum as he is very well done and the most interesting character in the movie and makes the otherwise enormously dull Frodo and Sam portions of the film worth watching.I throughly enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring but The Two Towers fails to entertain.  This, however, is not necessarily the film makers fault but due to the flaws in the source material.  When watched with blinders off The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers receives and deserves a 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The weakest of the trilogy but still a great experience,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the weakest part of the trilogy for me, but still a very good second part. Positive aspects are mainly the magical representation of Middle Earth and the groundbreaking visual effects. You can really tell how much love Peter Jackson put into these films. One reason why ""The Two Towers"" is the worst part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy for me is that the film has a much slower pacing than the first and third parts. There are many scenes of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas either walking or riding horses through Rohan, which just feels too drawn out. Also, the film puts much more focus on Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and doesn't show much of Frodo, Sam and Gollum, as much of their experiences were moved to the third film by Peter Jackson in favor of a very detailed depiction of the Battle of Helm's Deep. Still, the film is well done and provides a nice transition to the third film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The pacing is better than the 1st one,Well I can tell That I enjoyed this Film Film a lot better than the 1st one The pacing is a lot better the Cast is good once again And the action is a lot better the CGI is incredible This perfectly sets up the final film I will definitely recommend it. The action is bigger better and a lot louder It's more violent and more serious and I really enjoyed it I also think thatI also think thatThe sequel Is better than the 1st one And This film once again Is on par par with the book the book it's a good adaptation And I cannot wait to finish the series andAnd see how it ends And I think Anyone Who enjoys action movies will enjoy this one.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Strong as ever,"For better or worse Peter Jackson and team continued to release the second installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. For some, this brings great joy, for others, this brings dread at the thought of being dragged to another three hour escapade of traveling midgets trying to destroy some jewelry by their nerdy, obsessed friends.So there I am sitting down, eager to watch the next chapter in a movie trilogy based off of my favorite books. I enjoyed the first one so much that by the time this one came around I had no option but to, again, expect nothing but excellence. The bar was set, the standards were made, and they were already as high as they could be...and they did it again! Flawless execution in adaption, remarkable cinematography, convincing acting, exciting battles, great choreography and overall storytelling.This chapter in the series is the most action oriented. I mean sure, the last movie may have had the largest battle scene ever seen on screen today but ""The Two Towers"" was the one to actually go deep into the battle and really bring about a great war epic. This one incorporated a lot of eye candy for the typical everyday movie viewer. Yes, slashing, hacking, bow work, and massacres of bloody orcs aplenty! But don't let that fool you, it's also filled with an excellent story and expansion of character development.This time around the story focuses even more in on the world of men. It deals with men struggling to survive in a war that is quickly turning directly toward them. And while J.R.R. Tolkein's books dealt a lot with the half lings and their journey to destroy the One Ring, he also dealt a lot with man and their common struggles of power, love, and honor. He was after all a man himself...most of his writings in fact actually reflected his own life when it came to stories of men.I could go on and on about this movie; how the music captures the heart of Middle Earth, how the sets for Rohan (the mountainous land of men) looked so convincingly real and inhabitable, etc. But I'll stop it short and just let you know that this movie is no let down, just like ""Fellowship"" was no let down either. It continues to give justice to Tolkein's work and it's pulled off with style, integrity, and excellent workmanship. ""The Two Towers"" will inform the public of the wonderful work Tolkein did 50 years ago, and entertain even more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Greatest of the Trilogy,"I saw this film in 2003, before the release of Return of the King. Of course I had already seen The Fellowship and loved it. I found Two Towers to surpass it. Upon viewing Return of the King, I felt it was the best. Now I find myself saying Two Towers is the best because it is a much stronger film that 3. I hope I'm not including spoilers, but the battle of helm's deep was more exhilarating than minas-tirith, Gollum was better (not visually but spiritually) that in 3, and above all it had a sad and slightly depressed feel compared to the other films. Even though Return of the King is a great conclusion for the series, Two Towers is a better film with more emotional depth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Fellowship still rules!,"Today I attended a Press-Screening here in Zurich and saw what I have been waiting for almost a year.It started very good with the fight between Gandalf and the Fire-Beast (I must say I did NOT read the books, but I gave The Fellowship of the Ring 10/10 and liked the whole idea a lot, but I do not know all the characters by name....there are more important things in life). But after an hour I was getting bored a bit, after two hours I was asking myself where is ""a LOT more action than in the first one"" as seemingly everybody is talking about??? I still think it is a good film, but it was by far not what I expected after the excellent first part.CGI-Gollum is terrific and beats every cgi-character with dialogue we have seen before. End battle was good but not great (it always reminded me of the fortress attack in Starship Troopers but with orcs). The nasguls are just there but not frightening as they were in the first part. Gandalf has only a small part. Saruman as well. The tree-guys...well they were cool in the end-battle.Sorry to say that I am disappointed. I will see it again, maybe it helps (I want to like it). If you haven't seen the first one don't bother, you will probably not get it.Because of the production value and tech aspects I still give it a 7/10.PS: I think it will open very big, but it will not be as successful as the first. I guess 600 to 700 million worldwide (which still would be very good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Very good film, but barely Tolkien!","Having seen FOTR and loved it - the acting, the scenery, the sets, and the fact that the film captured the spirit of Tolkien, I was desperate to see TTT. I knew that it was going to be changed from the book more than FOTR had been, but didn't know that it was going to be changed to the extent that it was.1. The nauseating 'Arwen' inclusion is a disaster. It has nothing to do with Tolkien, however romantic and 'beautiful' they tried to make the scenes, and despite the fact that they had Hugo Weaving's seductive voice in one of them (in point of fact that was the only scene with 'Arwen' that bore a remote resemblance to Tolkien, i.e. the appendix). Putting this virtually new character into the film has meant that various changes were made which took away from much needed time that could have been used to explore the real Tolkien story. For instance, why have the Warg fight - just so that Aragorn could fall over a cliff and have 'Arwen' change into a horse over him? It was totally unnecessary to change Tolkien's storyline - the original story is brilliant enough in itself.And why does 'Arwen' appear everywhere in the promotional stuff - is she being used to promote the film? The main characters in the story are FAR more important, and they are who most people feel is important to the story, and want to see.2. Why did Eomer disappear for virtually the whole film? Why was Treebeard - supposedly the oldest and wisest being in Middle-earth - portrayed as stupid? Where was the noble Faramir? Why wasn't there more of Gandalf, who is the figure around which everything turns? Where were the wonderful Huorns, and all the action involving them, which we were so much looking forward to? Why was there so little about the Hobbits, who with Gandalf are the main characters in Tolkien's LOTR? None of this is the fault of the actors, because the casting for the film is excellent - it is great that they used mostly British, New Zealand and Australian actors who weren't known 'movie stars', which would have completely ruined the film. It is to do with the way the story was rewritten.Certainly there are brilliant things in the film - Gollum, Gandalf leading the charge on Shadowfax at the end of the film, the three running at the beginning of the film, the horses, Edoras, Helm's Deep, the marching Uruk Hai, New Zealand as Middle Earth, the costumes, among other things . . . but it would have been so much better if the story had been stuck to. The changes just seem so pointless, and I've heard far more criticism than praise for them.I really, really hope ROTK will go back to the books, but think this may be a forlorn hope - for one thing, I don't know how they could squash everything in from TTT that wasn't included in the film, and still do ROTK justice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Nothing near as good as the first one,"As the summary points out, I didn't find the two towers nearly as enjoyable as the first episode. Reasons for this are I believe quite obvious: The two towers is a mix of many things and tales and fails to grab the audience in the manner the first one did. In FOTR you felt enchanted as we were treated with beautiful images (and emotions in particular!) from the shire and from along the journey of the fellowship.In TTT there is really no single plot. The movie consists of the combined tales of different characters and groups and they fail to connect. Even Gandalf, who in the first was a loveable wise man has become more of an action oriented character. In FOTR for ex. you could see Gandlaf pondering matters of great importance, and then find out that his wise decicions were based on a better odor in this corridor than the others. This kind of subtle humor and intelligence is missing in the second film.Acting is excellent, as is everything else - technically. Soul and feeling is what is absent. And the ring. The ring is all but gone, it just hangs on Frodos neck.Having said all of the above, I still liked the film quite a bit. It's just not as good as the first one, which is obviously the only film you can really compare this to. I give this one 7/10, which is a good grade. (as a side note, I suggest users would learn to use the FULL range of votes, instead of always giving tens to movies they happened to like a bit).",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Overrated...,"I loved the Fellowship of the Ring and was greatly anticipating this film. This film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. Effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that I thought this movie had far less substance. The best part of the movie is Golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? Unfortunately he was the only character in this movie I found myself caring about. About all you get from Gimliy and Legalos are a BOMBARDMENT of simply awful jokes. Going alongside the wall at helms deep WAS humorous when you come by Gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, ""Shall I fetch you a box."" No thanks Mr. Elf I would prefer a mute button. Going back to Gimliy again, I found it very annoying that Treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. The battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie I had trouble believing in ""the reality of the movie"". Examples include... - Legolas was taking out the Orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, This I am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the Orc with the torch resembling a character from The Road Warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. This is also the same character that said when the Orcs were a rather far distance from Helmsdeep to aim for there Necks and Underarms. This brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - Legalos told them to shoot at the Necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. Well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. The scene that I am talking about where Legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull I don't want to see the movie again if I have to watch that. I was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. It truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. These people are defending there families and I can't take that seriously when I have elf man sliding away. - The central Characters are far to powerfull in this movie. When Aragorn and Gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -When the men who capture Frodo and Sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -And finally... there is no was I can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either Sam or Frodo when they were at the Gates of Mordor. There little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there.I suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not ""nitpick"" like me. I do think the movie is GOOD but it is far from great and IMHO not worthy of a Best Picture nomination.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
disappointed,"Lord of the rings...When I saw the first LOTR#1 I was really confused about the plot, couldn't match one with the other, but since it was one of those movies with elves,I personally adored the idea so much to leave out the next two movies and first of all read those books! So I did. And now that I finally saw LOTR#2 I am disappointed. I watched it with a friend that didn't read the books, but saw the first movie, and he kept asking why and what and who and where, I don't think that is the way a good movie should be! The only pleasure part was the battle (good atmosphere, screenplay) and not to forget good chosen music! I know that this movie is a really hard job to do, but still this is no excuse. And after all the special effects aren't that great(Golum), but they aren't bad either. I'd call it all together a good try. But the movie as a whole has no atmosphere and that is sad because it's the most important thing to feel what you see.

An Epic Sequel,"So next on my list of films to watch is The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers and here is my review for it. The Premise of the film sees Frodo and Sam get closer to Mordor with the help of Gollum, while the rest of The Fellowship must stand against Saruman and his huge army.Main Character
Viggo Mortenson really shines in this film, he is given more to do and really gets given the shine and he is a great lead protagonist. You see how his character has taken up more of a leadership role in this film and his part of the film is great and interesting. He nails the action scenes and it makes Aragorn really stand out and shine in this film, he develops well and he gives a really great performance here. Elijah Wood is still good as Frodo, he maybe is in the shadow of Mortenson a bit in this film but he still stands out. You see how the ring is really affecting Frodo, more then the first film and the introduction of Gollum really enhances his character and makes him more interesting then he was in Fellowship Of The Ring.Supporting Characters
Onto the show stealer of the film and that is Andy Serkis as Gollum, this character is fascinating and a really ground-breaking character. This performance really changed the game, it really is iconic and Gollum was such a great addition to the Frodo & Sam story making it a much more interesting plot point. Lets face it without Gollum, you wouldn't have the brilliant motion capture performances that you get now, so real credit to Peter Jackson & Andy Serkis for taking the risk and knocking it out of the park. Orlando Bloom & John Rhys Davies as Legolas and Gimli are given much more to do in this film and they are fantastic and add some nice comic relief here that never feels out of place. The friendship between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn is one of the best parts of the film and really sells the relationship, and feels like a natural progression from the first film. Sir Ian McKellen is back as Gandalf The White this time and he does a great job, he isn't in this film as much but when he is on screen he is awesome and nails this change of character. Sean Astin, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, Billy Boyd & Dominic Monaghan are great in there roles and prove that these Lord Of The Rings casts are probably the greatest of all time.Story
The story is bigger and larger in The Two Towers and it does work, there are three story arcs going on, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli's, Frodo, Sam & Gollum's & Merry, Pippin & Treebeard and they are interesting. The Aragorn plot gets the most screen time and it adds a new dynamic to Middle Earth and these films and make them feel larger then the previous film, even the Merry & Pippin stuff, though slower is good to watch and has a great conclusion to it which makes it worth it. The three stories work really well as they all feel a bit different and add something to the film in their own ways leading to The Battle Of Helms Deep which is possibly the greatest battle in film history.Script
The script is great, it has the right balance of drama and humour and it just does a great job of making these characters feel unique and interesting. This film does have a darker feeling and tone then the previous film and it shows but it knows where to find the times to lighten the mood without going against its overall feeling and it does a great job.Style
The style of the film is fantastic and raises the stakes. The action scenes are bigger and better, Bloom & Mortenson in particular standout with some great action scenes, leading as I said above to one of the greatest battles of all time that feels epic in nature but very real due to great stunts and great fight scenes. The film has great CGI and Motion Cap work, whether it be Gollum or Treebeard it looks great and Gollum in particular changes the game and allowed characters like Caesar, The Hulk & Thanos to exist in the future and this was his start. The film is 3 hours long but never drags, the stories are balanced really well and keep you interested throughout and expand on the films really well.Overall
Overall, just like its predecessor this is one of the greatest films ever made and is a must watch. One of the greatest second films in a franchise ever and raises the stakes in a great way and sets up the final film in the most grand way possible.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Dwarf... beware the Dwarf...,"Picking up where ""Fellowship of the Ring"" left off, Frodo and Sam continue to trudge towards Mordor - with the annoying CGI monstrosity Gollum leading the way and mixing it up with Faramir (Boromir's brother) while Aragorn, Legalos, Ghimli and the newly resurrected Gandalf try to save the people of Rohan from Saruman's monsters and reunite the alliances of men. Chaos and mayhem ensues.Sadly, I didn't like this film as much as I hoped I would. It's a good film overall, but marred by the occasional slow pacing and unnecessary camera mugging. In other words: the dwarf, Ghimli. John Rhys-Davies is a great actor and he was good in ""Fellowship"", but he was terrible here (almost as bad as Rupert Grint in ""Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets"" though not as bad as Jar Jar Binks). He doesn't even feel like he's playing the same character. Ghimli was a capable adventurer in ""Fellowship"" but in ""Two Towers"" he's suddenly become an idiotic clutz who can't ride a horse without falling off or get down a hill without tripping over his stubby feet. And then there was that ""Toss me! Don't tell the elf!"" bit. Oh god that was horrible; it's as if Aragorn was stalling just to make Ghimli say toss me. Peter Jackson wanted comic relief obviously but this was the best he could come up with? Pretty pathetic. I'd rather have a dull, ugly humorless fantasy epic than one who's only source of comic relief is an idiot dwarf. Oddly enough, John Rhys-Davies fairs better at being the voice of Treebeard of the Ents than he does at being Ghimli.Then there's Gollum, the most over-rated CGI abomination in the history of special effects. I can't even go in depth with this one...I did like Miranda Otto as Eowyn though, and of course I prefer Treebeard over Gollum, and I liked Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. The battle of Helm's Deep is spectacular, as is the Ents trashing Saruman's castle. Too bad the dwarf and Gollum had to ruin what should have been a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Not the LOTR, and not a good movie","OK - since the movie is definately NOT the Two Towers (outside of the same character names and the fact there is a ring involved), the movie really needs to be seen without the Tolkien fanatics with rose-colour glasses. The movie STUNK! The acting was sub-standard (Gandalf 'fighting' with Saruman through Theoden was hysterically bad!). The plot was only loosely put together - actions of characters seem to come from nowhere (Merry standing up to Fangorn, Samwise's preaching, Aragorn's 'issues'). The actions of the characters were just bad, the fighting scenes - although spectacular in vision, were just sadly portrayed (Aragorn and Gimli 'jumping' into the middle of dozens of orcs and not getting scratched, horses ridding into the middle of 10,000 orcs and not one of the orcs seems capable of killing the horses, horses riding into 'swiss pikes' and not getting a scratch?????)on the good side - the cinematography was PHENOMINAL; the CGI is some of the best in movies today (you could barely tell gollum was not real); the orcs siege warfare was historically accurate (the use of ladders with people on them; the breaching of the walls; the use of the rams and it's security - very well done).Overall - movie 1/10; visual and historical 10/10 (but final rating must still be 1/10 - just a poorly done story).",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
More of the same...,"In my review of The Fellowship of the Ring, I docked half a mark simply because I had to wait for the next instalment. I must, regrettably, do the same with The Two Towers. Like its predecessor, The Two Towers is long, but also like its predecessor, it doesn't matter. Usually long films fail to hold my interest, but if The Two Towers was any shorter it simply wouldn't cover what it needs to cover. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have broken away from the others and are selflessly carrying on alone in their quest to destroy Sauron's ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) search for the other two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, stumble across a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and make their way to Rohan, where the king has been taken over by Saruman (Christopher Lee). The whole thing culminates in an absolutely spectacular battle sequence at Helms Deep, where our three heroes and their mighty army battle against the orcs for close to half an hour. The Two Towers was shot simultaneously with the other two, and is therefore just as visually spectacular as the first part, and presumably, the third part. New Zealand is a beautiful country, and Middle Earth is a beautiful place. Even the dark clouds and volcanic activity of Mordor has a certain ambiance to it. But it is the CGI effects that dominate and shine in this film. In particular, computer graphics have been used to create Gollum (Andy Serkis), brought to life from the real actor's movements. As in the book, Gollum is a tortured soul, who's split personality and desire to possess the One Ring (his 'precious') creates a powerful, yet pitiable, character. Also, there is Treebeard, a walking, talking tree (voiced by Rhys-Davies again) whose lethargic nature comes across in his ambling gait and droning, slow tones. As The Lord of the Rings is really one big movie cut into three parts, it is difficult to rate each part as a separate movie. However, the action sequences in The Two Towers are bigger, better and more frequent than in The Fellowship of the Ring, and the character development continues nicely. It's probably better than the first one, but I won't be able to judge accurately until I see Part 3, due out at the end of 2003. Until then, I give it the same mark I gave the first one.

The second part of the already classic trilogy,"I must say I did like TTT better than FOTR. I think it's a darker picture. It's a shame it didnt pick up any oscars. I thought the movie dragged a little the first hour, but it's just in a class by itself. Only George Lucas' Star Wars compares to this series. Old school movie making. Peter Jackson is ok as a director but no one can knock his vision. He has a lot of it, and he did stray away from certain parts of the book, and created his own material, but hey, thats an adaptation for you. TTT continues from where FOTR left off, and the final hour of this movie will be talked about for a long time. Nothing compares to this not even the jedi battle in Attack of the clones. Peter Jackson gets knocked for his choppy direction, but he can get a lot out of his actors and that is what all great directors do. I think the other great thing about this film that also sets standards other than the final battle is the amazing ""Gollum/Speagle"" character. CGI has come a long way. One day,  an oscar will be presented to one. Gollum probably deserves one! Not only did he look so real, he stole a lot of scenes, and is amazing to see how movies have progressed. Of course this movie gets **** stars out of ****. Passionate movie making, nothing short of perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A True Fantasy Movie,"Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part.From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Wow!,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen! It works on several levels, and hauls you through a whole wave of emotions in 3 hours (it may seem like a long time, but it is gone in a flash!). You'll laugh out loud, cry, cower in your seat, and be glued to your seat!If you thought ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was good, this far far surpasses it. Gollum is incredible. wow! He is just how you imagined him, and you forget that he is computer generated! The battle scenes were totally blistering and you feel like you have been through them yourself once you've watched them.

The plot of the second part has a higher appreciation.,"There must be some kind of goodness in this world that is worth fighting for to the end. Actually, I like this second one most. The first part has just begun, many stories have not yet begun, and there is no decisive battle in the big scene; the third big science battle is too saturated and easy to fatigue. Therefore, the Battle of the Holy Helm Valley at the end of the second part of the battle has just arrived, and the "" Immortals of Various Paths"" have made their debut against the Salaman army and have been it most vividly.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"It suffers due to its transitional status, becoming unfocused and meandering; there are a few stand-out scenes, though, and it is still entertaining.","While 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002)' initially seems like an improvement upon its predecessor due to an almost instant start, to the point of totally leaving anyone not already on-board with the story behind, and constant 'in-the-moment' feel, the piece soon becomes a baggy and generally slow affair that does, in itself, seem like the so-called 'extended version' (how an actual 'extended version' exists, I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand). This middle instalment falls victim to its transitional status, which is essentially a kind way of saying that not all that much happens - at least not considering its bloated three hour run-time - while it ties the knot between the first and last part of its larger tale. It also suffers from a meandering narrative that opens up its world in a way that seems unfocused, taking away from the core - and, incidentally, most interesting - story of our protagonist and his journey to destroy that which would seek to destroy the world at every opportunity. There's still a lot to like, including a clarity of vision most prominent in the brilliant battle sequences - which are some of the largest in scale seen in cinema (only to be bested in size by its follow-up) and yet still retain a remarkably tangible quality - and smaller character moments - mainly surrounding its landmark 'motion capture' character. Indeed, this character is a groundbreaking achievement that did almost as much for the industry as the rest of the effects combined, being the premier creation of this kind essentially still to this day. He has some of the best moments in this feature, moments which are only slightly less interesting because of all the apparent 'filler' which surrounds them. It's made out to be essential perhaps because it sits in the source novel, but trimming sequences shouldn't be discouraged even in something based on a beloved book. This flick ends up perhaps the weakest of the trilogy. In the end, though, there are enough stand-out scenes and it's entertaining enough to make it more than worthwhile. 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Tepid Two Towers,"New hideous beasts join the Balrog and Orcs as audience members return to Middle Earth during Director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and five other members of the original Fellowship continue their arduous journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring.  Conditions are often intolerable.  Powers clash and collide.  The battles are fierce and unrelenting.  Friendships and alliances are tested.  Innocent people and brave warriors lose their lives.  Love is found and lost and unreturned. The world is simply a darker place.  But even this enormous amount of conflict and drama does not engender a superior sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The team of screenwriters (Frances Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and Peter Jackson) undeniably undertook a difficult task in reproducing J.R.R. Tolkien's epic in script form, but this fact does not excuse the film's slow pace and occasional incomprehensibility.  Both major and minor characters are introduced too quickly and little or no time is invested in many of these people, which prevents audience members from connecting and sympathizing with the characters.  Théoden (Bernard Hill) orders elderly men and young boys to fight an impossible war, but one cannot connect with the weeping women or terrified men as leaders outfit them in helmets and swords and send them off to a likely death.  The writers have not given audience members the time or reason to care.The overriding theme in The Lord of the Rings is that the good in the world is worth a tremendous fight and that evil cannot prevail despite its overwhelming force, but other themes evolve through various characters and subplots.  Few people can miss the dominating theme; Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) even states this Truth at the end of The Two Towers just in case it has eluded anyone in the story's first six cinematic hours.  Unfortunately, many other themes are lost not simply because of exclusion from the original text, but again, because the writers did not invest enough time in explaining the details and significance of certain events.  Allowing Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) to return momentarily to clarify certain points and clever monologues by Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis) avoid complete disregard for intelligibility, but more of these not-entirely-innovative but nonetheless helpful techniques would have benefited the film.Gollum embodies the possibility that any inherently good creature can be transformed into something evil.  The entire cast delivers laudable performances once again, but this computer generated character steals the spotlight in every one of his scenes.  He appears deformed and acts maliciously, but the writers gave him a tremendous amount of depth and so his deformities and deviance is forgiven.  Gollum is complicated, and he is endearing.  He has become a slave to the desire for power, but traces of his former Sméagol self penetrate his dominating ugliness--especially in an intense but entertaining forest monologue.Unfortunately, Gollum also represents the most disturbing reality of the second part of this film series: The Two Towers relies too heavily on its computer generated characters and special effects and not enough on the story and the abilities of its human actors.  Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) prances off boulders and dramatically flies onto a horse during battle, which elicits laughter during serious moments and detracts from Bloom's natural ability to play the part.  The Fellowship of the Ring is not entirely void of these non-human creations, but the focus is on the nine-member Fellowship.  The actors are responsible for the overall success or failure of each scene in the first film, but the exact opposite is true for the second film and pure spectacle does not afford cinematic greatness.Jackson's talented cast is not as present in The Two Towers, but they make a valiant effort to carry the film even through too numerous sweeping landscape scenes.  Still, few of the actors exhibit flawless or even nearly flawless performances.  Wood and John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli, occasionally overreact with melodramatic reactions and facial expressions, though it is admittedly the exception to Wood's otherwise skillful and intriguing performance.  Rhys-Davies is particularly guilty of this amateurish act, however, and these poor acting choices coupled with a script that portrays him as a fool cheapens the overall story and discredits the Fellowship.  The most troubling acting problem, however, is the lack of chemistry between the lead male characters excluding the hobbits.  Every single leader is captivating in his individual monologues and scenes, but their camaraderie seems forced and unauthentic.  The camera does most of the work, and the actors rely on background music and other visual effects to compensate for their collective inefficiency.  Thankfully, the believability of all other relationships balances this inadequacy, and newcomer Miranda Otto as Éowyn shines.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers lags behind its predecessor, but Jackson and his cast and crew have created another film well worth the price of a movie ticket.  The story begs for more explanation and the actors are undermined by technology, but the special effects and computer generated characters will keep audience members content through the three hour duration.  One Ring was forged to bind all creatures in the darkness of Mordor--despite the film's faults, don't be the only one to miss this continued journey that will determine if the dark prophecy will come true and send Middle Earth into catastrophic ruin.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"a visual achievement, a screen-writing debacle","What a disappointment compared to FOTR.Too much of the film focuses on King Theoden, in which he is misinterpreted through constantly driveling, mamsy-pamsy lines.Too much of the film focuses on Eowyn, in which she is misinterpreted as a wallflower.Faramir's character is completely misinterpreted.  In the movie, he resembles his brother, not the cool, contemplative scholar/soldier nor the shadow of Aragorn as he was well delineated as being in the book.Though Gimli provides some much enriching comic relief; by the end of the film, you get the feeling that he is used solely for comic relief.Sure, all the visual craft is there. (Yea!) And Gollum's script and dramatic posturing are even more impressive than the masterful CGI rendering of him. (Yea!) The Ents are wonderfully captured. (Yea!) (Though the rescripting of their activities was another disappointment.)I could rationalize the plot changes in LOTR, but as I watched this film, I was rationalizing a lot.  My rationalizations stopped when the misinterpretation of Faramir, (and to a lesser extend) Theoden, and Eowen overwhelmed me into bitterness.I was expecting this trilogy to be one for the ages.

CG Masterpiece,"This movie is typical of how Hollywood is transforming their 'big budget' movies to a CG masterpiece in which the audience becomes more focused on the 'creations' rather then real human actors and oddly the characters dialog sound quality is extremely tough to understand at points.  The lack of new character / plot development is awkward with old plot line being longwinded. It seems, I would have been better off reading the book first.  The 'epic battle' that everybody is probable talking about at the water coolers reminds me of computer games graphics about 3 years ago when everything was darker so the designers did not have to make everything perfect and sadly the main characters get lost in the overwhelming mass of the war.Overall, the complains do not take away from the movie and it is enjoyable from moment one.

Epic film making at its most spectacular.,"Director Peter Jackson has taken an `un-filmable' story and produced a true epic rich in the fantasy and myth that are inherent in the J.R.R. Tolkien books. There are naysayers out there that complain that the film doesn't follow the books  but it does  allowing for the vast scope and panorama of the original stories.The characters look and act exactly as I remember them from the books and the settings and scenes are far greater than what my poor imagination was ever able to conjure up.I was entirely prepared to not like this film; I was not completely sold on the first one. But Peter Jackson (director) and his wife Frances Walsh (screenwriter) have obviously poured their hearts and souls into this project  not to mention years of their lives and the effort shows.There are so many sub-plots and interconnected stories that it is near impossible to keep them all straight  but the tightly woven screenplay and the brilliant editing make it all work marvelously. There is not a miss-step or false note in the entire film.There were a couple of scenes that looked as if they could have been lifted right out of that other modern fairy tale: `The Wizard of Oz' but for the most part everything seemed original and fresh.Howard Shore's original score adds greatly to the overall feel of the film. It rises spectacularly at peak moments with a chorus of thousands' lending their talents and subsides quietly at moments of peace and tenderness.The Production Design and Art Direction (Grant Major and Peter Joe Bleakley, respectively) add to the grandeur and range that the film reaches for. The luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (not to mention the spectacular New Zealand settings) enhances the mystical and other-worldly' quality that the films strives for and achieves.This is a tightly woven piece of modern film making that should inspire filmmakers everywhere to strive for the best and hopefully, achieve it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A terrific film no doubt,"I might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is still a terrific film no doubt.Visually it still looks superb, I really do love the look of these films so far. The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.There are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.Elijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.Overall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring', despite a few 'issues' I have with it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I demand some explanations from Peter Jackson,"I hadn't read the story until last summer.  I read it all.  I hadn't given it a second look by the time Two Towers came out.  One thing about the storyline needs to be addressed ASAP:  THERE WERE NO ELVES AT HELM'S DEEP! Nowhere in the text are any more than one elf, Legolas, even mentioned. There is no mention of the Last Alliance of Men and Elves at the defeat of Sauron, like in the prologue of Fellowhip.  Eowyn was not at Helm's Deep, but that addition to the story is understandable, it makes female parts bigger. There is no mention of the Entwash and no mention of when Merry and Pippin drink from it, they end up being four or five inches taller than they were before drinking the water.  The Entmoot was smaller in the movie, but digital characters take a lot of time to render, so that is understandable as well. I think that New Line and the producers of this movie messed big time even before releasing the movie.  They showed Gandalf in the trailers.  That is one of the best parts of all the Middle Earth stories, when Gandalf comes back from death and you think it's Saruman.  By showing in the trailers that he is alive, it removes almost all of the suspense.  I think that this was an idea of the people of New Line more than it was on the part of Mr. Jackson.  I think he would have realized this but New Line had the final say.  I hope this was the case. I give this theatrical version an 8 out of ten because of all the missing stuff and craptacular addition of the elves at Helm's Deep.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Too much of an ""in-betweener"" to be fully enjoyed, except for the introduction of one key character...","I called ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" the first instant classic of the 21st century and one of the many accomplishments the film achieved was to be listed as the 2nd Best Fantasy Movie by the American Film Institute and to be the most recent film to make it in the AFI's Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. What I forgot to mention is that it wasn't the most recent to be listed in any AFI's film for this privilege goes to its successor ""The Two Towers"" listed in AFI's Top 100 Movie Quotes. Do I need to mention which line made it in the Top 100?The line says a lot about the key element of ""The Two Towers"", it introduced one to one of the most emblematic characters of the trilogy, the creepy yet weirdly cute in his childlike attitude: Gollum. In less than ten minutes, Gollum is as fully developed a character as all the members of the Fellowship of the Ring put together, from his voice and speech mannerisms to his elastic moves and constant crawling as if he was constantly looking for something one might have accidentally dropped, something of high value, that he'd call, with his raspy and ominous voice, ""my previous"". And if it wasn't for the introduction of Gollum, I'm afraid the second opus of the trilogy might have only been a continuation.And even being the continuation of a classic full of so many characters and based on the rich, dense and labyrinthine plot of Tolkien's book isn't enough to grab you by the eyes and hook you to the story, unless you're hardcore Tolkien's fan, and even then. A second opus isn't just the 'what-goes-next' but also the second offering of a director, and apart from the hypnotic presence of Gollum and his mysterious and fascinating split personality, I must admit that sometimes, throughout the film, I stopped paying attention to the screen. I know everything looked great, and everyone did justice to their roles. But it seemed like the novelty was gone, and the plot dragged on for too long. Ironically, the Tolkien purists complained that five chapters were abandoned and the story went too fast.I trust their perception but I think this says a lot more about the difficulty to adapt a story of such epic scale. At one point, there were new characters every ten minutes, and they all looked the same: dressed with medieval fashion, long hair, bearded, noble looking or close enough. So I tried to focus on the faces I knew, the ones I could name, and eventually, I could spell, I felt secure as long as I had Frodo in the screen, and Sam, Gollum who won me instantly, Araghorn, Legolas and Gimli (whose height relegated him to the rank of comic reliefs after the two side- kicks hobbits were gone). But by the second third of the film, even these characters couldn't carry the story. There came a moment where Frodo's wide-eyed expression started to annoy me, where I didn't much care for the talking tree subplot and when even the return of Gandalf left me perplex.""The Two Towers"" confronted me to the one reality that the first installment miraculously prevented; I'm not into Fantasy movies. Not to be pedant or cynical, but I'd say the problem of Fantasy is that it has too much fantasy indeed, it is so virtually full of possibilities that even death loses its realism, anyone can kill but anyone can be saved, I knew Gandalf would survive and was I glad to see him back on the screen, but when you have a character falling to a certain death in a mountain of lava and coming back triumphant, you know the notions of odds is relative. It's like the entire storytelling is governed by the primitive pattern that good guys will win, inevitably, because they're good by essence not because of some powers or skills. Inversely, the enemy contains so many hideous creatures that you know they're like naturally inept to win, on the long term.The film was great in every technical aspect, the production design, the special effects, the battle sequences, but the offering was nothing new once you've digested the first part. The film certainly works as a link between the introduction to this magical universe and what will be the climactic confrontation of the end, but that's what it is, an in-between movie highlighted by the introduction of Gollum, which is the equivalent of Master Yoda in ""The Empires Strikes Back"", but ""Two Towers"" is no ""Empire"" equal. ""Empire"" is a classic on its own, not a continuation. Besides, the ""Star Wats"" trilogy was built on a three-year span between the movies while ""The Lord of the Rings"" provided each opus one year after another, the first one was the immersion, the last one was the farewell. The second was probably the one that had the least time to be appreciated.And maybe Peter Jackson knew it and you can tell some unusual hastiness in the storytelling, the one pointed out by the Tolkien fans. Maybe this is why it focuses more on the human characters and on more conventional war/history movies tropes, while the Hobbits are left in the background. Somehow, anyone would get the feeling that the third one will be better, so perhaps the merit of ""Two Towers"" lies on the frail shoulders of Gollum, the first CGI character played by an actor, Andy Serkis. The combination of electronics and real acting, seven years before ""Avatar"" is the one milestone, the film achieved. Not that bad, after all.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A decent film, but nothing great.","I went to this movie with an open mind, expecting to see something great, yet throughout the whole movie I was bored and uninterested. I've read Tolkien's books two times and greatly love them, but ""The Two Towers"" does not capture the beauty and sadness that is within the books. One does not want to leave the world of Middle Earth when reading the books yet I greatly appreciated seeing the ending of the movie.Peter Jackson's directing was very annoying and redundant. He sets up his 180's with no sense of space, at times completely breaking the over the shoulder shots between two characters causing the breakup in the space to occur when it should not. There were too many close-ups when there should have been medium shots and too many extreme long shots when there should have been only long shots. Landscape scenes were often framed with no characters or tiny specks of characters, it should have been filmed as many of the classic westerns were filmed, capturing landscape and characters within the same frame where we could at least feel as if we're there with them and a part of their adventure.Jackson does not create feeling through images in ""The Two Towers,"" he relies more on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. The scenes with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum I would have enjoyed better had they been shown with more images and facial expressions from the actors. You can't rely on words to describe the terrible power of the ring, it has to be displayed with images. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" comes close to doing this.The screenplay should have had a major rewrite staying truer to the book with more natural dialogue. Many of the lines would be spoken and fall flat. There was no projection or passion in the lines, they were too stilted. Joking in the middle of a battle should have been crossed out by the director, and the entire love story should have been deleted. Doing this would have left room for the many scenes that were left out from the book. The ending of this movie lacks in drama and suspense, I deeply wanted to feel drawn into it and expect the next and last adventure, but the only thing I wanted was to get out of the room.What I greatly saw spelled over the entire movie was ""TIRED."" The actors were tired and the director was tired, and this was just another movie to crank out. With every scene saying ""OK, that's done. Let's move on,"" with no care or artistic appreciation of the true art of filmmaking. I don't expect much from ""The Return of the King"" next year and I don't expect much from Peter Jackson as he's too soft of a director to show the true grittiness of Middle Earth. He is targetting this movie more towards females and those who haven't read the books and not true Tolkien fans like myself.Overall it was a decent action film, with your typical fight choreography, one liners, Legolas and his unlimited arrows, and the good guys always coming out unscathed. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was excellent and this movie should have stayed more along the lines of that, with some improvements. On a scale of one to ten I give it a seven, because it wasn't all that bad and it wasn't all that good and at least they tried.7/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Not perfect, but as close as it gets!","After seeing this film for the 3rd time, I feel I can now write a clear evaluation of it. I would also like to add that I have read TLOTR about 10 times, starting age 6, so I have a good knowledge of the original story.I'm fully aware of the need to adapt a story to make it work on the screen, and I was always willing to accept these changes, despite my love of the original story. Like someone said, if I want the original story, I'll read the books again.However, I become somewhat annoyed when I feel the plot has been changed for no great reason, and and this happened several times in this film. Most notable was the adaptation of Faramir and his decision to take Frodo to Osgiliath. Faramir is meant to display his quality and strength by letting Frodo go, something Boromir could not do. Instead, he shows himself to be as weak as every other man, rather than proving himself.Another instance is the behavior of the Ents. A sudden desicion to wage war on Orthanc is really out of character of such a race, and that really jarred for me.Helms Deep was good, but I felt it was overextended at the cost of other elements of the film (i.e. the relationship between Frodo and Sam) I appreciate, however, that this was a change needed to satisfy the mindless punter, and suffer it as such.The film is still 100/100 for me, but a few little changes and it could have been so much better.

Jackson continues to channell Tolkien,"The Two Towers: It's official, Lucas is the padawan of film makers, Peter Jackson is the master.New Line Cinema will go down in the annals as having made a brilliant decision at a time in it's history where a gaffe could have sunken them, and we as filmgoers should be amply grateful that things fell into place the way that they have(these people that gave Jackson LotR also gave Raimi Spiderman - I think I see a trend). Now, granted, Jackson was handed one of the greatest stories ever told to bring to cinematic life, which Lucas was not, but Lucas could certainly follow some leads here on returning some humanity, lightness, and real dimensions into his upcoming swan song; after all, turnabout is fair play - Lucasfilm gave WETA their first leg up on a lot of the CGI technology prior to the Fellowship. But full marks to New Line for making some uncharacteristically shrewd moves at the studio level which are going to continue to pay large dividends over the remainder of the decade. THus far, Lord of the Rings has been all that Episodes I and II have promised to be without any of the sloppy shortcuts.A steady barrage of well plotted action, more polished performances by a cast little in need of polish in the first film, fanatic dedication to the material by all involved, and the discerning hand of Peter Jackson and his staff bringing it all together adds up to one of those rare sequels that at least matches the original, but in some ways surpasses it.Some have been mistakenly critical, but count me amongst those in the majority that found the way this movies hit the ground running to be a major positive. The backstory well established for all but the foolish holdouts, Jackson sees no need to build his story up, and launches right into chapter 2 of the saga with vigor. Opening with a teaser of the unseen footage of the Balrog battle from Fellowship, eyes are popped early on and make their way back into the sockets only during brief respites where the story is glued together. Really refreshing to see an epic like this done so painstakingly and with such dedication to craftsmanship without sacrificing an iota of story advancement.My biggest fear before his first scene(wasn't kept waiting long) was that Gollum wouldn't work - CGI simply hasn't been 100% successful imo with central characters to date, but you can chalk up another breakthrough for Jackson. His wise decision in hiring Andy Serkis to not only voice the character and map out his motions, but to also perform his scenes live during filming payed off handsomely. Nothing short of groundbreaking the way Gollum fits into the movie so seamlessly.And WETA did not lose a step either going into this second movie. The many otherworldly denizens of middle earth are brought convincingly to life on grand scales(of number and size), the locales of Barad Dur, Helmsdeep, Rohan, and Isengard are completely mesmerizing, and the battle choreographies and sequences of mass destruction are again new standard bearers for the industry.In short, a great movie on all fronts - if you don't like this movie, I hereby request you put me on ignore; we have nothing more to discuss, though I'd be interested to hear any cowardly swedes' opinions on the film before doing so.4/4 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

This very collection of stories is what makes this movie better than the first & keeps us on the edge of our seats throughout!The scenery is breathtaking (what a great ad for New Zealand!), the casting is perfect, and the special effects are awesome.  Comedy relief in this movie came from, not Merry & Pippin, but Gimli & Gollum (probably not intentionally funny!) who comes across as both cute, yet frightening with his double personality.  Treebeard and the rest of the Ents were unexpectedly cool to watch, the Orcs and Uruk-hai were disgusting and menacing and Aragorn was just plain gorgeous (like I said, great casting! ;-D)!There are bits that seem slow and dull, but then you can't have non-stop action for 3 hours straight!  Even so, the pace of this second installment of LOTR is a lot quicker and is action packed throughout.The whole movie contains so many 'best bits' that it's hard to just pick one!  But I have to say the battle of Helms Deep is probably THE best battle scene I had even seen on the big screen!If you haven't already seen 'The Two Towers' then I recommend you go see it NOW!!!  This is a film not to be missed![Just for fun: Look out for the Ent extinguishing his firey head as the water comes gushing in towards the end of the film!]",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An excellent sequel,"As the first, i have nothing bad to say about this movie, the characters, story and world are fully engaging and never boring.

Ok but nothing special,"Ok the effects were prety well done. But guys the plot... what plot? Comeon they were just going through the motions in this movie. Elijah Wood's acting took a turn for the worse. Sorry he can't do dark very well. Gimli is the new Jar Jar Binks. Those romance scenes with Liv Tyler were tedious and added nothing to the film at all. Some of the dialogue was dreadful. At one point Sam says somthing about ""people reading stories about them"".Argghh. Come on the first one was much better made and had a much stronger story then this.

A breath taking display of everything cinema stands for,"There are many ways to go wrong when making a film that starts in the middle of a story, losing your target audience, having people forget the original film and so on. However Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Barry M. Osborne and so on tackled these problems with tremendous dedication and overcame them without even making it look hard.The Two Towers is an exciting, exhilarating, fast-paced and emotional rollercoaster of ups and downs that can leave your heart in your stomach or your stomach on the living room floor. It's staggering characterisation that is carried on superbly from the first film, the moving and heart felt performances from each and every cast member- right down to the extras with less 2 seconds screen time, is unfalteringly profound, and only overshadowed by the sheer magnificence of the Helm's Deep Battle scene, which i really do believe to be, at least one of, the greatest battle scenes in cinematic history.Not only is this film heart-wrenchingly powerful, in the most blood-pumping-around-your-body-at-100-miles-an-our way but it's mixture of vigorous strength and endearing weakness, must truly make this one of the greatest films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) - Epic Fantasy at Its Finest,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" directed by Peter Jackson, is the second installment in the legendary film trilogy adapted from J. R. R. Tolkien's classic novels. Released in 2002, this epic fantasy adventure continues the saga of Middle-earth with breathtaking visuals, captivating storytelling, and unforgettable characters.The film picks up where its predecessor, ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" left off, as the divided fellowship continues its quest to destroy the One Ring and defeat the dark lord Sauron.

From the sweeping vistas of Middle-earth to the intimate moments of friendship and camaraderie, every scene is crafted with meticulous attention to detail. The visual effects are groundbreaking, bringing Tolkien's fantastical world to life with unparalleled realism and grandeur.The performances in ""The Two Towers"" are exceptional across the board. Elijah Wood delivers a compelling portrayal of Frodo, grappling with the burden of carrying the Ring and the temptation of its power. Sean Astin shines as Samwise Gamgee, Frodo's loyal companion, whose unwavering loyalty and courage provide a beacon of hope in the darkest of times. Viggo Mortensen brings depth and gravitas to the role of Aragorn, embodying the reluctant hero with stoic determination.The film's action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking, from the epic battles of Helm's Deep to the heart-pounding skirmishes in the forests of Fangorn. Each set piece is expertly choreographed and executed, immersing viewers in the pulse-pounding excitement of Middle-earth's conflicts.Beyond its spectacle and action, ""The Two Towers"" also delves into themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the nature of power. It explores the bonds that unite the characters in their quest, as well as the challenges they face in overcoming adversity and temptation.In conclusion, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a triumph of epic filmmaking, combining stunning visuals, compelling storytelling, and unforgettable characters to create a cinematic experience unlike any other. It is a testament to the enduring power of Tolkien's imagination and Peter Jackson's visionary direction.

Best Movie Ever?,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I'm not one of those people who has read the Lord of the Rings 85 times.

"It's a movie, not a transcription","This is for all the Tolkien-heads and goof-seekers.  This is a MOVIE--and an outstanding one at that--not a direct transcription from the books to the screen.  Peter Jackson never meant it to be.  Tolkien would not have wanted it to be.  No book ever goes from page to screen with exact authority, not even the Harry Potter ones.  Movies made from books are often worse than the text they sprang from.  Two Towers maintains the spirit of the book, telling the story in a way that is logical and more entertaining that if told literally.  Enjoy it for what it is:  smashing good adventure with dazzling effects that boggle the mind.And those folks who spend the time looking for ""goofs"" and inconsistencies: three words  --  get a life!  You are missing all the joy and the thrill of the film by looking for ways to bad-mouth the movie.  Have you never seen ""Plan Nine from Outer Space""?  It's the unintended inconsistencies that make that film so enjoyable.  But a movie with the scope of Two Towers?  Save the nit-picking for your dog's fleas.It is an outstanding movie, and I can't wait for Return of the King.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Jackson does it again!,"I can not begin to tell you how amazing this film is! After watching all 3 hours of it I am in absolute awe, and it now moves into my alltime favorite movie after a single viewing!Everything is so amazing and polished. The graphics and are the best I have ever seen. The CG character Gollum is the most realistic CG character ever, so real it's frightening to think about how real it is. With this film, CG has finally reached the point we all knew it would someday, where it could create an artificial character and you wouldn't know it was CG. The battle scenes put Braveheart to shame. You'll be in disbelief as you watch The Battle of Helms Deep in all its beauty before your eyes! Brilliant stuff!

Now This Is Where I Get Kind of Negative,"I treated my first viewing of the first Lord of the Rings film, The Fellowship of the Ring, as an obligation as a movie buff. If a movie hits it big, I feel obligated to see it, because people don't trust your opinion once they find that you've seen so many movies, so you claim, but you haven't seen Lord of the Rings. Before the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, ""Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign."" I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying ""didn't"" or ""can't."" This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.I gave this movie every chance when my natural proclivities were against it. I was assuredly paying attention, which didn't help me: Once Faramir's party reaches Anduin, one of Gondor's people says Mordor's seized the eastern side. So how do they get to the western side? If they use the sewer that Faramir later sends Frodo and Sam into, why did he explain to them what those sewers were? They'd have seen them already, just like me, who doesn't have to see this movie anymore. And for that I'm thankful. I didn't dislike this film, but I would add The Fellowship of the Ring to my collection and refuse to allow this sequel. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Two Towers is VERY Over-Rated,"Good reviews aside, I sat through an incredibly choppy and badly-paced, eternally long and boring film with no characterization to speak of, one that essentially leaves us at the same place we were at the end of Fellowship of the Ring.  No good character interaction, a CGI-Gollum that is blurry when he moves quickly--in fact, all the CGI is pretty hokey--and a final battle at Helm's Deep which, I just don't get it, it's really not all that special.  Maybe the Extended Director's Edition will rescue this one the way it did Fellowhip.  I hope so, but this film is more like a bad summer movie than it is a sweeping fantasy.  The pacing is terrible, characters disappear, the dialogue is a hollow retread of the first first. Aside from one schizophrenic dialogue between Gollum and himself, we could have skipped this whole film.  Certainly, the meager story on display here could have been told in two hours.  A bore.  A jerky mess.  A shame.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

BETTER THAN FELLOWSHIP,"The Fellowship of the Ring was a sermon preached to the converted; The Two Towers directs its evangel at the undecided, and will no doubt win more to the flock of the faithful.  Although the second act of a trilogy (it will make more sense to those who have seen part one, and it begs to be concluded with the finale next year)it stands on its own with great action set-piece. Peter Jackson seems to do better when he has more balls up in the air, staging eye-popping battles, reaching deep into the emotional lives of his characters, and telling a rousing tale with the best visual effects you'bve ever seen, especially the wholly digitized Gollum, whose internal struggle against corruption is captured as believably as his body movement.

The Lord of the Rings:  The Boring Snorefest,"While Fellowship was an excellent mix of drama and fantasy, as well as fantastic action sequences, this LOTR film falls flat on its face.  Most of the film is spent on boring talk of how the group is dealing with the situation with Sauromon(or whatever the guy Christopher Lee played's name is), and the film apparently doesn't remember that it's bad@$$ characters can also swing one nasty sword and lay a beatdown on those stupid Orcs until near the end of the picture.  According to my aunt, the book had tons of action sequences.  Either:  A., she got the title of the book mixed up with another one, or B., Two Towers the movie was changed A LOT from the book. Either way, after this atrocity, I am swearing off the LOTR films, and will in no way see Return of the King, even if the reviews dub it the best picture of the century.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I hope Jackson hasn't painted himself into a corner,"I did not like this as much as I did ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It looked like it was drastically edited at the last minute to meet time constraints, and some of the CGI/animation work was jarring. I'm still willing to give it a try on the ""special edition"" DVD (where I assume that scenes will be added back.)However, I get really nervous when I think about how *much* material still has to be covered. I'm also very concerned that some scenes in the first film that I think will be necessary to have the *last* scenes in ""Return of the King"" make sense were deleted in the theatrical release. And if we have yet another dwarf-tossing joke in ROTK, I'm probably going to throw something at the screen.All that said, this is an amazing project, and even if flawed it is worth seeing. It's not #10 on anyone's all-time best list (not when there are films like ""Children of Paradise"" and ""Andrei Rublev"" out there)... but the complete trilogy may hit close to that mark.

"Magnificent, top 10 movie of all time","After I saw the movie in cinema, I gave it a score of 9. Yesterday I got the extended edition, 4 DVD box set, as a gift, and enjoyed the 214 minutes of film. I agree with many others that this was the version I want to have seen in cinema. I don't mind sitting 214 minutes in my chair.It is a shame that so many parts were cut out in the original release, like Merry and Pippin being swallowed by Old Man Willow, the moving of the forest to help Rohan, the eating of the Orcs by this forest, the funeral of Theodred, the part where Eowyn founds out the real age of Aragorn, and much much more. This version of the movie makes more sense, more things are explained, the story is more comprehensible and logical. And above all that, the scenes that were cut out are often magnificent, in themselves better than many complete movies I've seen.The characters, the special effects, the sets, the paintings, the armory, the humor, the biting similarities with the real sad history of the world, the overwhelming music and the beautiful views of New Zealand nature: this movie contains a lot of wonderful movies, more action than most action movies, more emotions than most dramas, more story developments than most fiction movies.I re-voted and now gave a 10 for Two Towers. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am certainly going to see this many times.I really look forward to Return of the King. I've read somewhere that it will be over 3 hours in cinema and over 6 hours on the extended edition.

Flaws or no flaws - I am enchanted.,"For all that there are flaws - I love this movie.Looking for perfection? You won't find it in the Two Towers. There are flaws.

But where the first movie had me actually wincing at the computer effect when Galadriel delivered her beautiful monologue, there was nothing in -this- film that made me want to sink through the floor.Some people will love it, and others will hate it, but for me, it was a three hour performance that left me nearly tilted off my chair in the cinema after it was done - I don't care if others will hate it, and I don't care if some of the hardcore fans want to be stubborn and whine about what bits and pieces do not 'fit' with the book. I couldn't care less if it matches the book or not - I'm a huge Tolkien fan, but the movie is a miracle in on itself, whether or not it follows the original storyline word by word.That said, I will not comment more on the content of the movie, except to say this:The tear on Gríma's cheek.

I was blown away,"My overall impression of The Fellowship of the Ring was that I thought it was a technical masterpiece for bringing Middle Earth to life but I was a little less than enthused with the story. I can't say I ever really got totally absorbed by the story or character is in Fellowship of the Ring. So while I looked forward to seeing more incredible cinematography in The Two Towers I never expected to be blown away in quite the way that I was.The very first scene totally grabbed me in a way that few movies have ever done before. I was expecting a fairly standard recap with a narrator explaining what happened in the last movie and where we are now. Instead, the movie opens with some stunning vistas of the Misty Mountains. We hear the sounds of shouting and fighting echoing through the mountains and then we suddenly zoom right into the heart of the mountains where we see a thrilling fight between Gandalf and the Balrog.  When this happens, its like the viewer is suddenly thrown right into the story. It's a feeling that doesn't leave until the closing credits. Because of the way it immediately immerses you in the story I think this scene was the best in the movie and considering what followed that's saying a lot.What followed is the truly awesome Battle at Helm's Keep, the climax of the film. It is a truly grand spectacle that I can't really put in words except to say that you just have to see it. On a big screen. The view of the approaching army is firmly planted in my mind.Some characters who were fairly peripheral in FOTR get much bigger roles this time, particularly Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. In some ways, Aragorn is the main character of Two Towers and Viggo Mortenson turns in a terrific performance. That said, the very best character of the Two Towers is Gollum. I've never been a big fan of 100% CGI-based characters but Gollum is truly exceptional. He seems so hopeless, pitiful, horrifying and dangerous all at once. There's just no telling what he's going to do.I was absolutely blown away by The Two Towers. It's easily the best movie I've seen this year. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've seen in any year. I eagerly look forward to The Return of the King.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not the movie it should have been,"Sigh.  Since I was a kid, I've been waiting for someone to do a really great adaptation of the Lord of the Rings.  When Fellowship of the Rings came out last year, I thought ""this is it!  Finally!""  After seeing The Fellowship, I thought I was right...the movie I'd waited for was finally here.  So, when I went to see The Two Towers, I was totally shocked and dissapointed to see such a poor adaptation...indeed, save the names of the characters and the places, it has virtually nothing in common with the story JRR Tolkein wrote.Now, I know that certain liberties have to be taken with a book in order to make it a film...that's part of the territory and I accept it.  But the rampant, wholesale changes made to key characters and plot elements in this film seem the work of someone that never even read the books, and has no respect for the story.  Major characters were completely and utterly changed...not just little changes, but changes that were core to their development.  Faramir, the noble brother of Boromir, is painted as little better than his brother.  In fact, the whole capture of Frodo and Sam and the forcing of them to go to Minis Tirith is in direct contrast with his actions in the book.  His nobility is gone, and for no discernable reason. The same can be said of King Theoden, who turns out to be an indecisive, weak and fearfull old man.  Not so in the books, and again, there seems to be no real reason for the change.  Worse still, the ents were changed, only attacking Isengard after being tricked by Merry and Pippin.These changes to major characters, in my opinion, hurts the story for no apparent gain.  Tolkein fans will be dissapointed to see these changes, and will wonder ""why"" just like I did.  The movie is visually stunning, and is entertaining.  But it's typical Hollywood, glamor and glitz effects entertainment, with a weak story and less than inspried acting on most parts.Now, that being said, if there is ever going to be an Oscar given to a digital character, Gollum is that character.  The Gollum in the movie is stunning...his debates with himself are the high point of the film, and truly inspired.  This fact makes it all the more depressing that the director, who was able to create Gollum in such a convincing way, botched the rest of the film so badly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"`The Fellowship of the Ring' was simply remarkable.  And `The Two Towers' was just as great.  These two movies should be what all directors strive for, magnificent.  THE TWO TOWERS does as good of a job as the first one to get the viewer really involved in the story.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole 3 ½ hours approximately it was on.  I haven't read either of the Lord of the Rings books so I can't say if it is better or worse than the novel.  A lot of critics say that the movie left a lot of the book out of it.  That's probably a good thing in a way.  If the viewer read all the books, they're going to know what should happen next in the scene.  I'm sure Peter Jackson knew what he was doing when he left some of the scenes of the book out of the movie.  Why are the critics complaining, the movie is there to entertain you.  It doesn't have to follow the book word for word.  All the TWO TOWERS needs to do is keep your emotions and suspense going for the third installment of the movie.  It's very hard for the audience to like a sequel better than the first one, but Peter Jackson comes extremely close. It's amazing how much special effects and detail is put into these movies. The acting is excellent; I thought Elijah Wood and Sean Astin put in a better performance than in the first one.  They seemed more into their characters in the TWO TOWERS.  I can't wait tell next Christmas for the prequel to come out.  I'm sure there will be even greater and more exciting battles to come.  These movies should be ranked beside the Godfather trilogy in being the greatest films ever made.  I gave this film a 9/10 for greatness.  It better win some Academy awards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
lived up to all expectations,"I just got home from this movie, and i can sum up the movie in one word.....WOW! this is a great movie, the battle at Helms Deep was AWESOME!, i was a bit disappointed in the Nazgul(ring wrath) the dragons they were flying on looked good except for the head, kinda lame....but all in all a great movie, can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Awesome,"Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Masterful Encore,"Who says that a film can't do just as good or better as a sequel? So goes the tale, that a standalone film is best. Yet? Few films, trilogies prove otherwise and that's exactly what Peter Jackson proves! Creating another Masterpiece, with the sequel to the first installment of The Lord of The Rings. LOTR The Two Towers is a Masterpiece from acting/scenes/sound and especially war! The war scenes are a SHOWCASE of SPECTACLE/TRIUMPH. Some of the best war scenes ever in Hollywood. PERIOD! And in this sequel. We're presented with Gollum. A standout character, that holds a significance/importance in the film.Andy Serkis as Gollum is the standout performance in this sequel and another great performance from Ian Mckellen as Gandalf and not to forget the great lineup of actors from Viggo Morteson as Aragorn to Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Everyone plays their role to perfection!The Lord of The Rings The Two Towers is a TRUMPH, MASTERPIECE! Hollywood directors should take notes from Peter Jackson's art/adaptation of J. R. Tolkiens books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Pleasant to watch at all times,"The Two Towers unarguably makes a powerful impression, and with this second movie the simple accretion of mass, together with director Peter Jackson's maintenance of its unflagging energy and his fanatical attention to detail, mean that the epic is taking some sort of shape. These persuasive elements strengthen what was always powerful about the first film.Frodo, now alone except for his buddy Sam (Sean Astin), is on his epic journey to Mount Mordor to destroy The One Ring. He'll encounter Gollum, a wretched creature who's definitely up to something.And meanwhile Aragorn and friends are trying to protect the little country of Rohan from imminent destruction from the newly-bred Uruk-Hai, vicious monsters crossed with man and elf.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
They accomplished the near impossible with J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved story,"The stunning three-hour epic was just the first part of a three-part story. New Line released an extended cut of the film last year, and we went on to declare it the ""Best DVD Ever Made"". And it was. The four-disc set has really yet to be surpassed in terms of the amount of depth in its analysis of the films' production. Exactly a year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers stormed into theaters. It raked in the cash like its predecessor and earned much of the same critical acclaim. However, fans of the books were split on some of the controversial changes made to many of the larger elements of the story. What the filmmakers did was take the two parts of the book and intertwine the stories into the normal film narrative that one expects. In the process, some big changes were made and entire sequences were dropped; some to make the events in the film match up with the timeline that Tolkien put in the book. For example, in the book the action in Shelob's Lair doesn't take place until well into the Battle of Pelennor Fields, which is about in the middle of The Return of the King. Thus, that scene is not in the second film, but will instead show up in the third. Since all three films were made at the same time, Towers feels like the natural progression of the story from Fellowship. It's a darker story, but this second chapter of the epic puts the final pieces of the puzzle together to set things up for the final film where everything comes to one major finale. Thanks to Andy Serkis' acting and the work of WETA Digital, Gollum is the single greatest achievement in visual effects since ILM brought Dinosaurs back to life in Jurassic Park. There's really no other way to say it. Gollum is a computer generated character that can act and hold up to live actors in the same scene. Gollum truly breaks new ground. It crosses that threshold that effects cynics have been talking about since the subject of digital actions came up. With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J. R. R. Tolkien.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"competent, but not compelling","This series seems competently made, but it lacks the drive that Tolkien displayed. Even if I look past the fact that a lot of the visuals seem to be based on the works of doodler Allan Lee, I cannot get past the vision of good and bad, which seems to be the same as in any other Hollywood movie, and so far removed from the conservative, cold-romantic view of the original author.There's history. There's written history. Then there were a bunch of irreverent hobbits, who figured they could write the history from a hobbit's eye perspective. That (red) book got translated by an English professor.I remember the doubts from Tolkien fans when they heard Peter Jackson was going to film LotR. At first, I shared those doubts, but then I realised that he was only following tradition. Of course, he would be making a romanticized, Hollywoodized version of the story. He would be making a fiction based on a true story, and he would be doing that true story injustice in the process. Taking that as a given, would the end result still be an enjoyable movie, all by itself? And I think that largely it is; but I don't see it as more than a competent re-telling of the subject matter. I liked Tolkien's more factual translation better. The LotR trilogy is hastily told, at times it feels like I am looking at abstracts of the book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Most Overrated Film in History,"It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in ""dusk till dawn"" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Better than the first one.,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is once again directed by Peter Jackson, taken from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, screenplay by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair and Peter Jackson. All of them are the same from the first one, except for Stephen Sinclair. Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin.The story continues with Frodo and Sam trying to destroy the ring, during the journey they met Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, drawing closer to his kingly destiny, rallies forces of good for the battles that must come.If you read my first review of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so you already know that I loved how they set the characters and how they made the special effects, etc... And you also know that I didn't like the performance, and the direction sometimes wasn't good for me. So I watched this one and I was hoping to see these flaws got fixed. So, did they fix it? Not that much to be noticed, but as a middle chapter of a trilogy setting all paces for the final one, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is completely amazing, also for the fans of the book and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has lots of amazing special effects just like the first one, I was still amazed of how talented and unique the creators of this movie were, I mean some movies were released in the same year but the special effects weren't that good, not even close.The performances on the other hand are the same, the only one that was brilliant is Andy Serkis as Gollum, all the others are the very same, and I didn't like them before, so it's the same problem, but Andy Serkis improved it.I liked the direction a little tiny pit more than the first one.So technically, as it's obvious, I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers more than The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, especially the story, which was fast-paced and better than the first one. So as it's improved, it's definitely getting a higher grade, so I'm gonna give The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers an A!I really had lots of fun, while talking with you about The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and I'm so excited to talk to you about The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and it's gonna be very soon.Alright, guys thank you for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, please, support my work to encourage me to carry one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Horn O' Plenty,"This movie is beefy. I loved it but I will have to see it again before I can provide an accurate rating. I can say this though: Gollum was amazing! I had some reservations about him due to my dislike for all digital actors (first and foremost being Jar Jar Binks) but the second he showed up on screen I was won over. But even though Gollum was seamless I was less impressed by the effects in general. The blue screening Of Merry and Pippin in the Fangorn Forest was very shoddy, as was the Nazgul over the Dead Marshes. Effects wise, it was more ambitious than The Fellowship of the Ring, so it was inevitable that the cracks were going to show through.  There has been a lot of talk about Peter Jackson taking liberties with the story, and as far as I am concerned,  it makes for a better film going experience. Where he has given the hobbits short shrift, and emphasized the darker aspects of the story, he has made several improvements over Tolkein, including: A) The corruptive power of the Ring; B) The duality of Gollum; and C) the character of Aragorn. In the books, Aragorn is initially one of the more appealing characters but as the story progresses he becomes increasingly long winded and regal to a fault. In the films, he is infinitely more interesting as he makes the transition from rogue to king. I am intrigued by him every step of the way.  It is a thing of beauty that one of my favorite books is becoming the greatest pop fantasy to ever hit the screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great!!,"The second of three masterpieces!! It's a wonderful movie and you can't get enough of it, I've seen it 13 times. The extended edition is even better (of course).You got to see this (and the first) before you see the return of the king. // Madde",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Still trying to destroy the ring,"Here we have plenty of special effects, various battles against the evil's troops, most of them non humans and really nasty creatures, so more action and less thinking in the film. Obviously, this is part of a whole story, but if you compare this film with the first part you will agree with the fact that the first one had more content for thinking and/or meditation. One thing was clear to me and this was the message of peace given by the film and against those emperors always creating troubles, sometimes false ones, for provoking the wars. This happened during the Middle age, so let's hope that these events do not repeat at present in our planet Earth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Fabulous!,"And I hate using that word.  But this movie, as the Fellowship of the Ring was, is top notch.  I was really impressed with some of the way they did up some of the characters.  Grimer Wormtongue and Smeagal were almost exactly what I had invisioned when I read the books long ago.  The battle had me on the edge of my seat (literally) through out the entire thing.  Elijah Wood has done a great job of transforming from the innocent Frodo to the Frodo becoming more and more seduced by the power of the Ring.  These movies have been wonderfully casted.  The only complaint I have so far about the casting choices, is from the Fellowship.  Sean Bean acted the part of Boromir with excellence, but in my opinion he just didn't have the look.  He just wasn't barbarian-ish enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The best,"Now, after I've seen all 3 ""The Lord Of The Rings"" movies I have to say that TTT is my personal favourite. I think it's the best cuz it has the most action (I adore the battle of Helm's Deep!), a wonderful story and the greatest characters (my favs are Théodén and Gandalf). Thinking back at the Oscars 2003 I'm a bit dissappointed but they get another chance this year. I'm also very sad that TROTK is the last one cuz I've been looking forward the whole year to TLOTR and now it's over. So I'll buy the Extended DVD!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
7 out of 10...and mainly for technical achievements.,"Perhaps a second viewing will change my mind.  But as of now, I was generally disappointed in ""The Two Towers"".Not much in the way of character development, too much cross-cutting between scenes which oftentimes left me reeling. The FX were generally brilliant, though Merry and Pippin riding on Treebeard offered some pretty obvious green-screen backgrounds.I suppose I was left cold the most by the end of the battle at Helms Deep. It just sort of ended...with no real explanation on how it ended...or why, etc.The ""snowboarding"" of Legolas down the stairs was a real laugher, and not in a good sense.I'm mainly p***ed that Andy Serkis as Gollum didn't get any sort of acknowledgement from the Oscar folk. He was absolutley brilliant. Was he left out because he was covered in CGI? Obviously. But is covering him in pixels any different than covering an actor in prosthetics/makeup? John Hurt was nominated for ""The Elephant Man"" in 1980...and no, he didn't win. But he was just as unrecognisable as Andy Serkis is in ""TTT"".As an aside, a brother-in-law and I saw it in it's second week of release. Both of us were left somewhat cold. He gave it an 8 out of 10, and I gave it a 7 out of 10. I gave it a 7 mainly for the sheer scope of the project, the cinematography, the costumes, the FX; all technical achievements. The only acting nod I can really give is again to Andy Serkis.He saw it again just yesterday, and said it was way way (8 times he said ""way"") better the second time. And he has read the books until the pages fell out and bought them again. Perhaps I will feel the same when I use my free pass to see the movie again.And there will be an extended version of all the ""Rings"" movies on DVD. I'm hopeful that ""TTT"" extended version will make it a more enjoyable filmThe extended version of ""Fellowship"" was far and above a better film than the theatrical release.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Over-rated,"I was brimful of excitement and expectation prior to the release of The Two Towers. After thoroughly enjoying Fellowship I was told this installment would be even better as there is more action in this book than the first (I have never read the books). However I left the cinema after this film immensely disappointed.I have read review after review of Two Towers with people saying this is the best film ever. Come on, I mean seriously! Two Towers is incredibly slow and if it wasn't for the climactic Helms Deep battle would be the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first 2 hours of Titanic. Even during this epic battle it is interrupted by the character which personifies the slowness of the rest of the film, Treebeard. The romance, or attempted romance, between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler is so erksome and pointless I wonder if it is included because Liv complained about lack of screen time. There certainly wasn't any need for her character in this film because their romance is distinctly uncaptivating.Golum is created brilliantly and deserved the Oscar for effects but I was glad to see fhis film ignored in the other categories. I won't look forward to Return Of the King as much as this now. Disappointing",5.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Underrated,"Now this is only my opinion but I think that The two towers was much better than the Fellowship,But the fellowship is 4th and the two towers is 14th? Now I doubt that the Fellowship was better, because the two towers had so much more depth. You have Samwise and Frodo on a quest to destroy the one ring,Pippen and Mary trying to escape,Gimli,Legolas & Aragorn trying to protect Middle Earth.And in the fellowship they were basically do all the same thing together.If anyone else agrees post a mesage on the board please.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
human element of film good; didn't like as much as first,"I went to this movie in anticipation of an intense three hours.  But I made a major miscalculation.  I thought reading the book would make me enjoy the film more.  It did not.  I found myself annoyed by what Jackson did to parts of the plot.  When I saw the first movie, I was emotionally sucked in because I had a space of a year between the reading of the book and the viewing of the film.  This time, I viewed things with an incredibly critical eye.  I didn't like what he did to Aragorn in part of the film, seeing it as unnecessary.  I thought that Arwen was portrayed in an inconsistent, unjust manner.  I remembered what was in the book about the battle scenes at Helm's Deep.  I was immediately annoyed by Jackson's frills and the overly sentimental attachment to the roles certain characters played in the battle. I also did not quite like the way he cuts back and forth between the first half of the book and the second half.  I like that he does, because it is necessary, but some skill is lacking in the methods used and the pacing, causing some parts of the film to drag and take on a dull quality.  I don't like how the end of the battle at Helm's Deep is signified in the film, thinking there was better perspective and handling of it in the book.I did like the human element.  I loved how Gollum, Merry, and Pippin were turned into stars.  Merry and Pippin were given especially delightful roles. I loved their interaction the the ents.  I loved Gollum's speeches.  I love how the environmental themes Tolkein would have loved brought out were treated.  I loved the simplicity with which Wormtongue's, Theoden's, and Eowyn's starting situation and relationships to each other were treated. I liked the use of monologues by certain characters.  I disliked but found necessary the behind the scenes psychology of the battle of Helm's Deep. Somehow, sentimentality got hold of it too much.  But I greatly admired Jackson's very human treatment of all the characters in that situation, and the way he effectively shows the attitudes of those in peril.  I admired his attempt to socially and psychologically comment on what was going on.  It made a lot of sense even if I didn't find all of it artistically pleasing enough.I thought some of the great strengths of the film were in the acting, monologues, and highlighting of Merry and Pippin and Gollum.  I loved how Frodo is shown in relationship to Gollum and the shots used to clearly, eeerily, and humanly compare the two.   The clear storytelling focus really worked for me.And as annoyed as some people are by the ending, I found it well done and a great way to wrap up the movie, make up for flaws, and really make you want to see number three.A major flaw of this movie is the forced and ineffective music, obviously intended to get you.  But it didn't get me this time.  It was as bad as the watered down root beer I was drinking.  Another annoyance is Gollum's voice. I didn't think it was quite right.I have a reservation about the title.  ""The Two Towers"" as a title does not hold up well thematically for the film because of the information the viewer is not given.  It is better justified in the book, though still just barely. This has nothing to do with politics, but the fact that I feel it is too incompletely justified in the film and the book itself could have had a better title.  I have to say this, though.  The title gives nothing away.Overall, by the end, this film is a lot of fun and thought-provoking, despite my reservations.  It was definitely fun for me to think about and discuss with others.  I give Jackson points for pulling off anything having to do with these long novels as well as he did.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It doesn't get better than this,"What can one say?! Just a totally satisfying movie experience. Pity we've had to wait a year to see part II and another year has to go by before the final part.

Viewing in the privacy of my own home.,"The first 3 times I saw this movie, I saw them in large theaters just as it should be. The experiences were great, the movie grew by each of the times I saw it, always something that I had missed or misinterpreted all together. Despite those minor quirks, I loved the movie in all it´s splendor. Now that I managed to get a great TTT DVD from the oscarsjury, I could watch and scrutinize every little scene and make my new judgment.Well, the movie, on the whole, faired well during the transition between the silver screen and home entertainment. Fact is, several scenes became more clearer on a smaller screen.I feel that I don´t have to recapitalize the story anymore that what has already been done here. The movie is one of the best of 2002, no argue about that. Probably not THE best, but anyway.... it has a chance, right..?Best thing with this version is of course the ability for fast forward past those slow, meek Aragorn/Arwen scenes, and perhaps the telepathic link Galadriel/Elrond.Full score for the other stuff, with Andy Serkis & CCG unit taking first place in the race.9,5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A masterpiece of its time!,"Truly this is one of the great movies ever written. ""The Two Towers"" is a wonderful film, filled with dazzling special effects and awesome battle scenes.The story starts off with Gandalf falling with the creature that dragged him down when they were passing through Moria. It shows him battling the creature in the air and later shows how the battle turns out. The story then switches to Frodo and his loyal apprentice, Samwise Gamgee. As Frodo becomes more controlled by the ring, Sam is getting more worried of his master.When Gollum sees them sleeping, he attempts to take the ring, but fails. The special effects on Gollum are astounding and the creature steals the show. He agrees to help Frodo and Sam find the Gates of Mordor.Meanwhile, Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli are searching for their two friends that were taken captive, Merry and Pippen.This is just as good (possibly better) than the first one. Warning: If you haven't seen the first one you will be completely lost so before you see this see the first one. Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, and Sean Astin all give superb performances and the new characters are a treat (especially Gollum and the Empts) The empts are fun to watch, they are basically talking and walking trees that don't like to be pushed around. This story has a lot more humor in it, especially when Gimli (Rhys-Davies) is around.This movie is a masterpiece of its time and its got my vote for Best Picture of the Year. This story is good vs. evil is very well written by the brilliant writer J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job in translating this wonderful book into a wonderful movie.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An adroit adaptation of an extremely challenging novel,"It seems impossible to write a review of this film without turning into a comparison between it and J.R.R. Tolkien's original text. The deviations from the plot of the novel have been decried and also lauded.But that sometimes deflects readers from the nature of the accomplishment: Peter Jackson and company have taken a massive work (speaking of the entire trilogy), a sprawling work, and not just brought it to the screen but repurposed it to be a true film adaptation, playing to the strengths of the medium. The production team took a story that was plot-centric and made it character-centric; they took a story that in book form touched on an incredible number of areas and created a wonderful, rich universe and concentrated on the most important areas -- which makes it a less-than-perfect copy of the original source material, but a nearly perfect cinematic presentation of this story.As the middle part of a three-act story, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was the most difficult to conceptualize and the most difficult to present on its own, and some hurdles were nearly not cleared...but they all were, eventually.It's important to accept the storytelling premise: this is not a standalone film. It's less about character development than ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was and it's less about closure than ""Return of the King"" will be -- though it has both of those elements. It's the second act: that part of the story where we put the characters into impossible situations, where the challenges crystallize. The REAL story isn't about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. It's about the internal journeys that Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and the rest each face. This film does an excellent job in getting that task done.THE GOOD: The awesome panoramas and physical scope of what you see on screen is ever-present, as it was in the first film and I expect will be in the last. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but most attention is placed on the ones that need it.Jackson's decision to jump right into the second film -- to actually treat it not as a ""second film"" but as a continuation of the first -- means that every moment of screen time can be devoted to fleshing out characters and themes, which means that this film will contain more messages and things to dwell on than most films will. Some will find that a negative, but I found it a positive. Certainly Tolkien provided ample source material to choose from.At the same time, the film does not attempt to flesh out everything from the novels, which helps the viewer focus on the important things.The action is fast-paced but not overbearing, the acting superb and the balance between the physical and the emotional is good. Everything you've heard about the performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum is true -- easily the most significant digital character ever and a crucial performance.Howard Shore's score is superb.THE BAD: If you are a fan of the books and unable to let go of the text and keep an open mind, you're going to be distracted. I am a many-times reader of the books and I couldn't avoid devoting much of my attention to plot comparison during my first viewing. But once that was out of the way, I found that each successive viewing was a better experience than the last one.If you are not comfortable with the entire fantasy genre, the good news is that ""Lord of the Rings"" doesn't overplay the role of magic in the story. There are fantastic elements of course, but most of what you see on screen (or on page, for that matter) is different in form from reality but not so much in function. That being said, ""The Two Towers"" has the most fantastic elements of the three volumes, and will be harder for  you to swallow.With the plethora of characters and with Jackson's wise choice to focus on the development of the core ones, some characters seem to get short shrift, including Gandalf, who is in the odd position of being both a key mover of events but at the same time NOT being one of the core characters in terms of development. That can be disconcerting if you're not paying attention. ""Lord of the Rings"" is not a casual movie.A few of the visual effects are not up to par with the effects from the first film, though overall they are outstanding and in Gollum's case mind-blowing.Of course, ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective. The ""bad"" parts I list above are pretty circumstancial and might not make a difference to you. They didn't for me, which is why I give ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" unabashed top marks.A NOTE ON THE EXTENDED EDITION: I found the Extended Edition DVDs to have great extra scenes that Tolkien fans will love and cherish (I certainly did), and the special feature had me completely enraptured. However, I still recommend the tighter, leaner theatrical cut as the better film experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
VERY VERY good,"This movie was so good it made 3 hours seem like 5 minutes.  The time flew just as fast the second time I watched it.  In fact, I enjoyed it MORE the second time.  Peter Jackson and Company put so much detail into this movie that it seems you see something new every time you watch it.In that way, one may say that the movies are as good as the books.  I've read the books many times and I still enjoy them every time I read them.  So far, the movies are living up to that level of quality as well.Memorable moments from the movie include Gandalf vs. Balrog, Gollum's torment, Grima's passion for evil, Legolas & Gimli's growing relationship, Aragorn's courage, the last charge of the Ents, Rohan's last stand, Eomer's charge, Gollum's fish song, Sam's unfaltering strength, and many more...",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"""Like butter stretched over too much bread""","Yesterday, I saw ""The Two Towers"" and have to say that I am very disappointed. Even for someone who is not exactly a fan of Tolkien's world or the fantasy genre, the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" stood way beyond this sequel. A massive storyline and an excellent dramaturge concept made the first part appear smooth as silk. Chapters like ""The Treason of Isengard"" or ""The Bridge of Khazad Dum"" will always be remembered throughout the movie community and have set a new standard in this genre of film.Now, ""The two Towers"" has literally NO plot, it seems that director Peter Jackson didn't have a clue about how he should start, unfold and end the story of this second part of the trilogy. Somehow, it now seems hard to believe that he was in charge of the first part... The sequence of Frodo and his fellows crossing the Marches, the exaggerated focus on the creature Gollum and tons of splatter-UrukHai-sequences are all a strange reminder of his previous movies Braindead or The Frighteners. The film reveals its entire structural weakness just by the fact that Pippin and Merry appear throughout the movie in one Neverending Story-like sequence which was mainly used as editing material.The only impressive point so far is Howard Shore's incredible soundtrack on CD (even better than the first one!) and not so much in the film, where it was poorly used - amazing tracks like ""The Forbidden Pool"", ""Breath of Life"" or ""Evenstar"" are played in slapstick-like Gollum & Aragon scenes! Neither the old nor the newly introduced characters did have a chance to unfold properly. To put it in Bilbo's words: ""Like butter stretched over too much bread"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Brilliant!... (again)...,"Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. It's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Smooth as Butter,"As a preface, I waited for a second viewing before making a vote or comment. That being said, I gave the movie a perfect 10 and can only make positive comments about the movie.First, it is impossible to say that this movie was either better or worse than LOTR/Fellowship of the Rings, because both movies served different purposes.  The first movie devoted much of it's time setting up the story, establishing characters, and familiarizing the viewer with the world of Middle Earth.  The second movie was able to move the entire story along. The much more ""action"" nature of the second movie was probably a result of this.  In addition, the Two Towers book also has much more action than the first.  Therefore, those differences in the movies can be explained.Second, just like everyone else on the planet, I would concur that the special effects were amazing (although most of my amazement was with the Gollum and character - versus the Helm's Deep battle).  The Battle of Pellanor Fields will be incredible!Third, the acting was the part of the movie that really kept me in the story.  Lots of movies have big action and cannot keep your attention. The performances by Viggio Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Elijah Wood were very solid.Anyway, many people much more eloquent than me have waxed on about this movie.  This was a very good time.  If the purpose of the middle act of trilogy is to set up the grand finale, this movie was a complete success. However, it was also an entertaining evening in and of itself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The adventure is poised and rightly so gets more fascinating.,"The adventure is poised and rightly so gets more fascinating.This is the second film of the trilogy and adds up more elements to the story. There are newer characters and few old ones seem to have been rested, for good. Yet, the fascination does not stop and it gets more engaging with this one.I am actually happy revisiting these films as I seem to understand more points about the story than I did earlier. I cannot put them here and become a spoiler as I am an ardent fan of the Lord of the Rings. Rather, I can say that everyone must see why this is one of the finest fantasies brought alive on celluloid.The fellowship of the earlier film is split and yet each one is in the same pursuit. Their ways are different now, but the goal is still the same. The characterizations are still consistent and it makes it easier to understand the intention of each one. Also, it makes the story all the more fascinating.I love the technical aspects of the film, and that's one of the very reasons why this fantasy is highly appreciated. The visuals, the sound, the whole landscape. It seems so unreal and yet is so very connected. Peter Jackson is a genius who brought the whole middle earth in front of our eyes and yet everything seems like it existed at one point of time in reality. Also, he knows when to end and what to do with the material at hand. That's where his genius is. This film takes off from a good point and lands at a very wonderful point, making us more eager to be on the next adventure.It's a 5/5 for this one and is one of the greatest films and adventures ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Two Towers - Not a Top 250 Film of All Time,"Although an entertaining film for teens, The Two Towers does not really qualify as a top 250 film for the vast majority of movie goers over 21. The film has great music and cinematography, and wonderful characters crafted by the original author, but as a cinematic experience, it is rather dull and unexceptional. I cannot remember one exceptional line of dialogue from the movie, and I would bet that almost no one else does as well. There is lots of sound and fury, but we all know what that signifies.The film, to me, seemed to have only the slightest relevance to the book and its author's intent, and was made to satisfy the teens and other children in the audiences. In my opinion, one could have easily seen the first film and the final installment of the third film: Return of the King, without missing losing any film enjoyment. A very good children's movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Ehhhhh,"The first lord of the ring movie is by far one of the most overhyped and over talked about movie of our time ( I find it to be boring, and utterly a waste of time, with a story that is soooo lame that you will laugh hard when you hear it). Yet Two Towers, actually was able to capture a few cool moments, and make it at least a watchable movie. Sure its still the same utterly crap story, with lame charecters, and horrbile acting. But it has some pretty cool action scenes and some good directing. Now enough in the movie to reccomend, but if its on cable one night what the hell flip it on and enjoy about 10 mins of the film that are good, and be in for another 2 hours and 40 mins of bordness. I would give the movie a 4 out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The saga continues with even more richness and complexity,"""The Two Towers"" continues J.R.R. Tolkien's epic as interpreted by Peter Jackson, and though it lacks the same degree of suspense as ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" it delivers when it matters in the first culminating battle sequence of the series.In ""The Two Towers,"" the Fellowship has been disbanded following the death of Boromir (Sean Bean). Having bent the great wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) toward his will, Sauron now has armies in both Mordor and at Isengard (the two towers). Saruman's army of Uruk Hai have turned their attention to the kingdom of Rohan, where Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) venture. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) set out for Mordor on their own, though they quickly find themselves with another companion, the creature Gollum, who lusts after the Ring that once was his.The script for this middle installment involves a lot of setup and building toward the climax: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Given the rich texture and detail of Jackson's Middle Earth, we are swept up and intrigued by the new characters and locations rather than bogged down by them. The subplot of the catatonic King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and the treacherous Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) makes for great theater though it complicates matters, as does all the focus on Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who becomes quite fond of Aragorn despite knowing his heart belongs to another.With the Fellowship divided, the narrative must bounce around and entire characters become left out for what seem like hours. The one weak limb of the story that we come back to time and time again that really sticks out in a negative way is the subplot with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been rescued from a band of Uruk Hai by the great Treebeard, leader of the Ents. The film cuts back numerous times to the two hobbits riding on Treebeard's back as he slowly delivers exposition and back story, and the scenes are few and far between, so they really make the length of the film stand out in a negative way.All is cured, however, at Helm's Deep. This is the major action payoff we've been waiting for since the opening prologue in ""Fellowship,"" the first major arrival point in the series, one that the script foreshadows hours before the battle begins. The people of Rohan have retreated to their refuge hoping that the fortress's high walls will allow their few hundred to pull off a miracle against the thousands of Uruk Hai. It's a classic Greek mythology setup and the payoff makes Helm's Deep the most rewarding sequence in the series thus far.But what makes ""Two Towers"" great is not just the spectacle in the end; we also get even deeper into our cast of characters. The film really explores the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and their likely ill-fated romance. Although they're mostly comic relief, we become closer with Gimli and Legolas through greater use of humorous dialogue.The acting standouts of the film, however, are once again Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White, given a renewed life for the purpose of saving Middle Earth, and Andy Serkis as the motion-captured schizophrenic creature, Gollum/Smeagol. McKellen continues to draw so much attention to his character and the 100 percent pure gravitas he brings to the role cannot be over-appreciated. Adorned in white and given greater power this time around, he literally sparkles.Gollum is a curious character who carves out a pivotal role in the series in just a few hours after hints at his relationship with the Ring. The character's voice and mannerisms could drive a viewer insane, but he's such a technological breakthrough and Serkis gives the pitiable and ugly thing legitimate complexity. Whether Frodo and Sam can trust him becomes a huge piece of this movie, and ultimately it becomes about whether or not we trust him. Frodo believes that Gollum is capable of doing the right thing and that he's their only chance to make it to Mordor, whereas Sam is ever the skeptic. This thread of doubt runs through the entire Frodo- Sam-Gollum subplot.In the end, once again the script uses such moving dialogue delivered by actors so fiercely committed to their characters' emotions to really cap off ""The Two Towers"" in a way that will have you forgetting how long it took to get to this point and eagerly awaiting the final chapter. Sam's speech to Frodo in the end is nothing short of inspiring, capturing where the narrative is from an emotional and thematic standpoint.All the characters by the end of ""Two Towers"" have passed the point of no return; they've stared down certain annihilation and come to the conclusion that they are too far committed to their responsibilities to not be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. The notion that the ""storm is coming"" foreshadows the Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's really about what lies beyond. Hope is the unspoken theme in play — they all have to believe in it.Bridging the first and last chapters makes ""Two Towers"" the weakest of the series, but it's also among the most memorable for its stirring conclusion and rousing segue into ""The Return of the King."" Having had first exposure to this incredible cinematic vision for Middle Earth, it can be easy to forget the incredible production value, but that has to be noted and assures this second ""Lord of the Rings"" film a certain baseline of absolute excellence.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Better than the reviews are saying,"I have been reading a lot of online reviews written by creditable publications, and individuals.  Generally the concensus seems to be *** out of **** (3 out of 4 stars).  I don't agree with this; Two Towers is a continuation of a great epic and deserves **** out of ****.  Peter Jackson has become the best visual director in the film industry right now.  Many reviews are criticizing the CGI job for Gollum; this is ridiculous. Compare it to the 2 best known CGI characters in recent movies: the disastrous Jar-Jar Binks, and perhaps the even worse Dobby.  Furthermore, there are real characters in this movie including: Gollum, Aragorn, Arwen, and Frodo (who for the majority of the film is able to drop the Hobbit go-lucky attidude and present the caricature of a possessed victim).  Two Towers has some faults, like the flatness of Gimili's character, and more noticably the absolutely horrid shots of Merry and Pippin in a tree; these things are screaming blue screen.  But neither one of these faults warrants a *** ranking.  LOTR is like nothing we have seen before, it is a breathtaking epic, and Two Towers does not deserve any of the sophmoric backlash it seems it is receiving.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Dump all the cynical critics, this movie's just great!","Here in Belgium, lots of movie critics were not satisfied with this film. I don't know what they expected instead, maybe they're just prejudiced. Anyway, it's a must see. It's how the story had to continue to stay true to the book and at the same time be a compelling movie in itself. It's no longer a simple straightforward tale from North to south anymore, the plot thickens, the evil manifests itself more openly and despair grows. The careless Shire is long behind us, it's for real this time. The Aragorn-Arwen thing might be boring to some, but they're forgetting that their story formed a whole appendix in Tolkien's work, so it belongs in the major story. Besides, it explains the tough choice Arwen must make, just like any other character in the movie, they all have to realize the good old times will never return. But for me the best part in the whole movie was Gollum. Sweet, deceitful, tragic Gollum. You can't help feeling sorry for him. His voice, his expression, his dialogues with Smeagol, it all makes him one of the most complex and interesting characters of them all. It's just great how they created him, and developed his character so thoroughly in this piece of cinema with an over 30 man strong cast. And for anyone who dislikes it, I'd like to see YOU get those millions of dollars from the studios and make something better. This what you got, and it's worth every damn penny.

Fantastic adaptation... but beware!,"The Two Towers is a wonderful movie, one that stands as a great work on its own. As an adaptation, it also excels, but you have to be willing to forgive the filmmakers for the amount of material they changed. At first, I left the theater a bit unhappy and ticked off. Some things really didn't need to be changed, I thought. They went too far. However, after thinking about it more, there were a lot of things in the books that wouldn't translate well, not to mention the fact that introducing more people, towers, etc. would only serve to confuse the casual movie goer. Also, some characters weren't complex or realistic enough in the books (Faramir), and needed more depth and conflict. Arwen, who is barely mentioned in the books, with exception to her tale in the Appendixes, also needed to have her story, and her love story with Aragorn, expanded, for the sake of realism and believablity. That is the key. There are things in the book that we can accept as readers that casual watcher wouldn't believe. Were the movie geared only toward fans of the books, they could have mentioned all the names they wanted, and given us everything from the books they could have fit in 3 hours. But for the sake of making the trilogy make sense for new viewers, things had to change. I think that even the most jaded fan will appreciate this movie once they understand that. And, most importantly, Peter Jackson kept the mood and attitude right. Details may have changed, but the heart-and-soul of the book remains. That is commendable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A bit of a disappointment after the first film,"After the thickly-layered mountains of praise heaped upon ""Fellowship of the Ring"", perhaps it was inevitable that ""The Two Towers"" couldn't live up to it.  And maybe I'm the only one who feels that it did not.  Unfortunately, where ""Fellowship"" managed a near-perfect combination of the book's strengths with a good deal of shoring up to cover its weaknesses (sorry, Ringies, but it does have weaknesses), ""Towers"" shows all too many of the limitations of its source material, and the additions sadly weaken it even further.Certainly there's plenty to admire.  The new characters are beautifully introduced and performed, particularly in the case of Miranda Otto as Eowyn, and a surprisingly sympathetic and complex rendition of Gollum, who could easily have been extremely irritating.  The new characters, in fact, come off much better than the established ones.  John Rhys Davies' Gimli suffers particularly, reduced to an almost Jar-Jar-like role of comic relief and battle buffoon.  Also of note is the spectacular staging of the assault on Helm's Deep, surely one of the finest mass ground battles ever committed to film.However, there are many more mis-steps here than evident in the first film. A sequence in which Aragorn is separated from the party ultimately serves no purpose, as he simply experiences a flashback sequence and is quickly reunited with his friends.  Why?  In addition, the pacing is less even than that found in ""Fellowship"".  Where that film managed to pace out its thrills in excellent beats with the story-driven scenes, this one makes the audience wait quite a bit longer for payoff.  ""The Two Towers"" is more likely to test the patience of those not already enamored of Tolkien's world, as it's a long haul from the bombastic Balrog opening to the two battles that cap off the story.  At the same time, the many liberties taken with the structure of the book (especially the characterization of Faramir) may put off the hardcore fans.Still, there are a lot of filmgoers out there who decided to unconditionally love this series long before the first chapter hit the screens, and I doubt that this will dim their enthusiasm.  I can't wholeheartedly recommend ""The Two Towers"" for everyone, but that really won't stop anybody.  As a means of getting from part one to part three, it does its job in an entertaining manner.  Hopefully, ""Return of the King"" will bring us as rousing a conclusion as ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was an introduction.  But this definitely represents a dip in the road.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

If you did your research into the magnitude of the story, you will know that no one could ever had directed, or made the movies any better. The sheer volume of material that had to be included would leave anyone for dead. But Peter Jackson managed to pull it off. Of those who don't care for a story of such brilliance and magnitude, at least have the intelligence to acknowledge the quality of the production.We live in a world where everyone thinks they're movie experts. Clear and detach your mind from all preconceived notions, sit back and watch both films again.

One of the most epic and iconic movie ever made,"This is definitely one of the best epic movies I have seen and I would rewatch at anytime. The movie offers one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters.The characters like Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts - the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.The main action, of course, comes from the whole Aragorn storyline mixing in plenty of incident and interesting creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. The movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). The cast is flawless - exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban, and especial mention to Bernard Hill.

Glowing reviews and the promise of a ""better film"" got meinto the theater for this one. Well, Gollum ""is"" a technical wonder.This CGI marvel is by far, the most engaging character in themovie. The battle near the end of the movie is also wonderful tolook at. Lots of good ""eye candy"" there. But the rest of the movie?(Yawn!) Why would director Peter Jackson, spend over two hoursbuilding to the climax of this movie, the battle, and then keepcutting away from it to show us the two Hobbits and Treebeardwalking & talking? For me, it kept grinding the film to a halt.And extended DVD's? Are you kidding me? These movies areplenty long enough as is, thank you very much. One thing's for sure, I don't care how good the reviews are for thenext chapter. I won't be rushing off to see Return of the King. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What is so great about this?,Why does everyone think this movie is some kind of masterpiece which is set to redefine cinema?  I found it boring and at times incredibly cliché and corny.  I really hated all the pseudo-emotional romance that was put in for no apparent reason.,1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!,"I've seen SO many movies this year, none can compare to this one! The action & suspense kept me wanting to watch more & more! Although it was rather long, i wouldn't have wanted it to be any shorter. It was the perfect length of time. They sequenced it so well, it couldn't be any better. Although my legs went numb near the ending, i wouldn't have stayed for any other movie but i did for this one. The story is so fascinating, you want to know everything, but the great thing about the LOTR, it keeps you interested for the next movie to come out! The best thing about the LOTR is that you get a good feel for the character. Such as when something wrong happens, you feel sad for the character, this is what makes the movie so great! You feel the character's emotions. The jumping back & forth between Frodo & Aragron made it very easy to follow. You understood it once they got to the big fight scene. In the beginning, it was hard to understand how Frodo & Sam fitted in, like what they were trying to do. But the creature that kept saying precious made them all tie together. These are my opinions on the LOTR, the best movie of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Moviegoing at it's best!,"I know it's be said before so I'll be breif: THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE MOVIE! My recommendation?  If you haven't read the book, READ IT FIRST!!! It really will help.

A Tutorial on How to keep the Highest Quality All Until The End,"After a perfect introduction, Peter Jackson and the team continued the franchise equally perfect, portraying all the events and characters from the books in a perfect way, and bringing us to even better locations, sets and props than the last year. The Two Towers is (by the story) my personal favourite movie from the Trilogy, and the movie is so well made that there is no need to talk about it at all. A 10/10 and nobody could ever change my mind.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Gollum, Gollum!!","Rarely it is seen that sequels manage to keep up to the originals, generally heavily criticized by the fans of the original. But The Two Towers is a gem of a film and a jewel of a sequel. Nor does it go astray, neither it looses its pace. It is as beautiful as the The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. Also as beautiful as the book itself.Frodo and Sam continue with their quest and are finally united with Gollum, meanwhile Merry and Pippin finally get to play their part in the war. Aragorn and others fight to protect the Rohirrims from the armies of Sauruman's Uruk High.Just like the fellowship of the ring this film excels in breathtaking Cinematography, sound, original score, make up, set designs and visual effects. Also the character design, creating a haunting and pitiful Gollum, straight out of the book, I wonder if Tolkien actually wanted Gollum to be like that? Also It's superbly digitally acted by Andy Serkis, who reaches new heights of digital acting.The film also has some superior character development as it further sketches the characters of previously Un-scketched characters like Frodo, Aragorn and too some extent Legolas. Eoweyn brings in a good deal of famine element in the movie. According to the book, Ents are the most sluggish or boring creatures in the middle earth, and Jackson made sure to make their parts 'boring' (A little tongue in cheek).Direction: Flawless as before.Script/Screenplay: Strong and superb.Acting: I feel sad the Andy wasn't nominated in any major award ceremony, he was superb. Elijah shines too. Others are convincing.Music: Extremely good, though not as good as the Fellowship but still great and haunting. Its a delight to see how Gollum's last scene blends into Gollum's Song.Overall, not a movie but an experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Non-stop adventure and excitement,"The 2nd movie of the series does not disappoint.  It was non-stop adventure and excitement  The few parts that did seem to slow down were long to sit through but helped give you more background or information on the characters.The battle between good and evil is even more overpowering in this movie. Gollum/Smeagol was such an unusual character. The real actor is never seen but knowing he was actually being filmed and CGI altered later made his part even more difficult.  His face was ugly at first but his eyes were mesmerising after the first few closups.  Obsession was running wild for him, Frodo and others.So many characters are being Tested during the movie.  Do the right thing or take the easy way.  Turn on Frodo or not.  Steal the ring or not.A more than worthy sequel in the series.  We are so glad they decided to put in the ENT's.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A good Movie ..,"but really hard to follow for those who didn't read the book (like me). But i liked the special effects, the battle of helmsdeep was awesome (albeit a little too unrealistic). its a pitty that they left a lot of things unexplained (the whole story about the Ents was left out, according to my friend who read the book), but this would make the movie even longer.i'll give it 7 out of 10p.s.

Extremely overrated,"The fact that the majority of the viewers are rating this movie a 10 is just sad.  Is this what passes for quality current mainstream enertainment? What's the big fuss about this movie?  The first one was okay, but I found this one just DREADFUL.  First off, why was Liv Tyler in it?  They could have cut her character out and given me back fifteen minutes of my life.  I think they just stuck her in because she's a big name to put on the poster...but her little plotline lended nothing to the overall plot.  I found Frodo's adventure interesting, but it was not the overall focus of the movie.  It was mainly a boring war movie.  And the war scenes were terribly boring...I felt like someone was twisting all nine of my piercings over and over and over again.  The war scenes were just repetitive.  I looked at the clock after an hour thinking, ""Surely, it must be almost over!""  And then I realized that there had to be another two hours left.  I felt like I was being slowly tortured.  I couldn't believe I wasted $9 and a Friday night.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
It tears me in two...,"Having just returned from seeing The Two Towers, i find my self torn in two between my love for Tolkiens original work, and wanting to love this interpretation of it.Because that's what this film is, an interpretation of the book.  It made a number of changes which I absolutely hate, but can't help to love visually.First off, Mr. Jackson, get your priorities in order.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BEND TO THE HOLLYWOOD FORMULA!  You don't need to create all these new love stories and stupid cliche triangles between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn. These scenes were never in the book, they were only subtexts.  Leave them alone.THE ENTS ARE AN INCREDIBLE CREATION!  SHOW THEM OFF!!! The Ents needed much more screen time.  When we're first introduced to Treebeard, Merry and Pippin talk to him for about 30 seconds before we're off someplace else.  He's a new incredibly unique character!  Can we develop his history and culture a little more? PLEASE??  After his introduction, we only cut back to him for periods of a minute or less!  How long have Merry and Pippin been on his shoulders?  Then suddenly it's the march to war, and we don't even get to see their first charge!  Suddenly we cut back from Helms Deep and they're already inside the walls, breaking everything down! No dialogue with Saruman. He should be saying things like,  ""Saruman!  THe Forests are descending on the walls!""  ""What?  Impossible."" Etc.On the battle of Helms Deep.  This was i'll have to admit, incredible. However you should have played down Gimli's comic relief just a little bit. We should have seen him with a blood lust in his eyes, hacking away at the armies of the orcs, not being too short, tossed by Aragorn and poking people with the end of his Axe.  However the rest of the battle was incredible. Well Done.On Gollum.  Very nice indeed.  I was worried about his portrayal, and though a tad bit over the top, his dialogue with himself and the aside to the audience was great.  And there were just a couple of shots during the movie where I almost believed he was real.  Impressive.On Sam and Frodo.  KISS ALREADY!  If you're gonna have them get that close to each other and put all that mushy dialogue in, take it all the way. Frodo, stop overacting.  Sam, stop overacting.  Your monologues are rediculous.  It sounds like you're reciting poetry.All in all, it's a wonderful, incredible film.  The visuals are very much amazing, however there were almost too many grand sweeping shots, to the point where rather than thinking ""Oh my god, what incredible mountains!"" It was ""Oh look, another sweeping shot of more mountains.""However, stick with Tolkien, he knew what he was doing.  It's all there in front of you.  If you complain that you had to cut stuff from the book for time, don't go adding stuff back in that wasn't in the book.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The battle for Helmsdeep has begun,"The second part of Peter Jackson's epic LOTR trilogy.....This is basically a conjunction to the first and the last part of the trilogy, so it isn't as good as its predecessor....But then again it isn't that bad either....In this part we basically get to know the characters more, we know about their likes and dislikes, who they favor, etc....We start off right from where the first movie finished, the journey through middle earth continues, and Frodo and his mate take a new member in, one who eventually betrays them....The others are all separated, but they all meet up in the end......Like the first movie, this also has a sad theme, as people die, also the movie features a dazzling battle during the night, something we didn't have in the first movie..... Legolas(Orlando Bloom), does a series of mind blowing moves, which leave you open mouthed, stunned.........Gimli the dwarf offers some comic to the movie, and Aragorn, proves his selflessness..... and we find a surprise through Gandalf....It is also worth mentioning Elijah Wood, through whom the story revolves and his companion Samwise Gamgee(Sean Austin).... If anyone stands out in this movie, it must be him, some of his words sticks to your mind for a long time......The visual effects improve in this movie, so does the costume and cinematography.....8/10.........",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
5* Fantasy EPIC!!!!!!!!!,Having never read any of Tolkiens RINGS trilogy and only ever seeing the animated Ralph Bakshi offering over 20 years ago i wasn't knowing what to expect.But this 2nd part of what i feel could well be the best trilogy ever made was absolutely BRILLIANT.Gollum was one of the most believable CGI creations i have ever seen in a movie.You couldn't help but feel his suffering (totally absorbing).Great acting by all the cast throughout the entire movie.Battle scenes were extremely well done and the soundtrack really added to the atmosphere of the movie.My only downpoint to the movie was that 3 hours was not long enough.Heres hoping that Peter Jackson releases extra footage on another DVD set next year when it comes out on that format..I highly recommend this movie to everyone.I'm outta here.Gotta book a ticket to go see it again :-),10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Brilliant!!!,"Words cannot accurately describe how I feel about this movie. To see my favourite book, a book i've loved for years brought to life before my eyes is nothing short of wonder. Peter Jackson has created a movie that I can see again and again without getting bored. The battle of helms deep,gollum, the ruins of Osgilath, the flag of Rohan fluttering to the ground, king theodens song... the legend comes to life. All the actors are brilliant and all the effects are right.

Different movie from the first - a few quibbles,"Was looking forward to the second movie with great anticipation after enjoying the first movie tremendously. I saw the movie on its first day of release in NZ, the 19th of Dec 2002.The movie was intense, emotional and breathtaking. The wide pan helicopter scenery shots were incredible. Gollum, as may others viewers have sugegsted, was an incredible work of CGI/real character brilliance and gave real life, humor and humanity to Smeagol/Gollum. Gimli also added a bit of comic relief throughout the movie which was good to break up the intensity. The film left me more emotionally mved to sadness than the first, however it was extremely well done.Brad Dourif as Wormtounge excelled and liked the casting of Miranada Otto as Eowyn. Bernard Hill was a different Theoden to how I perceived him in the book, however was put in a good performance.I found that the dialouge was a bit heavier this time with some of it I could recall straight out of the book. However, I didnt enjoy how PC treated the relationship between Arwen / Aragorn went or how Elrond dispises humans. I also didn't like how the Elves turned up at Helms Deep or how Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. My idea of the ""rolling hills of Rohan"" was not really what appeared on the screen either.Howver, apart from these things, I'm sure the second installment will grow on me over time and it kept on reminding me of the second installment in another great Trilogy, Star Wars (IV, V and VI).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
No words can really describe the experience...,"A thrilling plot, beautiful scenery, brilliant music and some of the best acting I've seen.  This movie goes far beyond what I expected it to be.  I suppose I could write a detailed summary, but by now you've probably read others.  Let me say this:Of the comments that it didn't stay true to the book:  It did, like it or not.  Sure there is added scenes, but the movie wouldn't make sense without them.  If you want to see The Two Towers word for word, I suggest you pick up the book and use your imagination.And to the people who said there was missing chapters at the end...I say they have not even read the book.  If they followed the movie correctly, and the book, they would realize the story went in chronological order from chapter to chapter.  They left out chapters AT THE END and was stated that they would be in The Return of the King.  I don't know if people have corks in their ears, but I heard Gollum say, ""she'll kill them for me.""  If you don't know who ""she"" is ... you have not read the book.  It is apparent that some people writing their reviews have claimed to read the book and seen the movie, but obviously have not.The general feeling from book to movie was the same, it stayed true to the mood, and the general themes were the same.  For people saying PJ did a horrible job, I'd like to see you, or any real director in that same sense, do a better job.I rated this a 10/10, and all the people who have voted a one have not seen the movie.See this movie.

"Technically, a great movie","Well, what to say when you see a movie you´ve been imagining for 7 years... It is really hard to throw away prejudices and preconcepts. I think the result of this adaptation is more than acceptable, in fact, an excellent product. Great action, the love story, superb FX, nice and respectable stars, the drama, the commedy. It has all that it has to have. BUT then, as a LOTR fan, I feel very very dissappointed with some points. First of all, it makes me feel sad to see that THE ACTING, the best interpretation, the scene that better shows the spirit of theater and acting is the one of Gollum ""struggling"" with Sméagol. The best actor is computer created, without forgetting the surelly hard work (and very good one) of Andy Serkis. Now on to the characters. I was pissed off when I saw Aragorn giving the daggers to the hobbits and I understood that no Tom Bombadil will be in FOTR. I said, ""OK, it´s a whole new character and lot of time for something that, truly, doesn´t affect so much the storyline"". Something similar with Arwen and Glorfindel; but now, when Gollum decides to take Frodo and Sam to SheLob´s lair, it decides so because of Frodo ""betrays"" him. In the books, and I´ve already said that I´m a fan and cannot throw my concepts, Gollum takes the two hobbits to SheLob because of Sam, and this is one of the most important things in Sam´s character. Like Frodo hasn´t enough, Jackson took it off of Sam to give it to Frodo. HEY! SAM ALREADY EXISTS, YOU DON´T HAVE TO MAKE A NEW CHARACTER!!! This makes me sad too. But with Faramir, what Jackson did to Faramir makes me not sad but VERY P***ED OFF. This Faramir is totally opposed to the Faramir of the books. He was one of the noblest and wisest characters, even being very young, and there was a very big difference between Boromir and Faramir. I can´t see this difference in the movie. Man, Faramir resisted the temptation of the ring almost without effort, and here he don´t have the chance to get out of the shadow of his big brohter. In fact, it doesn´t even seems to bother him... It is a good movie, really well done, but for someone who have already created and recreated the characters, it will be a little difficult to accept some of these changes. Anyway, everyone should see it once or twice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Towers of Strength,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, directed by Peter Jackson, is an epic, visually captivating continuation of J. R. R. Tolkien's iconic saga, further immersing audiences in the vast, heroic struggle of Middle-earth against the encroaching darkness. As the second instalment in the trilogy, The Two Towers deepens the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) as they venture toward Mount Doom, while simultaneously expanding its focus on Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) as they defend the realms of men against Saruman's advancing forces. With its awe-inspiring battles, richly developed character arcs, and unparalleled visual achievements, The Two Towers stands as a triumph in filmmaking, offering a truly immersive experience.The performances across the board are exceptional, with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin portraying Frodo and Sam's emotional and physical burdens with great depth. Their relationship with the conflicted and pitiable Gollum (Andy Serkis) adds layers of tension, vulnerability, and complexity. Serkis's groundbreaking performance, delivered through motion capture technology, redefined the possibilities of visual effects and provided a lasting contribution to the medium. Viggo Mortensen shines as Aragorn, bringing both quiet strength and noble determination to the role, making his journey towards accepting his destiny as king both poignant and compelling. Meanwhile, the dynamic between Legolas and Gimli provides much-needed moments of humour and camaraderie, offering a welcome contrast to the darker themes at play.Jackson's direction is a masterclass in balancing large-scale spectacle with intimate character moments. The Battle of Helm's Deep, one of the most iconic sequences in cinematic history, showcases Jackson's ability to orchestrate complex action scenes while maintaining a deep emotional investment in the characters. The film's blend of practical effects and cutting-edge CGI brings the world of Middle-earth to vivid life, striking a remarkable balance between realism and fantasy. Howard Shore's score amplifies the film's emotional and thematic depth, weaving grandeur and melancholy into every note, further elevating the narrative.Beyond its visual spectacle, The Two Towers explores profound themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the power of hope in the face of overwhelming adversity. The characters' internal struggles, portrayed with subtlety and nuance, mirror the external battles they face, giving the film a rich emotional core that resonates throughout. Jackson's adaptation remains faithful to Tolkien's vision, capturing the darkness, beauty, and moral complexity of Middle-earth with care and respect.In conclusion, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a cinematic achievement of the highest order. With its unforgettable battles, deeply developed characters, and profound storytelling, the film stands as a masterpiece, solidifying its place as a defining moment in modern cinema and ensuring its lasting legacy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A Tribute,"To Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens,Dwarf Lord and Ladies of the Southern Islands,And to Their 3000 Sworn Companions,Who from the Bottomless Depths of The World's Greatest NovelMined and Wrought The World's Greatest Movie,My Humble Gratitude and Joyful Admiration.*Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings will forever set the standard for cinematic entertainment. Henceforth you cannot help but ask: was watching some other movie, TV show, sporting event, etc., a better use of your leisure time than re-watching a couple of hours of LotR? Probably not, especially once we get hold of the extended DVD versions.* * * * *To the naysayers out there:Yeah, yeah, yeah -- I know the film's not perfect. Neither, for different reasons, is Tolkien's book. Get over it. [Just one example:  in the book, Sam's speech is shot through with maritime references, natural to an Englishman, but no Shire hobbit had ever seen the sea.]I give 4 derisive 'Bree Belches' to Roger Ebert's delicately fatuous and thoroughly erroneous critique of The Two Towers's supposed lack of faith to the trilogy, which he acknowledges he has never read. Well, I *have* read the books, about a dozen times in the past four decades (starting with the hardcover first edition in my high school library, when that was still the only edition), and I believe that Peter Jackson's movies are true to the heart, soul, and characters of the story, and that the liberties he took with the plot were warranted by the translation to film, and some are genuine improvements (e.g. replacing Glorfindel with Arwen). Ebert pompously claims, ""The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien,"" but the Battle of Helm's Deep is in fact just as big and dark and violent in the book as it is in the movie, and both are tame compared to what Tolkien would have experienced firsthand as a line officer on the Western Front in the Great War.For a much more perceptive review, from another critic who has not read the books, check out Joe Morgenstern's column in the Wall Street Journal of 12/20/2002.*For others who like to obsess over details, consider this:Six of the eight Middle-Earthly members of the Fellowship are princes of their people. Aragorn is heir to the throne of Gondor; Boromir the eldest son of its ruling steward. Legolas is the son and heir of Thranduil, king of the Mirkwood elves. Gimli is nephew to Thorin Oakenshield, dwarf king under the Lonely Mountain, and cousin (and therefore potential heir) to Balin, late lord of Moria. Merry is heir to the Thane of Buckland, while Pippin is in direct line of descent from the Old Took. Only Frodo and Sam are commoners -- a rich eccentric country squire and his devoted gardener, nostalgic timeless English characters singularly resonant for Tolkien's own shattered generation.Jackson essentially omits this set-up from the movie. In the book it does not become important until after the fall of Sauron. Alas Jackson has stated that ""The Cleansing of the Shire"" will not be part of his Return of the King, though he was careful not to reveal what *will* be included. Narsil re-forged will play a part, one hopes. Elrond does set this up. And would zombie-master Jackson dare to delete the Paths of the Dead? One hopes not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

a prelude to a mediocre finale,"The Two Towers is where The Lord of the Rings trilogy reared its head. The excitement about the first movie wore off a bit due to a year's wait until the release of the second installment.

Tolkin's book.However, there were elements of a regular Hollywood blockbuster which would eventually get hold of the third movie. The battles are becoming larger, the special effects grander, yet they were still well balances with superior plot in order to capture my attention. The merit for latter goes to Tolkin, though, not to writers who managed not to get carried away.In The Two Towers we were still in a magical world with some dark changes. The characters are multi-layered and are developing as the dark menace of Mordor is slowly unraveled. There were some twists and surprises, but also we knew that there was one more movie to go until the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Why The Two Towers will become a classic,"I was on the nightly premiere of The Two Towers, and it seems clear to me now that there will never be another adaption of The Lord of the Rings. After the trilogy is completed, the legendary books will always be connected with this series of films.Many people were astonished by The Fellowship of the Ring. The Two Towers will blow their minds away. While Fellowship was an introduction of the characters in the story, Two Towers is full-scale mayhem (`open war is upon us, whether you risk it or not'). The violence is raw, the evil is dark and the Uruk-Hai army is mighty. This is also the point where the trilogy really becomes an epic story of the classic themes; love and friendship, hatred and war. The characters all become more complex. Elijah Wood portrays the increasing darkness in Frodo brilliantly - his frightening eyes telling a whole story of their own, Legolas is the ultimate medieval action hero and King Théodan is also given a worthy performance by Bernard Hill. The most successful character, however, is the one of Gollum/Sméagol. He is geniously portrayed by the actor and mountain climber Andy Serkis, who both does his voice and his movements. Gollum is definitely the most complex CGI character up to date, and his appearance is also very realistic.The footage is amazing. Peter Jackson has simply done an even more splendid job behind the camera this time than with Fellowship. The beautiful nature of New Zealand is a pleasure for the eye, with its majestic mountains and adventurous plains. Fangorn forest is fantastic. The extra lightening effects, as are widely used with Gandalf, adds to the experience.The Battle of Helm's Deep. It is huge, overwhelming and epic in all its form, as is the movie. It is hard to believe that the film really manages to portray the battle as great on screen as it was meant to be, but Peter Jackson has accomplished the task. That is really the core of my opinion on The Two Towers (as on The Fellowship of the Ring): Tolkien's story of Middle-earth was a perfected masterpiece, hailed by many as the greatest of all stories. In these years we are witnessing it come to life on the cinema screen in a way no one could have imagined. We are privileged. The professor would have been proud.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
In terms of timing...you could not have chosen a worse title,"The thing about reviewing these films so close to each other is that you kind of don't have anything to say after the first one, because they all feel so connected at an atomic level and so consistent with each other.Not that that's a bad thing, seeing as it is all based on one book, and I do have to give it credit for being probably the most consistent trilogy of all time (like if they had released it all as one film, aside from the length, I think it would have worked almost perfectly), but all I can really say that's good about it is stuff I already said about Fellowship, with the notable exception of ""sweet Christ the battle at Helm's Deep is still one of the best battle scenes ever bloody filmed"", and ""sweet Christ Gollum is creepy and pathetic and funny, sometimes all at the same time and Andy Serkis should have broken all the Oscar rules about voice acting to win best supporting actor for this"".Which means the only thing to do is whine about the ways I think this is worse than Fellowship, such as:The fact that I really hate it when a story acts like a character is dead, only to bring them back later, which actually happens a few times in this, and on the other side of the same coin, I also hate it when characters start feeling too indestructible, which a fair few of these characters unfortunately do.That there are a few slightly awkward edits throughout this, although I'm not sure whether that was just a symptom of watching the extended version or not.That I don't really like the stupid unrequited love that Eowyn has for Aragorn, especially when it never goes anywhere.And most of all, that of all three of these films, this is by far the one that drags the most. There is a pretty substantial chunk around the middle of the film in the parts that don't involve Frodo, Sam and Gollum that really slow the film down to a crawl, even if I still couldn't really call it bad.Although I will grant that Merry and Pippin are much less annoying in this one, and Legolas does have...some personality. A little bit. Enough to make him bearable.It's definitely my least favourite of the trilogy, but it's kind of like your least favourite Haribo. You'll still eat them and most likely enjoy them whenever you buy a packet, it's just that you can't help but wish a little bit for what came before or what you know is coming after once you finish it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Brilliant as ever, even after three hours (slight yawn!)","What else can be said about this fairy-story for adults? Boromir and Frodo are two diminutive human-like creatures (hobbits) from a threatened region of fantasy world. They have been entrusted to return an evil ring of power' to its source and so destroy it. The Ring has a mind and personality of its own and tries to corrupt its bearer. Line up the good guys: Gandalf, (friendly magician), The Ents (tree-creatures that can walk and talk), various human and half-human species, and CGIs that generally are wont to inhabit such tales. Then there's the baddies: Saruman (corrupt wizard), the Dark Lord Sauron, and an army of custom-bred nasties (queue more fabulous CGIs). Finally, one of the most popular characters, Gollum (Smeagal) who has been twisted body and soul and tracks after the ring bearer in the belief he is its rightful owner. (Smeagal is such a remarkable feat of special effects that he has endeared himself to many audiences who come out pining for a pet one.) The Two Towers' of evil unite against the forces of good and slug it out for another three hours. (This synopsis for the benefit of anyone who hasn't spent many hours reading the book). The good things about the film are much the same as Part One (Fellowship of the Ring) or even better  great scenery, great battles, believable acting and judicious use of special effects in a movie that respects the intelligence of the adult cinema-goer without being too horrific for a young adolescent. On the down side, you have to like this sort of stuff in the first place, or be willing to be won over, and you have to put up with built in flaws like a dodgy and seemingly random mix of accents throughout. Part two of a remarkable, brilliant, and genre-making trilogy  but more or less what you would expect if you've seen part one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Looks fantastic, storyline disappointing","I thought the movie looked fantastic, just like Fellowship of the Ring, but once again Jackson made COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY changes to the storyline. None of the changes where necessary to condense the story.  In fact, many increased screen time.  I'm not a purist.  I believed the decision to interweave the story of Frodo and Sam and the story of the rest was a correct one since modern audiences expect that sort of thing  like say in the Empire Strikes Back.  The story changes that actually replace parts of the story in the book were not at all necessary.I would say more but I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie.  I'm just warning them that they better not expect the story in the Two Towers volume.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"A lot of effort, but little reward.","Very similar feeling to the first film.  Certainly everyone can admire the effort and hard work that must have gone into making these three films.  I have never read the books and probably never will, so I can't comment on whether the original material was worthy of praise, but as films, they are poor.I can only assume, by the large amount of hysterical praise both films have received, that people decide before even watching the film, that it is great or that audiences just wish to see special FX.Just like the first movie, there's lots of little sub plots going on, but for what reason, none of the external characters seem to have any purpose or add anything to the story.  The complete mess of a story is virtually non-existent and by the end you realise after all the pompous procrastination you have a very simple battle sequence.  What were the first 2 hours about  ?The biggest crime of this film is that you don't care about any of the characters, nothing is explained really, none of the motivations of any of the characters seem genuine.  In the end, you see that the main cast of characters basically are invincible, so who cares, they're going to win, there is no tension, no edge.The FX, which seems to be the main reason everyone is watching the film, range from very good to very average.  The laughable tree sequences never really look real or believable.   Parts of the battle sequence were comedic, they were so over-the-top.The bottom line is really if people were more honest and looked at this film or it predecessor without pre-judging it as a book conversion, they would see that although there's lots of FX and lot's of things going on, the film is a muddled mess and not really worthy of such high praise.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Tolkein traditionalists please shut the hell up before I beat you!!!,"As a film student and a Tolkein fan I loved this movie and almost everything about it.  Peter Jackson really does understand what he's doing.  For all those who say that this film made too many changes from the book, this is all I have to say to you:  go cry me a river.  It's an adaptation for the love of God, it's not supposed to follow the story exactly.Most of the things that were changed in this film were changed with good reason.  As much as I love Tolkein and his writing, he does tend to meander with his narration to a point that I sometimes wonder if Treebeard is supposed to be the one narrating these books.  Additionally, alot of information in the books is conveyed through dialogue instead of through action and visuals, which is a big no-no in film, and not a great idea in storytelling in general.  Therefore, Peter Jackson created some new ideas that got the same story across only more visually.  Yes, he changed alot, but all of the new stuff still accomplished the same thing as the books and still got the THEMES of the story across.Yes, there were changes that p***ed me off.  Faramir is supposed to be the good brother and that bothered me because it was a complete change of a character, not just of the story.  As far as the whole Arwen thing goes, I'm not happy that they made the decision to blow up her character and all, but I like the way they did it once the decision was made.  It could have been done a lot worse, with her following him into battle and trying to be a lovey dovey, turning this into another Titanic/Pearl Harbor.  At least they stuck to things that actually DID happen, albeit in the appendicies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Gollum Steals the Show,"`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.  The DVD is the wide screen theatrical release edition featuring the theatrical release of the film and an additional disk with some special features.It covers two discs with a running time of almost three hours; `Two Towers' is an incredible sequel to `Fellowship of the Ring.'  For the first time, viewers get to see Gollum in the flesh so to speak.  The animated character acted by Andy Serkis definitely steals the show with the awesome visual affects, dialogue, and contrary emotions this complicated character has. The film continues where `Fellowship' left off but propels the story forward at an amazing pace.We are indulged in the scenery of Rohan and the immense Battle of Helm's Deep but also are exposed to the first appearance of the Ents who are living, sentient tree people.  `Two Towers' also brings the characters of Merry and Pippin to the forefront allowing actors Billy Boyd and Dominic Monahan to shine.  Of course, the story of Frodo and Sam's friendship entwined with the journey to destroy the Ring of Power plays a major role and continues to develop.True fans of the novels and first film will especially enjoy this DVD. Retailing at $17.99 the DVD is a good buy but unfortunately falls short in the special features department.  The special features gems include Sean Astin's short film, `The Long and Short of It' and the trailer for `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.'Although the film is a joy and the special features entertaining people may wish to wait and purchase the extended version of the film instead.  If the extended version of `Fellowship' is any indicator, `Two Towers: Extended Version' will be a DVD everyone must add to their collection.  Having scenes expanded and cut scenes integrated with the film and a plethora of special features will make the extended version more in demand than the theatrical release.While we wait, `Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' theatrical release is a good buy with its fun special features, and DVD-ROM content.  It includes English and Spanish subtitles but no available dubbing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
absolutely wonderful,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is, as expected, an amazing movie. Although, it lacks the pure brilliance of The Fellowship of the Ring, it is no disappointment.  Tolkien fans have criticized Two Towers as being untrue to the book, but I believe it comes as close as is absolutely possible to achieve an enjoyable movie.  Everything about this movie is superb.  The acting was incredible, especially the role of Gollum (played by Andy Serkis), the special effects were magnificent, and the cinematography was stunning. The only complaint that I have is the lack of screen time for some of the main players like Gandalf (Ian McKellan), and Eowyn (Miranda Otto). Otherwise, TTT was a perfect example of a movie masterpiece. This movie is worth seeing for any Tolkien fan, ringnut, or otherwise, and all those who just enjoy watching a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Well...,"I absolutely adored FOTR, even with my impossibly high standards due to my reading the entire series twice.  Jackson not only was faithful to the plot but also created a movie that was enjoyable on its own.  Then, the sequel came to theaters.  After hearing many rumors of how the plot was going to be altered, I admit, I was apprehensive as I sat down in front of that large screen.  My fears were soon justified. Yes, the visuals were stunning.  Yes, the CGI was beyond anything I could have imagined.  Still, the character development was noticeably lacking. Legolas got a little more screen time than in the first movie, but nothing significant, and poor Gimli was reduced to comic relief.Then, Jackson made really unnecessary additions to the plot.  Between Aragorn's repeated fantasies about Arwen, and the incident where he almost perished after falling from a cliff, not to mention the kidnapping of Sam and Frodo by Faramir, who was supposed to be wiser than his late brother, I was wondering if the book had been so boring that they had to create an entirely new plot. There were also numerous plot holes.  Why were Merry and Pippin brought before the newly-revived Gandalf, and then in the next scene it was like it never happened?  Even with elvish abilities, why did it take such a short time for the Lothlorien elves to arrive at Helm's Deep?  For that matter, why were they there in the first place? I realize that artistic license must be taken to bring any book to the big screen, but the unnecessary changes only served to hurt the movie as a movie, book aside.  I'm hoping that the final film of the trilogy will return to the original plot and give the characters the depth they deserve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The all male 'Mardi Gra' of the Ring!,"Ya know when I was 11, I was beaten senseless on a regular basis. Bullied beyond belief! Granted there were mitigating circumstances that lead to my brutalization at the hands of young sadists. I had 'uncool' clothes with patches so big and colorful that I looked like a circus performer. I also only showered if I was forced to and spent most of my days covered in mud. My tastes also haunted me. I loved jet fighters, fantasy novels and dungeons and dragons. People like me know that only one thing can come from LOTR, social exclusion. So its funny, have you noticed how geek-dum is coming to Hollywood?  Quite possibly you have. In fact they have taken William Randolph Hearst's place as the chief inhalers of cocaine and the grand administrators of all Hollywood orgies. Remember 'Eyes Wide Shut?' Those were all comic book and fantasy freaks! Did you notice the masks and the role playing? Kubrick was actually exposing these people! Whats even freakier is that the marketing exec's are right there with them, chanting. This is because these films have so many marketable goods.I could have easily hated this film. Anything with Elves and trees that walk and talk is deserving of contempt. Tolkiens novel is also known for its asexuality and repressed homosexuality. How very English! Yet somehow this film works, like Fellowship did. Yes the characters are very cheesy. The viewer does wonder what Sam and Frodo are doing in the bushes when the camera is not on them, perhaps a secret wedding? There was one in Attack of the Clones! Also Aragorn is such a cardboard cut out of a 'hero' that he belongs in the same Parthenon of hero's as Mr T and Shatners infamous Captain Kirk. Aragorn and Legolas, Sam and Frodo. So many cute couples. Lords of each others rings. Thats why I think they threw in some love interests because otherwise...this isn't a fellowship of the ring but a Mardi Gra of the ring. Many people I talk to complain about the issues of lack of depth in the characters. However as I have said, I don't think it is Jacksons fault. I think these flaws go back to the original text. But hey, 'cocktails anybody?'The feminine angle of the film further bugs me when none of the women engage in physical combat! They are forced to look after the kids! Isn't this the 21st century!?! Where the hell was Xena!?! She would have kicked ass! I mean I can't remember the book very well, but didn't women fight? Listen, if you are heavily outnumbered against a bunch of very hungry looking Urak Hai, you would have your wife, daughters and grandmother fighting with pitchforks! The character Eowyn should have had more to kick. She was straight jacketed by the limited role and wasn't let out to kick ass and chew bubble gum! Everyone wants to see sexy chicks kicking ass or mud wrestling.Basically what Jackson has done is take the best elements of the book and made them cool. Observe Legolas using a shield as a skateboard at the battle of Helms Deep. Jackson has 'Matrixed' LOTR. I am sure if Tolkien saw this, he would roll in his grave, either that or spark up a big fat one. The battle scenes are impressive and they made me think that they must have been extraordinarily difficult to film. Tension is actually built up all through the film and by the time Helms Deep rolls around the viewer is at the edge of their seat. Well at least I was! So many aspects of this film could have been so very cheesy. The Ents could have destroyed the whole film. The Golem could have been the worst thing to hit cinemas since Jar Jar Binks or that guy who played Anakin in Clones...The villains are also well done. They look like the evil dead and speak like Sid Vicious. Orcs and Goblins as punks is a cool idea and harks back to Jacksons classic 'Meet the Feebles.' Also an added bonus is that many stars of a local kiwi soap die in this film. To see 'Lionel' and that other guy die is worth the price of admission alone!The set designs, costumes and special effects are all excellent. The filmakers deserve an oscar for those aspects. Golem becomes the first computer generated psycho, who is actually well acted and could give Anthony Perkins a run for his money. WETA obviously went nuts on this movie. The effects literally transport you to another world. I was amazed as Jackson has taken the images of the book and what I imagined and transposed them onto the screen. This is how Tolkiens invented world looks and is! For achieving this feat alone the Jackson team deserve much credit. This film is also a great tourist brochure for New Zealand and hopefully many d&d freaks will come here and pretend to be little goblins in the Mines of Moria.Overall this is a simple film. But it is still a very enjoyable one. The last two points I would like to mention are,1. Why do Christians watch LOTR and boycott Harry Potter? Two Towers has brutal violence and homicidal maniacs that make Josef Stalin look like Timothy Leary! Potter gets picketed and banned in school libraries! Just because Tolkien is Christian and Potter is not devout, that does not mean Potter is an evil little boy who deflowers virgins. That's not Potter, that's Bill Gates. 2. Why did anyone think any of these films would get Oscars? Other than for special effects. It has Hobbits in it! Did anyone notice that? How can anyone take this film seriously? Although Chicago won oscars and it possessed a singing Richard Gere. Jesus, there is hope for ROTK then.I give this film 7 extremely horny and angry Urak Hais out of 10. Thats a B.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An epic fantasy/action movie. A great achievement.,"Upon first viewing of this movie, i came away from the theatre disappointed. I had just finished re-reading the book and all the characters and events were fresh in my mind. I expected to see on film the exact images i had read on paper. Unfortunately this soured my movie experience and i seemed to spend most of the time looking for all the changes and debating with myself if i agreed or disagreed with them. I guess i fell into the trap and even thou i knew, i did not heed the words 'The Two Towers the Movie - based on the books by Tolkien'.Anyway finally went and watched it again. Sat back, relaxed, cleared my mind and went for a ride. The amazing detail that went into all the scenes is just mind blowing. The battles were fantastic. As an fantasy / action epic this movie gives you everything you would expect and more. The downside is that some of the new characters do not get a chance to develop fully with the exception of Gollum. He was cleverly portrayed and all to entirely believable. There were several scenes that did not feel quite right like at the end with Farimir and Frodo.Overall a highly enjoyable way to past 3 hours.

Great!!!!!!,"I've just returned from an advance screening of The Two Towers here in Brazil and I'm very fulfilled. Everything went fine in the second adaptation of Tolkien's book.The story is fantastic as always ,the characters show anger and want to fight for freedom of the Middle Earth.The best in this picture are the battles that were extremely well realised , the Ents fighting were great and the scenes with Gollum are at the same time funny and scary.The story follows where The Fellowship of the Ring stopped, you see the parallel stories of Frodo and Sam going to destroy the ring and the story of Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli(the most funny in the entire picture) trying to rescue Merry and Pippin.More characters were added to the story.First Eowyn(Miranda Otto) a woman with presence and that has  very good facial expressions,she doesn't act too much. She's there just to cause jealousy in Arwen with a bigger cameo in this picture.Théoden is just excellent and Grima is just fantastic.It is not better than the first but is very good too.It has more effects and more freedom to tell the story cos' now Peter Jackson doesn't have to explain the story of the book,who wants to really understand Tolkien's world must read his books.The 3 hours pass quickly as a thunder(if you enjoy the story!).It can't be analized alone because the movie doesn't have a conclusion so it's a great second part,with a lot of jokes, battles, adventure, beautiful places and a story of hope , fight for a good cause and of course the ring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Hey!  Ease up on Jackson!,"I just wanted to address all those who are raging with Balrog-like fury that Peter Jackson did not follow the books to a ""T"" when he wrote the screenplays for these films (along with Walsh, Boyens, and Sinclair).  Who says he must?  YOU???  I admit I've not read the books yet, but I just finished The Hobbit and am now beginning FOTR.  I'm sure I'll be a bit disappointed also when I find things in the books that are nowhere in the films, but why must we always lash out with anger when a screenplay does not precisely mirror the book it's based on in every way?  Books are nearly always better than their movies.  Why?  Because of the power of your own imagination.  No Hollywood director past, present, or future can compete with that.  Jackson and the entire team down to those guys putting all that chain-mail together link by link (see the bonus stuff on the extended dvd edition of FOTR) are simply doing a sensational job on these films. Special kudos to Howard Shore for composing the hauntingly beautiful music that transports us to Middle-Earth.  I especially like the part in the score where Gandalf and the Balrog plunge into that monstrous cavern just before they hit the water.  In my humble opinion (and I've heard it from others, too), nearly every moment in these films is a work of art.  This is the first time I can truly call a movie a masterpiece.

Boring,"I am one who has never read more than just The Hobbit. I really enjoyed LOTR 1 because it was truly interesting. There was character development, and a rather good introduction that helped you understand what was going on. You cared about the adventurers and felt the emotions they did as they escaped perilous circumstances.However, this movie was extremely boring and hard to follow. Many new characters were introduced, with no character development. I don't even remember the names of the people from the first one, and they continuously rattled off all these new names, when we had no idea who they were, or why we cared about them.We had no idea why Gandalf was so interested to help a King whose subjects were a bunch of poor dirty-faced peasants. There were too many groups of men wandering around, and no attempt was made to establish who they were and why we should hate or love them.I kept waiting for it to get good and it was only mildly entertaining, maybe 20 minutes in 3 hours. They could have easily made it in 2 hours.Gollum was extremely annoying to watch. He reminded me of Dobby in Harry Potter, and was as annoying as Jar Jar Binks. Seeing him beat and chained was also extremely abusive and hard to watch.The main characters were obviously distracted in this movie and did not give as good of performances as they did in the first and as they will in the 3rd.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

But heck, I can still remember how that fantastic universe made me feel like, and I have to say I felt it once again while watching TTT. Outstanding movie! Actually it's one of the best movies I have seen in the last 10 years. Tolkien's fantasy unfolds before your eyes grace to Peter Jackson's marvelous work. Regarding the casting : each and every character got it's rightful interpreter, as if they were born for it. And the Gollum  .. I never thought a cgi would ever make me feel like that. I tried to see harry potter 2 right after TTT and I realised it was such a BIG mistake. I liked the Fellowship of the Ring as well, but the Two Towers is simply outstanding, breathtaking, placing the viewer right in the middle of story, allowing him to be part of everything. THIS is a MOVIE. not just another piece of commercial junk. I'd like to send my deepest respects to everyone involved in the making of LOTR.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
B+... the first one was better,"I know that it's not really appropriate to review The Two Towers as a straight sequel since LOTR is essentially one nine hour long movie. Still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do.I enjoyed Fellowship an immense amount more than this film. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that I've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. It doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before.My biggest problem with TTT is that the splitting of the Fellowship from Part I really hurts the story. Obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film I found interesting were the events that centered around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. I won't even go into the ""other"" two hobbits bc if I had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree I was going to stab somebody. The characters work best together. Their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. This one feels rather flat. A lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. It also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. This one kind of felt like I was looking at the same countryside over and over again.Obviously the climax to TTT is far superior to Fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. That and Gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. But the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. They were one of my favorite parts of Fellowship but here they're just cartoons.Now I haven't read the books since I was a kid, but I know that Fellowship was a much better adaptation than TTT. Everything they needed was right there in the pages. Why did they feel the need to change so much? I don't need it to be down to the last detail. Hell, I like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. A level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. THere were only a few moments of TTT that left me with a similar reaction.Don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies I've seen. It's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. Bottom line- Great flick, but not the same rush as Part I.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Not as good as the first but...,"Still a masterpiece. Though RotK will probably end up being my favorite. This movie just screams epic.I guess I didn't like it as much as FotR because it was missing some quiet scenes that FotR had. Some breaks in the pacing in order to give a rest to the characters and viewer. But then again, the pacing of breaking the story up into three parts really helped the narrarative and gave more consistent flow to the movie that was missing in FotR and made it seem a tad long.Speaking of which, it may be criticised for being long...but what great masterpiece isn't long? The more time you have, the more stuff you can fit in, and if the stuff you're fitting in is good...there's no problemo. Heck, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption and other top 10 IMDB movies are as long if not LONGER then FotR and TTT. I really just don't get complaints about length, because what it's really all about is consitency in the pacing. TTT went by FAST for me, while some movies like say Little Buddah are just 2 hours...yet that felt like an eternity.Anyways, enough of my ranting. Great movie. Won't win best picture this year though (Chicago has the oscars wrapped up, don't ask me why, I'll never know). Though, RotK will most definitely win next year, as if to honor the series as a whole, and it'd definitly deserve it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Simply another masterpiece from Mr. Jackson,"Somehow he did it again! I saw the movie this morning, and I would just call it an outstanding movie.The effects, the actors, the orcs, the animals (oliphants, Ents etc.)... and much much more, has made this movie one of the best movies this year.All the way from the start of the movie with Frodo's dream about:Balrog and Gandalf (which was a terrific start of the movie)Battle of Helms Deep! (a battle between 10k orcs and an rather unknown number of men and elves... Must be the best scene in this movie!!!) - The Ents battle at Isengard! ...all contributed to the fact that the whole audience were at the edge of the seat most of the scene... Although there are a couple of scenes with Aragorns love, which some dislike, although I can't see why!?I read the book myself, and I must say that Jackson ""twisted"" some scenes... some more than others, but all together it didn't mean anything much anyway. He had to cut something away anyway, since the movie can't be about 4-5 hours. The ending cut was also acceptable, since it leaves the audience to wait this *..* year (or reading the 2. part) to find out, who ""she"" is (yes: the 2. part, Jackson pushed the scene into the 3. part.. he had some reasons for this).I could go on and on, but I wont...

Wonderful movie,"While some ""reviewers"" revel in their power-tripping anonymity of the internet, all I have to say that TTT is a more than worthy second part to this so-far amazing trilogy. Having read the trilogy many times over the last 25 years, I appreciate both the written word of Tokien, and the screen interpretation/adaptation of Jackson. As many comments indicated, Jackson preserved the spirit of LOTR, as he necessarily adapted the story for the screen. Gollum/Smeagal is an amazing achievement in CGI, and Serkis's portrayal deserves to be recognized. The ""romance"" of LOTR is in the epic itself, as the characters are but pawns being pushed and pulled by the circumstances and dynamics of the greater story. LOTR is not a Harry Potter story that is so simple that it can be adapted word for word onto the screen. There needed to be some manipulation to fit the story onto the screen, and in 3 parts that made sense visually, and in its continuity of the story. All told, a wonderful job by Jackson and his team.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Two Towers (2002),"This sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring is everything a sequel should be. It maintains the charm and whimsical nature of the first film but builds on it in all the right ways.As with the first film, the casting is exceptional. The new actors for characters such as Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto) are excellent.The Two Towers builds on the stunning visuals of the the first with new lands such as Rohan and new CGI (I'm referencing Gollum mostly). And the film's score adds new themes while keeping the iconic soundtrack from the previous film.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the absolutely incredible battle at Helm's Deep. It's one of the most iconic and intense fantasy movie battles I've ever seen, and no matter how many times I watch it, it's still just as thrilling as the first time.The film is the perfect stepping stone between the first and third films in the trilogy, but it's much more than just an in-between placeholder. It's an exceptionally well-crafted film all on its own.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Ring's Second Foray Suffers From an Overabundance of Minutiae,"Peter Jackson and friends apply their epic vision to LotR's second chapter, although this material doesn't sparkle in quite as many ways. While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
What a trash!,"This is undoubtedly one of THE worst films ever made. I would think Peter Jackson can't make films if I didn't see ""Braindead"" and ""Bad Taste"". Those films had low budget but they was made very well: dynamic, funnily, with good concept. There is different in cause of LOTR. All ""LOTR"" trilogy is bad but ""Two Towers"" is especially crappy. Cinematography is average, music is horrible (one lame theme in 2,5 h film) and absolutely nothing happens. And when finally Jackson starts with action scenes, he makes them possible worst. Battle scene is chaotic and stupidly edited; I didn't see what going on, where are good people and where are bad. Watching this film is total waste time and money. If you want good fantasy, watch better ""Willow"", ""Neverending Story"", ""Excalibur"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"". If you want good battle scene, watch ""Alexander Nevsky"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Breaveheart"" or ""Joan of Arc"". 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
My pick as the superior episode of this trilogy,"Of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, adapted from the famous book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien (which I haven't read), this second installment is my favourite. It should have been the one to sweep the Academy Awards, as the last chapter in the trilogy did. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I get the feeling that the Academy jumped on the juggernaut/band-wagon for the final episode.The main reason I liked this movie so much was for the engrossing war scenes. It's one of the few films where there are countless thousands of soldiers fighting yet is nevertheless fascinating. Notable failures in this respect include one of the early Star Wars prequels (hey, apart from the third installment of that prequel trilogy, they're all pretty forgettable). In that movie, countless thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other was just mind-numbingly boring. As was the giant brawl between hundreds of apes in one of the sequels to the ""Planet of the Apes"" series.In ""Two Towers"" you get one things those failures didn't have...military strategy. Tension is built up by seeing military tactics and equipment deployed. It's just not one humongous but mindless fight scene. The best example of that is when one of the castles is besieged and attacked.In any case, this if a fine trilogy. Watch it from start to finish. It's just the second chapter that I'd give 5 stars too, though.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Masterpiece? Oh yes, I?ve no doubt about that!","The second part of the epic The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is simply the most spectacular film I have EVER seen. This movie overpasses its previous part The Fellowship of the Ring and delivers the most brilliant piece of cinema to ever hit the big screen. From the landscape to the characters, this movie is simply stunning in its own time.The characters fit right into the story through their emotional and physical features. Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, the most amazing CGI creation to be put on screen. He is so real and blends into the environment so seamlessly that after a while the audience forgets that he is animation and accept him as a real, physical character that shows no signs of falsity. The audience feels a real fear of the Uruk-Hai that have captured Merry and Pippin. The Ents are also quite impressive. These beings are believable and very true to what I visualized in Tolkien?s words. The Wargs, the winged Nazgûl, the oliphaunts and the Balrog, now viewed more in detail, are extremely breathtaking. The new characters add to the story and progress it faster than before.The music of the film is also perfect. From the opening of the Misty Mountains to the Battle of Helm?s Deep and the storming of Isengard, Howard Shore unquestionably deserves another Oscar for his spectacular work. The music of any film is vital to its feel and images portrayed in screen. It simply blew me away. The tone was just right and the volume as well. I couldn?t find any faults in the score, which has never happened to me except when I watched the Fellowship of the Ring.The storming of Isengard and the Battle of Helm's Deep is what really took my breath away. These had got to be the biggest and best executed battles I have EVER seen! I would rather go see the movie again for this!To sum it all up, don't miss this movie at any cost! Except, maybe if you haven't seen the first one, then see it NOW and then see TTT. Otherwise the plot and/or characters might be a bit confusing for you.

I don't get it.,"Why the heck is everybody jocking this movie?  Unless you're a diehard LOTR fan , I really don't see what all the big hoopla is for.  Granted, the visuals in LOTR: TFOTR was unlike anything anyone had seen before and it was worth double the price of admission just for that, but honestly, I just couldn't get interested in the story.  I do have to say that Christopher Lee's presence was awe-inspiring and the sets were breath-taking.  I felt that ,visually, I was taken to levels I had never even imagined.But I felt that this installment didn't offer anything new.  It seemed to only draw out TFOTR's worst flaw--endless exposition.  This installment looked to me like a 3-hour montage.  I didn't find anything particularly memorable, except the excellent CGI of the creepy-crawly dude (sorry, I didn't quite catch the name).  It wasn't that there was bad acting--it was more like there was no acting, or rather, no opportunity to act.  It seemed like everyone was either just doing a lot of staring ""out somewhere"" because the odds were so insurmountable, or that they were scuffling about in groups of twos or threes headed ""just over the other side of that tall hill or mountain"".Kudos to the LOTR movies for staying faithful to the books, but as a non-fan, (yes, I know, I am probably blaspheming) it all seemed rather tedious and silly.  I thought it was bad enough that TFOTR ended with the Fellowship being chased by a crap-load of Orks (sp?) who are easier to kill than the buffalo in a particularly memorable episode of the Simpsons.   I mean, jeez!  Is this the world's most inefficient army or what?!?!  These Orks are easier to kill than the ""middle-eastern"" armies in an early Schwartzeneggar or Stallone movie.  There is just no element of danger. Everything seems just to gosh-darned easy.   TTT ends with a good-guy army of 300 (and eventually some elves) taking on 10,000 Orks.

I've changed my mind!,"I saw Two Towers for the second time today and have totally changed my mind about the movie. After the first viewing I found the changes from the book incredibly jarring and unnecessary. I rated it 5/10. As one who has read the books about seven times over a twenty year period the first viewing was like watching a very expensive train crash. It seemed distant and unfamiliar, perhaps because I had watched the FOTR DVDs too many times. However, as I knew what changes to expect the second time I could enjoy the movie for what it was and it was fantastic. Sure the  changes were many but the essence of the book was there. It had the right feel. If you are a purist and you hated the movie do yourself a favor. Open your mind and see it again. Don't fight it, just let it flow. Don't force yourself to like it.

Absolutely outstanding!,"Absolutely outstanding!When people ask me about this movie, one thing that crops up in 9 out of 10 conversations is the question `Is the movie true to the book?'To me this is an unfair question.If you had asked Peter Jackson to make a movie that was beyond all doubt true' to the book, you would have a sequence of 9 hour movies instead of 3 hour movies. Also, the movies would be disjointed, dull and unwatchable. Why, you ask? Because movies require a unique combination of flow and pace that books are not constrained to, and transferring a story to film without adapting it for the job would be a big mistake. Book and film are not compatible media. What I often say is that the movie is true to the SPIRIT of the book. I get the same feeling watching the film that I got when I'd sit up late at night, reading under lamp-light because I could not tear myself away from the story. The characters on screen look to me as though secret agents from Weta Workshops mind reading department have tiptoed in to my bedroom at night and plucked the images from my mind  and I'm not the only person who says that  all the hardcore Tolkien fans I have shared this thought with have agreed with great enthusiasm.After watching this film, I feel justified in my past comments that PJ is a genius. I have been a fan since he produced the cult classic BAD TASTE in 1987, an alien/zombie movie that relied on vision and talent as opposed to a big budget or any real kind of budget at all, to be honest. The movie was improvised from start to finish (that's right, made up as they went along), and only received any kind of funding (beyond that which came from PJ's own pocket) just before its completion.Jackson is a creative genius, and deserves every word of praise he gets.

Have you or have you not read the book?,"Hello, all!I am in the FORTUNATE position to not only have READ all three LOTR books several times, and seen The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) NUMEROUS times AND The Two Towers (TTT) a few already, but ALSO loving both the books and the films. Listed below are a few ideas I think a few of you critics need to think about.1) Cliche as it is to say, if LOTR was turned into a film COMPLETELY after the books, it would have been about 36 hours long, if not more. Impossible. Some things need to be cut.2) LOTR are the best books I've ever read. THEY ARE STILL BORING AT TIMES. You cannot tell me that you want to see Sam and Frodo walking through Emyn Muil and the Dead Marshes for as long as they do in TTT? In that case you should consider seeing a shrink! I haven't seen anyone complaining about all the songs and poems being cut out in the films.3) The films need to be presented in a way that not only introduces LOTR to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the books, but to create a justifiable storyline and a visualization of LOTR to its readers and fans. That's a difficult job. LOTR: the films are NOT for its fans and readers only, NOR is it for the people who haven't heard of LOTR/read the books. It's for EVERYONE! And in terms of that, it could properly not have done better.OK, now I would like to say that yeah, as a fan of the books I have my pointers to the films, Why wasn't Tom Bombadil in the films? Why does Aragorn almost die in TTT? Why doesn't Sam look into the mirror of Galadriel? Why does Boromir die in the first film and not the second? Where is Shelob? But the point is, NOBODY CARES!!! We know all this, cause we've read the books. It's what we call INTERESTING/ADDITIONAL information. The people who haven't, DON'T CARE, they'll never know! So in this way, everybody is happy. But it does create a loophole for another question I think is more interesting: Why all the made-up stuff? Well, it is simply necessary to gain as large an audience as possible, and as stated above, THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE FILM, to be for EVERYBODY!I am sick of people saying that Peter Jackson is a bad director. The shots are fantastic, the actors (which have been directed) are doing a REALLY good job, the tenseness, which of course is different from person to person, is higher than in many other films, and the film has a feeling of art about it.I am sick of people who have read the books and complain about the film being crap and not doing the books justice, when they themselves can't be bothered to spell characters' names correctly. Go be miserable on your own while we others have fun. It's your loss.I am sick of people complaining about holes in the story when they simply haven't understood something. Gandalf becomes the white because he earned that title by killing the Balrog of Morgoth. DO SOME SIMPLE, FUN, EASY RESEARCH, read the books, or even easier: Listen to what the characters in the film are saying. Please don't put your stupidity on display like that.Guys and Gals, in the end, if you read the books, and then see the films, you'll know everything, you should be able to appreciate everything, and if you only want to see the films, that's fine, you're in for a long movie which should entertain you till the end. If you only want to read the books, that's fine as well, but more than anything, Peter Jackson's films are SUPPORTING Tolkien's work, not destroying it, not building on it, not overshadowing it. Supporting it. Giving it a new glance. And that, they do magnificently well.If you like the films, I feel sorry for you, for not being able to be done to, but  I also respect your opinion, just make sense. And make sure that it makes sense to you, and that you're not just trying to be different, or trying to be critical. The LOTR films are too good to be spoiled in that way.The books are always going to be the ultimate work of Tolkien, and they will always be the best, if you need them to be. The films still complement the books, in the same way that the books complement the film.Remember that your vision may not be the same as Peter Jackson's. That does not mean that either of you are wrong. It just means he had the money and power to show everyone his ideas, but that shouldn't matter to you. Keep yours, and make them what they are to you, but accept Jackson's as another vision, as fit to exist as yours.I, for one, cannot wait until The Return Of The King (ROTK), when the trilogy will be completed, and in the meantime, I'll have fun reading Tolkien's masterpieces (while skipping over the boring bits, like we all do ;o).Enjoy the art.Monroe",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Two Towers is just Too Good,"It may sound odd to refer to ""the Two Towers"" as underrated, but it is all relatively speaking. For some reason, of the original trilogy, this one gets the least amount of love. As of writing this review it is the lowest ranked on IMDb ( #14 on the top 250, where the other two are in the top 10). It won only 2 Oscars, where the first won 4 and the final won 11. So, I'm not sure whether this is an unpopular opinion or not, but this is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie.To a certain degree, I can understand why it's comparatively ignored. The first one begins the grand adventure, the third concludes it in grand fashion and the second just continues the story set up in the first. But this one introduces so many of the staples that would come to be synonymous with the series. This is where Andy Serkis as Golem really gets to shine. Characters like Wormtail, TreeBeard, Eowyn and Carl Urban are introduced. The action in this one is the best of the trilogy. The battle for Helm's Deep is thrilling, creative, huge and epic. The battle might go for about 40 minutes of runtime, but it never feels repetitive. You're rooting for these characters to succeed against all odds.Unlike the first movie, since the fellowship has broken up into smaller groups, the movie is able to cut between each of their side-adventures. There is not a side adventure in the movie that I don't find engaging, they are all interesting to watch. These multiple stories also help with the pacing of the movie. It feels like Peter Jackson was making an extra effort to have the story move at a quicker pace. The movie is a minute longer than the first, but it feels much shorter and easier to watch.It makes sense, where the first movie takes time to get started and the third takes time to wrap up, the second can spend all its time in the adventure.

outstanding and brilliant!!,"Great story, photography, acting, etc. This is the greatest film of the year 2002! I think director Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with ""LOTR: The two towers"" there's a particular care for details in every one of the scenes and in the beautiful landscapes portrayed in it that would definitely make this film unforgettable.

A Magnificent Motion Picture,"The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers is a wonderful film. It is different from the The Lord of the Rings:Fellowship of the Ring in a sense because it is darker and more threatening.

"Despite the criticism, is highly deserving of praise","Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid.  Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time.  Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care.  The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.A number of viewers have commented on how ""different"" the movie is from the book.  However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally.  A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well.  How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book.  Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once?  Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence.  Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments.  I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies.  They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Great movie - shame about the changes,"I liked the movie as it was, and I'd give is a pretty solid 8/10.  It woould have been 10/10 if PJ had just left bits out of the book that were unnecesary, but the addition of made up stuff and tons of changes detracted from it overall.It has a great many changes to the story and for the life of me, I can't really understand why.  As others have pointed out, if you take out the 45 minutes of made up stuff, you could have put back all the other stuff he left out.But more importantly it seemed there were changes for changes sake.  I kept getting anoyed that the introduced material was making a long movie even longer.  I didn't go along to see this film, I was expecting Tolkien's story.Tolkien's story was at the top of the list of books of the century.  I really think that qualifies it as having a pretty good story line to begin with.  Why the tampering.Overall it was an enjoyable romp, without the classic appeal that Fellowship had.  Changes there were made to simplify the storyline, not alter it materially.  The altering of the characters though is what hurts the most. Their motivations and actions have materialy changed, and not, unfortunately, for the better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Two Towers,"Has it really been a year. With ""The Two Towers"" it certainly doesn't look so, because I was immediately thrown back into this epic adventure and even quicker reminded of its brilliance. The second installment of the Tolkien novel is shere perfection when it comes to visual and sound style, be it the special effects(which are basically flawless and have come a long way since ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"") or the beautiful photography or the amazing score and sound effects. But what it doesn't have is the essence of the first one, the atmosphere which was just too strong and great to last forever. Instead the movie relies on its final battle scenes (during which I often found my mouth wide open)and forgets about the fellowship. Aragorn is given new depth as he has much mores screen time and becomes the hero of this movie and Frodo discovers a new friend, Gollum, shere brilliance of computer animation. Despite the lack of ""fellowship"" from the first one ""The Two Towers"" provides for an unprecedented visual feast which, after ""The Matrix"" or ""Minority Report"" speaks for itself.It's is probably going to be the weakest of the Ring Trilogy because let;s face it; Peter Jackson has spoiled us rotten, but it's still damn near perfection. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Highly disappointing.  A definite 3!,"Whereas TFOTR was inqeniously constructed and executed by the filmmakers, TTT seemed to be a more fitting vehicle for Schwarzenegger, Willis or Van Damme.  The failure of the creative team to define a dramatic conflict highlights their true goal to lens a Hollywood Actioner.  Having drifted from the source material, the choices made by the filmmakers seemed puzzling.  This adaptation contained a heavy dose of screenwriting cliches in place of character development.  Excessive hand held camera footage and lead actors failing to constrain themselves, possibly due to lack of direction(?), and falling into overacting was confounding to this viewer",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I love this too,"well, this movie is really good too. darker but great. this one have more surprises than the first, but I've seen it twice (at the cinema) and i liked it both times. I cried more the first time but... I'm a little sensitive sometimes, specially at cinemas... (laugh). well, more people are introduced in this film, but they weren't hard to learn, at least I didn't think so. some people asked: which of the films are best? I prefer to see them as one movie, but three chapters... cause they hold together, right? I won't choose one movie, I see them as one history and it will remain like that even when I've seen the last. To see this film, I suggest that you see number one first, cause it will be much easier to understand... this is a great story from the beginning, and probably to the end also.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Undecided,"Parts of this movie were great, others were annoying and I disliked the deviations from the book.  Faramir was all wrong, and taking Frodo to Osgiliath unnecessary.  I didn't see the point in Aragorn falling off the cliff.  These things ruined it for me somewhat.  Gimli taking over the role of the jester was also a little disappointing - Pippin suited that better. If you haven't read the book, you'll love it.  Otherwise the changes could really irk you, as they did me.  I'm hoping I'll enjoy it better on subsequent viewings, once I get used to the 'butchering'.  I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first.  I'd give it, however, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
A better than fellowship of the ring *,"If you are an avid fan of LOTR books and you understood em', than you'll love this movie. I personally thought that this movie was better in the sense that it had more fierce battle scenes, new characters,etc. Most people say Fellowship was better because it had a greater variety of places.True, but this is how the book was meant to be, no more lenghty explanations or introduction. I can see how people who've never read the books not enjoy as much as I did maybe because the film makers did not give cleaner or further explanations as to what was going on.With me, I sat down and watched it and knew exactly what was going on.My brother, who'd never read the books, didn't understand everything like smeagol's past, about saruman, ents, etc.So my advice, read the books first ( of course they are much better than the movies, which is saying a crap lot about how good these books are ) and then watch the movie. Or if you've already watched, read the books, and watch it again and then you'll understand better what's going on and enjoy it a ton more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

It got to the end of the movie and I just couldn't believe that I had been sitting for 3 hours.I can't wait to see this movie again. And then to see ROTK in about 12 months time.I'd read about the changes made to the story before seeing the movie so I was prepared to watch the movie and not the book as I did last year when I saw FOTR for the first time.Personally I can see the sense in pretty much every change that Peter Jackson made to the story. From a movie perspective the changes were largely necessary.Bring on ROTK!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Maginificient in every aspect,"After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring at the end of last year and feeling quite content to rank it as one of the best films I have ever seen, I was most intrigued to see what Peter Jackson and his ensemble would serve up this year.  Although the Kiwi has taken on a pure labor of love, it is clear to see from the films and the supplementary material on the special edition Fellowship DVD that his enthusiasm and love for such a great story flowed into his cast and crew and have allowed them so far, to produce what I personally believe are two pieces of cinematic history.The Two Towers picks up where Fellowship left off and does not dissappoint, in fact it only adds to the magic contained in the first film.  Although there is a slightly darker air than the first (and rightly so, as the shadow further advances from the East), there is still humour, and plentiful emotion as the main protagonists of the splintered fellowship continue on their respective quests, with the addition of further memorable characters. The one incredible example being that of Gollum.  Note - if any Star Wars fans (I was one of them prior to Episode I and II) wish to see a believable CGI character, please go along to see this performance!Coupled with this, we are also treated to much more wonderfully choreographed and action on an epic scale.  No more needs to be said than that, except I refuse to believe that anyone could see the Helm's Deep sequence (the word epic just about covers this!) and not be impressed!All performances are once again heartfelt and impressive, Howard Shore's score is once again a wonderful key into unlocking the most emotional and inspirational parts of the film, and lest we forget, the star of the first film, the New Zealand landscape, is once again present in even greater splendour this time around!I can't think of a bad thing to say except this...I have to wait a whole year now before I see Return of the King!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Taking A Deeper Journey,"{This review is for the 179-minute theatrical release.}The quickest way to burn three hours from your life is to sit down and watch this crisply structured, breathlessly paced, yet thematically rich dose of cinematic CPR. You will come out feeling refreshed, revived, and wondering where the time went.It's a bleak time for the denizens of Middle Earth, the evil powers of Sauron and Saruman forming a union against the beleaguered forces of good. While a small army of men from Rohan make a forlorn stand in a mountainside redoubt, two hobbits, joined by a nasty critter who answers to the name of Gollum (Andy Serkis), make a lonely, harrowing trek into the heart of enemy territory, on a mission that seems unlikely to end in anything less than their doom.""Do not trust to hope,"" is a characteristic piece of advice offered to another party of good adventurers. ""It has forsaken these lands.""Director Peter Jackson reshapes the problematically structured middle novel in J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy into a stirring centerpiece for his own epic cinematic adaption. Each shot has almost a painterly quality, a classical shape and texture that informs every frame.While Tolkien's source novel is the weakest of the saga, Jackson's film is the best of his own trilogy. Instead of long narratives, Jackson and his editors, Michael Horton and Jabez Olssen, present a triple-track approach where something is always happening, often very fast.At the same time, the script by Jackson and his writing team plumbs story elements for drama and tension that Tolkien at times barely limned. Gollum's story is the film's emotional arc, as we see in him a tortured soul not quite beyond the reach of redemption, however dangerous. His mad lust for the Ring of Power is not only dramatic in itself, but ominous for the lead character, Frodo (Elijah Wood) who now carries the Ring and sees in Gollum the potential for similar madness in himself.""The Two Towers"" does an effective job reintroducing the characters, good and evil, we met in ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" and investing all of them with qualities of deeper interest and humor to extend our investment in them. At the same time, ""The Two Towers"" broadens things with a slew of new characters, most especially Gollum (Serkis is never seen on screen, but he was both a voice-actor and a motion- capture artist on screen) and Faramir (David Wenham), brother of troubled Boromir seen in ""Fellowship."" Both Gollum and Faramir find themselves tested by the very same thing, and their different reactions help drive the rest of the film.There are minor weaknesses in this film, most particularly a needless detour where the brave human leader Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) temporarily goes missing. Some lengthy exposition elements featuring my least favorite characters, the Elves, grate on my nerves. But the spectacle and storycraft overall are brilliant in the main, and even better, become more enjoyable when the film is watched again.""The Two Towers"" is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride that keep you as mentally stimulated as it does visually ravished.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Not only do I love the books, I also love the actors who portray the characters so well.  It is without a doubt better than the first.  Although there aren't many happy moments in The Two Towers, the adventures of the characters are the main part of the story.  I give the Two Towers an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

More great images - more clumsy storytelling,"Review applies to both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are visually impressive films having wonderful sets, costumes and make-up.  The computer-generated effects are generally effective and occasionally wonderful, even awe-inspiring. However both films are boring.  The vivid and well-realised images on the screen are not sufficient compensation for the very poor story-telling.Director Peter Jackson can justly take credit for the feat of organising and being responsible for an apparently huge undertaking in getting support for three ambitious, expensive films and then making them on an apparently epic scale.  The art direction is wonderful and he has gathered some great teams about him that convincingly bring Tolkien's Middle-Earth to the cinema. Not least, it must be a feat to be entrusted with millions of dollars and keep all those film executives at bay whilst one gets on with the job.That said, the storytelling is inept.  Jackson shares the writing credits with two others and they take great liberties with Tolkien's story. This might have been all right if they had made the story better or more suitable for the medium of film, but the changes are not very good and they are badly handled.  The screenplay also misses much of the wit and interest of Tolkien's work.  It also lacks the drama and tension.Even when considered as a film independent of Tolkien's tale, the story-telling is very poor.  This is a director who relies on vivid imagery and hasn't much of an idea as to what makes a decent script.  Many of the exchanges between characters are extremely limited; there is nothing deep or profound.  Every now and again some of Tolkien's dialogue appears (easy to spot because they're the good bits) but Jackson and Co. appear to have cut and pasted such sections into their script without much care as to whether it comfortably fits into the stuff they have written.Perhaps it is no accident therefore that the film has not attracted true film stars to play the major roles.  This is a B-movie cast to go with a B-movie script.  That's not to say that some of the actors aren't good: Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Sean Bean give good performances, but one suspects that with a decent script the film series would have been attractive to star actors to take the lead roles.  Sometimes the casting of virtually unknown actors can pay off but I'm afraid that they aren't really given much to work on and thus little chance to show what they can do.I don't think that Peter Jackson's direction helps his actors much.  This is not a director with a great range, and things such as subtlety lie outside it.  Nor do I think he rates the intelligence and comprehension of the audience very highly.  Everything is thrust into the viewer's face. Nothing lurks menacingly just out of sight, nothing is merely glimpsed or suspected, no tension is built up: bad things or monsters just appear - ""bam!"".  Slow motion, backlighting (at night and in the wilderness) and extreme close-ups are laid on thickly.  The lighting is artificial and the editing is very careless and disjointed.(This is an occasion where the medium of DVD may really be useful.  The good thing about DVD is that people will be able to choose the sections they wish to watch and will thus be able to oogle over the wonderful set-pieces as often as they like without having to suffer the tedious parts.)I shouldn't really be bothered going on about all this as it's just a film, but I think that undeserved kudos and plaudits are being heaped on Peter Jackson (not to mention tons of money).  What is more, studios will may be further encouraged to think that a decent script is unimportant for a good film.The fact that quite a number of people rave about this film means that the money and effort used to make it were not entirely wasted.  (I suspect that they were so impressed by the imagery and the grand theme that they have been able to overlook the films' serious shortcomings.)  The sad thing is that a first-rate production was let down by a bad script and clumsy direction.  It deserved better.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Breath-taking!,"When I saw the first 'Lord of the Rings' (Fellowship of the Ring) film last year I was bowled over by the incredible visuals and set-pieces.Having just seen this new one, I can say that the visuals in this are even better and the action in simply breath-taking. The film builds slowly throughout its massive 3 hour running time to a gorgeous, huge battle at Helms Deep, pitting 10,000 Orkai (I think that's the correct spelling?) against hundreds of men and elves.The action in this film is well paced and the characters are developed further. On the big screen the whole film is a true spectacle to behold and one of the best films I've seen in a very long time.It's simple - if you haven't seen this yet, then go see it today on the big screen, you'll love it!10 out of 10 ..

A Towering Achievement,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers isn't a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, it's a direct continuation and it's every bit as brilliant, if not more.

Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue to Mordor, being guided by Gollum, the first truly believable computer animated character. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) make new allies and launch an assault on Isengard. The Two Towers features a breathtaking atmosphere, amazing character development, and one of the most visually outstanding battle sequences in motion picture history. A must see.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
DEFINITELY A SEQUEL,"What a great sequel that's all I can say that this is definitely a sequel. This is definitely a movie that you have to watch the first one to know what's going on in the second one and I think the book was like that too so throughout the movie, the first act started out with a clear mission from the first movie to get to Modor, Also, there's another plot line with aragorn and the rest of his friends that might play out in the third movie as well but the main thing that I really like about this movie is the third act usually third acts begin with a little slow burn and then build up to a final battle this third act in my opinion starts with the battle and finishes with the battle. And this movie is called the two towers which I can't really see the other tower but that's fine because I was fully entertained. This definitely works as a sequel. Usually I like movies to work as their own movie and a sequel but this definitely works as a sequel that you have to watch the first one to get this. The best character in this movie is a Aragorn and gollum and gollum steals to sing for me because he's so twisted and crazy that is very entertaining overall battles are straight up entertaining, the characters were the same as the first one and overall I can't wait for the finale not better than the first one in my opinion but really damn good 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"I liked it! No, I didn't! Yes, I liked it! No, it was bad! ...","I'm one of those guys who read the LOTR around once a year and who compare the movies a lot to the book. I had some issues with the script of FOTR, but the DVD version satisfied me and cleared a lot of things up. I can safely say, that part one is nearly without blemish for me.Well, TTT had even more plot holes and deviations from the book, which didn't work. However it also had some great elements, which made it more than memorable.The whole Rohan-story didn't succeed in enthralling me. The audience is thrown into it without too much explanation and I never started to care for Theodred, Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer. Some scenes and lines were quite hollow and even embarassing. All those suffering Rohan women and children didn't help either.And there are too many things left unexplained about the Ents. You never quite understand why they should go to war or why they shouldn't. Hopefully the DVD version will clear something up here.So much for the bad things, now for the good ones, and there were a lot of them: The Frodo-Sam-Gollum part worked perfectly. To view Frodo falling to the ring - great. And what can I say about Gollum, which hasn't already been said? It's the greatest CGI-character ever, by a long shot. After his introduction you have already forgotten, that he is not for real. I even liked the Faramir-character and don't think, that he is so different from the book. He has his preferences and the well-being of Sam and Frodo is not one of the first on his list.I also liked the intercut Elven scenes, even though they led to a conclusion I didn't like: The Elvish help at Helm's Deep. It's a 'feel good'-element, which should not have been necessary.At last there is one single scene, which will make this movie forever special in my mind: The charge of the Rohirrim down the hill. This is pure cinematography and potentially the most moving scene I have ever seen. The makers of the movie worked wonders with scope, lights, camera movement and the music in this part. Just remembering it gives me the shivers.The cast and the score were a notch down from FOTR, but still good. Wood and Astin got better, while I was a tad disappointed with MacKellen. Rhys-Davies was great - unfortunateley the role he was given (humorous sidekick) was not.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This entire three hour movie can be summed up in one word: AMAZING,"And, by amazing I don't mean 'mostly good'.  By amazing I don't mean 'could've been better'.  By amazing I mean the template for perfection. Peter Jackson's second act of the trilogy, ""The Two Towers"" is not only three hours of eye candy, but three hour of ear candy, heart candy and any other kind of candy.  As everyone knows, the second act is always the hardest, but Peter Jackson seemed to make this great film with ease.The story, continuing from ""Fellowship"", focuses on two plotlines: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis), who leads them to Mordor and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) helping the Rohirrihm.  The writers did very well blending these two stories together, just like Tolkien did.The star of this movie is without a doubt Gollum.  Even though he is a complete CGI character, he turns out to be the opposite of Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't comic relief, he isn't there for cute laughs, he is the same, tormented character as he was in the book.Of course, the action in this movie ranks up with ""Braveheart"" for great Medieval warfare.  As most know, the last forty-five minutes of this movie is one long war scene.  Despite being so long, it never becomes boring or cheesy, and you're never getting restless in your seat.  In fact, you're on the edge of it the whole twenty-seven thousand seconds of it.This film still has faults though, as all do, but they are miniscule compared to the great brilliance.  There are but two things in ""Towers"" that bugged me: the slightly overdone love story between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Gimli's (John Rhys-Davies) delve into comedy.  I'm not saying that Gimli wasn't funny, I'm saying that he wasn't as dramatic as he should have been.As I said, the faults are tiny compared to the brilliance.  ""The Two Towers"" never even comes close to disappointing, 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Quite a ride, but not for everyone.","The Two Towers will thrill you and drain you, don't plan on doing anthing too ambitious afterword. The computer animated Gollum, Ents and hordes of orcs are perfect or near to it. Don't look for a beginning or an end as it is the middle installment of a trilogy but it moves you there so intensely from the opening flicker you barely notice that this is the first major sequel with no reprise of the first installment to bring you up to date. Peter Jackson and crew take a few liberties with Tolkien's masterpiece but none too objectionable for all but the most extreme purists, and there are some welcome surprises as well.The Two Towers is dark and bloody with one of the longest battle scenes since The Longest Day with little relief from the intensity. Not for children and for those looking for women with large heroic roles.  The first and third installments have more of that. The three hours fly by, though be sure not to drink too many fluids or you may have to get up and miss much in the middle!Another masterpiece of film magic, I can't believe I have to wait another year for the last installment!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Wow, what a great film!","My one and only disappointment of this film is the absence of new music.  My friends have argued that this movie is just the second installment of a longer series, and I agree, but I felt that the first movie's music was new and exciting.  The music in ""Fellowship"" enhanced the experience, drawing out strong emotions in the audience.  I feel the music was ""recycled"" in The Two Towers, and it did not have the same effect.Other than that, I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job, again.  Go see it.  Even if you're not a Tolkien fan, the experience alone is astounding! The CGI is even impressive, and most films cannot quite grasp the importance of good CGI.  Take, for example, the newest Bond flick - the CGI was laughable, and took something from the movie.  Jackson, however, employs an incredible use of technology and the movie flows quite smoothly.I have nothing else to say.  The movie speaks for itself.I give ""The Two Towers"" a solid 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Continuation of the famous saga of Middle-Earth,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" continues the fascinating story of the struggle between good and evil in the world of Middle-earth. The Brotherhood has disbanded, but the mission to destroy the Ring continues. Frodo and Sam lead their dangerous journey to Mordor, enlisting unexpected help, while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli ally with the people of Rohan to counter the looming threat of Sauron. This is a story filled with heroism, betrayal and, of course, epic battles.Each actor in ""Two Towers"" brought incredible depth and emotionality to the film. Elijah Wood continues to superbly convey Frodo's inner struggle, his fears and desire to cope with an impossible task. Viggo Mortensen once again brilliantly played the role of Aragorn, a hero who gradually accepts his destiny. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is admired for his wisdom and charisma, especially in a new guise. But special attention should be paid to Andy Serkis, whose work on Gollum was a real breakthrough. Gollum is a combination of amazing acting and revolutionary computer graphics at the time of his release, making him one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema.Andy Serkis has done a herculean job reviving the complex character of a hero torn between good and evil. Computer graphics created by Weta Digital Studio have brought it to perfection, making Gollum frighteningly real. His movements, facial expressions, and internal conflict are the result of a great synergy between the actor and technology.""Two Towers"" explores the theme of unity in the face of threat and personal struggle of each hero. The film particularly highlights the idea that even the smallest and seemingly insignificant ones can influence the course of the great war if they do not lose hope. In addition, the theme of seduction and the power contained in the Ring becomes even more important, especially in the context of Frodo and Gollum's relationship.The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, of which it won two: for best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. The work of Peter Jackson and his team in creating the visual splendor of Middle-earth was highly appreciated, as was the epicness they were able to convey. The film won several MTV, Saturn and BAFTA awards.""Two Towers"" significantly expands Tolkien's world, adding new elements such as the majestic lands of Rohan, the gloomy tower of Orthanc and featuring, for example, memorable Ents and Nazgul. The world of Middle-earth becomes not just an entourage, but a full-fledged hero of history. Jackson and his team were able to transform Tolkien's rich text into something tangible and alive, preserving the spirit of the original.One of the key scenes of the film was the battle of Helmowa Pad. The scale, staging and tension made it one of the best battles in the history of cinema. Well, that's my personal opinion. This is an event that cannot be forgotten: every detail, from the formidable Uruk-hai troops to the desperate resistance of the defenders, was created with incredible attention.""Two Towers"" surpasses ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", which I perceive as a majestic prologue. The sequel is exciting, much bigger than the first picture, full of drama and emotions. The world of Middle-earth is expanding, allowing you to immerse yourself in it, and the ambition of the project is amazing. This film is a vivid example of how an adaptation of a literary work can become a new masterpiece of art.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Fantastic Trilogy, Rocking My World.","It isn't often that I spend the day at work distracted by the fact that I have a movie ticket in my pocket.  Today, I could barely contain myself until I sat down into the theater seat with my Junior Mints to watch Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.  Yes, I love movies, like many who lurk here at imdb.  But the effect the Lord of the Rings trilogy has on me is something new. For some reason, my imagination, my heart, my head, and even what I think of as my soul have been taken by the work of Peter Jackson and his companions.I have books by Brian Sibley (you've seen them in the bookstore, I'm sure) detailing how P.J. made the films, and the 4-disk Fellowship of the Ring DVD set is well worn in.  I've listened to all four DVD commentaries as well as watched all of the supplemental material on the last two disks.When I research how these films were made, I think I am searching for the key Mr. Jackson found to break into my psyche.  By manipulating pixels, lighting, models, costumes, actors, extras, and props, I have been newly spellbound by a fantasy story I read as a kid in 6th grade. I have the CD version of the BBC broadcast produced by Brian Sibley (excellent, by the way!) which I've listened through three times in two years.  I've never been a fan of anything to this extent. I am amazed by the storytelling in these movies and I am anxiously awaiting The Return of the King. Also, I can't wait to get the Extended DVD version of Two Towers in November 2003.

An eyepopping and compelling middle chapter to this great trilogy.,"""The Lord of the Rings: The two towers"" is directed by ""Peter Jackson"".It stars Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin and Orlando Bloom.After the Fellowship breaks up, ""Frodo"" and ""Sam"" find ""Gollum"" who promises to take the ""Hobbits"" to ""Mordor"". While this happens, ""Aragon"" along with the town of ""Rohan"" must fight against ""Saruman's"" forces.""The Two Towers"" is the film I consider to be my least favourite of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy"" but that doesn't mean I hate it. In fact I think it's nearly perfect.The positivesThe main positive is how this film manages to make the middle chapter of a wider narrative compelling. Usually the middle chapter of a trilogy is the hardest part to create. But the film manages to not only set up the payoffs in the third film but manages to create arcs for the characters in one film. ""Frodo's"" arc into becoming an unlikely hero takes a massive step forward thanks to his friend ""Sam"" being his morale compass. New characters such as ""Theoden"" manage time be compelling and Interesting even when he does start the film cursed and unlikeable. The characters developments are also enhanced thanks to everyone producing great performances and having so much chemistry with each-other. Another positive is the action. The third act is pretty much all action and tension. The battle of ""Helms Deep"" is one of the best action scenes put into film in my opinion. The camerawork to the editing to the cinematography is all flawless. The special effects are absolutely gorgeous for 2002 and still hold up today. There's plenty of horror elements in the film which add so much more tension to the film and it's all handled well to the point where my heart pounds so much. Finally, there is some humour in the film that lands nearly all the time. ""Gimli"" and ""Legolas's"" banter about how many ""Orcs"" they killed is hilarious and doesn't mess with the tone of the battle. ""Gollum"" and ""Sam's"" argument about stew was charming and hilarious.The negativesThere's only one nitpick I have with the film. There's a fake out death that didn't add much to the story but it did add some tension to the build up to the final battle so it's not all bad.ConclusionWhile I do think ""The Two Towers"" is the worst film in trilogy. It's still nearly perfect. It's compelling characters, incredible action, phenomenal special effects, great horror elements and charming humour makes this film a great middle part to a larger story. Just a slight nit-pick with a fake out death is the only negative.I'm going to give ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" a:10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Best of the trilogy,"Now that the initial shock and marketing campaign has passed, we can take our time to watch the movie as it really is. The storytelling in this movie is exceptional. Although a serious J.R.R.T. fan would say that the story is not 100% accurate, it's my humble opinion that the changes made, for the movie's sake, are totally acceptable. Especially in the extended version, that shows a lot of little details that contribute a gigantic amount of comprehension to the story. I'd say it's the best of the trilogy, and one of the strongest points for that consideration, is that the amount of action scenes is remarkably balanced with the rest of the movie. Size effects and special effects are almost up to date 10 years later. Overall, an outstanding movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Quite possibly the best movie ever made!,"This movie was so incredible I only hope 1000 words is enough to give it the praise it deserves!Just like the first movie, I left the theatre totally astounded!  Just when you think you've seen everything that CGI can give you, along comes this movie and resets the standards, yet again.Looking at Gollum and Treebeard was movie magic at it's finest.  If I didn't understand the process of computer animation, I would have sworn that I was looking at living creatures!  I think the CGI team can expect another Academy Award for there brilliant work here.Now, on to story and direction....both were phenomenal.  Peter Jackson must really love his source material, if J.R.R. Tolkien were alive today...I would think he'd take back everything he ever said about his stories not being able to be brought to life on screen.I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to see Shelob's Lair, but hey, I'll get to see all the closure I need in The Return of the King.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Less intimacy but more action-packed,"What a great movie The Two Towers is, chiefly because it is the exact opposite of its smashing prequel The Fellowship of the Ring, and yet the movie still delivers and much more! My opinion on both movies stands on an equal ground, because these two complement each other. The differences are very apparent, especially on second viewing: it feels less intimate, has much more action sequences, doesn't have the prequel's linear pace and progression, the emergence of an important CGI character, and overall has a much more perilous tone than the last.It is true that much has been left out or changed, even more so than the first movie. But most of the crucial events as well as tone & movement is all there, and that is all that matters to me (this is speaking from a BIG fan of the book who has read many of Tolkien's works and understood much of Middle-Earth's lores).My instinct tells me to put a hold on all opinions until The Return of the King comes out, and then watch all three one after the other in the same day. We'll then realise at how AWESOME the trilogy is and marvel at its unimaginable scope. It is the only way the story can be enjoyed - after all, no die-hard fan of the book stops reading it when it gets to a certain part!Once again well done to Peter Jackson & writers, the stellar casts, and all at Weta workshop for a wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Gutted,"While the first film stuck closely to the book for its plot and direction, The Two Towers is purely Hollywood. Bubblegum chewers will lap this up and proclaim it the best thing since sliced bread but if I wanted to watch a big budget no brainer I would have watched Independence Day.True, Gollum is superb and the Battle of Helms Deep is not without its charm, but fans of the book will be disappointed at the ""artistic license"" that has been taken with the plot. The Ents are particularly misrepresented with Treebeard positively hasty in his decision to attack Isengard. Faramir is seen as nothing more than a clone of his brother and the character is totally sold out by the fact that he considers sending the ring to Minas Tirith to be used as a weapon against Sauron.Simply put, this is not the Lord of the Rings. This is a Knights Tale set in Middle Earth.Fanboys beware. This film is not what we wanted.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"The Least Exciting Of The Three Parts,But Never Fails,","The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is a great movie with an amazing second part to this epic story that had to be broken up in to three movies,with incredible characters and an terrific cast.However,out of all three,I find this to be the least exciting,mainly because it is right in the middle of the whole story,it doesn't begin anything and it also doesn't end,but its still very good,I just thought The Fellowship Of The Ring and especially The Return Of The King where much more exciting.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are headed closer to there destination along with the help of Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis),who really only wants to ring to himself,and is completely obsessed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

A visual masterpiece!,"The journey to Mount Doom continues for only Sam (Sean Astin) and Frodo (Elijah Wood). The fellowship has been broken, but not entirely. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have stuck together in an attempt to regroup with the captured hobbits (Pippin and Merry). Darkness becomes stronger than ever in Middle Earth as Saruman (Christopher Lee) creates the army of Isengard and Sarun grows more powerful. The adventure grows more perilous in the 2nd part of the epic trilogy.What can be said more than this is singly one of the greatest films ever created? The acting is phenomenal in this film. The Fellowship showed great supporting roles, but nothing real strong from the main characters which The Two Towers is filled with. Elijah Wood really starts to express the power that the ring posses and Viggo Mortensen gives a performance unlike any other. Gandalf may have been wonderful in the previous film as well as this one, but the other characters really just start to shine in The Two Towers. You really start to see the characters transition into the hero.The story takes a whole new level in this film also. The adventurers experience Roahn, one of the kingdoms of man for the first time on film and are greeted with grief that has not been seen in the Lord of the Rings films yet. Not to mention the greatest battle scene ever put on film! The battle at Helm's Deep is the most phenomenal battle of all time. It is only a totally different league with battles from other movies like Braveheat or Gladiator. Overall, The Two Towers is one of the greatest films of all time. Enough said!! I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Two Towers Up!!!,"If there was such thing as a sequal being better than the first one, than this is it! The Two Towers are full of everything a movie needs: action, romance,suspence, and even some comedy. Peter Jackson has totally brought Middle Earth to life as he introduces us to new characters, such as Eowyn, and re-aquaint ourselves with others, such as Gollum. We also go where no one has gone before, like Rohan, and deep into Mordor. You don't even have to read the book in order to understand what is going on. It would keep you on the edge of your seat.However, if you actually read the book, there were a couple of things that every movie based on books has. It doesn't have every detail that was described in the book. Although it has happened before, and most likely will happen again, you just can't get over it. However, we can only hope that whatever is missing in this movie will pop up in the next one. Until then, I think everyone should see the movie, and I rate it a 9.5/10!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

When i sat in the cinemas and saw The Two Towers i could not have been more happy with the result, the acting, the directing and yes the story was incredibal...the battle scene's where well scripted  and the dialog was not too boring (exception  the aragorn arwen scenes) and it held my attention from beginning  to end.

Awestruck,"Right after watching LOTR, the group I was with - all of whom having read the trilogy several times - started debating whether this one was truer or less true to the original than Fellowship was. Even moreso than with FOTR, we concluded quite quickly that we didn't *care* about these deviations.The score was much more balanced than FOTR. I have read many times that Howard Shore has composed the score for the entire trilogy as one piece of music, however the Wagnerian usage of themes was a lot less obvious in this installment than it was in Fellowship.Furthermore, where in FOTR Gimli was a little too recognizable as a standard John Rhys-Davies character, in TTT he appears more ""natural"" in his fumbling, quirky behavior, probably because he knows when to keep his mouth shut. In short, I found his character to be a nuisance in FOTR, and a great source of comic relief in TTT.As for the Elves, their stance towards humans seemed to have grown more distant and in the case of ""Agent Smith"" Elrond (I can't help it) sometimes almost seems hostile. Which of course breeds tension for the love triangle that develops between Arwen, Eowyn and Aragorn - something I anticipate will deepen in part three even though Tolkien's original barely scratches the surface.Smeagol, in his computer generated glory, is a visual delight if one can call a wretch like him that. His creepy, crawly hideousness goes beyond the human form, so Jackson made an excellent choice in putting the latest and the greatest of rendering systems to work, and the end result is simply baffling. Especially since the immense pity Frodo feels for the creature takes hold of the viewer as well. Not bad for a bunch of pixels.Also wonderfully done are the Ents, whose way of disposing with Orcs I couldn't help but find terribly amusing. Here you see the splatter artist Jackson briefly appear, though the film keeps neatly within its PG-13 borders.There are some weaknesses in the editing storyline, and I am left wondering why this had to be done. Probably the alterations made for the Battle of Helm's Deep allow for a grander army to come from Isengard without the story losing too much of its credibility, but one wonders whether this could not also have been accomplished by simply doubling the garrison.Nevertheless, special praise has to be given for the way vast armies are created with the help of computers, ironically the very machines Tolkien was anxious about. I will not go into much detail, but you can very well expect to be swept off your feet by the intensity, the grimness and the sheer magnitude of it all. There has never been a battle on a movie screen with such ferocity and enormity, and one can only speculate what will happen once New Line unleashes the third installment of this already epic trilogy.We will see, my Precious, we will see...9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Spectacular!,"Amazing effects, great story, terrific acting.  The use of computer animation to assist with crowd and battle scenes was powerful and seamlessly done.  Peter Jackson did a beautiful job directing.  I saw this one on the IMAX screen and it blew my mind.  I also liked the way they set up the (apparent) differences in height between the hobbits and the ""big people"".And, it was so much as I had imagined it when I read the Lord of the Rings back in high school.  I dare to think even Tolkien (who apparently was a real techno-phobe) would have appreciated this version of his work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Film/The book/U can love both,"I have read the LOTR books 4 times, with a few glances back over the years. I daresay I'll read them a few more times before I pass from this earth. I need not say to those who have read and loved those books, how I treasured those novels. They are more than just books. They are stories I have held in my heart long after I put them down.Being a film buff as well, I have waited many years,with great longing and anticipation, for a film to bring the magical words of the trilogy to the screen. In my heart I knew it would be an imposing task, maybe an impossible one.In the past year I have seen what Peter Jackson has made from these books. I believe:1). Mr. Jackson labored mightily, and it was his heartfelt wish that these films be as close to the original idea that the books perfected, that his films grasp the feeling and mood and meaning of the words Tolkien put down. To this desire I believe him to  be true. One can feel and see the labor of love he put into these movies.2. I also believe that these books are so intense and personal to each loyal reader, and no visual art can truly fulfill every person's individual imagining of the magical places, actions and people of Middle Earth. While one person might accept the image of Jackson's Shire to be right on target, another might have thought it less than right. There are bound to be some parts of these movies that disappoint individuals, as each person holds a different picture in their own mind than did Jackson,or Tolkien did or anyone else. This is the unique and best part of these books, the idea that each of us can fill our own minds eye with whatever we envision as magical.Those things being said, I liked both of the movies. Did I think them absolutely perfect to my imaginary idea of MiddleEarth? No. Did I find them close? Yes. Can I respect the effort of the writers, directors and the actors who worked hard to bring these ideas to life? Yes.The Fellowship seemed to follow the book more closely than did the Two Towers. But the first book is an easier mark to hit, as the story is just unfolding. The second book was incredibly detailed with new characters, plots and separate adventures of the main characters. I think to bring the Two Towers book to complete justice, one would have to have 2 movies just to cover it all.Was I a bit disappointed in some of the liberties Jackson took with the story, that Eowyn did not take up the sword and Faramir was an incomplete character, as I had loved him so in the book? Yes, a bit. But the ancient Ents were there on the screen and Viggo M. brought fabulous life to Aragorn. Gollum was an incredible character both visually as well as poignantly humanized and Helm's Deep was dank and dark, the Enemy overwhelmingly many.The dead mrshes were truly frightening and I loved all breathtaking scenery, the mountains and the valleys, the imposing gates of Mordor.There were some disappointments, but overall the effort and the final product far outweigh the negatives. Both movies are cinematically brilliant. To judge them harshly by comparing them to the written word is unfair, as one cannot compare one to the other.The bottom line for me in rating a movie is by the overall effect it has on me, after I leave my seat and get in the truck to go home. I was truly moved by the Two Towers and the Fellowship movies. They are not mere popcorn chomping movies you watch and leave behind in the theatre. They are movies that stayed with me long after I walked away from the screen, impressing me with their strong, umwavering idealization of good and evil, dark and light. The same ideals found in the original written works by Tolkien.I'll go see it again and look to next year for the Finale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Nothing but praise.,I am in awe. There is simply nothing wrong with this film taken within its context as an epic medieval adventure. The acting is superb. The effects are seamless.

"Two Towers is the worst film in what I think to be the best film trilogy of all time. Naturally, it's a fantastic outing.","My cousin was visiting for the weekend, and he - an avid fantasy fan who somehow hadn't seen Lord of the Rings yet - decided to watch this and Return of the King. Little known fact: to maintain your NZ citizenship you have to have seen all three films (theatrical at the very least) in the last ten years. He seemed to like it a great deal, though commented that it's quite slow at times. It's true, Two Towers does tend to drag a little bit.I think there's an argument to be made that the extended version of this entry is worse than the theatrical release. There's only one scene that I'd definitely keep, the flashback to Osgiliath.A lot of the Ent scenes were too long. Merry and Pippin's added adventures were fun, but not entirely necessary and drag the pacing down too much.Fortunately these are just nitpicks. The main reason Two Towers is the lesser of the three for me is because a hefty portion of its runtime is build up for the incredible final act and its sequel. The film is the most backloaded in the trilogy, with a well edited climax as we see each story thread reach its emotional height.The craftsmanship is still in top form here: practical effects that look amazing to this day and the sound design and score are so diverse and impactful. I think the films' greatest achievement in effects is bringing the most complex character in the trilogy to life. Gollum enters the fray as a tragic mirror to Frodo's plight. Andy Serkis and the animators are to be commended - twenty-one years later the character feels like a natural part of the world.The region of Rohan is the central location of the film, where we meet several new characters including my favourite of the bunch: King Théoden. Bernard Hill brings a nuanced performance to the role, and while his character differs more from the book than most, I loved every scene with him in it. Hill even came up with the saddest and most impactful lines in the film from personal experience.Jackson, Walsh and Boyens again move portions from the book around. The start of Towers was at the end of Fellowship, the end of Two Towers (for Frodo and Sam) is moved to Return. In fact they add a detour which ends up establishing a location for the next film. An interesting decision, to be sure, and one that makes a fair bit of sense.Moving parts of the story around works a treat, as the original novels were supposed to be one book, and were split for publishing purposes. The way these writers reframed the narrative lets each film stand on their own better than the books.So Two Towers does drag a little bit, but the final third (and payoff in Return) justifies most of the slow pacing. It works well as the middle film, and the lesser of three amazing films is no small feat. It's a treat to have one film in a trilogy be this quality. It's a blessing for two. It's almost suspicious for three. Onto the finale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Watch Out Lovers of the Book,Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed.  Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place.  I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents.  There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor.  And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story.  We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why.  If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum.  This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter.  But then again what do I really know.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Completely enthralled,"I watched the first screening of TTT in Basel yesterday - and wow, was I impressed!True, there are things to be criticized and things I personally would have loved to see - but that doesn't change the fact that to me, TTT is an incredibly intense movie! I was captivated right from the start and forgot all about sitting in second row, craning my neck... I loved how each character has at least one moment to shine and that there were a lot of touching and true interactions between them.If there's one thing to criticize it's that the movie wasn't long enough - I'd have loved to see more of Merry, Pippin and the Ents as well as of Frodo and Sam (there specially more about Faramir). I'm hoping the Extended DVD will remedy some of that... But although I'm really not a fan of big action sequences and therefore didn't expect to enjoy the long long battle scenes, I found myself loving every minute of them, also thanks to Gimli acting as comic relief (admittedly somewhat overdone at times, but that doesn't change the fact that I for one needed those breathers).Oh, and one more negative thing - how the hell am I supposed to wait another year for ROTK? :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Epic awesome film,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Excellent movie.,"I saw this film the day it came out and was very impressed.  Gollum and the battle at the end were my favorite parts of the film.  I especially liked when they showed the two sides of Gollum.I have read the book, and unlike many others I don't think Jackson did anything wrong.  So he left some parts out, but then again what movie from a book doesn't leave a part or parts out.  If you are that upset about how the books have gone to screen, you should stay in your room and read the books, instead of enjoying a movie BASED ON the books.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
WOW!,"I have no words. Really. From direction to adapted screenplay and from acting to cinematography. From soundtrack to editing and from makeup to sound. This film is perfect. Just as perfect as its prequel, but much more interesting story-wise and much more inspiring!Personally, I think this is the best film of the trilogy, and speaking generally, The Two Towers (2002) is the second part of an unforgettable trilogy and perhaps the greatest thing in cinema history, if anything can be defined that way. Totally generic. Subjective - it's in there somewhere, I'm not sure exactly where.Congratulations!Final score: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Extended DVD better story than theatrical release.,"I give the extended version of Two Towers on DVD a 10 out of 10. But believe that the theatrical release is only a 9 out of 10. The theatrical release had some holes that were nicely filled in the extended DVD release. The theatrical release was a little confusing when it came to some of the scenes with the exiled Rohirrim. I truly enjoyed all 3 movies and recommend them. I do believe Two Towers was the most difficult of the books to translate to the big screen. I remember when reading the series that Two Towers always felt like work to get through, where the Fellowship of the RIng provides the joy of discovering Tolkien's fully realized world. The Return of the King gives us the climax of the entire venture. Given the extra time in the extended DVD version of Two Towers, Peter Jackson delivers a more compelling coherent story than the original book.Michael",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Meet All My Expectations (which are extremely high) and More,"I just saw it. I need to see it a few more times to decide if I like this one better than I like FOTR.However, it's certainly spectacular, with scenes after scenes that would take your breath away. Personally, I don't mind as much the deviations made by PJ, such as much more ambiguous Faramir. They certainly make better drama. The acting all around are powerful, and the interplay between Aragorn and Eowyn, King Theoden and Gandalf and later Aragorn, Sam and Frodo, Frodo and Gollum, Faramir and Frodo/Sam, and so on all come out seamlessly and naturally.Oh yes, Gollum although not perfect (there's one or two incidences I felt he's not totally seamlessly fit into the background) is the most amazing CGI character ever. Hats off to Mr. Serkis, PJ and the CGI team! By the way, the change of Gollum, from a menace to a helper back to a scheming snick, came through logically. I actually feel sorry for that wretched creature.Overall, it met all my expectations and more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Shortest 3 Hour Movie Ever,Even though this is a 3 hour movie.... okay 2hr 59min... it was well worth the time.  Where Titanic bogged this movie soared..

Bridging the trilogy,"I needed a little bit of time to ponder upon this installment of Lord of the Rings after seeing it. I wanted to think about how it would be viewed in the grand scheme of things for this trilogy years from now. Because basically, I don't view Lord of the Rings so much as three different movies, as much as one giant 9 hr movie that we just happen to see in three 3hr segments. Looking at it from that perspective, I think this ""segment"" had two main goals :1) have more action than Part I 2) set up Part III as the mac-daddy ending-to-end-all-endingsThis one does have more action scenes than Part I - though the majority of the action scenes are grouped together towards the end of the movie.As far as setting up Part III to be an ending-to-end-all-endings, well, I think this film accomplishes that because it really kept some key parts from ""The Two Towers"" book. Because of that, Peter Jackson is basically going to have a ton of material to put into Part III. I mean, there's probably about 45-60 minutes worth of material that's going to have to appear in the movie ""The Return of the King"" that is from the book ""The Two Towers"". So, the third part should be pretty interesting.So, I'll admit it, I was slightly disappointed at first - but when I started thinking about what Jackson has set himself up for in part III, I realized that it's all a matter of telling the tale in a way that will make for the most successful trilogy possible.Part I : has to be awesome, make sure the entire audience wants to come back for Part II Part II : give everyone their action fix & those big battles that movie goers love Part III : make sure the audience leaves this one thinking it was a home-run on all levelsKnowing what all material Jackson left for Part III, he definitely has set up the trilogy to end with a home run.I will have to say this : The second time was much better than the first! MUCH BETTER! Somehow, the movie seemed to move along much smoother & the pace was more tolerable & balanced.On the other hand, certain aspects of the film that caught my attention in a negative way stuck out even more noticeably the second time. The best example of this was Aragorn's ""dreams"" that he was having of Arwen (which were NOT part of the book). Because of the awkward change of pace to the rest of the film, these scenes felt slightly out of place - and the fact that they are not part of the book makes it look like a bad call on Jackson's part to add them. I'm convinced Jackson is viewing this whole epic as a giant stew that he wants to be able to look at 10 years from now and never have to worry about saying to himself ""hmmm...I should have put this in there when I had a chance"". I mean, after all, is anyone going to care that there are 10 minutes of mushy dream scenes between Aragorn & Arwen when they view these films back-to-back on DVD on a 11 hr Super Mega Platinum Edition years from now ?Gollum was especially impressive to me the second time around. They just couldn't have done a better job with him. They don't overuse him in the scenes and they make sure that when he says something it's memorable. Inevitably there will be comparisons to Jar-Jar, but in reality there really is no comparison. I think this is another example of how LOTR has shown up the new Star Wars in yet another way. Lucas was determined to have Jar-Jar be one of his shining accomplishments with the new trilogy (have a completely CGI character play a supporting role in the movie). Instead of having Jar-Jar viewed as a great cinematic accomplishment, Lucas has people begging him to get rid of the character. Gollum, on the other hand, is actually a very interesting character that actually brings something to the story, and you enjoy viewing on screen.I'm a little worried about what all Jackson has left for Part III, though I do understand why he left it for Part III. However, he has so much material to cover in that movie that it could be quite overwhelming to those that didn't read the books. ""Return of the King"" is definitely going to have to be the longest of the three films if he is going to cover the material the way it needs to be covered.When I wrote comments on ""Fellowship"" on IMDB, I said it was a good start for what could potentially be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. I think this installation of LOTR does a proper job in bridging the trilogy & setting us up for what should be the proper ending to the greatest trilogy of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Not as mind-numbing as the first, but still an instant classic.","Yeah, it's great. And yeah, I'll see it countless times on DVD, already several times in theatres. There are so many beautiful and powerful images in this movie that it's ridiculous to reel them all off. All in all it's a masterpiece, second act of a whole that will probably stand as the greatest, most fantastic film epic for many, many years to come. And still I can't help being just a tiny little bit disappointed?! Now, how's that for being ungrateful! Two major issues concerning changes from the original story follow below, plus reflections on the difference between being a movie LOTR ""virgin"" and having a score of FOTR viewings in your backpack when seeing TTT!Well, I have to say I am *really* looking forward to finding out what purpose that whole scene with Frodo showing the One Ring to a Black Rider was about. Doesn't the entire plot evolve around the fact that the Fellowship was supposed to go into Mordor *unnoticed*? I'm waiting for a reason for this scene, and a bit nervous about it, at that.Also, I find the screenplay's approach to the Ent-moot a tad strange: why on earth do the Ents take several days to decide on whether Merry and Pip are who they are, and decide not to fight - and then come storming out of the woods, lined up for battle, immediately after a howl from Treebeard? I guess it was done for dramatic effect, to hold the ""non-literary"" audience in suspense - but I think it was a rather pointless change from the book, and making no sense in regard to Ent psychology.Some CGI blunders seem as if they are the result of Peter Jackson's five-week award tour in 2002, haste in the editing forcing some irritating errors; there are many, some obvious - just look under Goofs at this page.I must admit to sometimes sighing a bit inwardly, silently wishing for the camera not to flip and flap about so much during (the many) battle sequences, so that one could dwell a bit more on all the details of the combatants. I know there's a perfectly good directing reason for it, showing how the havoc really is havoc, so that's just me.The score: it's great, I play it a lot on my stereo - and it's very much like the first one. Although not as varied, I think. When the three films can be seen in a row it will be very nice with the continuity, I'm sure, but right now it feels too much like the first to get me cheering.These things being said, there is no doubt that the tiny bit of disappointment mostly comes from enormous expectations. FOTR was an incredible blast: I laughed, I cried, I didn't move for three hours, I went to the theatre NINE times, I became a fanclub charter member, I bought both DVD editions. I mean, you can't have that same new feeling to it when you see TTT, or any other movie - because now you *know* how the orcs look like, how Saruman looks like etc. Of course, everything is still visually magnificent in TTT, I'm just saying - NOTHING can surpass, for me, the very first viewing at the premiere of FOTR in December 2001, because that was witnessing a new film legend.The Two Towers is a wonderful movie, I love it in spite of the minor flaws I see in it, and it's a definite 10 out of 10 stars from this reviewer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Violence is not something many enjoy watching, but then again there are those who do like watching it. I don't think it will disappoint anyone who has read the book.Maybe it's just me, since my ""Lord of the Rings"" phase has almost completely passed... but this movie is not bad.

The Best Film of the Trilogy,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may win more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
meticulous attention to detail.........,"After director Peter Jackson's exciting and emotionally affecting first chapter in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you would think he could do no wrong. While The Two Towers continues to up the stakes in terms of action and pure escapism it does not quite live up the sheer perfection of Fellowship of the Ring.TTT starts exactly where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam continue on their quest to Mordor while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail of the orcs who took Merry and Pippin. The story follows three distinct threads (that of Frodo and Sam, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and Merry and Pippin), unlike FotR, which was quite linear in its storytelling.The introduction of new characters such as Gollum (a work of technical genius), Eowyn (played with perfect restraint by Miranda Otto), Faramir (David Wenham) and Grima Wormtongue helps to keep the story interesting.Though much complaint has been aimed at Faramir's out of character behaviour, in regards to the source material, and other deterrence's from the book. I wholeheartedly understand why the writers took these minor liberties with the direction that was taken with his character, as it no doubt works better for the film.The majority of TTT basically foreshadows what is to come in Return of the King and also sets up the most exciting aspect of this movie, the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is technically impressive, with ingenious cinematography from Andrew Lesnie, brilliant choreography of fight scenes and a perfect score from Howard Shore to compliment the action and heighten the tension.I do have my complaints though. The fact this is the bridging chapter is noticeable and while some of the film's weaknesses can be attributed to this, no good reason can be given for the extremely slow pacing of the first 90 minutes. This is primarily due to some extremely annoying editing and writing choices that detract from the overall movie. Arwen's scenes and the unneeded, and somewhat underwhelming, Warg Rider battle simply don't add anything worthwhile to the story. Several scenes that can now be seen on TTT Extended Edition would have been better suited to the theatrical cut.Had the omission of Arwen's plot been considered, allowing for the insertion of some truly satisfying material (such as Aragorn's revelation to Eowyn that he is 87 years old and the Entwash scene), The Two Towers, in my eyes, would have been the perfect bridging chapter between FotR and RotK. As it stands a good 30 minutes could have been edited out of the theatrical version and this movie would surely be more deserving of the praise it receives.The Two Towers is a slightly disappointing middle chapter to what is becoming one of the greatest movie series ever made. Quality is one thing this series will be associated with and TTT continues this trend with its meticulous attention to detail, brilliant special effects and impressive acting.8 out of 10           EE - 9 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
This movie turned me into a blithering nerd - I love it!,"This movie has a darker edge to it than last year's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" but is still worthy as a holiday movie for those of us with children, 11 or older.

Also, I feel that many boring scenes could have been removed without affecting the narrative too much. Finally, many effects are simply laughable.

Overwhelming AND Underwhelming?,"Give a man a tower and he'll see across a kingdom; give a man two towers and he'll be blinded by special effects.I'll admit I've never read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which may render my commentary meaningless to diehard fans of the series. However, I'll give Peter Jackson loads of credit for his job on the first two adaptations. Thus far, I can't say I've seen any other film positing itself as an ""epic"" lately and actually FELT like I was seeing an epic. From the hordes of armies and the bombastic, poetic dialogue to the expanses of New Zealand that serve as the beautiful, majestic Middle Earth, Jackson and his dedicated creative team have done a superb job in recreating a world that I know many people love dearly.Unfortunately for me, as a film, The Two Towers (and to some extent The Fellowship of the Ring before it) leaves me wanting for something. It's hard to believe because there's so much THERE -- drama, archetype, huge battle sequences, lush cinematography, incredible special effects -- but I came away from the film feeling empty, like I'd just seen a gorgeous work of art that didn't speak to me personally. Some might say this is because I haven't read the books; I claim the opposite. I think what I'm missing is a sense of inclusion, of characters, of personal moments. These are the things that make me ""connect"" with any film, and which I didn't see in The Two Towers. If I sense them lacking, and I haven't even read the books, I can only imagine how half-empty the serious fans of the story are, in that they probably come into the theater expecting every nuance of Tolkien's 1000-odd pages to come to life onscreen and leave wondering where all their favorite moments were.The first film had the luxury of being based around interpersonal relationships among the Fellowship members, and Frodo's reluctance to be a hero, Bilbo's mixed feelings about the ring, Gandalf's weary wisdom, etc. All character traits, character moments -- building blocks of conflict and story. Here, the conflict is primarily external -- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must help the people of Rohan defend themselves from a swarm of orc soldiers as a show of force, good standing strong against the onslaught of evil. The character moments, particularly those between Aragorn and nearly anyone else, feel forced and artificial primarily because they occur opposite underdeveloped characters seemingly introduced solely to further the plot or embody elements of the theme (Rohan's king in particular) rather than being integral parts of the story. Why Rohan? Why not any other city, any other characters? Why would Aragorn be so easily swayed from his original love as to develop eyes for another? It seems like a plot device, not a natural occurrence.Even the comedic moments, especially those between Legolas and Gimli, are unnatural. The elf and dwarf are reduced to comedic foils, buddy characters, recipients of exposition and mood-lightening one-liners. Surely the bravest representatives of their races can do more than play second fiddle to Aragorn, yet they're given no chance here. They fade into the background, except for gratuitous and suspiciously out-of-tone (and character) comments and actions (Legolas on a medieval snowboard?).Finally, there's the redundancy and disinterest of the alleged central plot, that of Frodo, Sam and Gollum transporting the ring to Mount Doom. Never before has the main conflict of a story taken a backseat to a subplot (Aragorn and the defense of Helm's Deep) and been so welcome. Every time the film cut back to Frodo I became increasingly bored. It may be because Elijah Wood is reduced to playing a primarily one-note character at this point, given that his rational thought and will are eroding throughout the tale. Or maybe it's the frustration I felt at seeing them so close to gates of Mordor, only to have them decide to go COMPLETELY AROUND the main entrance to approach from a ""hidden entrance,"" which smacks of plot device. Call it theme; I call it flat story. And I'll say nothing of the rest of their end of the film, which features no conflicts we haven't already seen, paired with characters we're asked to care about prematurely, except that their final scene onscreen is a mirror image of the Frodo-Sam bonding moment at the end of Fellowship -- are there no fresh angles to this plotline?The Merry and Pippin subplot exists solely to topple another subplot, the tower of Sauruman. I'm sure the themes involved were more clearly stated in the book; here, they feel tacked-on. The film could have existed without them and been perfectly engaging, if not moreso, since we'd have no momentum-killing cuts from Helm's Deep to the langorous Ents, talking (for comic relief).The special effects are remarkable. The detail is commendable. The movie as a whole is impressive. But the attention to detail cannot overcome what for me is a lack of basic plot and character, deficiencies that hamper the aftertaste of the film. As everyone knows, special effects will never be able to replace a solid, coherent, emotionally engaging story, which the original trilogy likely is and which seems to be at least partially lost in the translation to the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Once is not enough...,"The Two Towers, the sequel.  Not only a sequel, but part two of three. One has to remember that when they sit down with their popcorn.  This movie is pretty fast paced, fast cut, and overall intense.  The battle scenes are epic and the dialogue scenes have loads of information to digest.  If you haven't read the books (like myself) but are familiar with the story, you're in luck.  You'll learn something and possibly even walk away a bit confused. The most intriguing and the most emotional, for me, are the scenes involving Gollum/Smeagol (Slinker & Stinker).  Tears and laughter want to explode at the same time while Gollum and Smeagol have at it with one another.  An internal turmoil that has been there for hundreds of years. And the CGI, well, nevermind that.  You'll forget in an instant that Gollum is computer generated.  Unlike Dawby the house-elf.There are many scenes that were added in apart from the books, and many parts of the books that aren't in the movie.  The transition from book to film is not always easy.  Suspense (aka Hooks) is a key form to action flicks.  It's necessary.  Internal and external struggle are also key parts in screenplays/movies.  As is romance.  (yawn)  But, it has to be done.There were a few scenes where the CGI jumps out at you and you can tell that something is outta whack, but those brief instances are quickly forgotten or dismissed.  There are many heavy action/battle scenes and several breathtaking topography shots.  All of it is amazing.  It's well acted, well conceived and overall a great MOVIE!  I say it like that so the purists will not turn beet red and explode with anger.  Yes, it's a fact, it is not 100% true to the book.  But, the story is the same.I recommend seeing it at least TWICE.

It'll make you drool for the next one,"First of, it is not as good as Fellowship.  It is however, almost as good. There were few elements I didn't like about the movie and many, many I did.Most people are talking about the CG.  And most people are focused on Gollum.  I want to give a mention to the Ents.  We all knew about what Gollum should look like, but how do you animate a tree.  Now we know.  The Ents were perfect.  There is no other way to decribe it.  Their distinct appearance, their voices, their mannerisms are all just brilliant.  Gollum is almost perfect.  He still has that slight unreal look that all CG has that tells you he isn't really there, but from the way the actors and Gollum himself behave, it doesn't cause a problem.  He is animated, alive, and acts on the environment around him better than any CG character to date.  There is a scene where Gollum and Smeagol complete for dominance that will blow you away.While everyone was anticiapting the Battle of Helms Deep, few people were ready for the battle at Isenguard.  I think this stole the movie.  The Ents rampage was just amazing and there wasn't a second in the battle you though they were fake.  It just felt like the keep was being torn apart.  Helms Deep was one of the best action sequences ever.  It is fast paced, intense, and features large and small scale fights all around to keep the variety going.  The battle builds and builds until its wonderful climax that will have you cheering in your seat.Now, I would give Fellowship a 10.  It is the perfect movie for that story. I give Two Towers, really, a 9.5.  The problem in it are not enough to drop it more than that however.  My problem, you ask?  Is the pace of the movie. Unlike Fellowship, which really, has two parts, Two Towers builds and builds for 2 hours until the Battle of Helms Deep.  After the first 1.5 hours I was just eager to see the Battle and urging the movie to get on to it.  There were a few small bits of action during the first 2 hours, but mostly it was story.  Mind you good story, but 2 hours is a long, long time to build up to something.  Especially when it seemed that it took forever just to watch the warriors of Rohan preparing for the Battle of Helms Deep.  Also, to create some tension, they make it seem like a key character might be dead, but it is a character you know will live, even if they don't stick to the books, this character is too important to die now.Then, once the Battle of Helms Deep start, there are breaks to the rest of the story, which is still slowly developing.  It isn't until there are battles in all parts of the story that the pace really moves and you can't even sit back for a good 30 minutes.  I wish they had started all the battles at the same time, so that while you would break from story to story, there would be action in all of them, so the last hour would be nothing more than a nonstop fight.  The intensity of Helms Deep is just too great to switch to the Ents talking and Frodo walking.  It is too much a shock in pace to feel confortable.That is why I'd say Two Towers is a 9.5.  However, once the ending is in full gear, it makes up for just about any problems with the movie.  The Battle of Helms Deep is amazing and filled with bits that will leave you in glee and the Ents rampage at Isenguard will just leave you with chills.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The Lord of the rings.,"The Two Towers is hands down one of the most captivating movies I've ever seen! From the stunning landscapes of Middle-earth to the epic battles, it's a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless.The characters are incredibly well-developed, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Aragorn's bravery, Frodo and Sam's unwavering friendship, and Gollum's complex nature all add layers of depth to the story.The Battle of Helm's Deep is jaw-dropping, and the chase scenes with the Nazgul had me on the edge of my seat.But what really sets The Two Towers apart is its emotional impact.

"WOW, WHAT PRETTY SCENERY!","I have read several comments on this movie and am very surprised at how many reviewers expected it to be exactly like the book The Two Towers. I have read the books several times myself, and seen dozens of movies based on books I've read, but I never expected this film (or any other) to copy the book to a double T.This film is ABSOLUTELY one of the BEST I've seen this year, and fits my bill as THE BEST MOVIE of 2002!! It is ALSO an excellent adaptation of the second book, with a few changes made and extras added in, and I didn't mind that Shelob (who features at the end of the book TTT) won't make her appearance until the third movie.I was a little worried that this film wouldn't meet my (rather high!) expectations (re Star Wars I, II) and the battle scenes would turn out like they did in Star Wars II - but I was pleasantly surprised! You see real warriors (and C.G.I ones of course) in real armor during the huge battle at Helm's Deep. I liked the battle with the Waarg riders, and Gandalf's fight with the Balrog was pretty cool.Gollum is simply amazing. You forget he's C.G.I and marvel at how hideous and slimy he is. His animation is just about perfect, even better than that boring Final Fantasy flick. His movements were animated over a live actor (who also does his voice) which really added to his realism.I found TTT to be even better than FotR! Unlike the first movie, which concentrated mostly on character development, TTT now concentrates on moving the story along with the battles, rise of Sauron etc.MR LUCAS TAKE NOTE!! Watch this film a few times BEFORE you make Star Wars III (after all, we *do* have to wait 3 or 4 years for the third installment, which is *plenty* of time to come up with a *good* movie)I highly recommend this film to everyone who loves movies!Congratulations Mr Jackson and crew!  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Extended Version: Who Says Bigger Ain't Better!,"Bigger story! Bigger sound! What a difference in DTS.What the extended versions have done (for me and probably millions of other viewers) is that the theatrical versions are now obsolete. It's a shame that for a long while to come, the majority will have only experienced the story via the shorter versions. Oh well! For the millions who have enjoyed the longer versions it's the same as being privy to being on the inside of a joke that the majority just didn't get. And repeated viewings only enriches it. But not too many...not yet! Not till ""RETURN's..."" extended version becomes available so this film can be truly appreciated the way it's meant to be.Not for years have I gotten so much enjoyment out of one film (and I'm not talking about ""Two Towers""; I'm talking about ""Lord of the Rings""...one story...one film...on 6 DVD discs; not counting the additional 6 DVD bonus discs).

'LORD OF THE RINGS'  PART 2!,"Like it or not, 'Lord Of The Rings' is ONE movie.

Scene after scene he manages to avoid the pitfalls plaguing so many other simliar movies.Last thought: G. Lucas could have only dreamed of realizing a full CGI character as well as Gollum when first he attempted it with Episode 1.For the first time, I believe we have seen just how incredibly far a filmmaker can go in inventing a character out of ones and zeros; quite scary indeed. Voice acting will definitely see a spike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"Inferior, but still worth it","The adventure continues with two separate stories (readers of the book will notice that the stories have been sandwiched together): one with Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Bloom) on the trail of orcs who have kidnapped hobbits Pippin (Boyd) and Merry (Monaghan); the other with Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) making their way to Mordor accompanied by troublesome guide Gollum (Serkis). No longer obscured by the shadows, Serkis almost steals the movie when brought to the foreground. While undeniably more action-packed than FELLOWSHIP (fans particularly love the intense Helm's Deep battle), this movie is really the start of the corny-lines and moments-of-boredom that plague the rest of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Hill and Otto are frustrating as the hope-driven king and princess of Rohan. Regardless of how disappointingly inferior it is compared to FELLOWSHIP, it makes for an excellent story-bridge between its predecessor and the following RETURN OF THE KING.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - A thrilling continuation of the epic adventure,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, directed by Peter Jackson, is a thrilling continuation of the epic adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring. The film picks up where the first left off, with Frodo and Sam continuing their journey to destroy the One Ring while their friends battle to protect Middle-earth from the dark forces that seek to conquer it.The film features some of the most memorable battle scenes in cinematic history, including the battle of Helm's Deep, which is a stunning visual spectacle. The cast, including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, and Viggo Mortensen, all deliver powerful performances that bring their characters to life. The introduction of new characters, such as the fierce warrior Eowyn and the tormented creature Gollum, add depth and complexity to the story.The film's music, once again composed by Howard Shore, is haunting and beautiful, adding to the already immersive atmosphere.

In response to Ashley Whitear Kam-Bo's questions...,"Ashley,You had asked what the ""two towers"" were. They are: Orthanc, Sarumon's tower; and Barad-dur, Sauron's tower. ""The Two Towers"" just stands for the two and their alliance. :o) Also, you had said that it was a pity the Fellowship did not unite. I think, in your case, reading the books would help understand what Tolkien was trying to get across to his readers. Frodo is destroyed by the corruption of the ring, Boromir is dead, and Gandalf is a completely different person. It's part of the drama, beauty, and charm of ""The Lord of the Rings"".

"Excellent work, but not quite as good as the first movie","For a start, ignore the fanboys who decry Peter Jackson's efforts as ""Not Tolkien's story"" or other such comments. Of course it isn't. It's Peter Jackson's version of it. That's why, apparently missed by the rabid Tolkien-ites, all such films, somewhere in their credits, have the comment ""Based on the novel xxx by xxxx....."". So, given that it isn't intended to be a word-for-word rehash of the book, why shout it down for that?What the Two Towers is, however, is solid action-fantasy cinema that picks up right where the first movie finished and runs with the ball. Personally, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first movie, but then, it would have had to be fantastic to be so. All sequels are ""more of the same"" to an extent, so it's hard to be as good as the original, but this one comes pretty close.There were things I wished I could see more of in this movie, like the Ents attack on Isengard, or maybe where Gimli discovers the caves at Helm's Deep (which wasn't in there at all), but I'm hopeful that the extended DVD release will add little extras like this back into the story as the extended DVD of FOTR did.I was a little puzzled to see the Elves at Helm's Deep. I don't recall that from the book, but who cares really? It seemed logical that they would come to help. Nice addition.Gollum was a truly amazing piece of CGI. I don't think he looked THAT realistic, but what made him work for me was the expression that they got into his features. Amazing stuff, especially the ""Good Smeagol, Bad Gollum"" internal struggle. Incidentally, on a humorous note, there were people in the audience that didn't get that bit. I heard at least two people (adults) wondering out loud where the second Gollum came from!I also think that it was a shame Shelob didn't make it into this one. T'would have made a good cliff-hanger ending for the second film to have Frodo apparently dead and Sam alone. But as it was, those of us who know the story can know anticipate the appearance of Ungoliant's spawn in much the same way as we anticipated Gollum's appearance.If there was one thing that I'm not sure is a good idea, it's the increasingly acrobatic Legolas. I almost hate to think what he'll get up to in the final installment. But I'll still go and see it!All in all, this is a worthy follow-up to FOTR and well worth your time. It will certainly be making an appearance in my DVD collection as soon as the extended version is released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

One of the vastest movies ever,"""The Fellowship of the Ring"" introduced audiences around the world to a brave and admirable new world. It was an epic movie, that gathered fans and awards all around the globe. But when compared with the second outing, the first movie fades like a modest memory. ""The Two Towers"" is probably one of the greatest and biggest fantasy pictures ever. The plot of ""Fellowship"" was straight, following nine characters on their journey to cast the ring in the fires of Mount Doom. This movie catches up where the other one has finished, taking us through three separate journeys of three sets of characters, and establishing a kind of rivalry among which adventure is more epic. The stage is set for an unmissable and certainly unforgettable ride, with countless highpoints, too many of them to pick one - from the initial hair-raising ride with Balrog, to the climatic battle of Helm's Deep. Served by the best special effects this side of Jar-Jar  Binks (Gollum is one of the greatest achievements ever in the CGI world), the movie is a fantasy-fest, that succeeds almost at hypnotic level. Served by a powerful score by Howard Shore, ""The Two Towers"" is set for another bunch of awards - and makes us expect a bone-chilling final third. Without a doubt, the most spectacular film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

"A fantastic, flawless second act. And maybe slightly better...","It isn't easy spending 5+ years of your life making a film version of the most beloved books of the 20th century. Peter Jackson and his team knew this and have shown such a wonderful respect for the material, and turned it into the film events of the century which has just started. Fellowship was an amazing feat, flawless and it warped us into Middle Earth. It was hard waiting for the next part, but it's here and it is amazing as well. I truly admire Peter Jackson for the decision on not connecting the first two films with ""rolling text"" or what has previously happened. You just continue the story and it is so powerful. It feels like you're home, like you never left. You have Frodo and Sam in one quest, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in another and then a bit of Merry and Pippin. Plus new characters and creatures and the film flows flawlessly. It's a flawless second act, where the only fault is that we have to wait another year for the conclusion. Yes, The Two Towers parts the most from the novels (PJ has himself stated) but it isn't that much. Films will never be as great or the same as the books, it is simply not possible, yet the impossible task is near perfection in PJ's version of the trilogy.There is a lot more action in The Two Towers, understandably, yet it finds time to develop the depth behind the new characters, enhance the olders ones and make us feel for them all. I felt the ring's influence on Frodo so much, I felt Sam's pain as his best and trusted friend, I felt the change in Merry and Pippin, I felt the transition from the Grey to the White, Aragorn's fighting skills were superb, as were emotional difficulties with his troubled love to Arwen, Gimli as the comic sidekick works perfectly and Legolas is great as always. There are many scenes I could point out, but me and three friends went together and after the film we all sat in awe and questioned each other afterwards: How is this possible??? The battle at Helm's Deep must be and will be considered one of the greatest moments in film history. The tension built up until the moment the first arrow is shot... wow - an amazingly big WOW!! Howard Shore has developed his amazing score further and Emiliana's ""Gollum song"" is hauntingly good, Lesnie's cinematography is perfect, costumes, make-up and visual effects ... never better! And if you are in doubt, ask Gollum!! A powerful performance by a cgi-character!! (Andy Serkis was magnificent)...I could count more persons (actors, crew-people) but I'm trying to finish without bursting to tears... yes, I almost cried because I was so heavily influenced. I was in awe! And I still am. This is what cinema is about, pure escapism and more than that... fulfilling it with such a fantastic, flawless second act. PJ: thank you for your brilliant piece. It may be slightly better than the Fellowship, which I didn't think was possible. It only makes me more anxious in seeing Return of the King.

To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better. The battle for Gollum's mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story I'm beginning to wish would never end.

My third comment of this stunning film.,"Hey, I just HAVE to comment on this wonderful film AGAIN to start the new year off.I, who am known by my friends and family as a ""Lord of the Rings"" obsessee, went to see this film opening night with high expectations. Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job with the first installment, I felt no need to worry about the second being any worse. I went in shaking like a leaf, full of anticipation and excitement. I left dazed and limp. Like the first film, the special FX are incredible, the acting superb, the landscape breathtaking, the creatures believable, and the sound editing mind-blowing. I must comment specifically on the latter two, using the Ents as an example. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull off a walking, talking, thinking tree. I was more worried about Treebeard being believable, than I was Gollum. I needn't have fretted over it. The floor of the theatre actually rumbled when Treebeard talked, an aspect of his personality and character that Tolkien described vividly in the books. 	 The acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality. That was such a powerful and moving scene, my eyes watered. Peter Jackson captured him beautifully, showing that he isn't entirely evil but isn't entirely good, making him an incredibly sad character that twists and tugs at your emotions. His Gollum matches Tolkien's Gollum perfectly.Aragorn giving battle commands in Elvish on the walls of Helm's Deep were also great scenes -- speaking fluently and powerfully, the fierceness in his voice mixed with the determined look in his eyes was thrilling to watch. Elijah Wood was also amazing, somehow altering his feelings toward the Ring and actually becoming a different person. This I found impressive, since they shot totally out of sequence when they made the movies.Merry and Pippen, who provided much of the comic relief in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" still have a certain cute flare, but are much more aware of the seriousness of the situation now that they are alone and without the protection of the Fellowship. They seemed to have handed over the puns and cute lines to Gimli. 	 Bottom line: GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Even if you don't like fantasy (which I didn't until I saw ""The Fellowship of the Ring""), the Battle of Helm's Deep is well worth the seven bucks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up.","The well-awaited sequel to the original has come and doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up. ""The Two Towers"" picks up where ""The Fellowship"" left off and the second chapter hardly miss a walloping beat.Most of the cast returns here with the additions of Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, and a very slimy Brad Dourif who appear here.The remaining members of ""The Fellowship"" have taken different paths since the first one ended and the encounters here are even more hair-raising. Frodo and Sam are heading to Mordor with assistance of the (psychologically and physically warped) creature Gollum while Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas are searching for Merry and Pippin, who were abducted and wind up running into a few surprises - one being Gandalf, who appears here as ""Gandalf the White"" instead of Grey and the other is what happened in Rohan.There's even one subplot where Aragorn (Mortenson) himself is now attracted to a king's daughter (Otto) while he still has the affection for Arwen (Liv Tyler). In a lesser movie, it might be a distraction, but here, it's not.Like the original, the battle scenes are frightening especially of the last ones that takes a half an hour. That fierce battle reminded of a quote from ""Platoon"" where a soldier says ""The beast is out there and he's hungry tonight."" and to me, the fight is like ""Platoon"" with swords and axes instead of guns and gernades.""The Two Towers"" is strong all-around as the first one was, but since it's the middle chapter. The energy isn't as high here, however; it makes up with the intensity. And maybe this time, the movie might get ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Best Films Ever Made,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy have to be the best three films ever made. They are masterpieces made when films used practical effects and a bit of CGI, and this truly makes these films works of art. From the set design, costumes, soundtrack, cast, special effects etc. Everything about these films is sheer perfection unrivalled. This is film making at its finest. I remember watching The Fellowship for the first time when I was about 11/12. I was utterly mesmerised. I'm now 32 and I have lost count of how many times I've rewatched these films.

"The movie is great, but the directors cut is awesome!!!!","The movie itself feel like a summary for the directors cut, and it got several times better as a movie.

From a literary masterpiece comes another exceptional film!,"Those who would claim that The Two Towers is sub-par just because Peter Jackson did not religiously adhere to the book are being entirely unreasonable.  I would remind them that although Tolkien was a literary genius, he was not a screenwriter or a film maker.  Jackson did an exceptional job with this latest work by sifting through Tolkien's massive work and accentuating the portions which have the greatest amount of cinematic appeal.  Remember that film is an entirely different form and medium for artistic expression and should be treated as such.  Enjoy the film for its incredible story, the beauty of the New Zealand landscape, the formidable acting, and the absolutely mesmerizing visual effects.  This trilogy will without a doubt be remembered as one of the all-time great achievements in film.  Excellent work Mr. Jackson!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Visually Epic,"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is a cinematographic masterpiece, that holds up extremely well after 22 years. It's a classic, engaging tale of good vs evil, with some of the filming locations being simply breathtaking.By far the best aspect about this film is the large scale battles. It's so chorographically put together, there's always something going on in the background. The best part of this is that it's grounded in realism. Take for instance the scene where the suicide bomber blows up the wall. The debris flies out and hits both the orcs and human alliance. It truly feels incredibly immersive.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Two Towers is only the 2ND part of a TRILOGY!,"To everyone who gave a negative review,Would you please comment sensibly? Look, this is the second part of a trilogy. You are really watching a 9-hour movie shown to you in 3 parts. All the character building is done in the first installment. The second movie is more to advance various characters' relationships and moving the story of the war further.Do you see the frailty of humans, dwarves and elves (who are supposed to be immortal)?? Do you feel the heroes clinging on to their hope in the impossibility of their situations? Do you see the variety of personalities that made up the people in Helm's Deep? The commoners? The warriors? The knights? The defenders of the weak? Or do you just see a story that has been dragged for 3-hours?I believe some are critical about how Peter jackson omitted out or changed certain portions of the story. People, he is trying to do his best to give us the best interpretation of the very lengthy and often long-winded story written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Believe me, going through the length of the 3 books was quite torturous (even though I think it is a modern classic). If he were to be as true to the books as some of you want it to be, he would probably be better off making the nine segments that made up the 3 books!! By then most of you would have lost much interest over some of the very exhausive and boring parts of the entire story.Be very grateful Mr Jackson has given us the best fantasy epic yet! Then think about this: can you do better?!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Gollum is the real hero,"Wasn´t really dissapointed w/ the first movie, but this 2nd part was way better. Critics have already claimed that this is the ""action"" part of the trilogy, but I found it to also have more depth and psychological (although archaic) undertones. I wish I was ten.. or maybe I am, at least these days you are sort of allowed to admit u feel 10 years old. Peter Jacksons splattermovies r nice but I consider this and heavenly creatures as his best up to this date. Let´s face it, Gollum is the most important character in the Tolkien saga. Come on mr.

Two Towers,"The Two Towers is a great movie and was well done. But I don't like it as much as the first because the first is cooler and more adventurous. I think it needs to have more action. Even though i loved it, and even though I love Lord of the Rings, i think it needs more action, adventure and more ideas. I hate the fact that the Fellowship broke and the fact that everyone is going every which way. I think someone should go to J.R.R.Tolkiens dead door and yell in his face about it.

Convoluted interpretation of the Two Towers,"Firstly,let me say the Two Towers is visually Stunning with Gollum and Helms Deep as the two standout features in an otherwise ambiguous and convoluted interpretation of the book. By this I mean Peter Jackson has misinterpreted the book in his own image and likeness.Secondly, The Two Towers concern Orthanc and Minas Morgul, that guards the secret entrance to Mordor (not Bara-dur )......please see last page of The Fellowship of the Ring (Hardback Ed. illustrated by Alan Lee. Pub. by Harper Collins )In the book Eowyn is left behind as shield maiden to look after her people after Theodens departure at Meduseld (Edoras ).She certainly does NOT leave with the King for Helms Deep. This makes nonsence when in the third book Aragorn see's her before riding to Dunharrow and The Paths of the Dead refusing her to join his company.Frodo does Not go to Osgiliath but is left with Sam and Gollum in the forest by Faramir to journey to the cross-roads and the Stairs of Cirith Ungol.At No point does the Nazgul try to take the Ring from Frodo.......Pure Fabrication.The Ents DO decide to help Merry and Pippin to go to War against Saruman with the help of the Huorns. Where are the Huorns at Helms Deep that help to annilhate the fleeing Orcs????Where is the confrontation with Gandalf and Saruman, the breaking of his Staff and the Palantir being thrown by Wormtongue at the Company.Where is the ride to Minas Tirith with Gandalf and Pippin after he has looked into the Palantir?Finally and most important where is Shelob? why does the film not finish, as the book, with this superb cliff-hanger?There are far too many annomalies in this convoluted interpretation of the Two Towers........especially from some one purportavely to have read the books in such detail.

Incredible visuals - a stunning spectacle,"The Two Towers is a great film, maybe not a masterpiece, but certainly a milestone. What's amazing is the ridiculous amount of illiterately posted reviews that attempt to somehow diminish the accomplishment of this film, which is truly amazing. While it lacks character development of FOTR, this is not a huge flaw, since we know the main players from before. Gollum is noteworthy for his complexity, especially being  CG character.

"Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.","This is the film adaptation of the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It follows the surviving characters from `The Fellowship of the Ring' as they continue their dangerous quest. The visual style, storyline, cinematography, acting and special effects all combine to create another milestone in filmmaking. I visited New Zealand shortly before the filming started there for the trilogy, and I actually read the novel `The Two Towers' while I was there. I could not help but project the landscapes I saw while I was there into to the book I was reading. Seeing these same landscapes now immortalized in the film version is just amazing. Some of the changes between the film and the book are quite drastic, but they should be accepted as they are two entirely different art forms that sometimes cannot be directly translated. The acting is very good, although there are many actors who have to share the three hour run time, so we only get a brief taste of many of them. The main characters are still engrossing, and the computer generated character `Gollum' is utterly convincing and realistic, almost heartbreaking at times. This film contains some of the most advanced special effects in any film, and part of their appeal is in the way they are used. Instead of blatantly using flashy effects in every scene like other directors, Jackson instead tries to use them discretely. During most of the battle scenes it seems entirely possible that we are witnessing thousands of extras, not computer generated effects, acting out the battle. Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Very entertaining, but less than the original","Let it be fairly said that this is a highly entertaining movie, with a wonderful storyline, good acting, and great special effects. Nonetheless, it did not bowl me over the way The Fellowship of the Ring did, and I suppose it's simply that the standard of the first movie was so high, wildly exceeding expectations, that it was hard for this movie to have the same impact. And somehow Frodo became less sympathetic in this movie, probably a reflection of the ring's growing power over him. Still, the battle scenes were wonderful, and I happily paid my money to see it. I don't think I'll buy the video, though, which says something about the difference from Fellowship, which I got as soon as it was available.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
I'd rather look forward to Return of the King,"The Battle of Helm's deep is just good to the eyes for a few minutes, I got very fatigued while watching it, I only bought Gimli's comic relief and Gollum's psychopathic performance.

The Bridge,"Note: this is a review of the extended edition.The middle portion of the story, obviously, serves as a bridge between the beginning and the end. Thus, ""The Two Towers"" focuses mainly on character development and expanding on the political circumstances of Middle Earth. In this way, it may seem to be the least eventful of the trilogy, but honestly it sets up a lot of things for the finale.In terms of production design, not much more can be said for this one. The trilogy was all filmed simultaneously. So the trilogy maintains its consistency of world class production quality.A superb masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Peter Jackson may be the gutsiest director of all time...,"I've been reading a book entitled ""The Making of The Lord of the Rings"" which details the processes involved in completing the three movies of such epic scale.  Seriously, just one of these films would be the pinnacle for many directors, but Peter Jackson has done the ""impossible"" and created at least two movies that will go down in history as a couple of the most ambitious and titanic fantasy adaptions ever made.  I only know a little of what to expect in December 2003, but if the previous two films are any indication it will be a grand spectacle.I've seen the Two Towers in theaters three times so far, giving it the most in-theater replay value of any movie in my history.  The reasons I keep coming back are several...epic battle scenes, whether they take place in ancient Rome, on the battlefields of Vietnam or France or in medievel England are something that have taken over movies of the last few years - The Two Towers creates the longest and greatest battle I've ever seen on film, an hour passes like minutes as we watch Helm's Deep almost fall then rise and conquer.  Strong characters like Viggio Mortensen's Aragorn and the amazing CGI Gollum made me want to see their performances again and again.There were a few Hollywood moments that I didn't remember seeing in FOTR and that I could've done without - Legolas riding the shield down the staircase at Helm's Deep and the comic ""relief"" of Gimili.  These small moments taint an otherwise seemless movie, but not enough to lessen its 10 star rating in my eyes.It was such an amazing undertaking, such a dedicated work and such a risky endevour - these movies could have failed miserably had Mr. Jackson not been 100% dedicated to perfection and details within these films.  Reading the ""Making Of..."" book, I realized even more that we are watching history unfolding and massive standards being set for future films of this and all other genres.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

Quest of accomplishing the impossible continues,"A reader amazed by J.R.R.Tolkien's world might say that 'The Fellowship of the Ring' makes justice to the book. Not all such readers would agree, but in my opinion, 'The Two Towers' makes something more. The first film had just to visualize the story from the first book with minor changes. The second one had to give the story a new and clearly defined structure. This task was almost perfectly accomplished. Also, it is a delight to see TT being different from FOTR. The first film often reminds of a colourful fairy-tale. The second one is more like a historical movie. Realism of one of the main storylines makes such movies like 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart' look a bit like a fantasy. Of course, there are amiable fairy-tale like moments, but character development and action are primary elements. These are perfectly balanced. There is more character development than in the book, and the performance from the actors adds a lot to it. Aragorn is perfectly depicted as firmly stepping towards his kingship. There are all aspects of Frodo's psychology, what makes me to abandon all fears about the ability of the third film to express the darkest ones. Gollum, based on astonishing performance, is alive. His big eyes make him similar to Frodo, a nice visualization of a not too explicit writer's idea. The action, especially the battle, is as capturing as 'The Matrix', while avoiding trivialization of death, so common in the movies.The film is impressive on all levels. There is a digital army, which does not look as such, and there are lots of subtle details like a flag of Rohan landing under the feet of Aragorn's horse. Visual effects? There were two or three. Everything else was REAL. The cinematography is breath - catching. The score is amazing. A certain theme is enough to remind a viewer of a location or event without naming them.What could one expect after FOTR and TT? The 'Return of the King' most likely will complete the seemingly impossible quest of moviemaking. 'The Lord of the Rings' as a whole will certainly be one of the best films ever made. For many people, at least.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Balancing act.,"My theory with the Lord Of The Rings films has always been that the stuff that is good gets better with each film, but the stuff that doesn't work as well unfortunately gets worse. Whilst this means the very best moments of the franchise might still be yet to happen for film 2, there's no doubt a balancing act that is playing out as the stakes of the battles gets bigger and the adventures of the heroes get grander, whilst the sadder, darker moments start to creep into the edges of this film. Overall, for upping the grandeur of the already fantastic part one without delving into what makes much of part three an exercise in patience, this film rounds off as the best one in the series for me personally - just don't fret about the extended directors cut too much, most of that stuff whilst good in its own right, was better left on the special features disc.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Part II of the greatest undertaking in the history of film!!,"This movie overall is even better then the theatrical release of ""Fellowship of the Rings""!! (it still falls shy of the special edition).  It is important to remember that this is not a sequel, and thank God Peter Jackson and Co. didn't try to make a sequel out of it.  Though of course the setting, plot, and characters are the same, there is little similarity between the films.  There is no replication of the movements of the first film like most sequels because this is the same story..  We've had our (unrequested) one year intermission and now the first movie is finally continuing, placing us in the middle of freytag's (sp) pyramid.  The action is rising without any cause for such things as an introduction.. exactly as it should be.  Hardcore book fans (such as myself) will see many departures from the book, Jackson was not quite as good about following this one to the letter, but as a whole the movie was such a great work that those blasphemies can be forgiven: I've seen it twice and I'm going back tomorrow. They may have made changes but they didn't make any mistakes.  SEE THIS MOVIE AT ANY AND ALL COSTS!

An Excellent Way to Spend 3 Hours of Your Lifetime.,"You've all heard about it. You've all read the books. You've all seen the first movie. You've all 'wowed' at the $800 million FOTR made worldwide. You've all waited a bloody 11 months to once again, become lost in a world of Tolkien, where Elves, Hobbits, Orcs, Dwarves, and more reign.The Two Towers, film two in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was said to be one of the biggest challenges filmaking would ever come upon. First, there was Fellowship, which, needless to say, was absolutely magical. How could any film follow that up? And there was Return of the King behind 'TTT', so that meant that this movie would not even have an official beginning nor end. Almost as if it were doomed to fate, TTT stood on the brink of anticipation for almost a year.The anticipation is over now, and Tolkien fans will definitely NOT be disappointed.The Two Towers, once again with Peter Jackson's magical touch, immediately draws the audience into Middle-Earth within the first breathtaking scene of the Cahadras. It has a darker, more dangerous side than of Fellowship, while still maintaining the rich magic of Middle-Earth. TTT is packed with action, deceit and doubt. The plot, wicked and black, definitely sets the mood for an extremely tight three hours. Surprises leap from every scene in all circumstances. Much as I wish I could, I'm not here to spoil anything, so we'll go right into the realistic side of the film.Yet again, the actors and actresses of this film give stunning performances. Orlando Bloom, Legolas, actually does useful things instead of constantly saying, 'Oohh.Orcs!' like in Fellowship. Gimli becomes the comic relief, with all the mirth directed from the Rohirrim toward his height. A big shock was Aragorn, portrayed by Viggo Mortensen. In film one, he was the quiet, brave warrior. However, TTT reveals a side of him that's passionate. Aragorn, burdened with the loss of his love and yet another possible woman, is faced with many situations in which death mocks his face. Viggo was every bit of Aragorn as anybody could be, and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actor. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and the other hobbits also give entralling performances.Then, there's the new characters. Gollum, Treebeard, Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Grima, etc. are all introduced. Each character is protrayed exquisitely, through his/her choices and actions. However, one disappointment was Treebeard. He, personally, did not look like a 'tree' to me. But Gollum's performances makes up for Treebeard's lack of. Although at times one can see he is definitely a fake, there are others when the audience questions his reality or not. His movements, snakelike and crafty, give the perfect image of what Smeagol is.And now, the big question. Is TTT better than FOTR? I say, YES! There are some weak points, but there are more strong ones. There's more depth, more failure, more reality. The Two Towers has lived up to FOTR, maybe even surpassed. Anybody who has ever imagined or dreamed should go and see it. As for those who despise fantasy, this movie should change your opinion, because it's probably as good as any movie will get during this era.My rating: If I could, an 11, but alas, no such choice. 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Was it worth the wait?,"I must say, after TFOTR, I was truly excited to see the next installment. And, like many others before me here have said, it was a disapointment. Farimir made cruel.  Treebeard made hasty.  Saruman and Wormtongue's role made much less visable.  No Huorns. No Grisnak.  No thrown palintir. What's going on here?Yes, it is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, no longer Tolkien's.  That fact has made me very sad.  And where I saw the first film numerous times, this I've seen twice - can not recommend it to anyone - and can see it no more.  It is a shame that a project so well started, could not be continued.Perhaps Peter Jackson could not find enough in the 2nd book to hold his interest, so he made up his own story.  It's not enough that the story truly belongs to Aragorn - but we have to be hit over the head, repeatedly, to let us know Aragorn is the hero.  It's not enough for Frodo to struggle admirably.  He has to be turned to ""the dark side"".  It's not enough for Gollum to be villaneous.  He has to be made the sympathetic character.If this is how the third film is going to be treated, I think that seeing it one time may be more than too much!",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Loved it, wanted more, and less","I literally grew up with Lord of the Rings; a map of Middle Earth hung on the living room wall next to the map of my  own local county, and I didn't know it was a fictional place until I was about 12. So my first view of Jackson's Hobbiton had me weeping with joy. I truly love the vision that has brought these stories to life. I would only wish for a teensy bit more adherence to the original... and canforgive the loss of Bombadil. I think that Return of the King will definitely get a Best Picture Oscar with the understanding that it encompasses the trilogy offilms. I hope Jackson will undertake The Hobbit while he still has his Gandalf and Bilbo.As for the Two Towers:You know, if they hadn't taken the time to throw Aragorn off a cliff, they might have been able to fit in the the Huorns.And then there's that thing with Faramir.The Wargs need work; they look a bit rubbery.But, I almost completely loved it. I think Viggo Mortensen's growing intoAragorn's character as he goes along. It's an interesting performance; Aragorn is being slowly revealed over time just as in the book. Gollum is beyond mywildest nightmares; Gandalf is permanently inhabited by Sir Ian (and I suspect vice versa as well).  The film is way above and beyond any comments I couldmake about it.I hope that Return of the King will show Jackson's best efforts to adhere faithfully to the original book. Less time wasted on the battle scenes, more time on the emotional conflicts and resolutions. It will be a much richer film for that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Masterpiece,"It is a hazardous business, watching much anticipated films, especially when those are based upon greatly loved existing works - the new Star Wars films or the Judge Dredd movie are good examples. When it comes to a work that touches people so deeply, everyone has their own very personal opinions about how things should look, about which characters or events are most important and about how many alterations are acceptable. Some hold that if the story is not to be re-created exactly then it should not be done at all; others hold that as long as the spirit of the source material is maintained we should accept any changes that are made.I am one of the lucky ones, as my vision of LotR and Peter Jackson's vision are remarkably similar. When I watched The Two Towers it was as though (with a few exceptions) my own imaginings had been sucked out of my head, polished, tweaked, filled out and generally improved, and then projected onto a giant white screen with Dolby surround sound accompaniment. I didn't mind the changes, and I didn't mind the fact that the film ends before the book does because I was too busy falling in love with the second part of what I consider to be the greatest cinematic work of all time.Citizen Kane? Unimaginative! Star Wars? Old Hat! I know this will sound really tragic, but there were points during the film (and also, I found, when watching the extended DVD version of The Fellowship yesterday afternoon) where the vision before me was so exquisite and captured so well my understanding of the book that I worried I would embarrass myself by bursting into tears! To put it simply, there may be a few other films that achieve to greater effect individual aspects of this film, but as a whole experience LotR is, to me, simply without equal; no other film even comes close. This realisation of Tolkien's great classic is the pinnacle of a hundred years of film making, and I would compare it with the Sistine Chapel, St Peter's cathedral or Beethoven's Midnight Concerto as one of humanity's truly great artistic creations.I do feel deeply for those fans who do not find Jackson's interpretation as wonderful as I do, and I am sorry that some do not see him as the great visionary that many others do. All I can suggest is that next time you watch the Two Towers, try and forget the details of the plot - ignore the alterations and the differences in interpretation and try to remember how you felt when you first read the books. Hopefully, with time, you will learn to love this film as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

I wanted to scan every corner of the screen so I would not miss a thing. I wish I didn't have to wait almost a year for the extended DVD!Certainly it was much darker than FOTR but it was paced just perfectly. Three hours went by way too fast. My favorite is still Legolas...perfect casting, and just watch his moves!10 out of 10 if there ever was one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
An amazing achievement,"The Two Towers is an excellent movie.  The special effects, in particular, are extremely well done.  You really get a great sense of the massive amounts of people/orcs involved in the battles.  That sense of a huge crowd/army is something that The Two Towers achieves, that no other film has ever come close to matching.Gollum/Smeagol is such an amazing character in the book and I was very happy to see him become what is destined to be, a classic movie character.  At times, he seemed a little bit too bright, which gave him away as a CG character.  But, there were also times where he looked so incredibly real, that you cannot help but view him and watch him as you would a regular, ""human"", character.  Andy Serkis deserves a nomination for the character he helped create, and The Two Towers should win the Academy Award for Best Special Effects because of what has been achieved with Gollum/Smeagol alone.Seeing the continued battle between Gandalf and the Balrog was so good, it had me wishing that I had my DVD remote with me so I could watch it again and again.  It opens the movie with a bang and it resonates so strongly, it's kind of difficult for the other things in the beginning of the movie to feel as important.That feeling of ""importance"" is not as apparent in The Two Towers as it was in The Fellowship of the Ring.  Of course, it IS a ""middle"" movie, and that important feeling is going to be somewhat missing, regardless of what happens.  But I think it's more the pacing and flow of The Fellowship that makes it seem like a more ""important"" movie.Scripting and filming HUGE battle scenes is extremely difficult.  But Peter Jackson set the bar so high with Fellowship, I was expecting even more this time.  Unfortunately, we don't get as many ""bad-ass"" moments in Two Towers, as we did in Fellowship.  As I already stated, being able to witness a battle that has so many characters fighting against each other is absolutely incredible.  But, I was hoping to see more examples of how Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are superior warriors to the rest of the masses.  In the first movie, I was blow away by how calm Legolas was while he stabbed an orc in the eye with an arrow, then shot the same arrow at another Orc.  I wanted to see more of that sort of thing.  I wanted to see more of Gimli as a fearless and accomplished warrior, and less of him being the comic relief.  But, perhaps those are just things that I selfishly wanted to see on the screen. As things are, I really can't complain.  It's incredible and it needs to be seen.The two worst parts (and these are VERY minor) of the movie are: 1)The Aragorn/Arwen love story 2)Legolas on a skateboardI understand the use of Aragorn/Arwen love story, but I feel that it interrupts the natural flow of the movie.  Basically, it doesn't fit and takes WAY too long.During the battle of Helm's Deep, Legolas slides down a stone staircase on an arm shield.  This feels totally contrived and remember thinking, ""What movie is this? Is this Two Towers (xXx Remix)?""  It was just weird and out of place.But whatever.  I'm being over critical.The movie is very, very good.  It's not quite as good as the first one, but it's still very good.  If you liked the book, you will love this movie. If like huge battle scenes, you will love this movie.  If you loved the first movie, you HAVE to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
LoTR:  TTT has got to be one of the best movies I've watched,"LoTR:  TTT has got to be one of the best movies I've watched.  Not only because I enjoyed the work of the actors, but also because the great book, ""The Two Towers"" by J.R.R.Tolkien is a masterpiece.  I never expected anything good from the movie, because the movies usually make the great books look and sound stupid, but on the contrary after watching the movie a lot of people I know decided to take time and read the book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Again, magnificent","So its 1 year later and we all own the first film on DVD...or should do.Everyone has high expectations for this film and by god were those met. The perfomances that made the first film so beleiveable are all here as are the special effects and amazing locations. This film however is the worst out of the trio. And its down to the fact that too much time is given to tree beard. Although he was done very well and he is an important part in the story...even i hav to admit (and being a mega lotr fan) he did waffle on a bit. Another bad criticism I have is that Gollum, although done well didnt meet my expectations. In fact the model of Gollum in this film is different to the one in the first film. I dont know what it is about him but I felt that Gollum could have been better. Its probably because he's so babyish and in the third film he does get alot better because the evil side comes out. The battle of Helms Deep is ground breaking in every way and is held together by strong performances by Viggo Mortensen and Bernard Hill. Whereas Legolas the elf only seems to be in the film to do cool stunts and Gimli to bring more comedy into the serious situations.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"Ok, this will hold me til the third one...","Peter Jackson continues to astound with the second installment of the Trilogy, creating another transcendant film excursion into pure fantasy. My favorite part was when Gandalf made his initial appearance - that literally made me suck my breath in (which hardly ever happens to me...in a movie theatre, I mean).",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
More powerful than expected...,"A long time Tolkien fan, I arrived at the theatre with a bit of apprehension (or was it excitement?).  The Fellowship of the Ring had not disappointed me, and was wonderful.  So it was with hope in my heart that the same would be provided by Two Towers as I awaited the curtain to go up on this second installment.  It surpassed my expectations.To say that Rohan was an indescribable splendor on screen would be an understatement.  The residents of Canterbury, NZ are lucky indeed to have such a pristine and beautiful place in their backyard.  Peter Jackson did a wonderful job bringing the people of Rohan alive as I felt they were not in the books.Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are developed well here and their actors put on an unforgettable show.  Astin's character of Sam shines as does Wood's Frodo.But Smeagol/Gollum!  If this portrayal of character (not just the animation) doesn't win an Oscar, I don't know what should.  Superbly done.My only criticisms may be the treatment of Arwen, Elrond and Galadriel as they seemed a bit out of synch with the rest of the movie.  Also, Faramir seemed a bit harsh compared to his character in the book.  Some of my friends and colleagues found the Ents disappointing, but I did not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The worst movie I have seen this year...,"I was really looking forward to The Two Towers. I thought that ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was good, but just so-so. Certainly not worth all the hype and Oscar nominations.This film bored me to tears for the first 2 hours. The last hour was good - if only the rest of the film could have been as interesting. I literally almost walked out of the theatre during the first two hours - and I NEVER walk out on movies.I can't believe it was nominated for Best Picture this year. I can't believe that everyone who voted for it actually SAT THROUGH it! No way!Yes, the cinematography, sound, and other technical aspects are all top notch. But that doesn't make up for the flaws, namely:lack of a plot - or at least an understandable plotlack of a reprise (however briefly) of what happened in the first movie to remind stupid people like me where we are in the story. I couldn't follow what was going on.way too too too longmany elements seemed stolen from other films - perhaps they were visualized as they were in the book, but since I haven't read the book I don't know. Moving trees like in ""Wizard of Oz"". Gollum is the same as Dobby from ""Harry Potter"". The dwarf with the height problem is really identical to Hagrid from same ""Harry Potter"". Even the big elephants reminded me of the huge walking things from ""The Empire Strikes Back.""If you want to see beautiful footage of New Zealand, watch the Travel Channel.The ONLY saving grace out of this whole movie was Sean Astin, whom, as in the first one, is the only one who seems to be really emoting and who seems to understand what he is saying. He is a great actor.I want my 3 hours back!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Jackson's second installment of Lordo f the Rings franchise is excellent.,"After grabbing critical and commercial acclaim to his first installment of his trilogy, Director Peter Jackson moves on to the second film. The Two Towers is excellent, a delight to watch. Andy Serkis's performance added with the CGI make Gollum, a convincing critter, one of the highlights of the film. The battle scenes look amazing on camera and the film amps up the climatic scope to make the movie better than the first and it works! The story follows Frodo and Sam, still on their way to Mordor as they face trials and tribulations of their journey. Meanwhile Aragorn and their former companions wage war on the forces of evil. Arresting, epic entertainment that nicely sets up the grand finale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"

The Perfect follow-up to the perfect trilogy first chapter,"The movie begins with an excellent pan over the Misty Mountains, and ties back with the fall of Gandalf the Grey. This film is even better edited than its predecessor, and totally lives up to the hype following the superb success of the first. The book was superbly written by JRR Tolkien to build up to the Helms Deep battle which is the high point of this movie. From there, the book follows further on to build up even further to the ""great battle of our time"", which is to be fought at Minas Tirith, Gondor, which is superbly directed by Peter Jackson. Meanwhile, Tolkien's greatest character comes to life further, and the film becomes even deeper and compelling than the first. One of the greatest sequels ever made, truly surpasses its original!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
"not as good as ""FotR""","The film delivered.  Helm's Deep was fantastic.  Gollum lived up to and surpassed expectations.  There are some flaws, though.  So much from the novel was left out or altered.  Arwen going to the Grey Havens?  Not even mentioned in the literature.  Elves at Helm's Deep?  I don't think so. Frodo and Sam taken to Osgiliath?  Never happened.  What was with keeping Merry and Pippin with the Ents the entire time?  They do so much more in the actual story.  Eomer was never banished by Grima in the novel. Okay, enough nit-picking.  Overall, the film was spectacular.  The pacing was a bit off, though.  As I said, it felt like Merry and Pippin didn't do anything, and the end was not appropriate at all.  There's a lot of plot to be accounted for in the third film.  I suppose, though, that the feeling of detatchment is because this film really is a continuation of the first.  The opening sequence detailing Gandalf's fate was amazing.  There was a lot of clapping in the theater.  The film is not a ""10,"" but deserves no less than an ""8.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
The Best Movie Series Ever! ! ! !,"I Dont say this lightly, but this is The Best Movie Series Ever! ! !I have never read the books,but this movie (and its predessor) have got to be the gresatest triumph ever put on film.The only thing I didn't like about ""Lord of the Rings 2: The Two Towers"" movie were the talking trees, and the scene were the trees go to war. That was just too much in my opinion. I'm not blaming the movie makers for that, because I'm sure that material was in the book too(again I've never read the books). Aside from talking Trees going to war, I believe you can dail ""P"" for perfection - this movie delivers all the goods.I have now given both Lord of the Rings movies a perfect 10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
Epic follow-up is not as cohesive as the first,"The massive scale and immense battles in the Two Towers eclipse anything else you will see in modern cinema.  Certain frames are truly overwhelming in scope, yet the ironic trend is that the battle scenes come across as slightly underwhelming and anti-climactic; due to some less than ideal editing and jumping between disparate plot-arcs.Also, excluding the superb realisation of Gollum, characterisation does not match that achieved in Fellowship, which -- just as the novel does -- has a more cohesive narrative.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
One of the best film of all time.,"This is quite possibly one of the most entertaining and engrossing films I've seen in a long, long time.  Sure, other recent films have been really great... Spiderman was a great movie this past summer.  But few are so epic and big that they're grand.  This is a movie that will forever be remembered in cinema history because it contains all of the elements that make a movie stand the test of time.  Lots of movies are forgotten or merely overlooked after a few years pass, but then there are those that you always remember because of the wonderful feeling they bring you when watching them.  You know your watching one of the greats when your completely taken out of your own life, you feel like your IN the movie.  When all your troubles are not on your mind for at least a few hours.  You know it's one of the best movies you've ever seen when everything on screen looks like it is real.  Even the CGI in this movie is merged so well with real shots that you don't really think ""hey that's fake!""  That's quite an accomplishment in today's movies.Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is.. like a lot of films.. a little more interesting than it's original movie, since the plot of the film has basically already been sat in motion and we can jump right into the story and all the action.  But because the three films are really one story and not three seperate stories, like the books themselves, you can't really rate one movie over the other.  Just see it as one big story.... The Lord of the Rings.and of course, who couldn't love this story.  I have a feeling Return of the King is going to be the better of them all.  I can't wait!  It's only a year! ;)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"
