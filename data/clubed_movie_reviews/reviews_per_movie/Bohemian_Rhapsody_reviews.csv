Long live Queen,"I just saw the world premiere and oh boy let me tell you about it:This movie might not be a masterpiece but my heart is filled with such happiness and joy after watching it that I think it's going to burst (sorry for the cheesiness), Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon are so exquisitely portrayed I sometimes forgot it wasn't them, the performances were so on point and so powerful you could feel the energy burst through the screen. ¿Have you seen the famous car scene in Wayne's world? well, now imagine a full room doing the same, people couldn't help but sing along (lets be honest, it's impossible not too).I laughed, cried, sang and wished I could have seen Queen live, this band will live forever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Makes you realise what a loss Freddie was,"This movie was a brilliant portrayal of the mixed up life, and massive talent that was Mercury ... and that is in no way meant to diminish the other fabulous musicians who made up this wonderful band. Whilst Freddie's life and death are quite well documented, his inner turmoil is not - this movie opens this up for all to see, and highlights actions and individuals who had a large influence on his fragile life, both good and horrendously bad. If only he could have been happy with the knowledge that he had one of the best singing voices, if not THE best, that ever fronted a rock band. Rami Malek does a wonderful job of portraying him, and in so many ways has captured his mannerisms to a tee. Loved it, and listening to the music in an IMAX auditorium was brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"The Critics where wrong about the song in 1975,and they are wrong about the movie in 2018","This movie is a must see for any music and movie lover
Queen fan or no Queen fan,anyone who sees this movie will be going through a rollercoaster of Emotions
Beeing it Queens music or the story behind the music
Rami Malek puts down an excellent version of Freddie Mercury, but all the actors play great in this movie

One of my favorites in 75 years,"I'm a 75 yr old Gramma that saw this movie with her son and grandson. We all Loved it!
I ""heard"" Queen music as I worked and raised my 4 children, but never really knew the band it came from.
My children Lived with Queen music, and totally identified with them, especially in their band performances.
My grandson heard Queen because his father played it all the time.
We saw this movie as a family and the movie was about family, friends, and loyalty. The typical band movie is about rising-to-fame, falling-from-fame. This movie is about hanging together as family, as loyal friends ..something we Really need more of today!! The 2 :15 time frame flies by and you're left wanting more...more... more...
Rami Malek is awesome as Freddie! He, his 3 co-stars, last director, music director, and entire crew deserve nominations! See this in a theatre that has great sound where you can appreciate the depth of the music!
One of my most favorite movies in 75 years!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Queen is king!!,"Wow! I feel mind-blown after watching the world premiere yesterday evening. I am whether a megahuge Queen fan (although I really like many of their songs), nor do I know how accurate the storytelling is (, but I suppose pretty accurate since both Brian May and Roger Taylor are co-producers of the film), but I found the movie both intoxicating and moving. I have read some of the professional reviews, and I cannot comprehend their search of documentary wisdom in this movie; this is not a documentary, but an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands. And the film delivers on all aspects. (And the critics were so wrong about the song Bohemian Rhapsody upon its release).As Brian May pinpointed in the interview on the red carpet, he found that the casting was excellent (I don't remember the exact word he used). But he is so right. Every major role is perfectly casted, and all the band members are brilliant. But I must emphasize Rami Malek's role as Freddie. It has Oscar written all over it. What he does, is almost beyond comparison. Chapeau for even taking on this role, and then delivering what he does. Even better, although marginally, than Michael Douglas in Behind the Candelabra. And Gwilym Lee as Brian May is also a bull's eye, but Malek really carries the production on his tiny shoulders. It was like watching our beloved Freddie all over again.Many, many memorable moments, but the Live Aid performance recreated: it is one of the best scenes I have ever seen - and I have seen lots and lots of films. Chapeau for director(s) and producers and the whole team for to me delivering the best film YTD in 2018!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A biopic or more like bio-epic. And a fantastic one.,"What a night this was! I went to the world premiere in my local theatre with the purple carpet event on the big screen and all that jazz.When I saw the first trailer I didn't think much about Rami Malek as Freddie or the whole movie at all since the majority of biopics are generic and pretty much formulaic. Back then, I even considered dropping Sacha Baron Cohen a huge mistake. But boy was I wrong. Malek shined like he's never shone before. I think Susie Figgis outdid herself as a casting director here.Ever since I joined the casting industry, I really started seeing what it means to work here, how important this part of showbiz that is, and how just a single miscast can ruin a project. Susie Figgis is a veteran casting director, known for many big and widely loved projects and she did well here. She did extremely well. Up until the moment I joined this business, I paid little to no attention to the actor ensemble, with the exception of clear miscasts that just stood out and you couldn't unsee it. But yesterday I just sat there, mesmerized. Gwilym Lee did an outstanding job portraying Brian May, in fact, I forgot he wasn't him. Lucy Boynton was one of my absolute favorites, portraying Mary Austin and her love and devotion towards Freddie. And Rami Malek. Oh, boy, Rami *was* Freddie Mercury. While I was sitting there in the theatre and staring at the screen I didn't have a feeling I was watching actors play their parts. I felt like I was watching Queen.I don't have much to say about the plot, or the costumes, the setting, the cast. Everything was close to perfection. A perfect balance of drama and comedy. Exactly how life is.I was five when my dad came to me, kneeled, put his large and on my tiny shoulder and delivered the tragic news about Freddie passing. Queen was basically the soundtrack of my upbringing, so I didn't take the news too well. I wept like I've just lost a dear friend. Dad and I spent the remainder of that afternoon blasting the tracks we oh so loved.Queen has been the soundtrack of my life, therefore it's impossible to have an unbiased opinion about 'Rhapsody', but I must admit I had my reservations at first. But in the end, I loved it. The last twenty minutes of the film I spend sobbing and wiping the tears and mascara tracks from my cheeks. I can't remember the last time I cried this much in a movie. And I don't know if it was the music, Freddie's tragic fate or the relationships he had, both with lovers and his family, or maybe it was an amalgam of everything, but from the first minutes the movie started building up, it rose block by block until the huge skyscraper that the story was, finally concluded and all the lights turned on and it shined like a marvelous gem.Until this day, Live Aid remains the biggest, most epic music event in the history of civilization and it is remembered by millions. And _Bohemian Rhapsody_ did it justice. Malek did justice to Freddie. And I left my seat long after the credits had stopped rolling. The show must go on, and it does.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Truly brilliant.,"For those of us of a certain age Queen, and especially Freddie, defined us. Sitting through this movie I had goosebumps. The casting just works and watching the actors playing May and Deacon you'd be forgiven in thinking someone had access to a time machine. Even Kenny Everett was instantly recognisable.
I left this movie a strange combination of elated and terribly sad. Elated to hear the music, watch the story and yet sad that Freddie was so desperately lonely.
Ultimately, I think Freddie would have approved of the whole thing. His genius and flamboyance shone through.
Truly brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Movie is popular only because Queen is popular,"This has got to be the most overrated film in recent history. Overrated by the audience. Critics got it right this time, even though they rarely do.Rami Malek offered a great impression of Freddie Mercury. But impression it was. He failed to capture the essence, the exoticness of the real Freddie, and his manliness. Rami's acting made Freddie looked like a generic gay man, which Freddie wasn't. Freddie's might have been a weirdo, but never acted like a sissy. At times, his acting simply looked ugly, such as his exaggerated emphasis on Freddie's incisors. You can easily verify what I am saying by searching for videos of the real Freddie Mercury, and you can see the real Freddie never acted the way as portrayed by Rami. Sacha Baron Cohen, the original actor slated to play Freddie, might have been a better choice.The worst part of the movie was the script. Far too much ""creative liberty"" was taken to alter historical events. Omitting details for clarity, adding details to fill in the blanks, compressing events to fit his career in a 2-hour movie, that's normal. But Queen never broke up! Freddie making a solo was never a betrayal! What the heck? As if the life of Freddie bloody Mercury wasn't legendary enough, the writers had to throw in fictional events to fill up the runtime. This is disrespectful to Freddie's legacy and his fans, and at the same time misleading to the youth, into thinking he's a self-centered a-hole (well, more of a self-centered a-hole).So much of the movie was revolved around Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin. Then all of a sudden, in one short scene Jim Hutton was introduced (with yet another unnecessary historical inaccuracy). And that was it. When Jim reappeared at the end of the movie, I almost forgot who he was. Jim was supposed to be the other love of Freddie's life, and the screenwriters made them fell in love in one short conversation, never to meet again until the end?Then finally it comes to the music. There are times the editors cram in the songs for the sake of playing Queen's songs, without adding to the narrative of the movie. Heck, they re-enacted 70% of the whole Wembley concert, and yet you can easily find the original performance even on YouTube. If they had to invest that much runtime in one event, they'd better not skim over other important events... oh, wait. For a proper music biographical film, try ""Ray"" (2004).The movie wasn't bad. Just not worth all the praise it's been getting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Extraordinary & Mind-blowing.,"Rami Malek will be forever one of my favorite actors since the day I've watched Mr Robot, I knew he will be one of the biggest star someday. Freddie Mercury is legend, everyone loves him but not everyone knows his story. Freddy Mercury is fearless, but not everyone knows about his desperately lonely. I dont't know how accurate the storytelling is but this movie is absolutely mind blowing and brilliant, such a perfect tribute to the legend!I'm not saying this movie is perfect or masterpiece, infact this movie has some issues with the director and delayed. But after I walk out of the theater, my heart is filled with joy, tears of happiness, brought so many emotions. That's how you know the movie is fantastic, darling. The casting was brilliant, bravo! I can't get enough with Rami Malek, he obviously worked so hard, Rami Malek pulls off an amazing performance, he just brings Freddie back to life and I don't think you will see any better film about Freddie Mercury again. It's an oppurtunity of a lifetime, every aspects of this movie was executed beautifully. Also the whole cast was so close to perfection!

"It's light and mostly okay, but could have been great","It's not surprising to me that Bohemian Rhapsody was a hit. Queen have always been a popular and well-loved band, and even if some consider it overplayed, the song this film is named after is undoubtedly iconic and quite the musical achievement. What does surprise me is just how much of a hit this was, raking in something close to a billion US dollars worldwide and earning several Academy Awards. If I'd watched it before the hype, I'm sure I would have found it a solid yet potentially unmemorable music biopic and then moved on, only to be surprised when it got the kind of acclaim, box office results, and awards attention it did.It also puts me in a position where much of what can be said about Bohemian Rhapsody has already been said. The criticism when it comes to some aspects of this film have been extensive, so I will briefly say that I agree with many of them. A harder edged look at Freddie Mercury would have been much better, because the film can only scratch the surface when it comes to his lifestyle, partying, and the various partners he had throughout his career. The pacing is a little too frantic, and some scenes are put together in a rather gimmicky, blunt manner (the biggest offender for me was the press meeting scene, where Mercury becomes overwhelmed at all the repetitive questions being thrown at him; it was filmed and edited in a way that I thought would look tacky in a student film, let alone a large scale Hollywood production). Then there's the whole matter of the surviving band members' involvement, including speculation that they wanted to tone down any edgy aspects and also make themselves look good in the process (oh! And give the actors that depict them more screen time. I think a lot of the clunky filmmaking and editing choices come down to those surviving band members wanting to increase the amount of time their personas were in the movie. This creates an awkward sensation where Bohemian Rhapsody is something in-between a Freddie Mercury biopic and a Queen biopic, but failing to truly excel in either regard). And then there's the matter of historical accuracy, which is ignored in some areas, but is far from an unforgivable sin for the most part, as far as I'm concerned.Rami Malek was highly praised for his depiction of Mercury and to be honest, he was good? But not fantastic. I think the fake teeth did a lot of the acting for him, and giving a good impression of a well-known historical figure certainly takes skill, but I'm not as blown away by what he did as many seem to be. Everyone else in the cast ranged from just okay to decent- there weren't really many standouts.The soundtrack is fun but it's Queen, so what else would you expect? Additionally, Bohemian Rhapsody is thankfully not boring; I guess a positive aspect of the frenetic, exhausting pace is that the film is never given the opportunity to drag. It's really the Live Aid concert recreation that saves this movie, and in the end, I almost wished I was watching that for two hours instead of the rest of this movie... which I still can't say is terrible. That concert recreation is a decent pay-off, and the movie is somewhat engaging and with a good (still not great, in my opinion) lead performance at its centre. It just failed to move or entertain or shock or make me think much beyond that. It's a perfect lazy Sunday afternoon movie, but beyond that, include me among the people who otherwise don't really understand what all the fuss was about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.","I'm fan of Queen& Freddie himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest.Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', they are right.First of all, the film distorts a lot of facts from Freddie and Queen's life, and if it were not significant events - I would not care at all, because I understand copywrite and legal issues, but these are important things and all of this should be done better. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he&his family, escaped their own homeland, because of brutal revolution. This could have been the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddie was.I don't accept excuses of many Queen fanatics , that ""this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself"". Because first, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include deeper analysis / truth about Freddie and the band, and second: the band's history is not shown in some great way either. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody ''. The rest is a fast, also quite chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, Queen tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand, that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert. The performance, photography, camera work, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic screenplay, writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Mercury's soul is the scene of conversation in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.But again : when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a shame, if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddie Mercury.In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), didn't rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I thought it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me at the time. Cohen, a remarkable & colorful character himself, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after watching the interview, in which Cohen explained why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him, who played the Queen main singer. He wanted to portray Freddie as a complicated, controversial figure with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist, who mixed his big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.As a result, we got schematic, ""polite"" movie, oh, what an irony - because Freddie Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and they deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie). I guess I'll just wait for another film, bold and great this time, I hope.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Ten minutes in, my little boy turned to me and said , 'mum, I love this already' The film has you right from the get go!

Rhapsody on the music of Queen,"Have a lot of appreciation for Queen. Not a favourite band of mine by all means, but it is difficult to not understand their importance and appeal. They had some iconic songs (namely ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""We Will Rock You"", ""We Are the Champions"" and ""Don't Stop Me Now"") and Freddie Mercury's immediately recognisable vocals and Brian May's virtuosic guitar playing were always out of this world.'Bohemian Rhapsody' fascinated me when hearing about it and became most of my most anticipated films for the year. When hearing some negativity for the film, my expectations lowered a little, but saw it anyway because it did look and sound good. It did turn out to be a good decision, it is good to see that others here loved it and don't agree with the mixed critical reception respectfully.Sure there are clichés (such as what some of the rest of Queen say) , but very few films are not and many are much worse in this regard. Like a lot of biopics, there are inaccuracies that may drive die-hard Queen fans into a frenzy, and the odd factual distortion, but again 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is not the first or worst film to do this and am going to judge it as a film on its own and not on a documentary level.As a film on its own terms, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' has an awful lot to admire. Getting the issues out of the way, the ones that could have been handled much better was the with the revelation of Freddie Mercury's AIDs diagnosis to the rest of the band, could have been done with more tact and less crass (like saying what it was a consequence of) and revealed too early and at the wrong time, and the implications with the phone ringing off post-taking centre stage that the event was a flop when it actually was a triumph.Some of the early parts were a touch rushed as well, Mercury's ascent to stardom could have been less breakneck.However, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is stylishly film and evokes the period beautifully. As to be expected, the songs are incredible and will be embedded in your brain for a long time, then again it is Queen of course. They are affectionately staged and performed in a way that made me remember what made me appreciate Queen in the first place.Didn't find the script that simplistic or cliff-notes like, while there is a nice mix of moment of laughter, tension and tears and enough parts that entertained and informed, if not as in depth as it should. The story is never dull and the Live Aid depiction is both rousing and poignant. It's capably directed and while all the performances are fine if underused, it is Rami Malek's outstanding turn as Mercury that will live long in the memory, true to what made Mercury so interesting a person and performer without being an impersonation.Concluding, impressively done and better than anticipated. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Ok movie,"The songs are great and Rami is ok. I've watched many interviews and Rami's style and mannerisms do not remind me of Freddie Mercury. Young Freddie looks just creepy, though moustache Freddie looks better.The big issue I have is that the major themes and motives in Freddie's life were completely changed. If these plot changes weren't the driving force of the movie, I wouldn't care. I don't mind changing the details of his life to condense the story into one movie, but major changes in how and why he did the things that he did are just deceptive.This movie doesn't just get the reason behind major events wrong, it also changes minor details in a way that's not even believable. Some of the scenes are obviously made up.When so much of the movie doesn't represent his life accurately, I almost start to wonder why they even made this film. It would have been better just to splice some of his concert footage together and put that out instead.I also was not a big fan of the scene jumping from one event to another.

I love Queen and I love Freddie Mercury, but I am truly disgusted at the way this film branded itself on preserving Queen's legacy when all it does is stuff falsehoods into a fictional retelling of the band's history. If you liked this film as a film, that's one thing. But, it is in no way, shape, nor form, the story of Queen.

Or is that I just understood what the makers of Bohemian Rhapsody were trying to achieve.Actually let's start with just that.Bohemian Rhapsody is a tribute to the legacy of Freddie Mercury and also the band Queen. It was primarily made for the fans of the the band and to showcase the band and its history to a new audience.To do this the film primarily uses a straight forward story telling style. This also means that events and time lines have to be condensed and fictionalised to tell that story in just over 2 hours. This also means that many real characters have to amalgamate in to a couple of fictional personas. I personally had no problem with this. I also liked the fact that the film poked fun at future events using also comic casting. Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about.
It seems to me that the critics wanted something that real Queen Fans have no real time for, namely a movie that explores Freddie's wild private life. We know what he did. We know a lot about his wild side. But Queen Fans want a film about the most important elements of Freddie's life. Namely the band and its music.Bohemian Rhapsody does something better.Instead of showing a debauched indulgent life, Bohemian Rhapsody instead shows us a man trying to come to terms with his extraordinary life. It shows how with the help of the truly talented other members of Queen he was able to do that. It also shows his Joy, his loneliness, plus some of his mistakes and missteps along the way, and of course his complex relationship with Mary Astor possibly the one person he truly loved.It tackles his sexuality and some of the aftermath of his partying. It also shows the beginning of his illness. This is all achieved with sensitivity and respect.Now for the music.Bohemian Rhapsody is possibly at its greatest when recreating queen on stage. Using a mixture of real singing from the actors, Queen and Freddie's over dubbing and sound alike artists to create a totally unique feel to Queens songs. Recreations of the bands greatest hits are mixed, to sound fresher than ever. Some even help the movie to move along showing headlines and critic's reviews as the songs play out. Then there's The Live Aid performance. Much like the real concert it almost dwarfs everything that has gone before on film. We the audience really get to experience what it was like to be at that event. Not just from the crowd but from the bands point of view. Almost every highlight from that performance is featured.The performances.Everyone agrees Rami Malek is a revelation as Freddie after about 20 minutes you totally forget that this is an actor. He is Freddie. This can also be said for Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joseph Mazzello playing The rest of the band in fact in the case of Lee the transformation into Brian May is astounding. As the film primary focuses on Freddie you can feel a sorry that aspects of the other members of the band aren't fully explored. Rogers womanising is hinted at but Brian's private life and his relationship with his father are not. John Deacon remains the enigma of the band.
Lucy Boynton gives a carefully measured and sensitive performance as Mary Astor coming to terms with the changes in Freddie's life.
Unfortunately Allen Leech has the unenviable task of playing a composites of some of Freddie's lovers and can be seen as a bit of a cliche villain. But he gives a good account of himself.
As for the rest of the cast. Everyone else is solid.The film begins with Live Ad and ends on that same day.If you're a fan of Queen I defy you to leave your seat as the credits role..
To Sum up. Bohemian Rhapsody is a celebration, not an expose and it should be treated that way by those pay their money to see it..

Bohemian Rhapsody brings it big time!,"Well, the moment we have all been waiting for has finally arrived with the release of the highly anticipated Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. So now just one question remains, was it worth the wait? Well, in my honest opinion, abso-freakin-lutely! This incredible story takes us on the journey of one of the most iconic rock bands of all time and gives us a look at not only the birth and life of the band but a peek behind the curtain into the life of one of music's biggest legends and Queen frontman, Freddie Mercury. From their humble beginnings playing college shows to their historic performance at 1985's Live Aid concert, Bohemian Rhapsody will take you on one hell of a rock n' roll ride.Rami Malek takes on the role of Freddie Mercury with all the charm and swagger that the real man gave off. Never one to be ignored or denied Malek's Mercury is cocky and charming and just captivating to watch. Even through Freddie's highest highs and lowest lows he gives a fantastic performance. Many were worried that with the departure of Sacha Baron Cohen who was originally slated to play a much wilder and dark Mercury, that the film would gloss over Freddie's personal life, but honestly what we get from Malek's version of the film just feels tasteful and right. You don't need to see the binge drinking, drug use, and copious amounts of random sex to know that Freddie used all those things to fill a void in his own soul and it is heavily implied throughout the film without the audience having to attend every party. Instead, we get much more substance and story which just feels way more important. He is the happy-go-lucky frontman, one second and the tortured artist the next and Bohemian Rhapsody does a great job of making you really feel for this man and not just him, but the people around him whom his actions effect. You get a bit of an inside look at his relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boyton (Sing Street). Their romance/friendship is both sweet and heartbreaking to see. I know many were worried this film would downplay his sexuality and instead focus on his relationship with Mary, and while the film does focus on this relationship with her, it definitely does not leave out his sexual exploits with men and his eventual relationship with Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker).While many would like the sole focus of this film to be Freddie Mercury you can't leave out the rest of the band because, let's face it, with them there is no Queen. Freddie's bandmates bring a lot to this picture from the sarcastic and at times confrontational Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy) to the band's voice of reason Brian May ( Gwilym Lee) to the quiet talent of John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello). These guys bring a lot to the table as Freddie's family, friends, and biggest support system. Despite all the over the top requests and ideas of their lead singer, these guys jump in with both feet to fuel the fire and bring us some of the greatest music rock has ever seen. It is pretty awesome to watch on the big screen.Overall, I scored Bohemian Rhapsody with a solid A. This is an entertaining, fun, funny, and at times the heartbreaking film that definitely deserves your attention. Fans of Queen should breathe a sigh of relief because this is a solid movie. So head to the box office and buckle up for one hell of a ride with this rock royalty and allow yourself to be taken away and inspired with Bohemian Rhapsody.Bohemian Rhapsody hits theaters everywhere November 2nd.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Flawed with Inaccuracies and pacing issues, but still a footstomping fun and touching film",The film struggles with pacing issues that cause the first act of the film to move to fast. Not to mention a couple of inaccuracies that's is sure to bug queen fans like it did to me. Other than that the film is really fun and quite touching in other parts especially the live aid scene which was by far the best part. Queens music is fantastic as always but rami malek as Freddie mercury is insanely amazing. Halfway through the movie I forgot I was even watching rami but instead Freddie that's how good he was. The supporting cast is great as well every member of the band feels authentic and realistic. Overall I had an amazing and fun time with bohemian rhapsody despite its flaws. Remember this is a biopic and creative liberties were taken meaning it's not a documentary.,,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Liked it,"Cool movie for sure, I enjoyed it a lot. However, I don't think it should be given 10/10s because it wasnt THAT good. I'll explain why, going through the main different things that made the film:Music (11/10)
Queen rocks. Every song was great.Story/characters (7/10)
At the beginning it was very clunky, not having a main goal or motivation. Also it hopped forwards in time a lot, which can sometimes work in movies, but not to the extent they did it in this one. It just felt rushed. Also a lot of the scenes werent really anything more than just showing us how some of the songs were made, which is interesting, just not relevant to the story. However, later the story gained a driving force as it settled into the time period just before Live Aid. Before, I would say the story was a 5/10 stars, but by the end it probably reached around 9/10, a really solid film by the end. Conflict, important character motivations, and interesting drama were only introduced about halfway into the film. I wish they just started the film then and cut out the beginning.Acting (9/10)
Top notch, of course. The only thing I would say was negative for this was that Malek's acting at the start was a bit shaky, but improved greatly by the halfway point in the film. Perhaps this factor also led to me disliking the start of the movie. All the supporting characters were great as well as Malek. I especially liked the actor who played Brian May, I thought he was perfect for the role.Cinematography (6/10)
Nothing special. Just your average cinematography.Editing (5/10)
This really was the worst element of the film in my opinion. The editing at the beginning of the film was a bit clunky, distracting from the story. My least favorite part was the artificial blurring, especially in the interviewing scene. I assume this was done in editing, not in cinematography, because it looked so unnatural. It was extremely distracting. I think it was meant to make the scene disorienting, but all it did was make me less invested in the movie, because the effect was so annoying.Overall:

Something rarely seen in an Oscar winner...a film that the public actually LIKES and ENJOYS!,"Long ago, I tired of the Oscars. Much of it was because too often the films they picked and the performances they praised were ones that simply were unpleasant and box office poison. In the case of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", however, the film earned nearly a billion dollars at the box office AND managed to win four awards...and one was a major one (Best Actor). What a refeshing breath of fresh air...and what an enhoyable and inspiring film.One thing you should know about me is that I was a history teacher and hate most bio-pics and historical films. This is because too often they play very fast and loose with the facts in order to tell a more cinematic tale. While some of this happens in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", the vast majority of the film seems true and isn't filled with fabrications. Sure, you can find a few examples here and there where the film changes dates and facts to make the story seem more inspirational...but a lot less of this happened than I expected.In addition to generally sticking to the facts, the film had two major things going for it: Rami Malek's amazing performance as well as a strong desire to entertain the audience. The film will definitely get your blood pumping and feet and body moving....and at times it feels like you've been in a time machine and are actually seeing Queen in concert. Overall, exceptionally well done and inspiring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Bohemian Rhapsody isn't the kingly biopic of Queen that it thinks it is.,"Possibly the most frustrating cinema experience I've had all year. Why? Squandered potential. It's Queen. Quite possibly the biggest rock band to ever exist. Influential to millions. Idolised by thousands. The risks they took with their musicality and stage appearances were aspirational. And yet here we have a biopic that, whilst undoubtedly entertaining, just doesn't know what it wants to be. Chronicling the formation of Queen, Freddie Mercury rises to fame as their lead singer and soon starts clashing with the other band members. Malek singlehandedly saved this film. His performance was both transformative and engrossing, occasionally fully embodying Mercury's eccentric personality. The exaggerated false teeth did initially distract me, but these are diminished once the story starts to unfold. The other members were also well acted and certainly looked the part, particularly with the 70s hair styles. The whole plot intelligently culminates to the infamous Live Aid performance that shot Queen's reputation to stratospheric heights, which evidently is the greatest segment of this biopic. It allowed the music to come through and force Mercury's emotions to be conveyed through auditory senses. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is deservedly one of the greatest songs of all time, and just the Live Aid performance alone showed its importance to Mercury and the band. It wants you to sing along, it wants you to tap your feet to the beat. It's infectious. It will leave you wanting to listen to their other fantastic songs. The development beforehand was well paced, nuanced and enjoyable to watch. However, there are two huge detriments to this biopic that lead to an underwhelming result. Bryan Singer's direction and McCarten's screenplay.Singer is unsure what angle to use to portray Mercury. He had a big career, with personal failures equalling his musical successes. Yet Singer attempts to balance the narrative with Mercury's life and what is essentially Queen's greatest hits. The two do not marinate seamlessly. Is it a Queen tribute? Or a Freddie Mercury biopic? Can it be both? Yes it can. But this is not substantial enough. The band has so much history and acute details that were glossed over in this film, ultimately feeling rushed. The time shifts range from a month to five years. Singer attempts to tackle too much, and it shows. In the first twenty minutes, they've already conceived their first album! That's ludicrous. Then we come to the screenplay. I'm sure Brian May and Roger Taylor's inclusion in this production somewhat hindered the telling of the band's history. It's completely sanitised. The often comedic dialogue juxtaposes the tonal shift of Mercury's eventual loneliness and battle with AIDS. There is literally a scene of Mercury contemplating the idea of conceptualising a solo career, only for the proceeding scene to joyfully create 'Another One Bites The Dust'. The script tries too hard at being a crowd pleaser, that the more important issues are diluted and consequently forms a tonal shift. Sure it allows Malek to show off his acting ability, but at what cost? There's no emotional resonance. Nothing feels memorable. It's a shame, as this could've been an excellent biopic. However the mediocre directing and script really hindered the emotional investment required to make this a successful trip down memory lane. It's a biopic that general audiences will enjoy, it's just not the biopic I wanted.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A reminder --- Don't always rely on the critics when selecting a movie to see,"My friends and I had unexpected free time and decided to see a movie. We had seen previews for Bohemian Rhapsody several times at the theatres, and when debating what movie to see, I suggested BR. My friends were so/so but went along with the recommendation. They came away - blown away. No one expected to be so captivated by this movie. We all like Queen music, but not one of us had ever seen them live. We realized right away that the music of Queen is timeless. There is not a winning Sports Team that at some point doesn't play or have a slide show prepared to ""We Are The Champions."" People ask if this is a documentary. It is more than a documentary. It is a brilliantly entertainimng story about the creation and rise to fame of one of the greatest bands of all time. I thought I knew the story, but I had so many missing parts that this story brilliantly unfolds. The reason why Freddie Mercury had such a big range was finally made clear to me. His coming out story is both tough, hard and poignant at the same time.
The final scene is a magnificent walk down memory lane for many of us about a time when the world was united in the cause of charity and helping the downtrodden, a subtle reminder of how far we have strayed from being a Global, caring village. That scene is epic and should go down as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.

Relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!,"Director Bryan Singer (""X-Men"" series) brings the life of Queen's frontman Freddy Mercury (Rami Malek ""Mr. Robot"" TV) and the band to the big screen with a vengeance. With screenplay by Anthony McCarten (""The Theory of Everything"") and story by McCarten and Peter Morgan (Writer, Producer, Actor), the film chronicles the mates climb to music notoriety, highlighting Freddy's frontman antics, the now notorious 1985 ""Live Aide"" concert performance, and of course the death of Freddy to Aids in 1991. Malek, who is unpleasantly overly made up to mimic Freddy's unique jaw line, teeth and hair, is plausible as the driven young British Zanzibar vocalist Farrokh (his given name). As the mature Freddy, he's given all the outrageous costumes (by Julian Day) and Freddy's dances moves, and pulls them off with ease, even though his lip-syncing is over the top at times. What Director Singer does well here, is provide backstory to the raise and demise of Mercury, including a look into his personal family dynamics, his little know love affair to Mary (Lucy Boynton ""Murder on the Orient Express""), who graciously sticks by him through his ups and downs, and a look at the effect Freddy's significant lovers Paul Prenter (Allen Leech ""Downton Abbey"" TV) and Jim Hutton (Aaron Mccosker ""The Astronaut Wives Club"" TV) had on his life, both who give moving subtle glimpses into Freddy's behind the glamour world. To McCarten and Morgan's credit, they provide an in-depth look at Queen's band members bassist John Deacan (Joseph Mazzello ""The Cure""), drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") and guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee ""Jamestown"" TV), demonstrating that the band was truly comprised of all four guys. As with most music oriented bio-pics, the film is packed with all the music and excitement one expects from Queen, and it's loud and powerful. Mike Meyers (""SNL"") has a nice cameo as Queen's EMI chief Ray Forster - although I think I saw and heard ""Austin Powers"" in his performance. And, Aidan Gillen (""Game of Thrones"") does a nice job as the guys music manager John Reid. Only a fool would pan this film, so check it out for yourself, and relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

This Is Not A Documentary!,"The critics were wrong about Bohemian Rhapsody the song and once again they're flat out wrong about the movie.If you want an in-depth look at Freddie Mercury's life you can head to a bookstore to pick-up one of the countless biographies written about the man. Alternatively you can head over to YouTube and watch one of the numerous documentaries solely dedicated to the life of the Queen frontman. However if you want to watch a movie that will make you feel good and remind you why Queen is one of the greatest bands of the 20th century and beyond then look no further, this is the perfect movie for you.Are there facts that have been presented out of context and embellished for dramatic purpose? Yes absolutely.
For example: 1) Freddie Mercury wasn't diagnosed with HIV until 1987. It is widely believed that Mercury acquired the HIV virus in 1981 or 1982 but was not physically tested and subsequently diagnosed with the virus until early 1987. 2) Freddie Mercury met his partner Jim Hutton at a club, not while Hutton was working at one of Mercury's lavish house parties. 3) We Will Rock You was not written in the early 80's but rather in 1977. 4) Freddie Mercury did not come out to his parents on the day of Live Aid. 5) Live Aid was not the first time the band had performed together on stage in years. In fact Queen had been on tour for a large part of '84 and early '85. 6) Freddie Mercury was not the first member of Queen to break off and do his own solo project, that distinction belongs to Roger Taylor.There are many additional inaccuracies to be found but it feels like they're made to service the film's overall run-time which is already over 2hrs. The movie doesn't pretend to be a note for note recreation of the band member's lives but rather a celebration of Queen (Freddie Mercury in particular), their humble beginnings and their meteoric rise to success. Most of all, the movie is a celebration of their brilliant music.You want to be entertained and come out of the theatre feeling happy and humming Queen songs? Go see this movie. If you want deeper insight into the personal life of Freddie Mercury or an accurate time line of Queen's many accomplishments, watch a documentary.I can promise you this though, I've seen just about every available documentary that's been released on Queen, some of them several times and none of them will make you smile, laugh, cry and sing the way this movie does.

A moving tribute,"As a queen can I went in with high expectations of this movie and it is beautifuly shot. Rami is superb as Freddie and catches those little Freddie nuances. I thought the chap who played Brian had it down to a tee also. The guy playing deacy though not given lots of lines had him just right too.
I was hoping for a bit more of the Freddie 80s NY gay clubs that he used to frequent regularly. But as I spotted Freddie's sister at the premiere then it's obviously got the family blessing and so I can see why that's not a major part of the film. It's very difficult to span the 15 years in a couple of hours and there where a few fast forwards. I would have liked to have seen some of the years up to Freddie's death as I know the band became very close indeed. But maybe that's something the band didn't want to explore. I did come out if the cinema with a lump in my throat. One of the clear things to take from the film and real life is Freddie's life long love for Mary Austin. He must have been a very conflicted soul.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Killer Queen or Killing Queen?,"Every kid who has ever had trouble fitting in has someone that inspires them. Someone to show them what it is like to be fearless, strong and bearing all of your soul stark naked for the world the see. That man was Freddie Mercury for me. I was a Queen superfan in my youth, and that says a lot for a band that had lost it's lead singer long before my time. Their music spoke to me. Rocked me to my core. Made my heart sing. Bohemian Rhapsody remains one of my favorite songs of all time. Passion, joy, rage and sorrow in under 6 minutes, and to think it was ever considered a critical flop. A Freddie Mercury biopic was decade in the making, and foundered in development hell as the surviving band members fought tooth and claw against showing the darkest portions of Mercury's life. The band ultimately had the final say. What we get instead is the fluffiest tribute to one of the greatest bands of all time. Fluff is all we've got to work with here, and quite frankly, it's disappointing.Bohemian Rhapsody spands Freddie and his career with Queen from the band's conception to the insane making of ""A Night at the Opera"", to the lull's of the 1980s, to the final scene which captures Freddie's greatest performance ever at Live Aid. That scene in particular is a masterful tribute that almost redeemed BH of all of it's numerous flaws. The entire performance is covered. Every movement, every facial expression, every audience reaction. Singer wants us to live this moment. We don't cut back and forth quickly around it. We stay with it. It needs to be experienced in a loud, large theatre without a doubt. But if we're going to compare the biography portion of the film, consider this familiar territory the entire way through. If you've seen Ray, Walk the Line, Get On Up, Jersey Boys, Love & Mercy, The Doors and Straight out of Compton, you've sadly seen Bohemian Rhapsody. However, where Love & Mercy and The Doors entire the mad darkness from which these great songs were inspired, we barely see that side of Mercury being explored. Neither do we see in depth his extricating struggle with his sexuality and his later crippling AIDS diagnosis. Both are hinted at, but none of the execution truly captured his pain. Again, this is disappointing.See Bohemian Rhapsody for the music if nothing else. You'll love hearing the old songs in crystal clear, loud quality.

"Not quite 'Bohemian Rhapsody', more like 'I'm In Love With My Car': undeniably entertaining but ultimately quite shallow.","'Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)' does feel like it's trying to do a deep-dive on Mercury himself, showing the highs, lows and everything in-between in an attempt to humanise him, to show the man behind the musical myth. It never quite manages to do so, however, despite a blistering lead performance. It always seems to just scrape the surface of the man's psyche, only occasionally dipping a little deeper into his inner workings but still never really coming close to painting a clear picture of his out-of-spotlight self. Instead of focusing fully on this, the piece just glosses past important moments and relationships in order to get back to the 'fun' stuff, ultimately coming across as pretty shallow (especially when you stop to think about it). Thankfully, though, that 'fun stuff' consists of a series of admittedly check-list and narratively flimsy, yet undeniably entertaining, scenes in which we're treated to the origin of several key Queen tracks and then given a performance of each of them, or even a full twenty-minute live-aid concert, all presented in ear-pleasing surround-sound. The only downside to these sequences is that the actors are lip-syncing the songs, despite having performed them properly on the day. While this allows us to hear Queen in all their glory, it does take away from the believability of the picture in some key moments and gives off an ever-so-slightly disingenuous feel; the characters in the film aren't the same as their real-life counterparts, no matter how well they represent them, and they aren't really singing. Still, as I mentioned, hearing these songs blasted from a cinema-quality sound-system is a treat; it really is difficult not to smile when they're being played. It's not like the film is ever unenjoyable, either, even in its most 'check-list' or hollow of moments. It also doesn't scream ""troubled production"", despite being the very definition of the term behind-the-scenes. The most you can tell it's a tale of two (or three) minds is in the sometimes strange post-production choices, which are clearly Fletcher's doing.

Not many movies can bring me through the full range of my emotions in a short space of time...and totally awe-inspiring as well.Being a Queen fan, I am fully aware of the history and what should or will transpire...yet it didn't detract from the experience at all. My friend watching with me didn't know who Queen were, and he fell over himself praising what we had witnessed at the end.Would have given it a 10 out of 10 if they didn't mess up some time line and music choices...still... it would have been even more enjoyable, I believe, if one is not aware of the incorrect time-line of certain songs and music.Based on a true story and beautifully executed...Freddy and Queen are legends...and thanks for sharing this experience with us.Absolutely brilliant and highly recommended!!(Only consideration is...unless you have a fantastic sound system at home hooked up to the screen...watch this in a cinema...the immersion factor is unreal.)9.5 out 10!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
needs some darker scenes,"It's a biopic of the popular band Queen and its lead singer Freddie Mercury. It starts in 1970 London. Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) is a baggage handler at Heathrow. He joins Roger Taylor and Brian May after they lose their lead singer. They add bassist John Deacon. Freddie changes his name to Freddie Mercury and marries girlfriend Mary Austin. The band signs with manager John Reid and becomes a world wide success. Freddie has an affair with Paul Prenter and comes out to Mary. It's a troubled life journey culminating to the celebrated Live Aid concert in 1985.The most important aspect of this biopic is Rami Malek's performance. For the most part, it is very good. If I choose to be snarky, I would say the teeth did half the job. While I think he has the essence of the role, his musical performances fall short in terms of power. In the end, all I know about Freddie Mercury is through his music videos and Malek needs to turn the dial to 11. Malek does fill up the role with humanity. One gets the sense of his confidence which seems to be a mask for his insecurities and his sexuality. He is a man of many dimensions and Malek is able to match his charisma. It's a very good performance.If there are flaws, the movie is pulling some of its punches back. I'm not pushing for a gay orgy scene but his homosexuality is held back for presumably the audience. If not that, then there could be more done with his drug use. I rarely call for montages but this case calls for it. It could go dark with a montage of his drug use. By going darker, his climb back to the light would be more exhilarating. As for exhilarations, I expected more from the Live Aid performance. I remember watching some of the concert back in the day but not for long stretches. The movie tries to make it something epic especially with the donations. I can't speak to that but it goes a little too far. It pushes too hard. I would eliminate the phone bank scenes. Overall, this movie is compelling. The band and its music is epic. The performances are good. It's a pretty good musical biopic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Good reminder of the Top Queen!,"The former Twilight Breaking Dawn actor did an okay job of performing as Freddie. I imagine in was difficult to find someone who resembled him in person as well as characteristics. However, the actor did a PHENOMENAL job lip-synching the original recordings, which the producers chose to use-good call on that! I wish the researchers would have spent more time coming up with widely UNKNOWN information about Freddie Mercury instead of basing the movie on widely known information about his life. I did not see any credits for information going to Freddie's parents, sister, or Mary Austin. Maybe interviews with those critical people from Freddie's life would have added information that was not already widely known. Unless I missed something, the movie seem to have been based on Freddie's relatiofnship with Mary Austin with just a little bit of information about his career during the years of his relationship with her. I would've liked to have seen more content based on his musical genius as opposed to his personal relationships. To top it all off the end of the movie ended with the 1985 LiveAid concert, which was six years before his death. Why did they not continue the movie through to the end of his life? The original videos of live concert cuts during the ending credits for me was the most moving part of the film-I'm glad the producers chose to use flattering footage in the end.

He will......He will.......Rock you,"Rami Malek best known for playing subdued computer programmer Elliott Alderson in the TV series Robot takes on quite a different character as lead singer
Freddie Mercury of Queen. A rock legend Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, but
the melody as an older songwriter wrote still lingers on.I learned quite a bit in the fact that both Malek and Mercury came from some
real minority religious faiths that have seen their share of persecution. I did
not know that Malek came from a Coptic Christian family in Egypt. They are
certainly people who feel it every time Moslem fundamentalism gets a boost.
I have a friend who like Rami Malek's family is also a Coptic Christian and fled
Africa for Canada.Freddie Mercury born Farrokh Bolsara is from a family who followed the
Zoroastrian faith. It is the religion of ancient Persia and there are not too many of them left in Iran. Most of the 130,000 left in the world are in India
known as Parsees. Like the Judeo-Christian-Moslem religions it is a religion
of an all encompassing Deity and an equal bad one like the western Satan.
Like the others Zoroastrianism frowns on same sex kanoodling.Homosexuality very frowned on by his parents and Mercury himself did have a
loving relationship with Mary Austin played by Lucy Boynton. Still he could not deny himself and one of my favorite scenes in the film is when Queen is
on tour in America and there's wordless scene where Malek checks out a hunky
truck driver at a service station and follows him into the men's room. Mercury
was in the closet still, but the door was opening wider.The familiar soundtrack of Queen favorites are the second best part of the
film and in concert Malek really becomes Freddie Mercury. What an incredible
name he gave himself, mercurial and flamboyant with an electrifying stage
and screen presence.Bohemian Rhapsody won a Best Actor Oscar for Rami Malek and also got awards for Editing and Sound Mixing and Sound Editing. It missed out for

Freddie Mercury and the Queen,"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is an attractive film about the story of Freddie Mercury and the Queen. In 1970, the British Indian Parsi Farrokh ""Freddie"" Bulsara meets the members of the band Smile in a pub and soon they become Freddie Mercury and the Queen. The plot shows highlights of Freddie Mercury biography and his relationship with the Queen until their performances in the Live Aid concert in Wembley in 1985. The plot has romance, drama and wonderful songs and is certainly one of the best 2018 films. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Bohemian Rhapsody""",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Great Songs, Bad Film","I'd like to start off by saying I am a big Queen fan and i' not giving it a low review because I don't like the band, I think there songs are the only thing holding this film together. With that out of the way onto the review.This film is supposed to be a tribute to Queen as a band, going through all their greatest moments and lowest lows, but in reality it feels like a string of loosely connected threads moving along without actually telling you much. There highs are just montages and there lows a couple scenes long, as well as that a lot of the facts have been changed for dramatic effect, the acting is okay, but it shouldn't be as widely praised as it has been, Rami Melk is fine but when you watch him talking next an interview with Freddie you can see that he's merely playing a caricature, that's what the entire film really is, a caricature of Queen's legacy held together by the fact that their songs are genuinely great, if it weren't for the fact that they have Queen songs I guarantee no one would like this movie half as much. If you like Queen songs you'll likely have a good time but that is only because of the music, definitely not the story.P. S. THE FACT THIS FILM WON BEST EDITING IS CRIMINAL, IT HAS SOME OF THE WORST EDITING I'VE EVER SEEN.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Poorly written, Bohemian Rhapsody is a disappointment","Sometimes there's a movie that really divides critics and audience. Sure a movie about one of the most iconic person of Rock (and music in general) should make Bohemian Rhapsody one of them, and it does. Honestly, the movie it's not bad -not totally- but it is messy. The structure is messy, the timeline is wrong and the characters are more selfaware than they need to be, but more on that later. It felt like they wanted to make a love letter to Queen, but the structure wasn't even nearly satisfactory as it should be, resulting in a Russian Roulette of cheap emotions and an unclear message by the end.Rami Malek is good as Freddie Mercury, reproducing several peculiarities of the original artist, but for me his acting was more of a series of impressions (a caricature) then a true representation. Don't get me wrong, it's still very good and very unique, but I've seen another Biopic this year (First Man) and by comparing the protagonists, I feel that Gosling's Armstrong is more of a ""character"" then Malek's Freddie and I don't know whose fault it is. Anyway, great casting too, I honestly want to know how they rejuvenated Brian May and taught him to act so fast. But even with a cast almost identical to the original band, the movie restricted everyone so they could make Freddie the absolute main character.This and other things are totally the screenplay's (and the people who wrote it) fault. And there's some Bryan Singer there too. The movie paints Freddie as a legend, a god from the first to the last frame, never letting us empathize with his character, his struggles or his wins. We're humans, the movie needs to humanize its protagonist so we can sympathize with him. The film even has a ""bad influence"" character so we could put all of Freddie's faults on him, what a shame. It seems like every single person involved with the band (except that one producer) was aware of what Queen means today. They're always convicted
that they would be successful, talking and acting this way, at least it's how the story shows us. The screenplay also manipulates time and events to fit the narrative created to the movie. Rock in Rio was in 1985 with a very well know Queen, not in '79. Freddie discovered he had AIDS in 1987 and definetely did not use it as ""plot point"" to empower the Live Aid performance, and he didn't was the first to go solo too, making an entire scene insincere. Propably one of the most poorly written scripts of the year.I honestly don't know where it's totally Bryan Singer's fault or some kind of Studio's censorship, but this movie is flat in emotions. Everytime the band argues about something there is a miraculous riff that saves the scene and in the next one everything is alright, they have a new song to perform. Unfortunately, not even an inspired Rami Malek and the Live Aid performance reproduction (which was cool) could save the picture. Makes me wonder how Sacha Baron Cohen wanted to make it. Probably he wanted to make a true Biopic of Freddie's life, not just a stack of exposition scenes.Probably he wanted to make it right.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Fans are rewarded...again!,"I could not wait to see this film and was completely rewarded at it's completion. i have been a fan of the band my whole life, the music was always there. No matter which members have left us and those that remain, they are in the fans hearts forever and this movie explains precisely why.Story telling was great, acting was great, music was great, and the live reenactment was thrilling. I left the theater with only one question. Why did audiences forget that this is what a real band should be? I truly feel that contemporary music is tragically devoid of what Queen created and treated to the fans. Few bands create an audience like Queen and few bands have a fanbase that is so adept at knowing the catalog of music and the rhythm of a live concert. Live Aid is a great example of a well trained audience who loves a band with all their heart. Freddie said it best, ""they sing the song because it's true"", favorite line of the movie.Ready for multiple watches of this film, Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Another one bites the dust? Nah, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine enough to proclaim ""We Are the Champions""","Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes. Look up to the skies and see. These are just a few lyrics of the famous Queen song, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that is still one of the greatest songs of all time. In fact, there are a lot of songs by Queen I can recite including ""We Will Rock You"", ""Radio Ga Ga"", ""Under Pressure"", and of course, ""We Are the Champions"". Along with very catchy melodies, the bands prominence could not been without the vocal range of Freddy Mercury.That combination of an amazing voice and the right players is so prominent, that it was like catching lightning in a bottle. I can hardly come up with one good song let alone an entire catalog that still holds up. I had a lot of their stuff growing up, and even now, I still find myself going to Queen's music whenever I wanted some uplifting rock. Again, I think a lot of it rides on Freddy Mercury, who was one of the few people in existence who was destined for greatness. If a genius like Mozart has a great movie like Amadeus, perhaps Freddy Mercury can be replicated with the biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody.In 1970, we open with an Indian-British man then known as Farrokh Bulsara, before he became Freddy Mercury (played by Rami Malek) who works as a baggage handler at an airport. He goes to a nightclub where he sees a band called Smile playing. When their lead singer leaves the group, Freddy meets guitarist Brian May (played by Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Played by Ben Hardy) and offers to be their new lead singer. They agree, get a new bassist John Deacon (played by Joseph Mazzello) and rename their band Queen.They play nightclubs, and Freddy's voice and onstage persona get the bands fame to quick success. At the same time, Freddy even gets engaged with Mary Austin (played by Lucy Boynton). Even when their original label refuses to release ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" as a single, they manage to make it a hit and their fourth album A Night at the Opera is their biggest. During this time however, Freddy questions his sexuality when he begins an affair with his manager Paul. This pushes Freddy away from the band in favor of him looking for ""Somebody to Love"".You'd think that a movie about Freddy Mercury would be a grand, almost operatic like experience. For what it is, Bohemian Rhapsody is fine. Its not a great movie, but it was entertaining. It was said that the real life band members wanted the movie the focus on them all, but most people really want to know Freddy. We get some idea, thanks to the amazing performance of Rami Malek. Even if his makeup can look a little off, he still captures the excitement and flamboyance while making him human. I'm glad they dubbed him instead of trying to recreate his singing voice, as most people would have spotted it immediately.So if the actor had got it right, what's wrong with the movie? Its not that the movie is bad, but that it's like any other music biopic. We see the group form, try and write and record music, get it on the radio, perform tours, see people come and go, see them return and settle their differences. I know the movie wanted to show the story of Queen, but we've come far within telling those stories. I was happy and satisfied, but something still felt missing. The best I can describe was that while it does a good job imitating Queen and Freddy Mercury, it always feels like an imitation.Think back to other music movies like Love & Mercy and the remake of A Star is Born. Both movies showed the trials of being an artist, what that means for the people around them, and the pressure of living up to that fame. Part of me still deosn't know much about Freddy Mercury other then he was bisexual and loved to throw parties. In fact, the furthest I got was that most of the members of Queen were college nerds who formed a group.I'll give this six A Night at the Opera albums out of ten. The movie has good moments (including an amazing recreation of Live Aid that was the highlight of the film) and even give you the story of Queen. While I think Queen fans are going to want more, most people will probably be happy. It does deliver what it promises and does so fine. So I do recommend this anyway if you like Queen. The show must go on, so see it and see if it's worthy of singing ""We are the Champions""",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing movie!,"Bohemian Rhapsody was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I've seen other stuff with Rami, and he always was amazing, and BoRhap was no exception.

"History repeats itself: novelist Robert Musil writes his novel ""The Man Without Qualities"" again.","🌟1/10It's simply a crime to make a movie about Freddie Mercury and make him look like a man without qualities! It's not the actor Rami Malek, he's fine. It's not the rest of the cast, they're fine. It's not even the script as a plan in general - the plan to make a movie along these lines is also fine. It's the depiction of Freddie Mercury as a man who can only speak in one-liners, and slowly at that, a man who is just there in the room without any real presence, as if at a costume party where a princess arrives and maybe everyone wows at her costume, but in the room she has no more authority of a princess than on any average day (what else could you expect?). Thus Freddie Mercury in this movie just is and nothing much happens with or around him. That's atrocious! Freddie Mercury was a workaholic (partying included), a musical genius entirely devoted to music! Not a man without qualities who just is there not really knowing what to do!

Highly enjoyable but not without it's flaws,"A hugely ambitious project and generally a big success. The way the story is told is excellent and I fully appreciated the focus on the Live Aid concert. Rami Malek does a commendable job in the lead role but I personally didn't think he was the best choice for such a big part. He simply lacks the physical presence of Mercury and doesn't dominate his interactions in the way that i would expect. I would have loved to see the original casting choice Sacha Baron Cohen in this role as I think he would be a much better physical match.The special effects, sound editing and interlacing of performances are incredible, with the Live Aid scene being comfortably the most memorable aspect of the film.

"Sadly, a missed opportunity","Well, who am I to say it. My only perception of Freddie is a someone knowing him only from watching him on TV. A bandmate like Brian May really has authority on that. A Brain was completely happy with Malik portrayal. Yet, watching Rhapsody with Malik, I could not shake the feeling that was not Freddie. Maybe, to Brian, who knew Mercury up close and personal, Malik marvelously channelled Mercury and hit the mark perfectly and captured Mercury's essence as a whole person. But for me, as only a ""tv fan"", that was not even close enough. Malik did not capture theatrical over the top flamboyance. His portrayal was of a guy with mannerisms of 3rd world immigrant making it big in a show biz. Meh...
I think May is being a bit disingenuous in his praise. I get it, Brain and Roger did get exactly the movie they wanted. And Queen fans will be moved just due to the fact how emotional everyone feels about story behind Queen and Mercury's untimely death. But movie missed huge opportunity to explore why contemporary critics hated Queen so much. What Queen represented to them - decadent, pointless theatrics, totally uninterested in politics, a music for bourgeois disguised as rock&roll. What drove critics even more mad was Queen's unwillingness to pick a ""cause"" while they could have been such a great poster child for gay pride movement. Great music just for pleasure and good time is just plain wrong. Also, movie actually felt very neutered and borderline boring. The very thing Mercury would cast away. The storyline about bad influence and being manipulated was somewhat baffling and definitely given significant film time at expense of other more interesting and unknown aspects of Mercury life story.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Queen's final masterpiece,"After reading a lot of reviewers disagreeing with critics, I decided to read a couple myself. In short, the users are right. I'll try to explain why.When a person approaches a movie, expectations play a huge role in creating the final impression. It's obvious from the way the reviews are written that critics expected an overblown drama, a gay anthem, or a politically correct liberal revelation. The film is neither of these and more importantly, it was never meant to be.When you think of the movie, you need to remember who produced it--the band. They wanted a tribute to Fredie and Queen, a monument, a celebration. The drama is there, but the film does not try to think for the spectator, to make conclusions. Instead, it presents the events and lets you feel them from your own viewpoint. And that's a very brave thing to do from an artistic standpoint in today's world.Just like Queen's life work, the movie features drama, comedy, documentalism, pure humanly fun, whit, and so much more.

Biopics' disease: more entertainment than real drama,"Biopics are always tricky: fans are outraged by the inevitable historical inaccuracies and omissions, or mindlessly blown-away by seeing (again) their idol. But those issues are not the point: the first one can be addressed only in a lengthy documentary or in a research book, while the second is as subjective as one can be (my friend who watched the film with me was thrilled simply because she is a Queen fan).From a strictly cinematic perspective, the critics are right, this film is almost a flop because it has no strong, central idea besides recreating Freddie on screen (which is very well done). Most acting is fine, lookalikes are amazing (""Brian May"", ""Freddie""), the concert scenes are great, cinematography is very good, but the film is full of the clichés common in biopics about artistic characters. It also offers an almost bowdlerized image of Freddie and the band's entourage, creative aspects are dealt with incredible superficiality, and generally speaking the movie is marred by the simplistic approach of a tribute. The twisting of reality, which in ""Amadeus"" served a strong, fictional central idea (what's the difference between genius and talent), is useless and embarrassing in this film.As usual, real life drama is more impressive and touching than the concoction served by most biopics, as is the case here. To avoid disappointment, the better biopics focus only on one main event in the life of their character, instead of trying in vain to tell hastily a story which took years or decades to unfold and develop.So, is this film good? It's worth watching for the acting and the re-creating of the atmosphere, but when recent, easily verifiable facts are distorted with no artistic benefit as in this movie, what should we expect from a movie with a historical subject? Ultimately, watching the original concerts and videos of the band is more rewarding, and that will remain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
God save the Bohemian.,"Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It's a masterpiece, with a lot of emotion. The actors are amazing, with a beautiful performance. The movie was directed by Bryan Singer and shot in the year 2018.
It's been nominated for 5 academy awards, winning four of them: best sound editing, best sound mixing, best film editing and best actor. It's unbelievable how real the film is.
For me, this movie It's perfect. The scene at Live Aid brought me a lot of different emotions that I can't explain. And, of course, Rami Malek deserved his Oscar, with an excellent version of Freddie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
These are the days of our lives,"My youngest son was born years after Freddie Mercury died. He started to sing some Queen songs when he was still a toddler. I knew then that their music was going to live forever. They have joined The Beatles and Abba whose songs transcends generations.A lot about Freddie Mercury is well known. Bohemian Rhapsody brings very little that is new to the table.Credit has to go to Bryan Singer for framing the story from the band's beginnings to their triumphant performance at Live Aid in 1985.I was worried that some white actor would play Freddie Mercury, real name Farouk Bulsara who was of Indian origin. Rami Malek is at least of Egyptian roots.We see young Freddie working at an airport. When a student band loses its lead singer, Freddie offers his services, he could reach some high notes and he dresses extravagantly. When the band has some initial success, he becomes legally Freddie Mercury.The band members have a tumultuous relationship. John Deakins is more normal, Roger Taylor could be temperamental, Brian May had big curly hair and a homemade electric guitar. All of them could write songs and fight to get it on the albums. Together they created a string of hit songs. Some of them catchy: We Will Rock You, others were more extravagant such as Bohemian Rhapsody.Freddie though although he has a girlfriend from the early days of the band is soon struggling with his sexuality. As the band gets bigger, his appetite for a hedonistic lifestyle increases. This includes casual relationships with men and self destructive behaviour that causes further conflicts within the band.Singer knows how to lift the film with Queen songs. He does well to recreate the events of Live Aid when the band best known songs get pumped out.Queen aficionados would know when liberties have been taken with the truth and the timeline of the band.Malek delivers as Freddie, especially with the accent. I thought Joseph Mazzello was good as Deakins. I enjoyed the unrecognisable cameo from Mike Myers as the record head.After Bohemian Rhapsody finished, my wife turned around and said she was really entertained by the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Disappointing from start to finish,"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" had everything to be a great biopic. The story of singer Freddie Mercury is rich and different from many who lived in show business and at the time of the emergence of stadium mega-bands in the twentieth century. By itself is exotic a guy who was born in Zanzibar, Africa, spent his childhood in India and then was forced to immigrate to England because of a revolution in his country, began to study design and suddenly joins with a quasi dentist, a quasi-physicist and an almost mechanical engineer to set up a band that would be a hit-maker in the '70s and' 80s.But ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is a lazy film that does not deliver even the basics, which would be a facetious, linear biopic based on historical moments of the band and its vocalist. It is a superficial, erratic work that adds nothing new or relevant to the biography of Queen or Freddie himself, one of the great voices in rock history.The film, for example, touches on important issues that deserved to be further explored. Ready a few: why is Freddie's relationship with the family so cold and filled gaps? How was your childhood in Zanzibar and India, where, by the way, did he start playing piano? What kind of influence could he have suffered from this life in these two places? In what family, immigration influenced him or not to be what he became? Why deny the name and origins? These are questions that could have been asked and were not answered. In the film, his family is almost a tip in history.Freddie's own relationship with his homosexuality, as well as his internal conflicts, lack and solitude are not properly treated / harnessed to try to understand who Freddie was. In short, it's a very little-delivered movie.Of course, the production suffered several problems. Initially, Freddie would be played by Sacha Baron Cohen, but divergences with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, ended up dynamiting their participation. The place ended up being occupied by Rami Malek, known for his participation in the TV series ""Mr Robot"", but delivering a Freddie just acceptable and nothing remarkable.After that, Bryan Singer himself was fired from production with two weeks to go. Direction this one that fell in the lap of Dexter Fletcher. But the film ended up having the same face of Singer's later work, with little depth in approaching characters and work short of expectations. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016) is an example.In fact, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" only lends itself to Queen's good songs, especially those that represented turning points in the band's career - Bohemian Rhapsody, Love of My Life, We Will Rock You, I Want to break free "","" We are the Champions "","" Another one bites the dust ""- to bring comfort to the heart of the viewer. It would have been more fruitful and cheaper, though, to listen to Queen's greatest hits on Spotify.The screenplay by Anthony McCarten and Peter Morgan, who is responsible for such good films as ""The Last King of Scotland"" (2005), ""The Queen"" (2006), Frost / Nixon (2008) and ""Rush"" (2013) also sins by not providing basic information, putting Rock in Rio in a random time and space between 1975 and 1985 and creating bad dialogues. Nor does it seem that there was a band there creating great hits. And even these moments of creation of the musicians sound fake and soulless.If Malek is far from striking, but does not compromise a gear that is flawed from beginning to end, the actors who make the other members of the band - always seen through the narrative with extreme generosity - are weak. Gwilym Lee (Brian May), Ben Hardy (Roger Taylor), Joseph Mazzello (John Deacon) is there to not compromise and be the sober pieces of Freddie Mercury's egotrip. Meanwhile, entrepreneur Paul Prenter (Allen Leech) is depicted as the villain in the film, responsible for the friction between Freddie and the rest of the band and even for his temporary separation.So, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" goes through its 2h15min owing a lot. His most memorable moments turn out to be Malek's scene in the rain, when Freddie decides to leave the bottom of the pit to resume his career with Queen and the historical presentation in 1985 Live Aid, a key point for the band and Freddie, in a context where the singer had just learned that he had AIDS, a disease that would eventually contribute to his death six years later. But unfortunately all of Queen's timeline in the movie does not even hit 70% of what actually happened. Just as the viewer leaves the cinema without even knowing the name of a disc of the band.Singer, by the way, chose to put a fake Queen's pocket show inside the film to portray the performance at Live Aid. I do not know if that was the best option. It seemed like a lazy option to me. For it was not a movie or a real Queen show, bringing noises everywhere.So ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ends with the false feeling of coming out on top, when in fact it left more holes and a bit of entertainment in an absolutely expendable movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Movie's Not As Wonderfully Weird As The Band,"Inimitable rock band Queen and their once-in-a-lifetime front-man Freddie Mercury have stood apart from the fray of classic rock artists by two royally distinct attributes: their bombast and their weirdness. Their bombast, as represented by the giant guitar crunches in ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" or the soaring choral harmonies in ""We Are the Champions"", is on full display in Bohemian Rhapsody. Unfortunately, their weirdness, as represented by the opera influences in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or the uncharacteristic rockabilly in ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"", is sorely missing.
The film focuses on Mercury specifically, from his early days with the band in college, through their unlikely assent into worldwide superstardom, to his final days fighting AIDS. Obviously, the casting of Mercury is crucial, and Rami Malek is flamboyant, magnetic and downright incredible. His movements and personality are Mercury through-and-through, and the pain underneath his larger-than-life aura is beautiful. It's a cliché, but I honestly got lost in his performance to the point of forgetting it wasn't Freddie himself I was watching.
As for the film in whole, it's a typical, sing-by-numbers, greatest-hits version of a musical biopic. If you've seen any number of other similar films (Ray, Straight Outta Compton, Walk the Line), then you know the type: setup the sad family/home life, hit the career highlights, present a downfall, then finally crescendo into a final celebration. It's a formula as old as G chord - C chord - D chord - repeat. Still, Bohemian Rhapsody uses its formula well. And when it narrows in on the music of Queen itself, all complaints are thrown away in favor of sheer swaggering enjoyment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Pretty good biopic about the band ""Queen""...","1st watched 11/17/2018 :
Pretty good biopic about the band ""Queen"" led by charismatic Freddie Mercury. This movie starts and ends at the 1985 Live-Aid concert where the band gets back together after a short breakup. We get to see Freddie's real family, which appear to be of Indian origin, and his in-ability to please them with his endeavors. These first's into the real life of the band including Freddie's marriage - helps the fan know the lead singer a little bit better. One big flaw is the timelines (dates vs. songs) - a real fan will see these very easily, but the story unveiling the real people behind the band will make you forget these flaws. The performances are very well done - so much so about ¾ of the way thru, you believe you're watching the real folks. It was also a good decision to use the actual music from the band instead of making the actors get compared to the real thing. I do have to admit the story was kind of sanitized to get a bigger audience. Less drugs, and prettying up the homosexual tendencies of Freddie, but this was intended to be a positive look at the band, partly working with the still alive members - so it makes sense. This movie is about the band, and it's music and appropriately ends with the 1985 Live Aid concert simulation with the original music - well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing,"The Queen soundtrack is great, of course, and technically ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" deserves the praise. It's a well-paced biopic, too, that hits all of the expected notes, but it's manufactured vapidity conflated by an ahistorical arrangement to create baddies while trivializing the part of drugs, homosexuality and AIDS in the life of Freddie Mercury.Reportedly, the biggest mainstream LGBT movie yet, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" ridiculously makes its gay protagonist's romantic life revolve around a woman, whereby he's not depicted as having a boyfriend until after he's diagnosed with AIDS. There are several references to his apparent sex life with his to-be wife, including them lying in bed and him boasting about it in front of her deaf father, in addition to the overriding theme of their love for each other. Meanwhile, his homosexual relationships are either hardly hinted at with the odd glance or confused with sexual harassment by a forced kiss here and a posterior grab there, until he's outed in the media, for partaking in a series of sexual encounters that were never shown. Tellingly, illicit drugs receive a similar obfuscated approach, with their mostly being only suggested by dancing and partying, alcohol and ashtrays. A PG-13 picture of a rock star is just a mistake, but the apparent shyness and queasiness over sexuality is worse. Hiding the queerness off stage while celebrating Mercury when he struts it in front of a crowd--consequently, ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is more of an extended Queen concert than a biopic.A recorded concert, that is--more akin to watching the Live Aid event on the telly if it weren't live instead of being there in the stadium. It's a ""perfect performance,"" as one band member quips, when they're told their show for the BBC will be playback, requiring them only to lip sync. Well, Rami Malek won an Oscar for lip syncing his way through the performances of Mercury. Admittedly, he does the part well visually, including the prominent prosthetic teeth. The singing, however, is reportedly a mix of Malek and a professional singer. I suppose, then, that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is even more like Queen recording a record in studio as opposed to concert performances. Indeed, some of the best scenes here are of the behind the scenes of the music industry and recording business. I also recently viewed ""Rocketman"" (2019) and was disappointed by its depiction of Elton John's creative process. ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" at least, demonstrates the band's experimentation and genre mixing, and the quarrels they have throughout the picture are largely based in the making of music. The movie itself likewise showcases technical virtuosity--not only in the soundtrack, but also with the swirling camerawork and narrative construction building up to the climax. Too bad it's hollow inside.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
No time for losers (critics) because we are the Champions of the world!,"I got to watch the movie last night and try as I might, the movie just won't let me be. It is as if Bohemian Rhapsody has been tickling my soul ever since.
Rami Malek has lived the role! Boy, how convincing was he! You kind of forget that you are only watching some guy play Freddie Mercury. There is no Rami Malek in here. There's just Freddie. The same goes for the other members of the band, especially Gwilym Lee. It's really hard to tell the difference between him and Brian May.
Whether you are a Queen fan or not, you probably agree with me that there is no better live performance than Queen's performance at Live Aid and the way it all culminated in the end, it would really be difficult for you to not shed a tear, even if you are heartless. That performance right at the end, even your goosebumps would get goosebumps and the movie is filled with many a moment like that.
This isn't just a movie. This is a celebration of the life of one of the greatest legends that ever walked the earth. You must watch the movie. I'm sorry. You must experience* the movie. Calling the experience surreal would be an understatement.
When the song came out back then, it got panned by the critics. Guess what, they turned out to be wrong. Utterly.

He looks missplaced in almost every scene of the film.. i think macho is the word that describes freddie the best but for maleks portayal he falls flat and i cant understand why both paul and bryan said that it was almost like freddie was still alive, they of all should recognise the big differses between freddie and malek.

A Memorable Movie-Going Experience,"It's inevitable. Multiple biopics are now created on a yearly basis, and will continue to be made until the end of time. In my opinion, if not a single writer can come up with an original concept, then exploring the true story of someone or something is far more interesting than remaking a classic film. Bohemian Rhapsody is the latest in a long line of already released and upcoming biopics-and it's one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had all year. Already thinking I knew a lot about this story before going in, I was pleasantly surprised by quite a few aspects of this story. Whether or not you're a fan of the band Queen or not, this movie has the makings of a film that can please many viewers. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and here's why.I knew Bohemian Rhapsody was a movie that was going to heavily focus on Freddie Mercury over the rest of the band, which I thought was going to feel imbalanced, but the way his story is presented here makes it seem like his life had the most story to tell. From working at an airport to performing one of the most memorable concerts in history, this film takes you on a decade-long journey that's well worth your time. I was never bored, because it either wows you with spectacle, engages you with its drama, or has you guessing about where the film is going to take you next. It's not a perfect movie, but I think I can go as far as to say it's a perfectly made film in terms of its presentation.I'm always looking for a movie to break out of the cliched way of telling a biopic, but I will admit this film slightly suffers from that at times. It does feel like it jumps from year to year, simply hitting the most important aspects of Mercury's life, which is fine, but we've seen that structure throughout numerous films in the past. With that said, that's truly the only complaint I can come up with here. If you don't like listening to the music of Queen, then I feel that will also be a detriment to the movie for you, but that would just be personal taste anyway. For the movie that it is, it works extremely well.What surprised me the most about Bohemian Rhapsody was the performance by Rami Malek as the leading man. I've seen him countless times in the past, appearing as comedic relief in films like Need for Speed or the Night at the Museum franchise, but I've never seen him shine in a leading dramatic role before. If this performance doesn't put him on the map, I'm not sure what will, because I was blown away by his portrayal here. Even if this movie suffered from lazy writing or a lack of energy, Malek's performance would've still held my attention, and that says a lot, especially for someone who I never expected to perform like this.In the end, Bohemian Rhapsody benefits from great editing (which hardly jumps out at me very often), some very solid direction (controversy aside), concert sequences that will impress many viewers, and an overall brisk pacing, even with the lengthy run time. I had a blast watching this movie and even with all of the depressing elements of this story, it's always well-balanced with happier or energetic moments. Aside from the lead performance, I can't see this movie receiving many nominations, but I will say that I can see it becoming a fan favourite movie of 2018. This is the definition of a crowd-pleaser. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great theatre experience from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

There was no swearing compared to the real freddie, the parties were too mild, the chronology was out of order, the facts were wrong most of the time and it just felt like one big concert to promote Queens music. So my review is 7/10. As a movie it would get a 9 but the afformentioned reasons I would bring it down to a 5 or a 6. The fact that it has Queen in it and im a huge fan of Queen is the only reason I'm giving it a 7 and not 5 or a 6.

Freddie Mercury biographic movie,"Biographic movie about the band ""Queen"".Well done, it focuses essentially on the unavoidable figure of Freddie Mercury .In my opinion there are two essential factors, not forgetting the rest, that contribute to the good quality of this film.One the script, written with great tact and sensitivity without falling into either the mistake of idolizing Freddie or the opposite of villainizing him. Shows Freddie's origins and who he was, an artist with extraordinary talent, but a human being, like all of us with its virtues and its faults.Second, the extraordinary performance of actor Rami Malek.It's a good movie, where I only regret the lack of greater protagonism by the other members of the band, who are excessively secondary in the plot.

The end, or part 3 of the movie is in some way a slight vindication of the man and the musician. The overall effect of the movie is scattered and jumbled yet also telling and compelling. It is a movie worthy of watching simply for the music. But it also allows you to see inside the mind of a musical genius. Queen will forever be rock royalty and while this movie doesn't live up to the legendary status of the band it gives us all an idea of what it took to elevate themselves to such a prominent place in the world's culture.

"Brought tears to my eyes, but not because it was good...","Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody is easily, one of, if not, thee most anticipated films of 2018. I'm sure that even the most skeptic Queen fan was curious to see how this was going to be pulled off. Well, let's talk about that...First of all, any and all praise should essentially go to Rami Malek. He's an excellent actor who obviously took the role of Freddie quite seriously. I won't lie, the casting director did a great job finding the rest of the band too, but it was more for their physical appearance rather than anything else; they were really just a static supporting cast. I mention the rest of the cast because this film was essentially supposed to be about Queen, and not exclusively about Freddie. Well, they missed the mark on that one, and it's an upsetting notion.I had basically been following this project ever since the idea stage. I remember when Ben Whishaw was tied to the lead, but better yet, when Sacha Cohen was going to give it a go as our ill-fated frontman. Initially, Cohen was quite serious about the role, and proposed that the film be an R-rated, hardcore rendering of the singer's life. Knowing Cohen's outlandish approach to cinema, it may have been brilliant. Sadly, the members of Queen were not on the same page, and demanded a change in direction. I remember reading, that the band wanted it to be about their collective journey, up to the point of Live Aid. At the end, the only thing that was true to this ambition, was the classic 1985, Live Aid performance which was recreated quite well.We all know how Freddie's journey ends, so there's no spoiler there, but for such a poignant figure in popular music of the 20th century, I expected so much more. Honestly, a breathtaking film about Freddie would take a hell of a lot, and very little of that ""lot"" was in this film. To loosely quote a review, Bohemian Rhapsody is like a Wikipedia bio of the band. The film references a collection of important moments in the band's career, but it feels all so superficial. Freddie is basically in every scene, and it becomes apparent that the film is about him, which again, was not supposed to be the original intent. The outcome is a basic overview, that just upsets the viewer, because you're left wanting more. It was the power of Queen's music and the notion of the tragedy that was bestowed upon Freddie Mercury, that brought tears to my eyes; however, if there's one reason alone to see this film, it's for Malek's professional dedication to the role, and for that reason alone I give it a 5. I will say, putting Malek aside, the missed opportunity of not green lighting the Cohen project was another major part of the tragedy.Bohemian Rhapsody is sadly superficial, and I can only hope that a respectful, yet honest depiction of Freddie's life hits the screen in some way, shape, or form in the future. If not, we always have their wonderful music, and that's truly the only thing that counts.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great Performance from Rami Malek,"Some people don't like this film because they feel it is not historically correct. I tend not to want to know very much about the private lives of rock stars et al, so I can't really comment on the factual accuracy of this film.But in my view this does not matter; this film is not meant to be a history lesson and apart from any upset that might be caused to those who feel misrepresented I don't think factual accuracy is needed.What this film is an engaging account of the life of Freddy Mercury. It can be a bit maudlin, and some of the characters are one dimensional but it matters not. Malek's performance is a tour de force of acting, and if you let yourself you simply get carried along with the energy. Mercury was an elemental force in the music scene and here we get the chance to hang on to his coat tails and enjoy the ride.A splendid, entertaining 2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Not great,"This is not a good film.
There are moments when it's good, when it actually captures something of Queen but those are too few.
The actors are all terrific but it's in spite of whatever direction they had.
I'm stunned it was nominated and won an Oscar for best editing. It is awful editing. That is half the problem.
Terrible or lack of direction, bad editing, leaden storytelling, and a multitude of inaccuracies for no reason made this a mess.
Queen's music and Malek's performance is what I think most people are giving good reviews for because the movie itself is below average.
So disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Only Rami elevates it,"If you've seen any bio pic, or know anything about Queen/Freddie Mercury, you've seen this movie, what elevates it above a 5/10 is that I knew nothing about Queen/Freddie Mercury, so it was entertaining to see his flamboyant lifestyle, and Rami Malek did fantastic in this role.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Fair, yet lightweight biopic","Several years in the making, Bohemian Rhapsody surpassed expectations at the box-office upon its release and it went on to become one of the highest grossing music biopics of all time.Rami Malek takes on the role of rock legend Freddie Mercury, one that was previously filled by actor Sacha Baron Cohen who famously left an early version of this project years ago, following creative differences. Cohen's version of the film promised sex, drugs and rock & roll aplenty: an R-rated, no holds barred, honest look at the singer's rockstar life. After the remaining members of Queen and the studio started having second thoughts about this particular approach, they set out to rebuild the movie in the way they wanted, without taking any big risks.And so Bohemian Rhapsody was born: a mainstream-friendly, Queen-centric biopic that aims to tell the story of Freddie Mercury with a slight emphasis on the positive and toxic relationships he made along the way. Despite its financial success, the film has received criticism for sugarcoating the late singer's life and not sticking to true events. Indeed, a lot of liberties were taken with certain key aspects of Mercury's life for dramatic convenience and this is definitely disappointing since so many other biopics fall into the exact same trap and it would have been so easy to avoid that.On the plus side, this is a gorgeous-looking film that builds up to an impressive (if often inaccurate) recreation of the classic Live Aid concert in Wembley. The music throughout is, of course, irresistible and, in fact, there just isn't enough time in the film to include all of Queen's biggest hits, which is in itself a testament to the band's legacy. While it would have been interesting to see Baron Cohen in the lead, it's hard to deny that Rami Malek was a fair casting choice. His Freddie Mercury is vulnerable yet powerful, lonely yet extravagant, awkward yet so talented it hurts. The casting in general is quite good in this film and there's an entertaining cameo by Mike Myers.By focusing on Mercury's relationship, and then friendship, with Mary Austin, the film touches upon a deep sadness that followed the singer over the years and could be felt through his songs. Unfortunately, the writing is far too uneven to convincingly elevate a film that mostly just wants to roughly celebrate a legendary singer's talent, play Queen songs and sell tickets.There are glimpses of a great biopic throughout Bohemian Rhapsody but the rushed storytelling, often clumsy script and lack of honesty hurts an otherwise entertaining and well made film with a solid lead performance.Enjoyable, if lightweight, biopic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A crime against Freddie and his memory.,"First of all, I didn't really want to go. After all that happened with this movie and after everything that Queen members said, I expected it to be bad. Very, very bad. But then I saw all those positive reviews and thought ""Hey! Maybe it's actually good? I mean, miracles happen from time to time and I don't want to miss something good based on something as epic as Queen"". So, I paid for a ticket. I was a fool...Bohemian Rhapsody is exactly as I expected it to be. Even worse, actually. And the biggest problem with the movie is the fact that the band didn't want it to be a movie about Freddie. I mean, sure, they're all very talented musicians and it's probably painful to live their lives in Freddie's shadow, even while pretending that the band still exists without him. No matter what they do, the people think ""Freddie"". So, sure, I can see WHY they didn't want this movie to be all about him. The problem is... there was no other way. The story of Queen is the story of Freddie Mercury. Who, aside from many other things, was a very complicated person. And the only way to make a movie about Queen and Freddie is to focus on Freddie's inner world. The same way that the First Man focused on Neil Armstrong. Remember how people said a lot of bad things about that movie just because it didn't focus on the American flag? But that was exactly why the First Man was so good. It wasn't yet another movie about American heroes in space. It was a movie... about... Neil... Armstrong. Bohemian Rhapsody does exactly the opposite. It turns Freddie into another character of the show. One of the many. And it's one of the things that pretty much ruin the movie.Like I said, Freddie was a complicated person. A true artist with the unique soul. And without even trying to look deeper into his soul, this movie makes him... well... a freak. Personally, I consider it a crime. Not because I'm one of those crazy fans, but because he deserved more... WAY more than what they did to him in this movie. And it's not about Rami Malek, no. The man is quite good and I hope that this movie will be good for his career. The problem is - writing sucks. Hard. We see Freddie saying and doing things, but we don't have a slightest idea about why. WHY does he do all that? How does he feel? Remember Sully? The movie about Capt. Chesley Sullenberger? Remember what Tom Hanks did there? Sully didn't have any action scenes, the landing sequence was quite short too. The whole movie was about Tom Hanks showing Capt. Sullenberger's feelings in his eyes. Clint Eastwood directed it in a way that we didn't even need words there. Tom Hanks' eyes and the right directing were enough. Bohemian Rhapsody? Nothing like that.Thanks to an awful writing and the pressure from the actual band, it turned out to be a movie about a group of cool and friendly guys and a freak with a superiority complex who were unable to do the things in a normal way. Meaning, feelings, thoughts, emotions... this movie doesn't have anything of that. It aims for a single thing - a bright and exciting picture. Something that is FUN to watch. A bright picture that shows us funny scenes of how famous songs were made, Freddie saying funny and shocking things to people, etc. Even the gay part is surprisingly dull and shallow. One kiss here, one hug there... No feelings involved.To make things worse, even though the movie is pretty straightforward, it's full of lies. Very convincing lies that make the band look even more cool. There are characters that weren't even based on actual people, there are scenes that weren't even based on actual events, etc, etc, etc. As the result, the movie feels like a convincing something that was ordered by Brian May and Co to make them look better. And that's exactly why the one should never ever involve the actual people in biopics about them. They'll want things done in their way. And it'll destroy any attempt to make something real. Brian and Co wanted a colorful yet shallow movie full of fiction, in which the cool British guys make a fool out of the EMI executive, who never ever existed in real life, they've got it. Bohemian Rhapsody is sure bright, colorful, it looks amazing, actors are quite good, even though many of them are TV actors, the concerts look shockingly close to the real deal, and yet, it's an awful movie. And the final scene (which is Live Aid, by the way, don't expect any Innuendo depression in this movie) is a nice example why. They've literally re-created Queen's Live Aid performance. They had a lot of time for a long and very expensive Live Aid cosplay. And yet... they didn't have enough time to show us Freddie's complicated soul. I call it a failure. But again, I hope it makes Brian and Co feel better about their lives. Clearly, it's the true goal here.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A legacy for a legendary band.,"It has been a long time since the death of Freddy Mercury, but not a day goes by that you do not hear Bohemian Rhapsody been played full blast to a group of nostalgic music lovers, who still can't get enough of the song.

They pushed boundaries and believed in each other and what they were meant to do, which was inspire and play music for the people. They engaged in a way no one did at the time and this movie is a perfect example of showmanship and living for the dream. Rami Malek did a great job of ghosting Freddy, because he really came alive through him in an almost eery way.. I loved the fact that they used Freddy Mercuries real vocals, Insteae if giving Rami the impossible fast, as no one can sing like him, full stop.

Is this real or is it just fanatsy?,"Remy Malik is superb, 10 out of 10. Having put in a tremendous amount of work and research into playing the part of Freddie Mercury, winning the Oscar is thoroughly well deserved. The supporting actors likewise are superb throughout. It is a pity that they are let down by the writers and senior producers and directors of this movie. These overlords could do with taking a bit out of Malik's book.The problem with biographies and bio-pics is that these overlords often take a great story, then feel it is essential to alter that great story, turning into something which is not the great story that the original great story craves for. A story wanting to be told, being altered in such a way that it deflects the impact of the story away from that which it ought to be. It is the main reason that I confess that I am not a great fan of this genre.Knowing that Bohemian Rhapsody was a famous song by Queen, and not reading any synopsis of plot, or other reviews before I watched it, I was expecting to see a movie about Queen. Instead what we got was a story about Freddie Mercury, whose position in Queen was aggrandized, whilst his colleagues' positions in Queen where diminished to one just above stooges.
There were four significant equal members of Queen, and any story that trivializes the other three loses my respect significantly.The overlords seem to have sacrificed facts of historical significance in order to build up to, in their eyes, a fitting triumphal grande finale for Freddie Mercury. That grande finale being the Live-Aid Concert of July, 13th 1985.
I remember it all to well. The Love of my Life at the time travelled to Wembley with her colleague from her workplace to see the show.In fact it was the Live-Aid Show that triggered a resurgence of interest in Queen. The production of their video for ""I Want To Break Free"" had caused a major backlash from conservative America, resulting in radio bans, which in turn lead to a collapse in revenue. Live-Aid was their penance completed and America wanted them back: Radio play again, TV, tours ~ fortunes restored.By moving some of the events that occured after the show to a time before the show, such as Paul Prenter's sacking and Freddie's diagnosis of AIDS - which occured in 1987, what we have left is a 3 parts finished story that misses out on the significance that Queen rose to post Live-Aid. That is the shame of this story.The one part of the movie that is without doubt excellent is the recreation of The Live-Aid Concert. If I was to judge this part of the movie alone, set aside from the rest of the movie, I would score it 10 out of 10.During the concert scenes we see Bob Geldof in his usual for the time garrulous manner. Beside him is the well known character of Elton John, who does not utter a word, which is unusual as I have never known him to be so silent. Spares him from this monstrocity.All movies have minor flaws, trivial goofs and so I generally set aside most of them. But to take such a part of history and radically alter it to such an extent that people are no longer seeing the real history, when they believe they are, has to be called out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It didn't even feel he got as much screen time as other actors above.Queen singers are almost lookalike but why don't they age. None of them changes a bit over a period of almost 15 years? Freddie looks twice the size of Rami... it's just something unreal about the cast that keeps on spoiling the impression.Not supposed to compare movies, I know.

I'll admit I was sceptical, and am late going to see it, foolishly, because this was one of the best films I have seen in years, it's moving, it's funny, interesting, and as it showcases their best music, it's a musical feast also. People will be talking about this movie for years to come, and in particular the performance of Rami Malek, who is nothing short of sensational as the fabulous frontman, the supporting cast are sensational too, Gwilym Lee, who I know from Midsomer Murders was a revelation as Brian May. I loved how it told the story, but it never focused too long on one aspect, it moved at a cracking pace, and allowed the real life story of Queen to be told, phenomenally.This shows that despite the rise of Giant TV companies giving us all we can watch at home, the Cinema industry is thriving more then ever.Bravo. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Rami Malek and Queen's timeless music.,"I have the feeling many moviegoers have been surpassed by the infectious and overwhelming nostalgia that seems to take over and obscure an objetive judgement of the film. While it is not nowhere near a masterpiece, it isn't bad either. It is an acceptable portrayal of the band's history leading up to their legendary Live Aid concert.
The physical resemblance of May, Taylor and Deacon are spot on. Rami Malek sort of lacks the uncanny resemblance but he makes up for it with his enormous acting, through his gaze, mannerisms and vocal inflection. He gave
such an exceptional performance which is without a doubt the highlight of the film, along with the final scene. One could say that those two elements carry the movie's weight on their shoulders, because without them, the film would definitely be of average quality.The way the filmmakers depicted Freddie's sexuality was okay, I mean obviously they played it safe, because this is a filmic representation of the band, properly supervised by Queen's actual members Brian May and Roger Taylor so, a daring version of the late singer's life story would have been out of the question (many would have preferred Sascha Baron Cohen's version instead). Still that wouldn't have ensured us a tasteful handling of his personal life. Nevertheless, I actually enjoyed the film, and I'm not entirely sure what percentage of my view on it was biased by the nostalgia factor, but I can safely say the majority of Queen fans will have a blast with this film and will undoubtedly praise Rami Malek's outstanding performance, along with the Live Aid concert scene, which is shot properly and creatively, hence why is one of the better parts of the film, and of course it contains the music of Queen, which of course, is one of the most important aspects of this effort.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"It has its moments, but Bohemian Rhapsody lacks the energy and passion that the story deserves","As far as music history goes, Queen, and frontman Freddie Mercury in particular, are one of the undoubted all-time greats, with a unique and intense energy to their music that few acts have ever been close to matching. As far as music biopics go, however, Bohemian Rhapsody really doesn't live up to the potential of what is an incredible story, and although it has its moments, it's a generally rather superficial film that lacks the immense energy that makes Queen as a band and Mercury as an individual so legendary.But let's start on the plus side, with the fact that fans of Queen will undoubtedly have a good time with Bohemian Rhapsody. That doesn't immediately render it an incredible movie, but if you're a fan of the band's music, and have an interest in Freddie Mercury's story, then this film will prove a far more entertaining watch, with the odd musical number here and there getting my toes tapping effortlessly.The problem with the film is that, while it features some good songs and tells a great story, it really fails to get to the crux of what makes Freddie Mercury such a legendary figure, going over the fifteen year span of the story in rather superficial and simplistic detail.As a result, if you want to learn about the history of Queen, this is a great film to watch, but I was left wanting a whole lot more, particularly a deeper analysis of Mercury as an individual, rather than the simple facts of what happened to him. In that, Bohemian Rhapsody is a fairly generic biopic, and it doesn't do quite enough to spark an immense interest in something that should be so much more spectacular.Above all, the film's first half is a really disappointing watch. Jumping back and forth between a focus on the band as a whole and Mercury alone, it's an infuriatingly messy period that's peppered with a few random and rather emotionless (albeit entertaining) musical numbers, making for a disappointing and underwhelming opening to the film.What's more is that the dialogue is really rather poor throughout. Apart from the fact that the majority of the humour really falls flat, too many scenes feel like a slow-moving slog through some very iffy dialogue, as the film attempts to create a sense of pathos as we see Mercury discovering more about who he truly is, but unfortunately misses the mark with a heap of dialogue scenes that lack the emotion and energy that I felt the film was really in need of.So, the first half is an undoubtedly disappointing, and with a rather superficial and generic biopic setup, as well as less-than-stellar dialogue and humour, Bryan Singer's direction means that the film often comes across as a rather boring watch, with none of the vigour or deep emotional conflict that's needed to transform the story from a history lesson into something a whole more affecting.Fortunately, things do turn around about halfway through, and although it all takes a very long time to get started, the film's second half introduces some strong dramatic conflict surrounding Mercury's sexuality and increasingly flamboyant lifestyle, which makes for a far more interesting watch.While I can't say that the dialogue or humour improves particularly towards the end, there is at least a sense of dramatic depth and emotion that shines through eventually, and that's what makes the film's second half a far more engrossing and entertaining watch, concluding with an excellent medley of Queen's greatest hits that finally packs a good emotional punch, even if it does all feel like too little, too late.Rami Malek's performance is an interesting one for me, because it's the only part of the movie that's got a bit of flamboyance and energy to it from start to finish. On the one hand, that's an excellent portrayal of Freddie Mercury when contrasted with the people around him, and Malek does a great job at bringing him to life right the way through, particularly when things become a little more emotional in the second half.On the other hand, there's a bit of a clash between Malek's performance and the rest of the film's rather underwhelming nature. In the first half above all, it feels like Malek is really overacting, and you're not able to see him as Freddie Mercury for a long while, definitely not until the screenplay gets its act together towards the second half. It's an energetic and hard-working performance, and that ultimately comes good, but there's something about it that just doesn't mix in with the rest of the film, feeling a little distracting and even jarring at points.Overall, then, I have to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is a bit of a mixed bag. While it tells the story of an incredible man and his part in an incredible band, it fails to really inject the same passion and energy that Queen's legacy has left on the world, coming across as a rather superficial and simplistic biopic that starts off in very disappointing fashion, only coming good a long way into the film, before a very entertaining but belated finale.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Bohemian Rhapsody,"A biopic fitting for such an amazing individual and iconic singer. Rami Malek delivers an eerily great performance as Freddie Mercury that is more than deserving for the Oscars, and it is even better that the film does not feel carried by him, but carried by the aura of Mercury and his music. You could just see in Rami's eyes that this is not just another role for him, but he truly embodies another individual. The beginning portion of the film does feel a bit loose, but with so much to tell in such a short period of time, it is hard to place the blame on anyone, especially with such an emotional and surprisingly uplifting ending. Not a traditional rendition of a biopic, as it feels more cheerful and more... Mercury.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great Film for any fan of Queen.,"Bohemian Rhapsody great film and by far one of my favourite films of the year such a great story and some great acting performances i would recommend this for any Queen fan.The performances in this film where amazing were amazing especially Rami Malek who played Freddie Mercury did an excellent job and looked exactly like him and he played the role perfectly in my opinion.There some excellent moments in the movie and some where very emotional and for a Queen seeing what he went through and learning his story was incredible and i shed a couple of tears during the movie.The movie was also really well directed and showing the live performances the band was incredible and it felt like i was there watching the band live all those years ago.
You can tell everyone put all there passion in this movie and it was brilliant.Now some of the movie was historically incorrect ive heard from other Queens fans that how he got Aids and how he found out played out differently in real life than it did in the movie so for Queen purists that can be annoying but it does not ruin the movie.A great movie with great performances that i enjoyed from start to finish i also loved the Live Aid performance scene that was just perfect and really showed that Freddie was the best live performer and no one could play a crowed like he could.

That VOICE!,"Greetings again from the darkness. That VOICE! During my life, I've been fortunate enough to see many of rock's greatest bands live in concert, including: The Who, The Rolling Stones, Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and AC/DC. Each of these bands are amazing, but no other concert combined the energy, showmanship and musicianship as Queen (two different tours). And certainly no other lead singer donned a Harlequin leotard ... only Freddie Mercury could make that look seem natural.This is such an odd movie, and one that is somewhat difficult to discuss. It's billed as an ""inspiring story"", though one wonders how self-destructive living, an acrimonious band break-up, and dying young of AIDS could be considered inspiring. It's not supposed to be a biopic, but the vast majority of the screen time is devoted to Freddie Mercury. And to really confound us, the film kind of drags (pun possibly intended) during the personal story times ... and then explodes with greatness during the band and live performance segments.Rami Malek plays Freddie Mercury, and he perfectly captures the swagger and strut of one of rock's greatest theatrical showmen. Mercury was born Farrokh Bulsari in Zanzibar, and the film shows us his conservative family and time spent working as a baggage handler at Heathrow. Of course, things change quickly once he joins up with guitarist Brian May (played here by Gwylim Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy, MARY SHELLEY). When bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) is added, Queen is born.With a story and script from two Oscar nominated writers, Peter Morgan (THE QUEEN, ironically) and Anthony McCarten (THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING), it's surprising that much of the film is downright slow - especially the bits with frenemy Paul (Allen Leach). Perhaps this is more a factor of the issues with the director's chair, where Bryan Singer is credited despite being fired during production. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel filled in until Dexter Fletcher (next year's Elton John biopic ROCKETMAN) was hired to complete the film. Lucy Boynton (so good in SING STREET) holds her own as Mercury's wife and friend Mary Austin, and Mike Myers plays producer Ray Foster (with a tip of the cap to WAYNE'S WORLD). Other supporting work comes courtesy of Dickie Beau as influential DJ Kenny Everett, Aiden Gillen, Tom Hollander and Aaron McCusker.The 20th Century Fox opening fanfare has its own Queen version, and is not to be missed as the film begins. Of course, it's the infamous 1985 Live Aid performance that is the film's highlight and one that will leave every audience member pumped up, smiling, and singing along. It's a stunning sequence on a custom built Wembley Stadium stage, and it helps erase much of the tedium of the film's non-band scenes. Erasing any doubt as to whether the film is worth the price of addition ... hearing that VOICE at full volume on today's theatrical sound systems. Killer Queen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A significantly different experience if you're not familiar with Queen,"Films that draw on historical subjects can produce an interesting divide in the viewer based on how familiar you are with the subject. A great deal of the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" reviews to date have expressed disappointment because it's a paint-by-numbers of all the major points of Mercury's life.As someone who grew up in a household where my father listened primarily to classical music and my mom listened to a radio station called ""The Sounds of Sinatra"", I'm embarrassingly unfamiliar with most music before 1998. My knowledge on Queen boils down to A) songs I recognize by Queen like ""Bohemian Rhapdsody"", ""Killer Queen"", ""Somebody to Love"", and ""We Will Rock You"" and B) songs that play on commercials or in summer festivals or movie soundtracks that I knew of but didn't know they were specifically Queen like ""Under Pressure"", ""Another one Beats the Dust"", and ""We are the Champions"" (thanks ""The Mighty Ducks"" for the assist on that one) and little information on the band members. I honestly have no idea how people can keep track of the names of so many band members of groups that came before their time. The point, however, is that your knowledge of Queen is going to affect how you see this film.If you follow the school of film criticism that the film's intent matters, I'd suggest that this film was made for people like me. Reading the interviews with Queen's surviving band members, director Bryan Singer and producer Graham King, this was a passion project because they wanted to educate. Look at Graham King's quote:""But I was also fascinated with the idea that there is so much about Freddie Mercury and Queen-arguably one of the greatest bands in history-that the general public does not know....This is such an important story to tell, and, for me, it was crucial that we not only celebrate their music and achievements, but also give people a better understanding of the band's history.""At the same time, if you're not going to see the film specifically to rediscover Freddy Mercury from a backstage perspective, this will read kind of like every other rock biography in existence. The protagonist is a man driven by pure id and does whatever he pleases and, for the most part, doesn't care who's in his way. It's the result of having all the right creative instincts and being isolated from reality by handlers who want to feed off of him. The protagonist's ego becomes oversized and he sews his wild oats. He either gains self-control or doesn't (they often dies young) but the audience is encouraged to see his beautiful soul and his contributions over his sins because that audience is biased before the movie stars by an appreciation for the music.
It's not really the fault of the film if it all follows a predictable script: The screenwriter is beholden to the details of the subject's life and Freddy Mercury is what they had to go with.Some of these entries (Love and Mercy is a good example) manage to transcend the genre even with figures who fall into the same narrative but Bohemian Rhapsody is largely beholden to the genre. As interesting as Mercury was of a person, the story flattens some of the more interesting chapters of his life by not involving his origin as a Parsi immigrant (his family is largely absent beside the opening chapter) or a promising student. His conflict with his surname and legacy and status as an immigrant is never explored.Similarly, there was a harmony among the members of the group that is overlooked in the film because conflict is juicier. To what degree were they ok with his gay lifestyle? There are erroneous complaints that the film straight-washes Mercury (not true), but it would be interesting if his band mate's reaction was covered. Similarly, the band was held together because ""they were a family"" but I was told that more than I was showed it.Part of the problem is screen time: With his marriage to a woman that fell apart because she was upset with him for being bisexual (it seems that there is a misunderstanding over whether bisexual means faithful), his bandmates, his family, his lecherous manager, his exploration of himself some of these chapters get short shrift.On the whole, it's certainly watchable but it had more unanswered questions than room to fill.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Best movie i've seen in a while,"I read a lot of critics and there will always people who manage it to get offended by the fact that the movie does not follow the complete story of Mercury's life, but thats why its called a movie and not a documentary. Its romanticized. Just like every movie existing. Although it's already said like a thousand times, they did an amazing job on the casting. I'm still convinced Brian May played himself. John Deacon was nailed as well. The production also really focused on details, they even made Ben Hardy, the actor who played Roger Taylor, look older than he actually is during the Live Aid scene by getting him wrinkles underneath his eyes. Just because Taylor was around his 40's at that time while the actor is like 25 years old or something like that. Not to mention Rami Malek as Freddie was brilliant I just have no words for it. (Oscar?) I have already seen the movie 3 times in the cinema and it was worth the money just to notice some fine details the movie includes.

"A Harmonious Tribute to Queen, Yet Missing Mercury's Frenzy","In the grand symphony of music biopics, Bohemian Rhapsody emerges as a harmonious ode to the legendary rock band Queen, skillfully weaving together their meteoric rise and the indelible legacy of their charismatic frontman, Freddie Mercury. A cinematic journey through a treasure trove of Queen's spectacular songs, the film's meticulous attention to detail in recreating the iconic Live Aid performance deserves applause. However, while Bohemian Rhapsody shines as a well-crafted production, it's not without its own share of limitations, particularly in capturing the unbridled essence of the larger-than-life Freddie Mercury.The film undeniably thrives on its musical prowess. With toe-tapping numbers that traverse genres and ignite emotions, the soundtrack becomes the beating heart of the movie. The electric renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You and Radio Ga Ga give the audience a taste of Queen's unparalleled artistry. The centerpiece, the Live Aid concert, is a masterstroke of accurate recreation, from the precise stage setup to the infectious energy that flowed between the band and the audience. This segment alone pays homage to one of rock history's most unforgettable moments.Yet, even as Bohemian Rhapsody dazzles with its song-and-dance routines, it falters in painting the full spectrum of Freddie Mercury's vibrant persona. Rami Malek, who won accolades for his portrayal of Mercury, impeccably mimics the singer's mannerisms and stage presence. Nevertheless, the PG-13 film tends to steer clear of Mercury's R-rated complexities, portraying him more as a misunderstood artist than as the wild force of nature he was.Mercury's journey from Farrokh Bulsara to the icon who changed the face of rock 'n' roll is marked by both triumphs and tribulations. However, the movie often seems hesitant to delve too deep into his personal life, choosing instead to gloss over the more controversial and poignant aspects. While it's understandable that some artistic liberties were taken for the sake of a mass audience, it's disappointing to witness Mercury's tumultuous relationships and inner battles given such a restrained treatment.The dichotomy between the sanitized depiction of Mercury and the film's own message of celebrating authenticity becomes evident. The exhilarating high points in Mercury's life are captured with a sense of reverence, but the lows are approached with a sense of caution. This imbalance prevents Bohemian Rhapsody from achieving the raw emotional impact it could have had.Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-crafted and entertaining tribute to Queen and their extraordinary music, seamlessly weaving together iconic songs and memorable moments. The film's meticulous reconstruction of the Live Aid performance is a commendable feat in itself. However, its reluctance to fully embrace the unbridled spirit of Freddie Mercury holds it back from transcending the realm of a mere biographical retelling. While the film serves as a gateway for newer generations to discover Queen's legacy, it leaves room for a more daring and candid exploration of the enigma that was Freddie Mercury.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Mercury rising and falling,"This two hour plus celebration of the life and times of flamboyant Queen front-man, Freddie Mercury chooses to put his music at the forefront of his brief and often troubled personal life and indeed ends at the scene of his greatest career triumph, to wit, Queen's day-stealing slot at the London setting for 1985's Live Aid, even eclipsing R. E. O. Speedwagon in the process! So the movie starts and ends with the group doing their twenty minute Live Aid set, jumping back from preparing to go on stage, to then telling the singer's story in conventional back-to-front format, from his days as a rebellious teenager in his parents' strictly religious household, to working as an airport baggage handler, where he is the object of casual racist comments to his fateful meeting with his band-mates just as their then lead singer walks out on them.The story takes in the group's struggling to get signed by a record label, internal squabbling, finding success, more internal squabbling, Freddie's key relationship with his muse and soul-mate, if not bed-mate, Mary Austin, yet more internal squabbling, his mushrooming, hedonistic now openly gay lifestyle although he never publicly came out unlike say, David Bowie or Elton John and even more internal squabbling before the band all kiss and make up in time to boost Bob Geldof's fund-raising Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium.Naturally the soundtrack is peppered with any number of Queen classics which help to gloss over the sometimes over-dramatised sequences in Mercury's life. Rami Malek never once looks like Freddie, at least from the front, although ironically the actors playing the other band members strike greater resemblances. Malek is credible as the troubled Mercury and is equally good in the musical set pieces, although I felt the Live Aid climax looked a little unconvincing at times.Nevertheless it was impossible not to enjoy the movie as a whole, despite its shortcomings, even if the real Freddie Mercury still maintains his enigmatic mystique once the movie has ended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Worse Than Mockumentary,"The title of my review is not supposed to be a derogatory statement about this film, but rather a comparison to 1984 mockumentary about Queen-alike rock band named Spinal Tap. Bohemian Rhapsody does not come close to This Is Spinal Tap's wit and charm. It comes of as a glorified Queen concert which has very little to offer to an unbiased audience.I came to the cinema with very little expectations about this film. I was never a particular Queen fan, even though I listen to their stuff occasionally. And even so, the film left me with a lukewarm feeling afterwards. For all its length, it managed to be all style, and no substance. Characters are very one-dimensional, while the overall band dynamics is presented as a highly naive instant success story. Also the few characters who disregarded Queen, or were unsure about it were presented as villains, of course. While Rami Malek delivered a nice performance as Mercury, and the re-creation of Live Aid concert offered its perks, it was not enough to turn around otherwise poor storytelling.So to sum up: if you are a die-hard Queen fan, then this is a film for you. If you'd rather like to see a rock band film with more substance, then consider titles like This Is Spinal Tap or That Thing You Do! instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Real shame and failure!,"I don't agree with most of the reviews. I can't believe this film won Oscar! For what? What incapable director will choose this kind of actor to play Freddy Mercury? He is a short, small, thin man, with artificial teeth, can't be farther from the real person. Awarding Malek an Oscar for this role was an offense for the good actors. And it shows again and again how everything in Hollywood is arranged in advance, unfairly. Not to mention the chaotic editing.
Malek is not natural, he over-performs, not convincing at all. He just makes faces and mimics without showing any emotions. Bad actors just cannot show emotions. Most of the times he is ridiculous, leaving the viewer in wonder if this is supposed to be a comedy.
The story is artificially decorated, forced and unreal. It is part of his life but it doesn't reflect the real life of Freddy Mercury who left much bigger legacy with his voice and music. Why important parts of Freddy's life were neglected? Does it have anything to do with Hollywood greedy to make money? Where is the art in all this?

"This is not ""Elvis has left the building"" movie; IMITATION IS NOT ACTING.","The Oscar Best Actor Award was given to this guy, but in my humble opinion, he's actually no better than the other actors who got nominated. This whole movie if you didn't watch the real deal of Freddie on some video documentaries, maybe he's okay, but since my wife and I both had viewed those great videos showing how the real Freddie performed with his band, the Freddie in this movie simply didn't sell me at all. If you tried to tell a story about a real person, you've got at least to try your best to transform yourself into that person, not just outlook but his inner most soul. I've watched ""Vice"" and saw how Bale was completely transformed into that real person inside out, and believe me, you've got to convince me at least 90% that YOU were HIM, not just copycatting or compete in an imitation show, but just put in with a false overbite front teeth, a beard under your nose, or a long hair, a white sleeveless vest. No, performing someone who indeed existed in history, by imitation with some makeup materials was not enough, you've got to transformed yourself into that person as Freddie, giving off somewhat inexplainable CHARISMA that the real Freddie really carried on the stage and off stage life. This guy who played Freddie, not like Bale who played the VP, I didn't find any believable charisma from him. He didn't even try to put some weight to make him more alike, just his still skinny physic. So before our eyes, it just ended up like one of the Elvis look-likes.What this bio story telling about Freddie in this movie also seemed to be too tidbits and not so interesting to watch. The whole movie was just a lackluster imitation of the great and so talented Freddie, by signed up three other look-alike to assemble the Queen Band was another copycatting imitation, borrowing some concert footages in the background and making these guys imitated almost every movement of that band was a very basic and primitive technique trick, the only difference between a painted scene and those footages was the latter were motion pictures. There's no big enough impact or strong enough punch in this movie, so there's not enough empathy and regret for Freddie throughout the whole movie.That's exactly what my wife said to me afterwards: ""It's just a mediocre feeling-less imitation movie. I'd rather watch those real Freddie concert videos time after time, again and again, not only never feel tired of his performances but will always feel blasted with energy from him. This film is like what we saw when the patient just died, a never-ending green flat line from left to right on the life monitor.""",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A solid but risk-free biopic,"For a band and frontman that were anything but run of the mill, Bohemian Rhapsody is a rather bio by the numbers affair that does nothing you wouldn't expect it to do, while delivering the crowd pleasing moments that will see it become a likely box office heavyweight.That Bohemian is even the middle of the road experience it is is some form of movie miracle, as the production of this long mooted examination of world conquering rock band Queen and it's lead singer Freddie Mercury had lived many lives before it began, most famously with Sacha Baron Cohen signed up to play Mercury, only for the film to again face more trauma when it's credited director Bryan Singer was fired deep into production.Finished off with the help of actor turned director Dexter Fletcher, Bohemian is a coherant and polished undertaking that shines a light onto the stadium packing band and the polarising behaviour and chauvinism of Mercury, that never threatens to become anything truly special despite the valiant and impressive turn from its lead man Rami Malek.Inhabiting Mercury in a chameleon like performance, this is a career defining role for Malek who has so far been best known for his role in TV show Mr. Robot and while it would've been quite the sight to see Baron Cohen's take on Mercury, it does feel as though there was no better man for the Mercury job at this time and place than Malek.Malek remains a constant strength to the film as it ebbs and flows between a foot stomping Queen love letter and an at times laborsome play by play on key Queen moments, that culminates in what's unquestionably the film's highlight, the famous Wemberly Stadium Live Aid Gig that will make audiences leave the cinema thinking they watched a much better film than they in fact did.It's a shame the energy found in this extended and energetic sequence wasn't to be found more regularly in the film, as had it done so in addition to featuring more daring and inventive structures and further delving into Mercury's complicated mindset, Bohemian would've been one of the years most memorable big screen outings.Final Say -All thing's considered Bohemian Rhapsody is a solid Queen experience that's founded around Malek's showstopping turn, one only wishes that this safe offering took more risks and aimed a little higher, much like its subject matters did.3 coffee machines out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"So Hyped, Also Dissapointing","Man, I was excited for this film. I had watched the trailers multiple times, I love Queen's music and I love Rami Malek. Rami Malek is fantastic as Freddie Mercury, you really believe him in this performance. But the amazing music makes up for how mediocre this movie is.Movies that put in great music really can make you feel certain emotions while watching. If it's intense music, you feel scared, maybe it's sad and beautiful music, it makes you feel sad. Queen's music can be used in any movie and make it better, and it makes this movie better than it is. They get a lot of the facts wrong which is frustrating if you know the story. But they also mix up their image of Freddie.Since Freddie Mercury is no longer living (R.I.P) the ones still remaining in the band are the ones that have control over the story. I feel like they make the band members very clean and civilized and they make Freddie look like the enemy. Sometimes they make Freddie this really annoying, aggravating character that we just want to stop doing whatever he is doing, but then right after that they make us feel sympathy for him. Maybe this is used for a good purpose, it didn't work for me. Even if he was respected for his music skills, he does seem like an outcast in the band.The movie's runtime is also very long, even if it leads up to a fantastic ending scene. The pacing has problems, and when things are moving fast it's hard to keep track. Is Freddie Mozart? It seems like he is, one melody after another is just popping in his head and there is just so much going on that we don't even know what's happening! They wanted a long film, they spend too much time on making certain characters too big of a part in the film rather than slowing down and explaining what was happening when Queen was a rising success. This is a problem with the writing, and all we get out of it is how hard Rami Malek is working to piece this movie together.Look, don't listen to me, really, just go see the movie with a fresh opinion. It's memorable, and I'd see it again with someone else to share the experience. People will disagree with my opinion, that's ok. People had mixed feelings about the song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when it came out, and look, it's one of the greatest songs ever. Highly recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" Doesn't Capture the Epicness Queen Deserves","There are a few bands I look back and wished I had the opportunity to see perform live, and Queen is one of them. While I haven't yet journeyed into the deep cuts of their music, I did find myself impressed with what I head from Another One Bites the Dust and Under Pressure. So I was pretty excited to see a Queen biopic, but I found myself complaining about the same things I did about All Eyez on Me. It gets the performances and highlights, but severely lacks connective tissue.Where the film excels is Rami Malek giving a very solid performance is Freddie Mercury and giving an extremely thrilling finale at their iconic Live Aid performance (which is worth the price of admission alone). The problem the film doesn't develop the other band members at all or even the creative process. And while the film addresses Freddie Mercury's private relationships with men, I feel the movie plays it almost entirely sexually driven and hedonistic with no real thread of intimacy.Bohemian Rhapsody has some thrills, but ends up being a major disappointment for me as a whole. While it's great to hear Queen's songs on display, it gives little to no context and is quick to move on from the song before the chorus. I just wished the movie rocked as much as the movie did.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Overrated & Superficial,"The movie leaves a lot to be desired, and is definitely not the masterpiece people are making it out to be, but an average biopic at best. Highly predictable, the actions of the characters are very expected and the characters are mostly stereotypes even to a non-fan.For a biopic about such a colorful individual, the colors are certainly very drab, as are the sets. This picks up a bit after the middle, but the bland colors reminiscent of a Marvel movie are a strange choice from Singer.The movie is incredibly rushed, obviously trying to fit everything into a viewer-friendly 2 hours, but unfortunately it sacrifices characterization & establishing relationships. Halfway through the movie I realized i still have no idea who the other members of the band are, I wasn't even sure hoe many they were (I'm not a big Queen fan), for me it was just one big mess of long hair. By the end, the characters are finally established, but you have no empathy for them and feel no connection since they get almost zero depth.
The Paul character I am still not sure who he is or where he came from, or how he influenced the protagonist so much.
Malek is adequate, although definitely not worthy of any awards since the material is simply not enough to warrant even a nomination. He never manages to make us believe he's anything other than Rami Malek playing Freddie Mercury, and the overdone prosthetics definitely don't help.The final scenes are of course very epic and moving, leaving you with a sense you watched a movie that's far superior to the one you actually just watched.6.5",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Absolutely Phenomenal,"The only person who could play Freddie Mercury better than Rami Malek would be Freddie Mercury himself. I was blown away by the cast of Bohemian Rhapsody. The story was incredibly well written and there was never a lull. The cast meshed together so well and I think that made their ability to perform playing legends like Queen even better. This was the first time I've seen Rami Malek's acting but I know he's been on the radar for years. His ability to transform into Freddie Mercury goes beyond makeup & wardrobe. His mannerisms and the confidence you know Freddie Mercury for having were so important for whatever Actor ended up with the part to nail. The efforts they made to recreate their iconic Live Aid performance was incredible. There were times when I actually became overwhelmed watching Rami Malek play Freddie. He was one of the most talented musicians in history and it's a huge task to try living up to that but it was like Rami Malek was born to play this role. He was just that incredible. It's especially apparent at the end of the film where old footage of Freddie Mercury performing with Queen is played as the credits roll. I got my intro to Queen after begging my mom to buy me Wayne's World when I was 12. Until last year when the announcement this biopic was in the works I didn't even realize I was a Queen fan. I clicked on a Queen greatest hits album that was trending on iTunes only to discover that songs I'd been listening to whenever they came on the radio were not by different bands as I had thought. Queen was just so exceptionally talented that their sound never stopped evolving and it was impossible to hear a song by them and know right away who the artist is. If you're debating seeing this movie, stop. Get in your car, and go to the theater. Zero regrets. If Rami Malek doesn't at least earn a Best Actor nomination for his role as Freddie Mercury this year I won't even bother watching the Academy Awards.

Although one part around the middle was quite boring, it could not spoil the overall impression. The great selection of actors and their even better performances, excellent music and some of the best songs ever written, and perfect balance of touching drama and good humor completely hypnotized me, so I spent most of the film either in tears or loudly laughing, and often both simultaneously.

Fluffy tribute that played it safe,"I was neither here nor there heading into this one earlier tonight. Not being a massive fan of the band itself, I wasn't fussed on being treated to 2hrs 15mins of all the hits, but desperately hoping for a deep look into Freddie Mercury's world that we might not have seen before, all of his off stage antics & issues that inevitably caused the break up of Queen.Alas it didnt really turn out that way, this isnt to say that Rami Malek didn't do a great job as the energetic front man, he does. A quite brilliant job in fact. It just seems like they merely glided over the deeper issues at hand & skipped by them as quickly as they could. Zero risks taken, when it probably could have been so much more. With a 12A rating in the UK I probably shouldn't be surprised.I've since learned that Brian May & Roger Taylor were responsible for Sacha Baron Cohen not getting the Freddie gig as he wanted to go deeper/darker & focus solely on Mercury and less so the band itself. Going in this direction would've grabbed me 10x as much, but that's just personal preference.As well as Malek's excellent performance, the tracks are all there sounding absolutely superb through the big screen & the visuals for old Wembley at Live Aid were stunning!Although I do feel said performance was way over cooked in the finale, running 10mins longer than it should have. A good portion of time that couldve been utilised elsewhere.This was a decent enough movie for Queen fans all over, but still remains the feel good tribute movie that the 3 surviving members will be delighted with.

Masterpiece performances befitting Royalty,"To say I enjoyed this film is a massive understatement... it is quite possibly the most enjoyable film I have ever seen on the big screen.
The performances of the band members are outstanding, capturing their personalities brilliantly, and if Rami Malek is not an Oscar winner, then there is no justice in the world.
If you are a Queen fan, like I am, then you will come out of this film feeling like you have seen an amazing concert, constantly foot tapping and trying not to burst into song throughout the film. if you aren't a Queen fan, then you can still immerse yourself into the bands hits, and enjoy the story being unfolded in front of you.
Some of the film had me with goosebumps, some of it had me feeling nostalgic, and other parts had em with a tear in my eye, as you realise the personal issues that Freddie went through, and the inevitable sad end to his life.
It is a film that I will go to see in the cinema again, and when released on Blu Ray, will played so many times. I thoroughly recommend you see this film and leave with a smile on your face and a song in your step.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

We both sang, laughed, cried, sang... all the way. Younger crowd arround us wasn't singing, but everything else was there in the air! Great film makers did really excellent job and I hope that most people decide to watch and appreciate it. Because they will enjoy it!

A very enjoyable movie but not one without a few flaws.,"I like to keep my reviews short so here we go. To point out a few positives of the movie, every single performance is amazing, most notably Rami Malek in the leading role. The song choices are of course spectacular and don't just follow the typical greatest hits format. Of course the hits are there but people are introduced to songs such as Keep Yourself Alive and Doing Alright. The Live Aid performance was something that everyone worked their hardest on and it shows. However, I think after the movie shifts from the 70's into the 80's, I think it slows down and gets a little less interesting. Also, there are many historical inaccursies, which isn't awful but stand out to a hardcore Queen such as myself. Finally, after watching Rocketman, I realise that this movie could have been done so much more better if they had chosen to do a 15 rated movie.Overall, it's a very good and enjoyable movie although it does have it's flawed it's a movie I did buy on Blu-Ray and I have fun watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Send shivers down my spine,"Hugely enjoyable. It's certainly not perfect; the influence of Brian May and Roger Taylor can be felt at times when scenes start to feel a bit rose-tinted, but Rami Malek superbly portrays the lonely, conflicted, tortured genius that was Freddie Mercury. Gwylim Jones, Ben Hardy, Joe Mazzello and Lucy Boynton are all excellent too and the music, of course, rocks!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Enjoyable movie.,"I always liked most of Queen songs to begin with. So I was kind of apprehensive when going to the cinema at first.
Nevertheless bringing some extra popcorns and drinks was sort of an insurance incase the movie was bad. Luckily for us, the movie was so good that we had to finish eating them outside after the movie was over. It is very engaging to watch.
This is one movie where the main cast members seemed to have incredible chemistry as if they were Queen in real life.

An insult to the memory of Mercury,"The sole reason for this movie's commercial appeal is the timeless score, but a Queen fan would arguably enjoy simply watching actual footage of the late charismatic musical genius rather than this historically inaccurate and exploitative blockbuster.The only positive generated by the creation of this motion picture was exposing Queen's incredible discography to a new generation. But if that's your intent, save your money and buy one of their numerous ""greatest hits"" collections instead of watching this abomination.Fun fact: This was the lowest-rated movie to receive the top honors at the Golden Globes in 33 years.

Brilliant!,"I went with slightly mixed feelings because of the critics' reviews but they were WRONG! This is a brilliant film and the 2+ hours just flew by. Superb acting from all. To find people who look like Queen and can also act was a stroke of good luck. Of course, it goes without saying that the music was spinetinglingly amazing and I think Marc Martel should get greater recognition for his Freddie vocals.

Wonderfully entertaining,"Let's get this out of the way first.
I'm 54 years old.
I fell in love with Queen (specifically Roger Meddows Taylor and Freddie Mercury) when Bohemian Rhapsody (the song!) First came out.
I then bought (well, my parents did) A night at the opera, Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart attack and listened to them over and over on my little record player.
I read every interview in NME and the other magazines at the time and was also in the official Queen Fan Club (I got SO excited when I saw the postman coming down the drive with an A4 size envelope in his hand!)

"Not terrible, but problematic","This film is similar to Green Book. It's actually not a ""terrible"" film in terms of filmmaking- there are some good scenes, especially the music ones, and I do think the acting is worth it. But it's not a particularly good film either, as the script is lacking in any real substance. It tries to chronicle an entire journey but doesn't hit many of its targets with any real meaning. It's shallow and all surface-based, although it's not boring.But that would have been enough to critique if it wasn't for how problematic and offensive it is. The film really does try to portray anything related with his sexuality in a negative light. In one of its most offensive scenes, during the section where Freddie is acting out, there's a montage of him circling dark corridors for men and sex. The film paints everyone straight as positive and everything related to his sexuality as negative. I don't think it was intentional, but it is telling and it doesn't matter. Rami Malek really does deliver some great work, but it's a miracle he's able to with so much mediocrity and problems around him. Freddie Mercury (and Rami Malek) deserved so much better.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Bohemian Rhapsody review,"The involvement of Brian May and Roger Taylor means we get a largely sanitised view of the dynamics within the band, with both portrayed as the picture of reasonableness in the face of flamboyant leading man Freddie Mercury's psychological frailty, but the music at least provides us with a poignant reminder of just how good Queen were. And Rami Malek is flawless as Mercury.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Clueless Critics Don't Know the Meaning of Entertainment,"The casting was very well done, the sound was terrific and the story was thoughtful enough without trying to make up some hidden deeper meaning to pander to the pretentious movie critics.
Don't go into this thinking that you're going to come away with an accurate biographical story of a musician whose life was cut far too short. The timelines don't mesh with what really happened or in the proper chronological order but that doesn't take away from what is a good if toned down storyline. The music is the central theme as much as Freddie and they do a great job with it. It felt like being at a rock concert throughout many of the scenes and the recreation of Live Aid was amazingly spot on including the performances of the cast.
I loved Queen's music growing up and this movie was a great reminder of why.

Having 'Almost Everything',"""Bohemian Rhapsody"" soars to the heavens as the cinematic chronicle of the rise, fall and redemption of legendary rock band Queen and its charismatic lead singer Freddie Mercury, authentically inhabited by Rami Malek: The tragedy and joy of their iconic music. Yet, what touches foremost is the love story of Freddie and his soul mate Mary, played by radiantly strong Lucy Boynton.While lying in bed together after Freddie dazzled in Queen's concert, he confesses to Mary that the only place where ""I'm not afraid"" is performing on stage. Mary loves Freddie. Still discovering his amazing voice through his music, he suffers in his inauthenticity, in his sexuality.After returning from a lengthy Queen tour, Freddie discloses his sexuality to Mary. He says, ""You are almost everything..."" Mary is heartbroken. 'Almost' is never enough. That visceral sense of sadness resonates in Director Bryan Singer's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".This very much is Bryan's film, although the studio fired him before the movie's completion. Another director completed the filming for theatrical release. Openly gay Bryan poignantly reminds: Finding and accepting your distinct voice is scary regardless of gay or straight. Announcing who you are to the world is terrifying for all of us. Bryan, Rami and Lucy compassionately say that we try to love ourselves and gift from what is within us. Freddie Mercury brilliantly did that.Freddie Mercury died of AIDS at 45 years old. I was a huge fan of Freddie back in high school. Freddie had flamboyant charisma and the voice of an angel. I found cathartic joy in Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""We Will Rock You"" or ""We Are the Champions"". Although, Queen's music represented freedom, it ironically cloaked Freddie's suffering: To be himself. In his journey Rami astounds as Freddie.Accepting his life's deception, Rami's Freddie tells Mary in the pouring rain, ""I'm happy for you."" Lucy's tearful visage is her hope that Freddie discovers his own joy in life. Bryan Singer's narrative is about healing as Freddie sees what he has become and his fate. Rami is powerful vulnerability and humanity. You see his soulfulness in his eyes. You hear it in his voice. He beautifully regenerates the late Freddie's immortal sound. Rami expresses Freddie's vibrant spirit that captivated us all those years ago.""Bohemian Rhapsody"" begins in London with young design student and Heathrow baggage laborer Freddie. He's the son of the Parsi family, followers of the Zoroastrian faith. Traditional Father Bromi, played by solid Ace Bhatti, disapproves of his son's choice not to follow in his professional footsteps. Freddie wants to be a rock star.His opportunity arises when guitar god Brian May, played by compassionately wise Gwilym Lee, needs a lead singer for his band. Brian and drummer Roger Taylor, played by spritely Ben Hardy, take a chance on Freddie. While joining the band, Freddie falls for beautiful kind Mary. Freddie eventually meets Paul, played by subversively charming Allen Leech, who reveals as the duplicitous seducer.At times Anthony McCarten's screenplay veers into the indulgent excess of the 'rock star' life, coming across as caricature. Yet, his narrative has the authentic feel for the creation of music as when Brian stamps out the beat for ""We Will Rock You.""In the end Anthony and Bryan create profound compassion for Freddie Mercury: Whether he is free to express his voice in the world, regardless of what others think. We care whether Freddie finds true love, again. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is full of sound, sadness, and joy. It will rock you, too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The People Have Spoken - And They Love It!,"I was already convinced after my first time watching it that any Queen fan would love this film. It left my friends and me emotional and enthused.My mum, a long-time Queen fan (she has even seen them live in 1982) and her best friend, talking about the movie non-stop even months before it came out and absolutely enthralled after seeing it two times already, had this idea to organize a private Bohemian Rhapsody screening at our local cinema.
About 150 people can fit into this small venue and we were inviting people left and right, friends, family, telling them all to bring their friends and family.In the end, we actually had an entire room filled; around 115 of our own people showed up and the variety was remarkable: We had anyone between the age of 7 and 85; men, women, teenagers, parents, grandparents, long-time Queen-fans and people who only knew a song or two. By far not everyone considered themselves a Queen fan, some merely came along for a nice Sunday evening at the movies. In the end, the room was packed, the rest of the seats were given to some confused visitors.A movie screening with friends and familiy is definitely worth it, the atmosphere was brilliant and I still had goosebumps after my third time seeing it. What is so special about this film is that it really does bring the generations together. Many of my friend's parents (I am 22) came along for nostalgic reasons and because they actually remember this time. Others were music fans or hobby musicians and loved the movie as a musical spectacular. But like I mentioned already, some people saw the film with no expectations whatsoever and they were still ALL blown away. I have not recieved a single complaint or bad word about the film.In conclusion can be said that the people truly have spoken. A big group of various age and taste was enchanted and highly entertained by Bohemian Rhapsody and that's why I can wholehartedly say that this film is absolutely amazing and a blast for anyone who sees it, not only fans.It really does do justice to a bunch of true legends.

True story with little truth and little interest,"In my opinion to make a good biopic picture, you must do two things; One stick to the true story as much as possible, two, show the things that the public has never seen, this is what makes the film interesting.Now this fails on both accounts. Key scenes in this are completely untrue and therefore the motivations behind the actions we seen aren't true. In the end its a largely fictional account of Queen.So many biopic movies fail on focusing on the behind-the-scene stuff, which is what we are all interested in. I don't need to see a Queen tribute band perform, I can see the real thing on YouTube.

Distracting dental appliance,"I went through a bunch of reviews and thought I'd see this mentioned left and right so apparently it only bothered me.My beef has to do mainly with the ridiculously large dental appliance (prosthetic?) that was fitted on Malek. At the end of the movie during the credit roll, there is some real vintage footage of Freddie. That gave us a good comparison of how his teeth were supposed to look. Instead it was like two giant chicklets on Malek. And what was so distracting, is you can see how much he was struggling with this appliance. He's constantly running his lip over the thing throughout the entire movie. Like an old man with dentures! Also the way he sucks in his cheeks in the early parts of the movie were very unconvincing. In both of these cases, less would have been much more. I found myself just staring at this poor guy's mouth struggling with this thing and it took away from the movie. Nobody else?The story itself was good. I would have liked to learn more about who Freddie really was. What was his musical background? How did the band gel so quickly and without any explanation with Freddie's vision of the band? I feel like a lot was left out and it was just throwing in the top 10 songs in a haphazard fashion to appease the viewers.I should also mention that while Malek's acting was good (certainly not Oscar material IMO), I don't think he was the best one to play Freddie.

Queen: A Freddie Mercury Story,"Bohemian Rhapsody is a lot like a Cheeto puff. At first, when you're in the moment, it's amazing. Problem is, when the moment passes and it's dissolved to nothing you realize it's just air. There's no real substance to a cheese puff and there's not really any in this movie either.That said, I love Queen. A movie full of their amazing music? Yes please. Add to that the fact that the actors playing the band do a really solid job and that's even better and Rami Malek is an exceptional Freddie Mercury. Honestly, between this and Mr Robot, I want to see anything that Malek puts to film next.But then there's the other side of it. The ""villains"" are so over the top, cartoon-like bad guys that it's ridiculous. The movie is practically a paint by numbers biopic, hitting all the overplayed notes even at the cost of accuracy to the actual events. Which, to me is a problem in and of itself. I'm not a super fan by any means but I have a passing knowledge of the Queen story, so there was really no hope of surprise here, making the formulaic approach all the more mundane.Still, did I mention I love Queen? I've watched this twice now and still get goosebumps at certain points just from the power of their music. It's like that Cheeto, I know there's nothing there.

But to be honest i didn't like the story of Freddie mercury ,obviously they can't change it or make it any better than that. They tried to make it as good as it can gets.
i enjoyed the music and Rami malek was great in it .

"WOW, the critics are so wrong!","Any massive Queen fan like me would have been full of emotions before seeing this movie. We all communicated our excitement through social media leading up to its launch.I made the mistake of reading several high-profile critic's take on the movie who were questioning accuracy of timelines etc. This put me in a nervous state walking into the theatre.But who cares. Trust me (and the thousands of other great reviews here) DON'T read the critics.This movie is a testament to the patience of Brian and Roger who took their sweet time to make this movie a tribute to the late, great Freddie.All the actors are incredible and Rami must be up for Oscar nomination. That was acting on every level and emotion. Also, the actor who played Brian was a pure reflection in looks and sound.I get emotional reading all the great reviews because it's us Queen fans whose thoughts mean the most - not critics.A massive thank you to Brian and Roger (and John) for this beautiful gift. I will watch again, then buy the DVD to treasure along with all my other Queen memorabilia.It was certainly worth flying from our beach-side town to a major city just to see it :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Ironically formulaic,"I wanted to love this movie I really did. I was blown away by the first scene of the film and Malik's likeness to Mercury. Sadly, after this I grew even more disappointed. The way they have written this is so formulaic and boring unlike Queen's ethos. The whole thing just seemed like a Hollywood adaptation to the story and a money making opportunity.Freddie Mercury was a fascinating character and to try to understand him we had to have an insight into the way he lived his life. Unfortunately with the age rating of the film there's no way they could do that. They've exchanged reality for a Family-friendly movie and it really misses the mark.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Freddie Mercury would be proud,"This film made me go back to cinemas after years without going.
Is one of the few cases in which I got what I was expecting:
A celebration of Queen!
And it's true, you leave the cinema actually feeling moved.
You get some of the group's story, and some of their music.
You end up actually believing you are watching Queen perform, and listening to their music through cinema sound adds another layer of greatness to their songs.
I didn't like Somebody to love very much until I heard it on film, and now I just love it.
This film makes you feel lovestruck with the group, and it delivers on something important: people do not only like Queen's music, they love Freddie Mercury and the group. The plot and treatment they all get is warm, that warmth transpires throughout the film. There was something about Freddie Mercury that made you actually like him, and the film did catch on that.
Rami Malek deserves any prize he can get, by far. You feel when he feels, and for me that's what signals good acting.Forget what some critics say, the film also touches the shady parts of their lives, it just doesn't need to focus on them, because the focus is our love for Queen and their music.
This film's been made for the people, and that's why people love it.
As Freddie says, we give people what they want.Exactly.This film is worth watching in cinemas. Definitely worth the price of admission.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Good movie but it should be great,"The film provoked divided opinions, and so am I on some similar thinking. I'm a fan of the band Queen so I definitely enjoyed the musical parts of the film because they sound great and look great. The music was quite represented in the film which was a big plus for me. Unfortunately everything else was mediocre. Lots of inaccurate data taken as facts in the film. The way Freddie and the band members were portrayed was lousy to me. It was weird for me since Brian May was involved in the film as a producer so it's not clear to me why they decided on this tone of the film and the portrayal of the band. In the end, overall, it was a good movie for me because of the songs, but this is not a quality movie or an accurate portrayal of Queen's career. It was supposed to be a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Memories of Youth and an LP,"«Bohemian Rhapsody» made me cry in several moments of great emotion. It reminded me of my youth. I was 24 years old when the album ""A Night at the Opera"" was released.

In my case, my appreciation mainly derives of my memories and the affection for the title song, because otherwise I was a bit distanced from the proceedings describe in the plot, which is quite formulaic and predictable, like almost all the biographical films of an idol that rises, falls and rises again.

The Best Band Biopic I've Seen,"This was a tremendous and entertaining film. Many music biopics like to just look at the personal lives, but this also shows how the music was made; the thought process behind some of their biggest hits. It was also nice to see everyone look like the real people they were portraying and not shoe horn an actor in there like they did with Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison. I had goosebumps during the Live Aid concert the same way I did the first time I watched it. Great film for not only Queen fans, but music fans in general.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Inaccurate timeline. More like fan fiction.,This movie is disrespectful to Freddie Mercury's memory. It's as if Brian and Roger purposely tried to gloss over real situations and issues the band had. They also changed the time line of several songs & band members which is a red flag that this is not a biopic but more of a promotional tool for another one of Queen & Adam Lambert's up coming tour.

So much potential but deceptive...,"This movie would have had so much potential with better casting... I'm talking about Rami Malek, which I do like; I loved him in ""Mr. Robot"", but Freddie Mercury is not a role that fits him. His accent, his look, his voice and the teeth (possibly a prop during the movie?) made his character sound like... Someone who is not the sharpest tool in the shed in my opinion. It left me somewhat clueless after watching the movie. On top of it all, the character himself has such a toxic, narcissist personality that it makes Freddie Mercury looks like the worst nightmare of any musician... Makes me wonder if the writer and director went the right way. I can't pretend that I knew Freddie Mercury, but I have a feeling that maybe focusing a bit more on his positive assets without completely ignoring the negative ones would have created somewhat of a peaceful balance. Instead, he just is the most immature, annoying, delusional and ignorant artist in the history of art! A feeling that I'm sure, real fans of Queen might not enjoy... In the end, the movie is entertaining enough to reach 6/10 for me, but it probably could have gotten 8.5 with better casting/writing/direction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Lots of Sizzle but not much Sausage,"It comes close but overall it failed for me, Malik's impression is over done except of the stage clips which he does very well.

deceptive bonus concert clip,"The DVD comes with ""the complete Live Aid performance"" as an extra, which made me believe apart from the biopic I would be seeing a clip of the real Freddie Mercury singing as an extra. But the clip is only a recreation of the 1985 concert again starring Rami Malek. Rami Malek's performance looks good, but the awful editing cuts down a lot of the stadium atmosphere, even intercutting with other locations. Then watching the original concert clip with Freddie Mercury elsewhere, I found a good resemblance, but the original singer is clearly stronger in his staging and interaction with the audience. Charismatic indeed. This deception and the numerous comments of Queen fans who have pointed out inaccuracies in the biopic (which I cannot confirm nor deny, apart from missing the Spanish opera duets period) have ultimately led me to buy a Queen concert DVD instead of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Divided,"Bohemian Rhapsody was one of my most anticipated movies of 2018. It'd be quite strenuous to oblige to you'll quite how crucial the band, Queen, means to me and how much they've inveigled myself as the person I am today.As a youngster, I had been raised upon the newest, hottest, artificially publicized pop and rap tracks that were continuously featured on the most vouged radio stations at the time, but in the corner of every auto-tuned, computerized feature I listened to, I would often get to occasionally tango to a Queen hit.Freddie Mercury and his band of bohemians are the quadruple-handed culprits who peeked my interest in soulfull, rock and roll music genres which conincidently, have shaped me into the ""Classic Rock-Head"" I am presently. Not only that, but the obscurities and lunacy of their lyrics-especially from hits like Bohemian Rhapsody-drove me into studying the arts of profoundly galvanized poetry/lyricism/literature.Their music additionally, has helped me power through numerous of my most emotionally conflicting encounters I had brawled with during my time here on planet Earth. This iconic band has been persisting alongside my life ever since I was born, and that's something I can't declare about towards any other musician/musical group.Now Here's My Consensus:I am very, very tied on this film. On one hand, I thought Bohemian Rhapsody tributed the story of Freddie Mercury-for the most part-judiciously, mainly due to Rami Malek's immersive performance. Trust me, if Malek wasn't in this movie, Bohemian Rhapsody would've crumbled to ashes apace with some of the biggest catastrophes of 2018. As a depiction and honory of a musical legend, I was earnestly contented to witness the results.On the other hand, I found this movie to be a pretty incoherent, potboiler mess of a product. The harshest way to submit this is, well, simply put, to say that Bohemian Rhapsody is fundamentally your average company manufactured, cop-out, strand of merchandise that was only fabricated for mainstream audiences who will unknowingly be able to eat up the same old ""Fast and the Furious: Family is Important"" blueprint that they've unconsciously seen billions of times.However, this movie is dang LUCKY that they got Malek on the project and that they AT LEAST managed to make a glaringly enthralling, two-hour, sound-explosion of a music video.The Main Core Killing This Movie: So, not gonna lie, Bohemian Rhapsody's script is somewhat atrocious in my humble opinion. This penmanship nearly lineaments everything I don't want in a ""based-on-a true-story"" feature. Whose bright idea was it to make a Marvel movie confided within a Queen movie, an arrangement which wasn't necessarily a construct that one should really consider for a freakin' Queen movie. Writers of the world, you don't have to throw in a satirical one-liner every twenty seconds in order to conquer your audiences attention!And MY MY. Like, if you didn't think a movie could get more ""by-the-books"" cliché-especially when diving in with all the family is valuable and family acceptance mortalities-than you sir or madam, were wrong. Screenwriters-I've been sounding so demanding recently, I apologize. I guess I'm just admittedly aggravated today-stop making your dilagoue feel as if it's sprouting out of the pages of a life coaching pamphlet! It's amateurish, honestly.They just had to bend the story into little bits and pieces because they just had to insert their little chestnut morals and preaches, and their superfluous, forced humor. Why Hollywood? Why? (Probably because of production issues and what not. Oh. And Bryan Singer. Supposedly. And marketing. And money. Definitely money.)The editing is a bit of a mess too. The sequence of events are muddled like crazy. You'll needa do some final cuts on this DARLING! And about 30% of the movie is just witnessing the band drag on from how they crafted one hit to how their next hit was created and so on so forth.Did I just rant? Woah, I totally did. Hmm...let's lighten matters up, I suppose. I don't want to give off too many negative vibes about this mediocre biopic feature. There is virtue to be found.But Rami Malek. This man carries this ENTIRE movie. Without him, Bohemian would like an ATOM BOMB. Or...not, like an Atom Bomb. Cause the song. Okay, I'll shut-up.Malek's performance is honestly Oscar-nominee worthy. He embodies head to toe, Freddie Mercury's EVERYTHING. Even in the sentimental, dramatic moments, he kills (sorry), DESTROYS it-despite the poor script and dialogue he's often given. Additionally, his chemistry and the story behind his love life was intriguing enough to keep me locked on. The positive outcome of the film originates from this portrayal and this plotpoint that majorily has to do with who Freddie was and what he had to accord with during his times of fame.I mildly relished Bohemian Rhapsody, and I was enthralled whenever we got to relive Mercury's tale, but...a Queen movie deserves light-years better than this. I'm possibly being a tad-bit generous offering Bohemian Rhapsody with this grade, but, I can't deny that I enjoyed and was cheery that I got to venture this film of messy yet, dapper flair...so: (Verdict: D+)",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

My Family and I Loved This Movie And That's Very Rare,"The only one missing in my family to see this was the true Queen fan but she had to work. Instead my other sister, nephew and my mom went to go see this and for the first time in what I think is ever we are unanimously loved this movie. I thought it was outstanding.The film starts out with Rami Malek (brilliant performance) as Freddie Mercury going from his mansion to the Live Aid concert until we go back to see just how the band got there. This was what I had been wanting to see from the film and how closely it recreates it because it was an amazing event and I never seen so many people until I saw that video.There is not a dull moment in this film. I can't say it accurately portrays the band, but I remembered a lot of stuff like Freddie playing the piano from his bed, the fact that he was gay. and that the band didn't always get along. The climax of the film, by the way, doesn't disappoint and it's amazing how accurate it was with the real event.Before I close this review, I must talk about the performances. Everyone did a wonderful job in the film but I think everyone will remember Rami Malek's portrayal as Freddie Mercury the most. I swear every single time he was on screen it was like seeing Freddie Mercury come to life. The way he is on stage is exactly how Freddie Mercury was. I'm not sure if he was really singing or not, but either way, he deserves to be nominated and I would lose faith in the Academy completely if he isn't.Queen fan or not, everyone should check out this movie. It is very inspirational, and a good representation of what it's like in the business.

Good biopic marred by addition of pointless inaccuracies,"Rami Makel plays Freddy Mercury, flamboyant front man of the rock group Queen, from the legendary band's seminal years to his early death from AIDS-related complications. The film is generally very good, with an excellent cast (especially Makel and Gwilym Lee, who plays guitarist Brian May), great music, and a nice period feel. Mercury was an astonishing stage presence, and the story of his life is fascinating, so it's beyond me why the film-makers had to make up nonsense like the band breaking up and reforming just before Live-Aid (in reality they toured just weeks before the massive charity gig) and Geldof having to be talked into allowing the band to play as a last minute addition to the schedule, or change the time-line of Mercury's AIDS diagnosis. Yes, I know that it's not a documentary, but making up facts for 'dramatic effect' diminishes the value of the film as a biography and shows a marked lack of faith in the material or the writers. I am surprised that band mates May and Roger Taylor allowed the pointless revisionism, especially as they professed to be concerned about 'Mercury's legacy'.

The show must go on!!!,"Bohemian Rhapsody is a very good movie and its defenitely an entertaining couple of hours.
Within the first 5 minutes of the movie you know this movie is a very good attempt to see what Queen but mostly what Freddie Mercury was all about.
Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury is very convincing and his performance is outstanding, but i prefered his performance as Freddie in the earlier years of Queen a lot more then Freddie during Live Aid for instance. Freddies Performance during live aid was amazing, inspiring and a very powerfull performance and i feel during that part of the movie Rami Malek lacked the powerful charisma that Freddie had at that moment.
It just didn't feel right to me.
Maybe its me but Freddie wasn't a small man but Rami during Live Aid looked quite small, and all the other members looked like teenagers while they were orginally already in their late 30's.
Also there were a couple of things that were not factual and that bothered me quite a bit.
During one of their first shows before getting famous, in the movie, they played fat bottomed girls during their show, but that song wasn't released until 1978 and not in early 1974 before they release killer Queen.
Same with the way they introduced we will rock you.
There were a couple of more things that weren't actually the way they happened and i couldn't help thinking how that was possible knowing that Brian May and Roger Taylor were executive producers of the movie.
Besides all that Bohemian Rhapsody is a really fun movie and you realize how good Queen really was, their music is really endless.
Rami Malek really deserved his oscar as Freddie Mercury but lets not forget the actors that played the other members.
Brian May was an outstanding performance and for me a brilliant choice and John Deacon was a great choice as well.
Bohemian Rhapsody is really worth the watch and very entertaining.
My rating would have been higher if not for those couple of things in my review.
A great effort and a great movie for Queen lovers and for a new generation to discover their amazing music, but for now the show must go on!!!

Watch the real thing,"Finally got around to seeing Bohemian Rhapsody. Instead of watching the movie at a theatre when it came out I decided to watch the real thing. I am of an age where I can remember sitting down to watch Live Aid. I wasn't a massive fan of Queen and they were just one act in the lineup of the best music acts on the planet that day. As acts came on and played their 30 minute sets starting from noon it was incredibly flat. Regardless of how popular the acts were they couldn't project themselves on such a big occasion. By evening it was frustrating just how poor the day was. Enter Freddie Mercury who turned everything round with one of the great live performances of all time. Maybe that gives a hint of why I wasn't jumping to watch this film. It couldn't live up to the real thing.And it doesn't. Whilst there's no doubt that Remi Malek puts in a great performance he isn't Freddie Mercury. The movie was a little too kind for my liking. Pretty sure Freddie Mercury will have been a lot wilder in real life. It's worth a watch, but make sure you take a look at the real thing if you enjoy this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It's a joy to watch and huge credit goes to Rami Malek for doing almost impossible job - representing one of the best (if not the best, sorry, Mick) frontmans in rock music who ever lived. Other actors played really well too. The movie is sensitive, touching, but not too sweet or comical - it is made with respect and love and I see why filmmakers decided to get rid of Sasha.

Not as Exuberant as the Iconic Song,"Queen remains as one of the most iconic rock bands of all time, so making a biopic about them was a no-brainer. This film in particular was actually in development since 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen attached to play Freddie Mercury himself. However, after several disagreements with Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, the project never went into full swing until a few years later, with Rami Malek of Mr. Robot to star as Mercury. In the end, what we got is a beautiful albeit standard tribute to the band. While it has its moments of inspiration, the product doesn't really rise above being passible and highly flawed.Right off the bat, the biggest problem with Bohemian Rhapsody lies within its depiction of Freddie Mercury through his personal life. Mercury was a highly fascinating albeit eccentric man who spent much of his life coping with his personal stigmas, yet the movie ends up rushing past plot point after plot point so much that the most we gain out of him was that he was bisexual, he liked cats and he died from AIDS. It doesn't help that the rest of Queen aren't given much development either, as each member comes off as two dimensional with little to know about them. What could have been a unique take on the musician biopic genre ends up being as cliche as the next, complete with disapproving parents, the shoddy romantic life, the greedy manager, the band break-up and the drug addiction. Even if some of these elements are appropriately dramatic, they still come off as routine and tiresome.On the plus side though, Rami Malek is fantastic as Freddie Mercury, as one can tell he truly analyzed his concert performances and videos in capturing enough charm, charisma and skill in recreating the iconic figure. In fact, the actors in general are wonderful in inhabiting their roles, especially those playing the other members of Queen. As formulaic as their relationship can be, they do manage to display a lot of witty banter and humorous rebuttals in managing their group. Even though Mary Austin is written as the typical concerned girlfriend, Lucy Boynton tries her best in making her sympathetic and she pulls it off well enough to create a decent amount of heart in the film. I can't say any of the characters are given enough dimension to be looked upon with greatness, but at least the cast knew how to deliver their performances with a lot of delightful zest.Bryan Singer's direction on the film can be a mixed bag at times. There are wonderfully crafted moments like the actors recreating the famous opening of the Bohemian Rhapsody music video, with negative quotes from critics being shown in contrast, and pretty much every performance and music video recreation, especially the Live Aid concert. However, other times the editing can get a little jarring and flashy up to the point where some of the performances can get a little sickening to watch. There might also be a few too many quick cuts even during scenes where characters just discuss specific details for their own good. On the other hand, the timing to the music, post production special effects and near flawless singing make up for what would otherwise be distracting choices in mashing scenes together in an exuberantly stylized manner.There has been a lot of respect for Freddie Mercury and what he did for modern music displayed in the film, but Bohemian Rhapsody could have been so much better than what it became. While the production design, acting and scenes of putting together the band's famous songs are worth praising, the rushed plot and simplified depiction of Mercury's personal and romantic relationships keep the film from being anything special. I suppose if you're simply a die hard Queen fanatic and you just want to see a decent albeit imperfect tribute to the famous band, then you might have a good time. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of them or you're very passionate about the real life of Mercury, it's best to give this one a skip. Maybe someday we'll get a truly marvelous and correct bio on one of Britain's greatest bands, but right now, this will simply remain as one of Rami Malek's best performances on his resume, because that man knew how to bring the bisexual super star to life better than this flick did.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Beyond my feelings on this the film itself was great the cinematography, VFX (Creating the arena, ect) was amazing. I feel a ton of work came from the production company that had to do a lot of homework to make this film successful. I think as so many fans Queen has even gaining popularity in newer generations it was a good move to make a film.

I was born too late to see them playing live together, but I left the cinema crying with joy, feeling as if I attended their performance in Live Aid before my time. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and I hope they win all the Oscars they can :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Music and many lives were never the same after Bohemian Freddie,"There's one you, another how you see/want to be yourself and the third is how others see you.
Bohemian Rhapsody is trying, like some of us, to bring closer those 3 different Mercury-s. And they do a helluva job!
The story is, as much as the outsider fans knew, pretty accurate. I was even (gladly) surprised to see so much gay stuff in a PG13! The debauchery of emotions and artistry which was Freddie's trademark is dealt with great elegance. The balance between ""this is a film about a Bohemian musical (his)tory, about Freddie and about Queen"" is very touching.
The acting is brilliant, if Mr Malek doesn't get an Oscar or Globe for it, I don't know who else would!
Filming, direction, camera, editing, all that in spades! Of course, the sound is Queen perfect

Doesn't do Freddie Mercury or Queen justice,"I'm a huge fan of Queen's music so Bohemian Rhapsody was a must watch for me. Sadly, I feel this film didn't do the band or Freddie Mercury justice.Bohemian Rhapsody follows Freddie Mercury from the formation of Queen to the Live Aid concert in 1985.Bohemian Rhapsody disappointed me for several reasons. One of the major issues was the atrocious editing. The film cuts to so many different shots and angles in the space of a few seconds. I understand the point was to make the pacing seem faster but doing it this way made it come across as distracting and amateurish. I will never understand how and why this film got an Oscar for Best Editing. For a biopic, this film came across as very superficial in my eyes. The PG-13 rating is something that didn't sit well with me. Freddie Mercury is someone that did a lot of adult stuff in his life so a PG-13 rating would not be suitable at all. It uses clichés we've seen and takes a very safe approach to Mercury's life by glossing over many controversial aspects of his life which doesn't make the film seem genuine at all. The entire story feels surface level and only relies on people's love for the band and its music without providing deeper substance.The best part of Bohemian Rhapsody were the performances. Rami Malek delivered an absolutely phenomenal performance as Freddie Mercury. He absolutely nailed it especially during the concert scenes where he seemed like Freddie Mercury reincarnated. I'm amazed by his work here and I'm happy he received an Oscar for it. Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joe Mazzello did a good job portraying Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon. Lucy Boynton and Mike Myers were also great in their roles.As a whole, Bohemian Rhapsody was very disappointing. What saves this film is Rami Malek, Queen's music and the recreation of the Live Aid concert. Without any of these, this film would be nothing special.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The King lives on,"This was one of the best, emotional, thrilling bio movies that has been made of this lifetime. The reason why I say this, is that this movie is not just based on one-person Freddie Mercury, but this movie is about Queen, meaning all four members, how they came together, showed their talents and how each contributed to their group success. While I was watching this film, it felt like a rollercoaster as I was full of emotions from the start of the movie to the end of the movie.This film focuses on the group Queen and not just about the main star of the movie. So, you get to see how good Brian May is when he writes some of the songs and John Deacon and Roger Taylor. I went to watch this film again for the second time as it was a dream come true for me. I have been waiting for years for a Queen movie to come out and this movie was top. This film focused on how the group came together and showed some of the best moments of their life and some of the sad, bad moments of Freddie life.The film did not focus that much on the drama that was in Freddie life but it focused more on Queen. Watching this film made me thinking about how much I love Queen songs and I have once again started to listen to their songs and watching their tours again. The beginning of the film really sets the tone of the ending of the movie. Rami Malek who actors in Mr. Robot does a brilliant job of bring Freddie Mercury alive and throughout the film I really was thinking, wait is that really Freddie Mercury.Personal, I don't understand why some people give this film a bad rating or review, this film was the best tribute to Queen the music group and Freddie Mercury. This film once again did not focus too much on the bad things in his life but only the important things that happened in his life. You also get to see the experience of how they came together and how each of them came up with some of their and our most favourite big hit songs such as Bohemian Rhapsody, we will rock you, another one bites the dust, love of my life and we are the champions.You also get to see the birth of one of the greatest performers of all time in music history who to me is up there with Michael Jackson.So, to my fellow music fans, movie fans, queen fans, rock fans, please do not listen to the movie reviewers as I do not understand the little criticism of this movie.We need to now see a Beatles, Michael Jackson movie, like this movie which focus more on the music artist instead of focusing on the bad parts of their life.This movie is about Queen, all four members not just about Freddie Mercury and how he lived his life. Go and watch this movie. 10/10 rating. 5/5 starts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

There is not a single boring moment in this movie!!! Every scene, every shot, every bit of dialogue has been executed magnificently. I'm not sure about the accuracy of the biopic and I don't care. Some complained about the lack of Mercury's sexuality being discussed. Not everything has to be about LGBT just because the man was a gay icon. He was more than his personal life and I think that was also a side point of the film being made the way it was. This serves as a medley and snapshot into Freddie's progress into stardom and what Queen became from hardly anything. Best movie of 2018, it maintains a special place in my heart so much that I went twice to the cinema to watch it and it still didn't feel like enough viewings.

Pg 13 version.Flat and safe.,"It was nice. It was touching. It had a great actor. But it was flat and safe.
It was a portrait of saints. The band had no real conflicts, only Freddie had problems.
The story has many lies also. The conflicts we see is Freddie's ego against hamble and cool band members who the only do the right thing.
They didn't party, they didn't drink, they didn't do drugs. Lol.
Also Freedie was a struggling homosexual, but he had a wild life. His lifestyle was crazy. Malik does the best he can do with the pg13, safe and family oriented material to create a more in depth character and in a way succeeds.
But other than his performance and the great music their is nothing else to remember.

Goosebumps and tears.,"While this is a simple straight forward story, it is the performances,sheer energy and music which assault the senses. The casting is quite unbelievable. Everyone is great. The movie portrays the debauched lifestyle of Mercury without being sordid and shows his loneliness and torment which ultimately proved so devastating. Having been lucky enough to have been at Queens last live performance at Knebworth Castle, the finale gave me both goose bumps and a tear. A fitting tribute to a brilliant band and the greatest front man ever. Go and see it. The Mike Myers joke was genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
As a fan of Queen i enjoyed this.,"Bohemian Rhapsody tells the history of how the British rock band Queen was created and it also tells the life of Freddie Mercury played by Rami Malek. I listened to Queen and I thought they were good, but I wasn't a fan. And then I watched Wayne's World and they played Bohemian Rhapsody and I remember listening to them and I have been a fan ever since. Funny enough Mike Myers was in Wayne's World and he's in Bohemian Rhapsody as well. That's just a little trivia of the day. And let's be honest who hasn't head banged to that drum solo, I know I have. Rami Malek nails it as Freddie Mercury that for the whole movie I thought that was Freddie Mercury and not Rami Malek. If the movie were bad, I still would've walked out of the theatre admitting that Rami Malek carried the film from start to finish. Even if you like Queen, or your not a fan of Queen, its really interesting these four random people with nothing in common got together and decided to form one of the most iconic rock n' roll bands today. But Bohemian Rhapsody does get confusing, but not awkward. The movie focuses on Freddie Mercury's life and the title is one of their songs so it gets confusing on which side should this focus on that I was left in the middle. One part of me is glad that they choose to focus on Freddie Mercury's life as we get to find out more about him, and the other one wants that part to focus on their songs that they didn't cover. And as much as I love Queen, there are way too many songs by them that are crammed in this two and half hour movie. I'm not talking about the songs that they come up with, but the whole soundtrack is their song and that's it. No other bands like Credence Clearwater Revival, Led Zeppelin, The Who, just Queen where I asked myself I know that this is supposed to be about the history of Queen, but do we really all their songs in this? The balancing could've been done better, but with what everyone did they have given us a biographical film about Freddie Mercury, while at the same time not going into too much detail about his life and also saving room for the history of Queen as well. So overall, this is a fun movie to watch if your fan of Queen like myself, but its still worth the watch even if you don't like Queen. And also say what you will about the movie, you have to give credit to Rami Malek, because he absolutely destroys it as Freddie Mercury.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
VERY CLOSE TO MY OWN QUEEN EXPERIENCES,"Yes I know, I have been a Queen fan size 1974 and I am very glad that I was able to see them perform in 5 Dutch concerts between 1976 and 1983 so giving it 10 stars was easy. But this movie is so close to the own experiences which I had. I recall the first time the video clip of Bohemian Rhapsody was broadcasted. I was the discussion at high school on Monday morning. "" Did you see and hear that song Bohemiam Rhapsody"" and it is by far one of the best songs written. Tonight we went with to see the movie with our 4 kids and we enjoyed it to the max.

Don't listen to the critics,"A great example of why you shouldn't rely on critics. Had I listened to them, I would've missed out on one of my new favourite movies.

Technically, it might have some flaws, but I can wholeheartedly say I fully enjoyed the movie from the very beginning to the end. And that's quite a compliment for a movie this long!
The acting is stunning and the casting is impressively done. Rami Malek is one of the best actors out there, in my opinion, and did Freddie Mercury justice. He did an excellent job at embodying the legend, and he's deserving of winning the Oscar that he is nominated for. There were plenty of moments during the film that I was in awe of him. All of the actors were great!What they wanted to do with this movie was to honour Freddie and Queen, not making a full-on documentary about Freddie's life, as the critics ""complained"" about. I'm actually glad they didn't go down a dark path and instead focus on the highlights. But I'm also confused by how some critics think they shied away from the darker aspects of Mercury's life? I didn't feel like they did that at all. In fact, I think they handled it appropriately.I'm happy with the soundtrack as well. I honestly wouldn't mind if it had been three hours long. Plus, the recreation of Live Aid is spot-on.All in all, wonderful movie that made me happy and emotional, and gave me a bigger love for Queen.

Wikipedia-entry storytelling,"Bohemian Rhapsody started out life way back in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen set to star as Queen's hypnotic frontman Freddie Mercury. With band members Brian May and Roger Taylor heavily involved in the development, Baron Cohen eventually left, citing creative differences with the way they wished to approach the story as the main reason for his departure. The years went by, and in 2017, the wheels were well and truly in motion with Bryan Singer in the director's chair and Rami Malek in the lead role. The production was famously dogged with problems, and when Singer was eventually fired for unprofessional behaviour (reports say he was frequently disruptive on set, even failing to turn up for three days straight), it felt like the film would never see the light of day. But Dexter Fletcher filled the vacant director's chair and Bohemian Rhapsody was released to huge box-office numbers, and recently received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Actor, amongst others.Remarkably, despite the film's difficult production, there's no sign of patchwork or a clash of directorial styles. Bohemian Rhapsody actually has much greater problems, and while anybody looking for an easily-digestible Queen sing-a-long with find much to love here, anybody hoping for a deeper re-telling of one of the music's most enigmatic figures with likely be baffled at the film's eagerness to share the credit and Wikipedia-entry approach to story-telling. We briefly get to see Mercury before he took to the stage, working as a baggage-handler at Heathrow while his parents worry about his lack of academic ambition. His experience as a young immigrant is summarised by a single racial slur, and the film isn't too concerned with exploring this any further. Perhaps screenwriter Anthony McCarten (who wrote last year's similarly formulaic Oscar-baiter Darkest Hour) felt like this would be too much of a drag for the audience, so he quickly moves to Mercury introducing himself to Smile guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee) and drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), coincidentally mere seconds after the band loses its lead singer.A few montages later and the band now known as Queen (bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) completes the group) are signed up by manager John Reid (Aidan Gillen) and land a contract with EMI Records. The characters act and talk like they already know how the story turns out, and the film only manages to scratch beneath the surface when dealing with Mercury's relationship with love-of-his-life Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) and her gradual realisation of his sexuality. The rest consists of band squabbles that always seem to conclude with the writing of a hit song, rock movie cliches like the alcohol-fuelled parties and accelerating ego, and cartoon supporting characters (Mike Myers' meta appearance as EMI executive Ray Foster spectacularly misses the mark). By aiming for 12A/PG-13 certificate, Mercury's story is oddly sexless. For a man that radiated sex and sexiness with every air-punch and pout, the lack of raunchiness adds an unwelcome TV-movie quality. It only really comes alive when Malik is allowed to do his thing on stage, climaxing with an extended Live Aid performance that will have you singing along and waving your arms. It's a great impression by Malik, if hardly a great performance, and it helps reminds us of how great Queen really were and how timeless their sound is. Bohemian Rhapsody has certainly made me a bigger Queen fan, but this isn't the biopic the band deserve. That being said, I haven't come across a single person that agrees with me, so what do I know",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Entertaining yet shallow,"This is a fairly simple rags to riches, coming of age, Freddie Mercury tribute piece.Or a musical biopic if you like.It lacks a solid character arc and perhaps without Malek's stellar though at times over-the-top performance this story would have been immediately forgotten.Without a brave dive into the real FM, this feels like a well worn and trite trope about the boy who comes to be loved and adored, yet lacks the self assurance, self confidence to navigate through a world of extreme vanity, indulgence and fair weather friends.The story of the relationship with the band is also formulaic though perhaps ultimately true.The plot and sub plots feel rushed, the timing is off and the supporting cast under-utilised.Was that Mike Myers?I cannot help but draw comparisons with Rocketman - which, to avoid the usual clichés came up with an clever allegory using costumes to tell the story of Elton John's tumultuous inner journey to find true meaning in a vacuous world.Whilst not a serious drama, it feels at times an opportunity was fumbled to explore the real issues, instead quickly skimming over the surface of the AIDS epidemic, racism, drug abuse, fame, sexuality, love, relationships and betrayal.Singer certainly does a good job of showcasing what made Queen slightly different from the hordes of other pop rock bands who came of age in the 70's and 80's, and the cinematic performances are truly epic.Ultimately a popcorn musical.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A search for identity told through a bohemian rhapsody,"One of the biggest blockbusters of the awards season, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' had all the elements needed for the perfect storm of attention - lots of controversy, both on and off screen, an iconic band with a killer soundtrack, and a frontman who is nothing if not interesting.When you put all of this together, 'Rhapsody' becomes a story that is one of tragedy, overcoming adversity and personal identity. Without a doubt, it is Rami Malek who is the standout, as his portrayal of the conflicted Freddie Mercury leaves very few stones left unturned. The fact that Malek earned an Oscar for this role tells you pretty much all you need to know - he's the star of the show, and he won't let anyone forget it.To be sure, there are plenty of openings for audiences to criticize 'Rhapsody.' Perhaps Mercury's story was sanitized more so than it should have been. Maybe it was how Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton) was portrayed. Maybe the friction between Mercury and the rest of Queen was downplayed. Whatever may be the truth, it shouldn't take away from the fact that the film is entertaining. Just take the Live Aid concert scene - that in and of itself is worth the watch.It won't be remembered as the greatest music-focused film of all time, but 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is a pioneer in this genre and may in fact be responsible for a new wave of similar films that will be hitting theaters over the coming years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Glossy and Colorful but Emotionally Shallow,"Freddie Mercury and Queen finally get their big screen moment, after years in development hell, and the end result is more than a little overcooked. If there were a blueprint for making a safe rock biography, this would trust it like a Bible. It's so superficial and emotionally bland, I felt like I was watching a troupe of actors recite from the group's Wikipedia entry, with a few last-minute ninja edits tossed in to twist reality.Everything looks polished and, of course, the soundtrack is spectacular, but it's tough to get excited about passive storytelling and a supporting cast that's, frankly, quite boring. I kept wondering if Brian May and Roger Taylor, the two original band members participating in the production, were too involved in how it played out. It's Mercury's story, of course, but the rest of the group is handled with such kid gloves that it's almost laughable. The worst thing said about Taylor is that he wrote a silly song about his car for the first album. Not that I'm looking for gossip, really; the whole thing is just so vanilla that a little grime and conflict would've gone a long way. Even when they're at-odds for a brief stretch near the climax, nobody's feathers seem terribly ruffled.Glossy and colorful but emotionally shallow, Bohemian Rhapsody goes to great lengths to achieve mannequin-like visual authenticity, but pulls every gut punch.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

''. His influence has been so great that they came to be portrayed in a complete movie, and he has done it in an excellent way.A biographical film, exciting and full of excellent sounds, carried out under a good direction and above all, incredible performances that give life to each of the members; it is not necessary to emphasize the incredible thing that is Rami for Mercury, an act totally in point, from its ways of behaving, compustura, tone until the expressions and the movement, is to see Mercury with life in the big screen, an experience difficult to forget for so emotional it is.

Fantastic!,"So here's the deal... I heard about this movie being made over a year ago with Sacha Baron Cohen as Freddie Mercury. It was going to be R-Rated and focus on Freddie's sordid personal life.

A glimpse of what my generation missed,"I've never taken an interest in Queen, it's not my kind of music, not my era, and not my culture. It's a testament then to this movie that all that didn't stop me from feeling moved by this awesome and tragic story. Some of the moments in this really hurt to watch, like seeing first hand the pain Freddie put himself and Mary through and how he was enabled by those around him. But now knowing the story they had to work with I can't help but feel the writing and directing on this fell very short of the mark. For example, I'd have liked to have come away with some kind of clue as to what was happening in Freddie's life before he joined Queen, but that was very lacking.The cinematography really didn't suit the grand setting, so modern and cheap like a TV show. The acting felt really poor, the characters really felt fake, like being in drama class at school again.

Sharp Ending,"I don't admire all of the movie but bohemian rhapsody is a good movie to watch, Rami Malek is awesome as Freddie Mercury and raised level of the movie at the ending scene!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Condescending, inaccurate, manipulative pap","Sasha Baron Cohen said he left this project when he learned surviving members of the band wanted the filmto avoid Freddie's illness and eventual passing away. Here's it's like they tacked it on in reshoots as an afterthought.I remember Live Aid and I remember Freddie's passing SIX YEARS LATER, but the film ends after Live Aid and implies Freddie's life ends soon after. Aside from some coughs, a doctor's office, and a tuberculosis moment where he coughs up blood onto a hanky, there's hardly an indication Mercury struggled at all in this film. You'd think for a film that shines in its music sequences, they'd at least cover his last six years for the sake of some of that music, even if they're clearly disinterested or just intimidated by the prospect of writing biopic drama with enormous potential.Rami Malek is mostly great in the role, however. He clearly looks and sounds awkward at different points, not as a character, but in the actor's performance. The mannerisms and line delivery come off as cartoonishly effeminate yet stiff at times, and this alternates with an assured defiance and stage presence that excels beyond mimicry. Uneven, but a highly commendable performance that pulls most of the movie's weight. The ""songwriting"" scenes, especially Brian May rallying the rest of the band to imagine stomping a beat that will make audiences feel like part of ""We Will Rock You"" have a McDonald's commercial artifice and do nothing to make the band look like they faced any sort of challenge. Closed captioning should just say, ""Enough negativity! Our music shall be a force for GOOD!""In the end, it's really paid promotion for the band. Some attention to making their Flash Gordon and Highander soundtracks would have been nice. Do yourself a favour and buy their music instead of this sanitized, emotionally manipulative and falsified account.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

The movie for every Queen fan,"Queen is the kind of band I could listen too for hours without getting tired of it. One of the most famous and greatest rock bands in history, with a legacy larger than life. The question is, how well can a movie really preserve and retell a story as grand as this? Turns out it can do it just fine.From listening to reviews, they seem to be split into to parts: Hating it, or loving it. But I have fallen in between that space. The hatred and bad critisim against it I find hard to understand, as it really isn't all that bad, but neither can I comprehend why people have such love for this film. Rather, I beilieve, do they have an uncondicional love for Freddie and Queen, submitting them into loving it.The first 15 or 20 minutes of this movie I found quite annoying and unnecessary. Yes, it shows the backstory of how queen was formed, but that's about it. It is a series of montages that puts queen on the world map, showing the members touring and signing contracts. But it could've just as easily been cut out of the movie, given that it provides little to none information. The montages continues further in the movie, and I am not a fan of them. I personally think montages are just a way when the writers are lazy and tries to put in as much information as possible. Neither do I think they were especially well made for this film.Moreover, other problems I have with this film is it's editing, and I don't really understand the reason it won an Oscar for this. The editing at times feels interrupting and clumsy, and some scenes feel almost irrelevant and some cuts are more disrupting than purposful. Furthermore, this movie felt more as a movie about Freddy Mercury than one about Queen. Sure, he is the big star, but he keeps talking about the importance of the group, not excluding anyone. The other bandmembers feel unattended and forgotten. Their backstories fall out of the picture, as well as their respective traits making them feel like very bland and flat characters. I have nothing against Freddy, I just wished more attention had been paid to the other bandmembers, because they felt left out and almost not even necessary to the plot.Nevertheless, lets not forget what this movie excells in, exactly what it should excel in, providing an entertaining experience for watchers as close to the feeling of attending an acutal Queen concert. Of course nothing will eveer compare to the real thing, but it was nice to see her Majesty back up on the stage again. And lets not forget the best thing which is Rami Malek's performance. He has done great research and captured the spirit of Freddy spot on.While the story feels unprocessed, and the editing is somewhat off, it still manages to deliver a sometimes funny sometimes heartbraking event. But that is due to the good performances rather than good scriptwriting, and the emotional connection might just be because it is Queen, and not any other band we're watching. It is also their music that make this movie survive. Had it been another band, I'm not sure anyone would have been bothered to sit out the whole screening.The songs of Queen as well as Rami's performance makes you forget about the mistakes, which is why this movie is enjoyable. This movie is not bad, but neither is it amazing. I wanted more from it.When it comes together, this movie is entertaining, but mostly due to Malek's outstanding performance, and to the brilliant music Queen had already made. The film in itself, is okay at the best, needing some extra work. As to the question if it captures the story of queen: It does it well enough.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Doesn't compare to others,"Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 movie about Queen sharing the name with their most popular song. I do not like the movie as I feel it was wasted potential. It did the bare minimum and won awards. Brian May was reported to have fired the original director of the film as they wanted to make an accurate movie about the life, good and bad of Queen's frontman Freddie Mercury. He instead opted for a pg13 rating instead of the original R to get a wider audience and more money. While this makes sense under some circumstances Queen is not a pg13 band and Freddie did not live a pg13 life. The audience the movie was catering to (Queen fans) knew this and expected to see at least in some part some of the crazy stories about the band. It terms of how the the movie treats the band Netflix's The Dirt, about Motlëy Crüe is betterIt seems like the people who like this movie the best are casual Queen fans and casual movie fans, but I am neither. As a movie it is not great it had terrible editing, weird pacing, no standout visuals, and little to no care about the band themselves. The bad editing is shown during the infamous lunch scene where they meet There new manager, John Reed. The pacing is bad because it crams in all this tension among the band then brings them back together for the finale like a kids story. In terms of how the movie is made 2019's Rocketman is better. Rocketman is an amazing movie and it is not afraid to show the dark side of the protagonist.

Worth to take a risk,"This is my first time I writing a comment. I watch this movie first show on a local cinema. The acting of Rami Malek is marvelous. I am big fan of Queen. I like to write here what really happened to me for watching this movie. Few weeks before its release I am disappointed that no cinema in Pakistan show's Bohemian Rhapsody. Few days before I come across a facebook page a cinema near my shop (where I running my own business) showing Bohemian Rhapsody on Friday. I so happy after see this news finally watch this movie on the cinema. A day before I discuses with my friend on the phone that tomorrow I am going to watch this movie he said to me that there is strike going in the country so you are not able to see this movie tomorrow. So I told him that whatever happened I am going to watch this movie. The next day (Friday) I check my cinema facebook page again they cancel the two earlier shows of other movie due to law and order situation. but Bohemian Rhapsody show which is on 5.00 pm is not canceled . So I went to the cinema bought the ticket sit's in the hall . I surprise after few minutes I check my right , left, front and behind only me in hall and entire hall is empty. Movie starts right on time after half 'n hour I again check the hall I am surprise nobody there entire hall is empty. It's strange for me that I am only one person watching this movie and it is the first show of the movie. So really enjoy this movie. I give full credit to the management of the cinema allow me to watch entire movie. After the movie end I went back to my shop I am on the road suddenly my cousin phone me and say's where are you? I told him I am going back to open my shop after watching the movie he surprise and said that do you know what happened ? I told him no I watching the movie. He told me a religious leader is murder and there law and order situation in city (Rawalpindi Punjab) don't open the shop go home immediately it is risky to be on the road . So I take a cab went to my home. Reaching the home I realized that I take a huge risk to watch this anything can happened to me. In our country in these kind of situation anything could happened.

Rami Malek playing the main character of Freddie undoubtedly does a good job of it but I personally feel as if this very complex character ends up being 2-dimensional at most; the screenwriters may be more to blame here for this: there was struggle but no unpredictable or even remotely interesting obstacle. The emotions expressed fall flat in the context of the story, and since the story is so well known from the get-go, I feel as if there could've been a deeper dive into the mind of the character we are made to watch grow on-screen.
The movie itself seems to pride itself on playing Queen songs and joking about the band being too experimental, and maybe the filmmakers should be doing exactly that, but it just ends up feeling cheap and pandering.It has me split; I want to like it but however much I try I keep thinking of ways it could've been done better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Simply moving.,"Having grown up with Queen's music, loving it, being transported by it, and later learning of Freddie's passing almost as an aside, it was wonderful to see this biopic of his development from Farrokh Bulsara to Freddie Mercury and the humanity behind the image, the fragility, the search for love and family.
My wife and I were both brought to tears many times.

Disappointing and often boring film about Freddie Mercury.,"Queen is a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm more of a Beatles/Rolling Stones/Doors/Led Zeppelin type but Queen is one of the most entertaining groups to come down the pike. They employed many genres in their music such as glam, disco, opera, gospel, rockabilly and straight-ahead rock and were led by the often imitated, never duplicated Freddie Mercury. I was very interested in seeing Bohemian Rhapsody and, well, it was a disappointment.I don't know why the producers chose to create a sanitized film about the life of Freddie. Many of us know that Freddie was a very private man who didn't grant many interviews and disliked the press infringing on his matters. Outside of his music and concerts. we know very little about him. So, they chose to use creative license to make up stuff, rearrange history and distort his life. As expected from a PG-13 film we get uninspiring dialogue, Freddie's homosexuality being trivialized (and made to be seen as harmful) and Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon relegated to being meaningless fringe characters.Much of the movie, when not re-enacting concerts or recordings, is focused on Freddie's personal and emotional battle between his heterosexual love for Mary Austin and his homosexual love for Paul Prenter, who is ridiculously portrayed as a villain. His relationship with his real-life boyfriend Jim Hutton is barely acknowledged. Utter claptrap that wasn't needed and slows down the film to a crawl.To be fair, the concert footage (especially Live-Aid) is superb and Rami Malek delivers a masterful performance as Mercury. He deserves a Golden Globe or Academy Award nomination as it's nothing short of brilliant. 5 of my stars go to him.If you're a fan of Queen, yes, you should go to the theater and see this movie just for Malek's unreal performance as Freddie but don't expect much more out of the film. It's a wasted opportunity to learn about one of the greatest showmen in rock music history.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Ending save the whole movie, or, Queen's song save it.","Story been told in a weird way? Or I should say that ""what a mess""? Actors give their best performance in this movie wit no doubt.

After all, the whole movie is rescued by Queen's songs. 7 scores all for Queen, this legendary band and their legend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"""I can't stand the in-between parts""","""I can't stand the in-between parts"" (paraphrased quote) is at one point said by Freddie Mercury during this film while talking about the parts of his life between performances, which on a meta-level, was also my biggest problem with the movie. Although Bohemian Rhapsody is a well-acted movie with some amazingly staged performance sequences, the story that fills the remainder of the movie could be told better. Ironically, despite having notable director issues (Bryan Singer leaving the project a few weeks before shooting ended), I thought the directing was far from the biggest issue, and rather that the script was what brought the movie down. Anthony McCarten's screenplay seems to have flipped the age old saying ""show don't tell,"" with much of the character development and important moments being described to the audience rather than shown. Considering that the general story hits quite a few familiar beats to other band/musician biopics, this lack of visual storytelling is a major detriment to the overall film. My other big issue with the story is that this movie seems like an odd mash-up of two movies. One, a dramatic and personal story about Freddie Mercury. The other an entertaining popcorn movie about how Queen came together and became what they are remembered for. In my opinion they should have chosen one of these avenues and explored it fully rather than trying to do both, as neither story arc gets the development it needs, and the final product is oddly disjointed. Despite these script issues, Bohemian Rhapsody does have some spectacular elements. Obviously the big one is Rami Malek's career-changing performance as Freddie Mercury. He not only nails the mannerisms and personality of Mercury, but also does a wonderful job at conveying the tortured soul hidden underneath the legendary performer. All of the praise that Malek has received is absolutely earned, as is his tentative Oscar nomination. Besides Malek at the center, the supporting cast does a great job as well, delivering either a dramatic performance (Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton in particular), or providing some needed levity and comic-relief. However, Bohemian Rhapsody isn't just well acted, from a technical-standpoint it also very well made, especially the concert scenes. The sound-mixing and camera work during the Live Aid scene is truly next level, and sets a new bar for showcasing musical performances in film. To sum up, Bohemian Rhapsody has all of the elements to be a great movie but just isn't able to balance the style and substance well enough for my taste. That being said, I think many people will thoroughly enjoy it, and any fan of Queen should see it for Malek's performance alone.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

What are the stakes?,"Don't get me wrong, the music is excellent. The actors do a magnificent job, but it is never quite clear what the stakes are, why this movie needed to be made?It really seems to me like they glossed over most of the really bad stuff, and instead of getting into the nitty gritty in the interpersonal relationships within the band and the people surrounding it. It just feels like business as usual, no challenge is appearing as one. and every time the very clunky dialogue comes to a halt, its either a montage or a cut-away to music.I can't help but feel like a real biopic, with no band-members listed as producers would just have had more edge, would have explored the person Freddie Mercury was, and what he became, and in the process found a place for itself.This movie just does not have that, the actors do their best, but the script and story just isn't there, every conflict is solved quickly or off screen, and then its business as usual.It just feels like the musical back-catalogue of Queen becomes a crutch for pushing the movie forward, the non-Freddie bandmembers just appear flat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
standard celebrity biopic,"Bohemian Rhapsody follows the well-worn groove of celebrity bio-pics, as a brilliant artist pushes his vision into the world while dealing with personal travails before ultimately doing a triumphant celebratory something (the other path, not taken, is similar but with a downbeat ending).Rami Malek makes a persuasive rock star; theatrical, intense, egotistical, driven, his oversized personality masking the lonely, unconfident inner man.But Malek's Freddie Mercury is also pretty annoying, self-centered and arrogant, and ultimately he struck me as someone I wouldn't want to meet. And while at first I found the movie generally entertaining, fueled by Queen's music and Mercury's drive, my attention began to flag as the film became increasingly soap operish, and the final recreation of the 20-minute LiveAid concert was something only a concert-movie fan (I am not one) could love.For me the movie was most notable for the trivia I learned along the way. We Will Rock you was conceived as an audience participation song. Zoroastrianism is still practiced. The filmmakers have no idea when Fat Bottomed Girls came out (judging by where the put it in the movie).Admittedly I am in the minority on IMDB, where almost everyone is raving about this film. And while I was increasingly bored, at the end I looked over at my girlfriend and she was weeping, which I wouldn't have even guessed as a possible reaction to the film. So I guess if you like music-heavy, somewhat fictionalized, thoroughly manipulative biopics, you might love this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

So much better than expected - one of my favourite all-time films now,"I saw the film, not knowing any critic or public reviews. I expected a good film - but what I got was a fantastic experience, that few films of any genre deliver these days.I am not even a Queen fan - I am 51 at time of writing so grew up knowing and liking many of their hits since I was a kid in the 70s. I have bought only a few of their greatest hits albums over the years. However, I always understood what fans saw in the band, appreciated the many catchy hits, and felt Freddie Mercury one of the best showman and singers of 'our' time.Now, I know the Queen Live Aid performance pretty well; have seen it many times and could never get over how in such a short time any band can command a crowd's attention so superbly and emotionally (and a crowd that is not even a Queen fanbase, at that). What the film did with this performance was absolutely astonishing, from the obvious stage coverage of the band, which was brilliantly done (right down the the Pepsi and beer on the piano, and Freddie playing with the camera man) to the swoops over the stadium, the whole stage layout, and the crowd close-ups singing along. This whole segment was pristine film-making.The film, at the beginning, gives a teaser of the Live Aid performance, and then hops back to the start of the band's formation and Freddie's story as the main thread. Everything feels well-paced; we get glimpses of various songs in the making, the recording, the concerts, the band arguments and of course the many surrounding characters that make up the story - the managers, girlfriends, record execs, hangers-on and so on. All are well played and I felt there is a good balance between the personal, the music and the show-biz elements of the story. I could have done with a bit more focus on more songs and studio time, but accept they can only pack in so much. Now, evidently things are not portrayed 100% as they really happened; perhaps he didn't sing in the car park; perhaps they didn't split up and reunite exactly in the way depicted - but does that really matter? There will be plenty of documentaries that fill that gap just fine. This is entertainment first and foremost.The casting was spot on in every respect except perhaps Bob Geldof (I felt they could have done a bit better with him, but he is a very particular type, so must have been tricky). All the band are excellently played - and without a doubt Rami as Freddie is a performance that you don't often see. He nails it in so many ways - and there are many facets to nail, it is hard to imagine any actor getting all of it right - the gestures, the voice, the looks, the concert showman-ship, the overall personality. I hope he gets what he deserves for all that hard work, and I'm sure we will see a lot more of him in future (quite how he will top this I don't know though).There is no doubt I will be getting some kind of DVD with Bonus Materials when it is available (hope they do a good 'making of'), and enjoying this film many times in future. As for now, I have added 'A Night at the Opera' on vinyl to my Christmas list for Santa.

Touched my heart,"The critics got it all wrong with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" when the song came out, and this time, the critics got it wrong again with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" the movie. Make no mistake, this is a movie made for everyone to enjoy and appreciate, just like how Queen ensured their music touched the nerves of their audience.The tone was set at the movie's very first frame, when a rock guitar version of the 20th Century Fox fanfare came on, aptly tying the subject to the presentation. The last great movie which tied the movie to the fanfare was ""Argo"", and look what happened to that movie. A good omen, I hope.This movie touched my heart more than any other that I've seen. The music was mesmerizing, and was adroitly and intricately woven into each sequence, each act and carried each arc of the movie, right up to its climatic conclusion : the band's epic Live Aid performance. It will give you goosebumps, I assure you.
And make you cry, which I did.Credit must be given to the entire production team for making this movie so believable. The cast were so good that after a while, you forget you were watching actors but rather felt like you were the fly-on-wall seeing these events happen right in front of you. I must also congratulate lead actor Rami Malek for taking in every essence of Freddie Mercury, and replicating it on the big screen with total perfection. He was not Rami, he was Freddie. Thank goodness Sacha Baron Cohen was not cast here, and Freddie Mercury would have turned out very differently, given what we know about Cohen's acting credibility (or lack of).Finally, it'll be good for viewers to accept some creative licence undertaken by the filmakers.

Bohemian Rhapsody - Cinema with CJ Review,"Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) has a sequence where the titular song is released to their original, critical reviews. Queen's song was later seen as a masterpiece, but in its initial release was only deemed ""Perfectly adequate"" by some. The latter, and probably not the former, describes the film of the same name.
Bryan Singer (or Dexter Fletcher) has created a perfectly adequate musical biopic here that doesn't do much revolutionary, but at least doesn't rob you of any time.
That is carried very much so by Rami Malek and co-stars disappearing into their roles as Freddie Mercury et al as Queen. Malek truly steals the show as the band's frontman, bringing the energy and life and mannerisms of the iconic Mercury. If there's one solid good to take from this film, it's that Malek's performance is a perfect capture.
Bohemian Rhapsody is bolstered by the fact that Queen (I would say objectively, but let's say in my opinion) have so many brilliant songs and of course that means this film gets to flaunt them all. Each song is a performance of all elements coming together and you get Queen's greatest hits translated onto the big screen. If you're gonna watch this movie at the cinema please at least splash out on the IMAX for the big screen, big sound experience.
If Bohemian Rhapsody was just a concert movie starring Queen or even just these facsimiles of Queen, it would be perfect, but the execution of this narrative biopic brings the film down a notch or two. There's always a curious case of poetic license with biopics, First Man recently has a bit of this, but Bohemian Rhapsody creates many an eyebrow raise.I am by no means a Queen aficionado but I'm sure I'm not the only one doubting just how fortuitous and neat the story of Queen and Freddie Mercury is. The film saunters for the majority of it with next to no conflict and brushing past themes and issues and moments that could have done with more fleshing out. Events go by and you wonder just a little too much on whether they actually happened. Usually you don't need to bust out the fact checking like a Neil deGrasse Tyson of film, but this is a biopic with such glaring leaps of logic and license you can't switch that off.
There's just something off about cartoonishly evil characters or how people just stumble upon the music they're iconic for. The creation of the titular song felt like it was a through-line of the story until it suddenly wasn't, and that thread was full of ""this is a bit too on the nose"".
Bohemian Rhapsody has as much subtlety as Mercury's character. Very fun, well performed, nostalgic, and goddamn, that last sequence would be an all-timer if it wasn't just a shot for shot recreation with iffy special effects enhancement.
Inconsistent style over substance, it brushes past and messily tackles themes such as Mercury's sexuality and later years all for another hit Queen track.
It feels like one for fact-checking, but it also feels like Bohemian Rhapsody will forever remain Perfectly Adequate. And that's only down to the music of one great band, and one great group of actors translating that to screen.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Loved Queen, Hated This Amateurish Ham Handed Movie.","Whether you like Queen or not, this is one terrible film. It is so bad in so many ways. The actor who plays Freddy, has two things right. Freddy's posh accent and his teeth. Maybe Freddy was not very bright, but he was as charming as he was talented and he was a gymnast on stage. I have enjoyed Malek's work in other movies but his characterisation of Mercury makes him look like a cross eyed vampire ( the teeth thing). On the concert stage Rami just looks awful. Mainy times in this film you are actually embarrassed for his Freddy. In fact some may find Rami Malek's portrayal insulting to Freddy's memory.So, you might think never mind, just go for the music, and that never really happens. We only get silly, little carelessly selected snippets of the music of Queen. You rarely get to sit back and enjoy the band.The writing is just putrid bad. Long periods of clumsy sentimental nothingness, and then a little bit about the band.Save yourself the time and money.

For someone who isn't/wasn't a fan, it is the ultimate conversion method and reminds me of what a truly wonderful and one-off performer Freddie Mercury was.It is sublime in the creation of atmosphere, excels in driving you to the crescendo of emotional distress that you'll see so many cinema go-ers experiencing and wonderfully written and acted.You'll laugh, you'll cry (or want to), you'll want to tap-along to the music and sigh at the homophobia of the 70's and 80's and the sheer bad-luck that struck Mercury in respect of the era in which he contracted HIV and what a different future he'd have had if the treatments of today had been available - all of these are factors in making it a compelling tribute and distressing reminder.The Live Aid finale is one of the best recreations of a moment in history I've ever seen, especially knowing just how accurate it is. It felt just like being back there in July 1985.Ignore the critics. Go watch it. You'll not regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Queen without majesty,"Unlike the legendary band, a movie wich no one will remember over the years.
Not a bad movie, it was indeed a good experience (Queen's songs can certainly improve the quality of almost everything).
At any part of the movie i felt connected with the events, seems like it lacks emotion and conviction, and all major plots are solved too fast (A plot can be solved in seconds and yet be believable, but is not the case).
Brian, Deacon and Roger really convinces on screen, Mary was great, but Freddie not, althought Malek doing a good job (the script and direction really can trap some actings).

I clearly missed something...,"I saw this film much later than I should have, I guess. True to form, when a movie gets too much hype and praise early on, I tend to set my expectations too high. Such is the case here. I felt like it was an okay biopic but it felt oddly undecided about how it wanted to play out. For such a long run time, I felt like lots of the important parts were rushed and, while the music is iconic, as we all know, I felt like it overpowered the story and played a bigger role than the story itself. Maybe I'm just off here, but I don't see the acclaim. It's a basic story with great supporting acting but Rami Malek annoyed me to no end. Perhaps I should go back and look at Freddie Mercury more, but I couldn't get past him, which kept me from connecting. I'm sure I'm alone in this opinion and I can appreciate that. I will say the emotional peaks of the film were the highlights for me. The end concert sequence dragged on and on for me and I feel like they just added length to the movie when we already know the music. I would love to have seen his relationship blossom in more detail. That just popped up out of nowhere and it seemed like they didn't care to explore it, more so leaving it as an afterthought. The movie just didn't live up to the hype it received and I do not at all think this is even a best picture nominee.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Queen fans will love it.,"I went to see Bohemian Rhapsody not because I am a fan of the band Queen, but because I think Rami Malek is a great actor as evidenced by his character in the Mr Robot series. His portrayal of Freddie Mercury is at times very moving, but occasionally not quite believable. He's hindered in his acting by prothsetic teeth which don't even resemble FM's protruding front ones with others crooked, and his lips seem to stick to them when he speaks giving him a speech impediment. The musical moments are presented very well and Freddie's co-members of the band are well acted. Mike Meyers was a tad over-masked (kinda like Freddie's teeth) which prevented any empathy for his character as a human being with feelings. The ensemble cast - wife, mum, dad, boyfriend, evil servant, are really good, as is the the recreation of the big gig at Wembley.

The CliffsNotes version of the making of a superstar...,"Rock-bio on the formation of British rock band Queen, led by an incredibly self-assured baggage handler at Heathrow Airport named Farrokh Bulsara, he of the protruding front teeth, a young man disdainful of his Indian-British-Persian heritage. Bulsara lucks into the lead singer's slot with a pub band called Smile in 1970, after the original vocalist leaves for greener pastures; the next thing we know, the band has recorded a self-financed demo and is being eyed by a high-profile manager. This is when Bulsara legally changes his name to Freddie Mercury; he tells his horrified father of this in an incredibly static scene at a family gathering that includes his bandmates and girlfriend (Freddie boasts, ""I even had it changed on my passport"", as if doing all this was akin to changing one's shirt). Soon, the band has been rechristened Queen (apparently at Freddie's suggestion, though this happens off-screen) and has landed a record deal, finding themselves on tour in the US. This narrative is hurried along at a rapid pace, at the expense of the drama. Though the movie runs just over 2 hours, there's far too little history of the band in favor of concert reenactments and a blurry montage of Queen's rise to prominence. There's also the proverbial scene of Freddie telling his sweetheart that he's bisexual (with the girl giving him the standard ""why me?"" reaction). The middle portion of the film is the weakest--it's difficult recalling any specific scene from this section in retrospect--but the prologue and epilogue centering on the band's comeback performance at Live Aid in 1985 are pretty fabulous. Rami Malek was an excellent choice to play Mercury; his false front teeth are a marvelous attribute and he's got Freddie's moves down (he actually looks the most like Freddie Mercury in profile or when he's wearing tinted sunglasses--the eyes give the actor away). The rest of the band is equally good: Gwilym Lee as Brian May, Queen's lead guitarist; Ben Hardy as Roger Taylor, their drummer; and Joseph Mazzello as bassist John Deacon. Director Bryan Singer probably did his homework and mounted this biography with great interest and care, but the big dramatic scenes are sketchily-drawn. Singer does well by his cast, letting them strut their stuff to Queen's incredible soundtrack, but there's a void in this movie that the music cannot fill. Winner of four Oscars: Malek as Best Actor, Best Editing, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Missing the edge,"Not sure how to feel about the production. The are some bits I absolutely love in this film, however, it's also visibly flawed. I don't feel it really does justice to Freddie. Freddie was an extremely shy person offstage, here he comes across incredibly confident from the beginning. He also had this irritatingly sweet habit of covering his mouth when laughing which is totally ignored by the actor.
He was also incredibly promiscuous, what is merely hinted in the story. Obviously, both Freddie and Marry had their hearts broken when Freddie decided to face his sexuality but they maintained the friendship and Freddie embarked on many relationships and took lots of emotional blows from a multiple guys he was in love with, in this film however it looks like he was forever not over Marry , who basically moved out and moved on. The fact was, she never stopped loving him , and it took her ages to build up a new life and become emotionally involved with another guy.
And the last thing... The parties Freddie threw were ... excessive and wild beyond imagination, nothing like it was actually shown.
Also, Freddie didn't meet Jim in his house, Freddie was not super faithful to him, did but test him that well, somewhat Jim stuck around to the very end with him.
I'm not sure about Freddie's parents, was he really do open about his relationship in front of his parents at some point? Did his dad really go beyond his beliefs and culture to pay him on the back when/if he found out?
Very nice editing but dialogues at some points just truly horrible.
All in all, it's a bit of a disappointment, such a great artist like Freddie deserves something less conventional, less careful and more bohemian-like film story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Conventional.,"Oh, this was a good movie all right, with great, little-known actors, great music (the guy doing Freddie's voice was just as good as the one playing him), but IMO it lacked vision, it lacked grandeur.The shots, the way they told stories, the montage, all reflect ""playing safe"", something Queen never has done in their carreer. There was no excess, no subjective shots, no geist of the time - I would have like to see the encounter between Mercury and Bowie for ""Under Pressure"", for exemple, but the movie kinda existed in a conventional vaccuum. It was also a bit long, and binary in moralistic colours.There were however some strokes of genius like Myers' reacting in a very different way to a particular song he did act differently to some decades ago. The rooster also made the theatre laugh. But alas, I don't think this film will make history, because it is merely informative and pleasant whereas it should have blew us away - much like Queen did.

piercing the sky,"I am a daring person and I confess what very few people seem to have the courage to confess nowadays. I never was a great fan of 'Queen' or Freddie Mercury. It may be my dislike for the disco genre and the suspicion that this rock band with incontestable talent and which has reached immense planetary success, slid too much towards this direction. It may be the fact that by the time when 'Queen' were rising and had reached the peak of their glory I was behind the Iron Curtain with all what that meant from a point of view of censorship. Anyway, it's a fact, but at least this gave me the advantage of seeing and judging 'Bohemian Rhapsody' without the prejudice or extra-enthusiasm that many of the fans seem to have in the opinions they expressed about the movie.Not being too updated about the biography of Mercury and the history of the group, most of the information brought to screen by the film was new to me. As I understand there are some inaccuracies but the spirit of the band was kept true by the two veteran members of 'Queen' who are still active and who read the script and surveyed the filming. They seem to have had such an influence on the film that director Bryan Singer did not complete his work, although he is still the only one credited, and the differences of opinion with them led to Sacha Baron Cohen giving up acting in the lead role. We are left with a story of the raise, the troubles and the tragic end of a star who aimed to pierce the skies with his music, but the same ambition as well and his incapacity to control his personal life daemons led to his burning out fast after reaching the peak. The film deals mainly with the period of his ascend and culminates with what is considered today to have been the best concert Freddie Mercury and 'Queen' ever gave and one of the best in the history of pop music - their section in the Live AID concert on Wembley, on July 13, 1985.What I liked: The rendition of the atmosphere and sound of the music clubs and recording studios of the 70s is very credible, close to a documentary, and I mean the positive interpretation of the term. The stories about how some of the most famous songs of the band came to life are very interesting, and I do not care too much if they are not 100% a accurate. The recreation of the band concert at the AID Life mega-show on Wembley is a masterpiece. All details are being brought to screen at perfection and the atmosphere is as electric as it was on the stadium. I have seen again the original footage on youTube, and the twenty-something minutes in the film seemed to be another version of the same event, filmed with different cameras. The soundtrack is also excellent.What I liked less: I feel that Rami Malek is a miscast. He is doing great efforts to replicate the moves, the grimaces, the moods of the real Freddy Mercury but he lacks the charisma and the stage presence of the artist. The teeth prosthesis is ridiculous. All this is mixed into the melodramatic construction of the script and the effect is at some moment closer to parody than to real emotion.Frankly, I believe that the producers missed a great opportunity by not succeeding to bring Sacha Baron Cohen in the cast. It would certainly have been a different film, as Cohen is known for insisting on his personal ideas in executing his roles. I am not sure that my opinion about 'Queen' and Freddy Mercury would have changed, maybe the film would have been less reverential to the factual history of the band, but certainly it could have been a more interesting movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Surely a masterpiece,"I postponed watching this movie for a while because I was afraid it wouldn´t come close to my expectations. I have seen a few bad biograpic flicks. And I wouldn´t say I´m a die hard Queen fan, but I really appreciate their work, their contribution to the music and entertainment industry. They have a few songs that are my absolute favourites and just last summes I went to the Adam Lambert Queen concert and it was amazing.
I began hearing a lot of feedback from people that went to the movies and saw the Bohemian Rhapsody and all of the feedback was that this movie is somekind of magic and totally the best thing ever. Then I decided as a movie buff I can´t go on without seeing it myself. And well...the 2 hours and 10 minutes of this movie felt more like 30 minutes of a whirlwind of emotions. And I have seen a lot of great and not so great movies in my lifetime, still this one gets a solid 10 points from me. Ofcourse the major part of it is because of Rami Malek who I think gave an oscar-worthy performance, who studied so thoroughly every essence of Freddie Mercury and who managed to make every scene with him bright and interesting. Even the scenes with him just staring at something or someone conveyed such deep emotions that I really felt it all. I felt his pain, his sorrow, his ambition and literally everything there was to feel. Someone should make a video of people´s facial expressions who watch this movie for the first time.

Unbelievable mediocre,"Freddie Mercury is such a character! As a singer he's definetely one of the top 10, as a composer he's shown to be unique and revolutionary as no-one else before, and he had such an exotic and interesting life, what a pity that it wasn't that well translated to the screen. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is far from being the best motion picture of the year, it isn't even a good film, the editing was the worst part overall, songs that diserved full treatment (such as ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") were cutted while other songs were fully displayed (and the time didn't lacked, there is simply no explaination for this choice), also the screenplay was very poor, I can't remember any quote or time I felt dragged into the play, in fact I remember times were I thought the dialog was very empty and even irritating. The film takes 30 minutes just to play music, 20 of them to recreate the ""Live Aid"" concert -which I strongly recommend you to see instead of the film montage-, and that is the biggest reason people overrate this movie, because of the sensation of being in a concert, but if that is your objective go buy a real concert of Queen (i like the 1986, live in Rio performance), but that shouldn't be the objective of a biographic play. The film tries to treat so much topics (his relationship with his dad, his friendship with Mary, Queen's stability, his sexuality) but none of them actually utilized any simbolism or metaphores, everything was explicit and felt both bland and cliché, which is awfull to say while watching a (pseudo) biography of Freddie! If there is something to highlight was Rami Malek's interpretation, the excentricism and glamour of Mercury was quite well captured, the personage felt as the real man, also Gwilym Lee looks just like Brian May! But good interpretations can't save a mediocre storyline, narration, lack of deepness and melodramatic exageration. If you like musicals look at ""Cold War"", this is a far better one.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"While the music is fun and Malek is good, the narrative is wildly inconsistent and builds up its characters horribly, making for one of the worst scripts of the year","While Malek tries to inject life into the film, it feels completely segmented and disjointed, as if the film pieced together 6 small parts of Mercury's life where characters were different people and didn't show development between any of the segments. And you can't even claim the plot is disjointed because they have to squeeze real life down into a simpler, short narrative because they took plenty of creative liberties.
The simple, fundamental problem is the terrible script. They manage to make a fascinating true story seem at points unrealistic and at others boring. The first act was the lowest point in the movie. It seems very hard to believe that Queen, one of the most legendary bands of all time, was formed by three guys in a going nowhere, not very driven bar band where their lead singer leaves them, and then someone watching who apparently had little musical experience joins them, and almost immediately and without challenges they rise to great stardom. The movie just glosses over and makes it seem easy and natural that these random, previously completely irrelevant local musicians become international superstars. The narrative in the first act was no conflict at all, led by Freddie and the others just support him and songs just magically flow out of them (the first session they have, they already have Killer Queen in their back pocket?!). The creation of Bohemian Rhapsody was especially absurd to the point of being laughable - all the lyrics and exceptionally complex rhythmic and tonal changes just come to him? No natural artistic challenges to work through and change things, especially for one of the most complex songs ever made? The lack of effort they ever have to put in to make great music felt like a disservice to artists.
The characters are very poorly developed throughout. The other 3 band members are completely indistinguishable and indistinct for the first half of the movie, and even after that they are completely flat characters with little personality. His relationship with Mary begins with no reason beyond he thinks she's pretty, and of course they immediately fall in love with no depth to their relationship. Why he chooses to marry her, and how Freddie's sexuality was dealt with in general, was perplexing and poorly explained. Had he never felt any attraction to men before marrying her, but then when going on tour we see his perspective to suddenly be bizarrely sexually charged?
Freddie's character more than any other suffered from the discretized narrative chunks. Early in the movie, he's a hardworking, scrappy guy who loves music and manages to get this band to take him, though he has an odd and flamboyant style. Then we see a jump to him being essential to the band and out of nowhere bringing them success. How he had the musical experience or talent to do this is unclear. Despite his individual and flamboyant style, during this period there is never a hint of conflict and he's clearly the leader. Then there's a jump from this unrealistic period of perfect harmony to an equally unexpected shift to Freddie being utterly self-absorbed and flippant towards the band. He lives it up, parties hard, and alienates the band. During this period, the reporters scene seemed out of place and jarring, as it showed very different emotional issues than were shown in the flamboyant party style surrounding it. It also implied a frustration that people only cared about Freddie's life and not the band or their music, which wasn't shown anywhere else.
And then we reach the only part of the movie that shows something that could be quite good, but of course they ruin it. A picture of Mercury as an uber-talented but self-absorbed person who pushes everyone away develops, and he seems destined to hit rock bottom. Paul could've been a fascinating antagonist in creating this spiral and pushing others out for his benefit only to ruin Freddie, but their relationship is horribly set up and never clear who holds power and investment in the other. The shift in Freddie trusting everything to Paul to turning on him by Mary's word was inconsistent, and then the ending redemption arc for Freddie made everything ring hollow and gave the movie an immoral message: Freddie rises on talent, only cares about himself and pushes others out, but then everyone loves him again because of one concert so his talent bails him out anyways. Not only is that arc not what actually happened (he didn't really push the band away), but it leaves a horrible message. There's an interesting story there, but they were too afraid to actually follow it (and it wouldn't be true to Freddie's story, raising the question of why they brought the arc in at all).
The music is perfectly acceptable, the Live Aid concert is good, and Malek does what he can to salvage the wreck. The humor often didn't land with me, but wasn't a key problem of the movie. As other reviewers put it, it does feel like an AI adapted a wikipedia page into a script, and the outcome isn't good. Who thinks this movie is one of the best of the year???

A memory that will last,"First off, I seen this movie on the opening night at the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood as it happend that I was in the area on vacation.The movie itself was fantastic even if you are not a Queen fan or too young to have been around when they were still playing. I was around and kick myself for never making it to a concert. You know how it is, ""I'll see them next time around"" except in my case there was no next time. For me the movie was much more then just a movie. It was a time machine. It sort of makes up for the concert that I never seen.Everything that I thought about and liked about the band came through very well in this movie. The depiction of Freddy as a larger than life character front man to the band holds true to what I would expect. If anything, it showed me aspects of his life I did not know about but add a significant amount to his legacy in my mind.A great tribute to the best lead singers in rock history.

"Rami Malek does a great Freddie Mercury, but...","""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018 release; 135 min.) is a bio-pic of the British band Queen, an in particular focuses on the lead singer Freddie Mercury (RIP). As the movie opens, we see Freddie waking up and getting ready to perform on Live Aid. We then go back to ""London, 1970"". Freddie has another argument with his parents, and heads out to catch a show. Ut happens to be Smile, with Brian on guitar and Roger on drums. That very night, Smile's led singer quits, and Freddie, who gives an impromptu audition, manages to convince Brian and Roger to take him in. It's not long before John joins as well, and Freddie renames the band Queen. In a parallel story, Freddie falls for a sweet girl named Mary... At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie has been in development for years and years. It ultimately was directed by Bryan Singer, best known for his with with in the X-men franchise. Here he brings 15 years in the band Queen to the big screen. Please note he was fired as director before completion of the film. Whoever made the decision to cast Rami Malek in the role of Freddie Mercury should take a big bow, as Malek is absolutely fantastic, as if Freddie Mercury has come alive again. Of course the music is top-notch. That said, there are a number of issues that bother me. First and foremost, for reasons that care incomprehensible (actually: so as to make the movie as commercially accessible as possible), this is a PG-13 movie, and hence we get a strongly filtered version of the band and of Freddie Mercury. Freddie's battle with AIDS is barerly touched upon, for one. Next, there are a number of unexplained gaffes in the movie: the movie makes it look like Queen hadn't played together in forever before doing LiveAid. That is simply untrue (the band did a long tour of Australia and Japan just months before LiveAid.) Then we see the band perform ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" on their first US tour (in 1974). Except that ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" was a hit single from Queen's 1978 album ""Jazz"", and was never played before 1978. Need I go on? As a life-long Queen fan who saw them in concert in 1978 and 1980 (arguably at the band's peak) in Belgium (where I grew up), ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" leaves me unfulfilled, I'm sorry to say. It should've been the definitive film about Freddie and the rest of Queen, but for me it's not. Thankfully Rami Malek's performance makes up for some of it.""Bohemian Rhapsody"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. If you have any interest in the music of Queen and/or the person that was Freddie Mercury, I encourage you to check it out, be it in theaters, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

One of best movies of 2010s,"Didn't manage to go to the cinema around premiere time and before watching a movie many people shared their opinion regarding the movie: masterpiece, total rubbish and so on; on one hand I knew what to expect, on another was not really sure of anything and that was the most pleasant surprise I had in years!
Touching till the line I left cinema in tears and had cried through most of the movie. Insaw men sheading tears. Definitely must see in a lifetime movie, especially if you're fan of Queen. Regardless the storyline - highly criticised how Freddie's life, especially after coming out, was represented; personally I don't find it anywhere close to critic's opinion - film is worth ""just"" for the music.
Remarkable performance of Rami Malek deserves Oscar and I am sure to see him on the list of nominations. He inhabited Freddie to the point where Ieven started to think of him as Freddie.

Historical inaccuracies spoilt an ok movie,"I like the music of Queen. I was hoping to see a biopic and learn something about them; especially seeing that Taylor and May are behind this. Unfortunately, like in art, truth has been sacrificed for image. What we have is the sanitised version I guess they would have us believe. Problem is, we were there. It did not happen they way they were telling us. This film, then, screws with your mind, and leaves you wondering if what you know is true actually was how you remember things. (And thanks to proper research, history vastly outweighs this version of truth.) But what is truth? Queen are awesome. Mercury is a legend. The music will live on. Perhaps for musical entertainment and experience, they should have made ""We Will Rock You"", and stuck in a rockumentary as an extra on the Blu-Ray. I guess ""management"" are happy with the truth they are trying to sell us; but as an audience member who lived through those times, it's leaves you slightly dazed, slightly confused, and slightly unsatisfied.

A movie about a larger-than-life band that fails to reach their mythic stature but ends up being an entertaining ride nonetheless,"For a man of the intensity of Freddie Mercury, this movie seemed too mellow in its delivery.The music alone is worth the entry price and the performance by Malek is the best he could have done in this situation. The movie is entertaining and will cause you goosebumps here and there specially during the performances. But the handling of the story and the characters and their relationships seems lacking in its authenticity and ends up feeling like a disjointed collage of happenings during the band's history and Mercury's personal issues. There's not an in-depth and gritty exploration of the evolution and the roller-coaster intensity of a passionate soul as that of Mercury and even less of the other band members, there are only hints of it. There's a lack of cohesiveness both in storytelling as well as in emotional grip which ultimately subtracts from the epic dimension that the story of such a mythic band deserved.Overall I feel a bit disappointed about the end result but the movie is no doubt entertaining from start to finish and will delight you with the music score, it is Queen afterall.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Watching this movie was like drinking a stale, flat beer.","Watching this movie was like drinking a flat, stale beer. it was too expensive to ditch, but I wasn't enjoying it, and I felt no buzz (despite any 'oscar buzz'). It's very poorly constructed, with most of the scenes being fabricated fiction rather than fact (so don't get excited; it never happened that way).I rarely felt like I was watching Freddie Mercury. Only in a few concert scenes shot from a distance. The buck teeth prosthetic was too extreme, and kept distracting me (freddie's weren't as pronounced), as did the grey/blue eyes of the actor (Freddie's were very dark brown). It was very hard for me to believe that this blue-eyed Caucasian was Indian. They really should have cast an Indian actor, because in scenes with his family, he looks like he was adopted. However, I did think that the actors who played the drummer and lead guitarist did exceptional jobs. They and the actress who plays Mary were the only thing worth watching. (Though Mike Myer's appearance was entertaining as well.)I was very disappointed in this movie. It could have been so much better. But it's basically a collection of mediocre Youtube videos from a mediocre tribute act.Three stars are for the star performances of Gwilim Lee, Ben Hardy, and Lucy Boynton, and a half-star for Mike Meyers (entertaining, but too similar to the Shrek voice). The rest all combined was only worth a half star.The biggest let down of all, is how they chose to fabricate series of events, rather than portray them accurately,which was way more interesting and entertaining than the fictional series of events they came up with.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

It feels like you've been to the Live Aid concert,"I had my first child in 1983. Before that, I was a boba-fide, dancing, rock n roll girl who went to as many concerts as I could possibly afford. Saw The Rolling Stones a couple of times, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, etc. I never got to see Queen, and that's left a kind of hole in my rant history. Ahaha! I was excited to see the movie because I loved them then, raised my kids with RnR, and they know almost every word to every song...and so do THEIR 8 $ 10 year old kids!
I know the critics have been pretty lukewarm (to say the least) about the movie, because there wasn't enough time spent on the ""angst"" that Freddy must have had about being gay, the AIDS crisis and his eventual death from it.
I don't know, maybe it's a generational thing, but, unlike most critics of movies today, I got the message about all of those angsty things just fine, and in the proper perspective. Of course his music was impacted by his life - how could it not? But I was happy to not have to watch him at the moment he actually contracted the disease...the music was the important thing here, and wow...out of the park! By the end of the Live Aid concert, which felt unbelievably REAL, my husband & I, as well as other members of the audience, were weeping and singing and laughing, those all brought on by the power of the music, the stories & people behind the music, the actors' portrayals of the band (I had to keep reminding myself that they were not the actual band members!) and the sort of naive dawning of the realization of just how much impact those guys have had on our society...not just on music, but in so many aspects besides.

Beneath all these revealings of arguably the greatest rock band since the dawn of time, the real story and drama triumph over this - how emotionally lonely and fragile Freddie was and how that loneliness only grows until the importance of true family is realized.
The story and script concerning all band members are highly accurate, but the acting of this script is what REALLY hits the nail on the head in portraying their personalities; extremely convincing.

Tries too hard to grasp too much,"It's hard to make good biographically movies. Especially on famous people like Freddie Mercury. An icon, one of the greatest pop singers ever. With a copious career. This movie is well-liked by many, but I did not fall for it. I think the movie tries to embrace too much. Is it about Mercury? About Queen? Mercurys career? Or the privacy of Mercury? A bit of everything, it seemed. There are good roles performances by the main role-holder, especially I think he is good at the last part of the film.But after reading several (admittedly unauthorized) biographies by Freddie Mercury, I think the movie does not seem to give any good insight into who he was private, his relationship with other and sexual orientation. The movie takes light of who he was private and unable to go into the depths of life he lived. It is too smooth for me. Mayby to make it more acceptable for a big audience? His career and the story of Queen is well presented here. But quitting the movie with the entire sequence of the band during LIVE AID becomes strange.

Totally worthwhile biopic of Freddie Mercury. Best Actor for Malek.,"My wife and I watched this in March 2019 at home on BluRay from our public library. I watched it again in January 2020. Picture and sound are first rate.This movie almost swept the film awards season, winning many of them and just missing ""Best Picture"" Oscar. But Malek did get the Oscar for his performance.Back when they were most popular I never recall paying any particular attention to the rock group ""Queen"" but as a music lover have long been aware of their name. And of course the lead singer Freddie Mercury, without him in particular this would have been a very forgettable band.Rami Malek, who shares similar ancestry, plays Freddie Mercury who in real life died at 45 of complications from AIDS. Malek was fitted with prosthetic teeth and given more width to his nose to more resemble Mercury. Malek sings, to provide realism, but all the singing we hear in the movie is Mercury's voice, the credits simplay say ""Queen"" for each song.Overall a brilliant biopic of a very complicated musician and singer who was determined to entertain and to live his life the way he wanted.I also really enjoyed the various extras on the disc, particularly how they developed a new technique to simulate a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the live aid concert in 1985. Basically using individual images of real people, ""extras"" dressed in various garb and performing various motions, then via computer building all those individual moving images into blocks that when complete looked authentically like a large crowd.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Lightning in a bottle,"Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic focusing on the career and life of Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen. It depicts how he got involved with his bandmates, achieved stardom and eventually succumbed to AIDS.Freddie is played by Rami Malek and I'm convinced this will go down as one of the most perfect castings in cinema history. Malek very deservedly earned an Academy Award for his role and for a reason. Just watch this film's recreation of the famous Live Aid concert in London back to back with the real thing and you can see how Malek briefly becomes Freddie reborn.The rest of the band are played by Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy and Joe Mazzello. They give credible performances but this is very much Freddie's film, which is a shame because the rest of Queen are also interesting personalities and have their own fascinating stories. Brian May (Lee), for example, has a doctorate in astrophysics and has an actual asteroid named after him. Barely mentioned in the film.Still, it can't be denied that Freddie was the brightest star of Queen while he still lived and had the most interesting life story. And the film captures this rather well. Although, it is a bit baffling how inaccurate the film is in regards to actual events. Now... don't get me wrong. I get that this is not a documentary. It doesn't need to be 100 percent historically accurate if that would get in the way of storytelling.But when you take out already existing drama. Stuff that actually happened and could make for great cinema. When you take stuff like that out and add in your own made up twists. Then I have to question the wisdom of that. I get condescending timelines and combining side characters. But leaving out actual dramatic events and making up your own. That seems a bit weird. And unnecessary.That being said, it's a great film. The Live Aid concert recreation especially is an electrifying experience and well worth the price of admission by itself. Add in Malek's superb performance and you have an imperfect film with a lot of heart and soul.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Nice (albeit too simple) reminder of a musical legend,"Bohemian Rhapsody plays it safe. It's a typical biopic with some pretty cheesy moments/dialogues and one-dimensional characters. Given the legendary status of Queen - and especially Freddie - it's a shame, that the film doesn't take more risks.On the other hand, the setting and direction is good, film is full of energy, casting is great, the music is divine and Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury is (despite some limitations) outstanding.The film definitely isn't any masterpiece or historically accurate, but it serves well as a simple memento of undying musical legend(s).",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
The critics have got this one so wrong!,"Absolutely brilliant biopic of Queen.As a fan of Queen and musician, I was so happy and buzzing walking out of the cinema. The film honours the memory of Freddie and the rest of the band, Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor and puts the music front and centre.The music is as fresh as if you've just heard it for the first time. As you would hope, they did a brilliant job in the sound department (I know May and Taylor were heavily involved). It's bold, fresh and punchy and you feel like you've been to a Queen gig. I think this is a major part of why audiences are connecting with the film.Rami Malek is incredible as Freddie, at times you think it is him. I also loved Joe Mazzello's portrayal of John Deacon, again, he really is him! The actors really do a superb job and fully inhabit these roles - fantastic casting. The film really 'gets' Queen's band dynamics, has a deep understanding them, and also what it is to be a musician.As a Brit, it also just simply makes you proud!The critics have completely missed the point of this film. I didn't need a gritty, hard-hitting netflix style drama involving all the gruesome details.

"Solid entertainment in the second half of the movie, but not much more. Overall bland and flat, Mercury and all the Queen deserve much better.","First of all, some people here - the most fanatical fans of Queen - have to stop writing two-sentence reviews, like ""genius movie, Oscar for Rami Malek"" & give 10 stars, because this is what makes the review biased and dishonest. I'm also a fan of Queen and Freddy himself, but the same time I graduated film school and I love cinema, that's why I also like to be as objective as possible in my reviews of movies. Here I will try to make my criticism honest, substantive, and not too long (so that everyone wants to read it).Yes, sometimes professional film critics are deliberately malicious, and their opinions are detached from reality, but sometimes they are also right, and in the case of 'Bohemian Rhapsody', this is the second.The film distorts a lot of facts from Freddy and Queen's life, and if these were unimportant events - I would not care at all, but these are important things and especially in a biographical film this should not be done, just to make the movie more dramatic. Fred's life was dramatic enough, if only the creators of the film really wanted to make an interesting movie, they would go even deeper into Mercury's childhood and the fact he escaped with his family, against persecution, from his own homeland. And this in turn could be the starting point / foundation for a deeper, better portrait of the Queen singer.Unfortunately, there is no depth here, the worst part is that this film is schematic, completely flat, only glides over important topics, does not carry out any serious psychological analysis of such a fascinating, complicated character that Freddy was.
I don't accept excuses of the most fanatical fans of Queen (who cannot come to terms with the fact that many critics / reviewers, very rightly criticize this movie), that ""this is the story of the band and not Mercury himself"". Because firstly, one does not exclude the other: it was possible to include in the scenario a deeper analysis / truth about Freddy and the band, and secondly the band's history is also poorly told. The best moment of a rather boring, long-lasting, first half of the movie is the recording of '' Bohemian Rhapsody '', a humorous accent with a rooster and Galileo. The rest is a fast, also quite jumping and chaotic montage of musical scenes depicting, carelessly, subsequent tours and writing of individual hits, and while I understand that in a 2-hour movie it is not possible to show each creative process in the smallest detail, it was still possible to show it better from the pov of the characters - band members, thus also build better and deeper characters in this film.The second half is better, I admit, both in terms of pace and in terms of writing/story, and the icing on the cake is the Live Aid concert, so really the edn. The performance, photos, acting of the main actor is at the highest level in this scene, unfortunately it is not enough to save this movie from failure.Malek's acting, imo, certainly doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination. He tries his best with an empty and schematic scenario, and the writers / director's mistakes are not his fault, true, but Oscar is an award for outstanding acting performances, which are not limited to robotic mannerism, it must be accompanied by the psychological, emotional depth of the portrayed character, and there is no such depth in this film, in this main character. The only really emotional scene that attempts to penetrate into Freddy's soul is the scene of conversation between Fred& Mary, first at Fred's house and then in the rain. It is here, that Malek's creation is the truest and the best.Unfortunately, when we look at this role through the prism of the whole film, majority of Malek's work is the mentioned mechanical mannerism - perfectly recreated- but it is not enough to rate this role positively, let alone reward it with an Oscar nomination. Imitative mannerism, gestures, faces alone - it is only a skeleton, an acting sketch, especially in a biographical film, and not a full, beautiful, complex image, which should be any biography. There is simply no soul in this act, and it's just a crime if you play a figure as extraordinary, colorful and complicated as Freddy Mercury.
In addition to the obvious mistakes of screenwriters and director, Malek himself (for me), does not rise to the task. Sometimes he is just Mercury caricature, and large, artificial teeth don't help to erase this impression, in fact, the opposite. The make-up department didn't do good job here, famous teeth of Queen frontman could have been done better, much more subtly, it would look less ridiculous. Returning to Rami Malek - he is still a young talent who - like any actor - needs more workshop and acting experience, plus really good material, to really shine. That is why I predict Rami Malek will not win an Oscar.I still think that the great mistake of the Bohemian Rhapsody creators, was to part ways with Sacha Baron Cohen. When I found out that he had left Mercury's biography project, I felt it was a big mistake from film producers, because I was sure Cohen wanted to tell an uncompromising, interesting story, not forcedly smoothed , and it seems, my intuition did not disappoint me then. Cohen, a remarkable & colorful character like Freddy, would have fit in perfectly in this role. In addition, after hearing the interview, in which Cohen told why he finally left the movie and what vision of Mercury he had - I regret even more that it was not him who played the Queen main singer. People, who can't stand Cohen (they don't understand him) say it's good that he was replaced by Malek, because Sacha supposedly only meant/wanted controversy and scandals, that he would show Freddy only as crazy sex addict, taking drugs and nothing else. However, all of this are just primitive attacks, not supported by logic.Whoever saw 'Borat' and really understood the message behind it, knows that Cohen is an extremely conscious and intelligent actor / artist, at the same time, I will repeat: extraordinary like Freddy. He is a master of imitation, a master of using various accents, a great actor and, additionally, he can sing very well - which he showed in his role in '' Les Misérables ''. Cohen's strengths don't end there, because physically, with stature, he is much closer to Freddy (who was a well-built man) than frail Malek, has naturally dark eyes and hair, and with a bit of characterization, I have no doubt that he could have been the most wonderful Freddy Mercury. What's more, if he was allowed to do what he wanted with this role - to portray Freddy as a complicated, controversial figure, with a great appetite for life, but also a great artist who mixed the big ego with great sensitivity and shyness - I have no doubt that it would be a great role. Now it's just a missed opportunity.As a result, we got schematic, ""polite"" movie, ironically - because Freddy Mercury, as well as the entire Queen, were as original, unapologetic and creative as you could be and deserve much better. Sorry, but real Queen fan, who wanted raw, real, complex, deep, uncompromising truth and story - just cannot like this movie. Mercury and all the Queen story has so much potential (wasted in this movie), which is weird to say and how it all turned out, considering living Queen members were involved in this movie. Sorry guys, you did awful job. I guess I'll just wait for another movie, bold and great this time, I hope.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

absolutely heavenly,"Rami Malek's representation of Freddie Mercury was stunning and completely unexpected. The critics were wrong in 1975 when they first heard Bohemian Rhapsody, and they're wrong about it now. Admittedly, the movie offered little to no elaboration on the backstory of Mary Austin, Brian May and other significant characters, but BoRhap is the story of how a poor Pakistani boy went from working as a baggage handler to being the lead singer of one of the biggest rock bands in history. I suppose this may be due to the inherent disinterest of director Bryan Singer and how he continually disappeared from set on days end. There are defects in the movie. There are plot holes and perhaps not enough angst as I personally would have liked, but no movie is perfect.

This is a Hollywood movie in nearly every aspect and you can feel that throughout the entire film. I am a Queen fan, but not once during this film did I feel compelled to move or sing along, even in my head. A QUEEN biopic and they played it safe. This movie should have been 3 hours long, it should have tested our patience, it should have bombarded our senses leaving us breathless and not sure what to think at first. Many of Queen's songs are like that, and they become greater upon repeated listenings as we discover new and rewarding layers. This movie has no dimensions. And it ignored his sexuality almost entirely. Unforgivable, if you ask me. I'm not saying it should have displayed graphic sex, but this film takes a coward's stance in that regard.

"A movie for movie-goers, not for Queen fans","Bohemian Rhapsody failed in many respects to reflect the accomplishments, the fame, the torment that went through the band and through the life of Freddie Mercury.It failed to entertain us with the music of Queen, giving us just short clips until the end. It failed to show the true Freddie: shy, retiring, an admitted introvert, and the extent of his drug and alcohol use. It glossed over the number of his male partners, and the sickness of his AIDS.The movie inadequately explained his unremitting, dying even, love for Mary Austin. The movie suggested that they married, but they did not. Freddie said she was his common law wife. He wrote ""Love of My Life"" for her, but it was not included in the movie. She was with him to the end.There were many factual errors in the movie, which is to be expected in a bio-pic. But two stood out for me: The movie suggested that Freddie was first diagnosed with AIDS and told the band shortly before the Live Aid concert. Not true on both accounts. The movie also recorded that Freddie fired his manager for suggesting he might leave the band to sing solo. However, Freddie made two solo albums and several solo singles.Many interesting sidelights to Queen were omitted from the movie. When DJ Kenny Everett ""mistakenly"" played (36 times) an unreleased Bohemian Rhapsody"", the phones lit up from fans wanting a copy. Freddie also performed with a ballet troop and recorded an operatic album with a Spanish soprano. He took Princess Diana to a gay bar. Queen's performance at Live Aid is credited pushing response from contributors to a reported £150 million.However, the movie's interpretation of the Live Aid concert was fairly good. The actors even wore clothes identical to Queen right down to the Freddie's belt. But the movie cut at least half off of the actual performance, leaving me wishing for more. (""Freddie"" of the movie omitted Freddie's use of the mic as a phallic symbol and his sexual strutting throughout the performance.)So much more could have been done with the movie. Freddie's last recording, ""These are the Days of Our Lives"", and the evening Live Aid duo ""Is This the World We Created"" would have made a nice overlay on the screen credits. Regardless of the hype on the movie title, we never heard more than a minute or two of the six minute anthem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A polished Hollywood depiction lacking authenticity,"Just to begin with: Bryan Singer's depiction of Freddie Mercury and Queen's concerts are absolutely brilliant in terms of their direction and editing. The cinematography of the film is also excellent and it is overall a very polished effort. As was Rami Malek's performance.What I really and truly missed in this film was authenticity. Especially with regards to the writing which seemed almost superficial and afraid of spoiling a perfect image of a perfect rock band. Perhaps this goes in line with the massive advertisement of the film and that it needs to be politically correct in most ways.To sum up I think the direction is excellent but the tight Hollywood-esque writing really suffers from flaws in terms of conveying true emotion and authenticity.I saw this screening very close to seeing and experiencing Bradley Cooper's ""A Star Is Born"", which I hugely preferred due to its down-to-earth direction and writing as well as some very unpolished and vulnerable performances by Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.Nonetheless I can recommend this film to any fan of Queen, as it gives some interesting perspectives on the life of Freddie Mercury.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Disappointed But Still Enjoyabe,"Bohemian Rhapsody Review:Bohemian Rhapsody is the story of Freddie Mercury and how Queen became one of the most popular bands. I saw this a week ago and wasn't super excited but thrilled to see it. I love Queen so I thought this would be a nice entertaining movie that people were saying could get nominated for some Academy Awards (even though it hadn't been viewed yet at the time). I liked the movie but was disappointed that I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It was a very entertaining movie with great songs but it failed to wow me. People think this movie is amazing and critics gave it a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes (just on the verge of a rotten score). I feel like critics were a little harsh on it and audiences were over rating it. I think the movie would've been much better if they fixed the first act of the movie. It couldn't decide what it wanted to be and there were unnecessary and slow scenes during that. After that 35ish minutes it got better. Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury was a perfect fit. He could get a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. Probably not an Academy Award nomination though. I also really liked Lucy Boynton as Mary Austin. I haven't seen her in many things but I really liked her. One thing is that there wasn't much said about their relationship but it was just there. I would've liked some development there. The songs were great. Everybody in the theater was enjoying them. The story was good although I would've liked to learn more about the others in the band. It didn't really go in depth with them but mostly with Freddie. Also there were too many time skips at the beginning where we learned basically nothing that happened in that time and I wouldn't liked to know what happened. It was also a little long and some scenes could've been taken out. The humor throughout the story worked well. It was a pretty good script. The editing was fantastic, especially when the make the song Bohemian Rhapsody. I won't say what they did but it was something great that I've never seen. The concert scenes, the Live Aid concert in particular, were great. It felt like an actual concert. Overall I would recommend this movie to lovers of Queen. Yes it was an enjoyable film but it had its flaws. It'll be a movie people will think will be snubbed at the Oscars but if it deserves an Oscar I would say editing. Go see it if you have time and want to have an enjoyable time.My Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

A formulaic movie and a missed opportunity,"The main show here is Malek. This movie is his masterpiece. His energetic antics on stage, his accent, his prosthetic buck teeth and his tragic tension successfully bring Freddie Mercury to life. He is the most interesting thing in this movie, as he should be.Coming in second are the performances of the supporting cast, particularly Ben Hardy as drummer Roger Taylor.The last thing that stands out is the historical setting. The 70's and 80's are faithfully recreated, from Freddie's eclectic wardrobe to the soaring aerial shots of the massive crowd at the Live Aid concert. This is all somewhat expected. The authenticity is the one thing you need to get right in a biopic like this.But that is where the interesting things end. While the film is serviceable, it doesn't have enough remarkable qualities to warrant the standing ovation that this movie seems to be receiving from the public. It sure seems like the enduring hype surrounding Bohemian Rhapsody is driving people to cheer anything remotely related to the band, even when the substance is lacking.The story, in particular, represents one big missed opportunity. A deeper exploration of Freddie's early development as a singer, his influences, and his emigration to the UK could have added much interest to the movie. There were also countless interesting moments in Queen's history, like when the song The Show Must Go On came out right in the middle of the rumours about the singer's health. There is none of that here (that song, by the way, just gets played during the credits).Instead, the story starts with Freddie meeting the band when he is already a perfect singer. From then on, the group rises to fame, experiences the obligatory break-up, and the film ends with the band back together, at the top of Queen's fame.In short, this film delivers strong performances, and provides a nice audio-visual treat for those who are interested in the band, but it falls short in providing any real substance beyond that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

You got the simple pattern of, 'formation of band, label disapproval, success, descension, lead goes away, lead fails and abuses drugs, returns to sing kumbaya.

Bohemian Rhapsody (2018),"Directed by Bryan Singer & Dexter Fletcher. Starring Rami Malek, Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazello, Aidan Gillen, Allen Leech, Aaron McCusker, Tom Hollander, Mike Myers. (PG-13)Superficial (and largely artificial) biopic of rock band Queen from their early 70s roots in London up to their famous 1985 Live Aid charity performance. Focus falls heavily on frontman Freddie Mercury; so much so that Brian, Roger and John barely register anything that even remotely resembles individual personalities. Countless cornball moments along the way such as offering ""origin stories"" of big radio hits and Myers' obnoxiously wink-wink anti-""Bohemian Rhapsody"" routine, separated by cloying glimmers into Freddie's personal life, with dialogue that no one in real life would ever speak and clumsy approaches to most of his important relationships, to say nothing for the wince-inducing, bordering-on-offensive surface examinations of his homosexuality. Don't expect more than a little leather-clad texture, a handful of innuendos, and a cliched declamation or two; the PG-13 rating keeps the usual rock star excess on the sidelines, but neutering Freddie's sexual identity/conflict felt more like a (poor) choice on the part of the filmmakers and the awful script. Despite distracting dental prosthetics, Malek is credible in the lead role, but he only truly shines when he's performing; the film itself only comes alive during those same concert moments, especially the Live Aid finale. Better, though, to skip the reproductions and all the connect-the-dots filler in between and just watch archival footage of the real deal. A band as driven and theatrical as Queen deserves better than this rote and absurdly inaccurate coloring book of cliches.33/100",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"As a rock biopice it's a 9, but overall 7, with one stunning scene","Well, maybe it's because I never was a huge fan of Queen. A friend used to wear out ""Killer Queen"" when we were in high school, and my first impression was that they sounded like a rock version of a barbershop quartet.Bohemian Rhapsody the song was certainly different. A little known fact was the influence of 10CC's ""One night in Paris"" on the arrangement and the style of that song. Later, Queen scored big with ""We will rock you/We are the champions,"" which to this day is a popular anthem at sporting events and other types of public spectacles.To the writers and producers credit, the story skirts around the edges of Freddie Mercury's sexuality, which was a popular topic during his time, and it stays clear of too many party and debauchery scenes, where it may have gone with a different director (think Quentin Tarantino or Oliver Stone).Instead, the story explores it in one of the most stirring non-musical scenes of the entire movie, when Mary Austin gently confronts him on how his sexuality has dampened their relationship. And he is supportive but hurt at the same time when Mary later introduces him to her new boyfriend.The narrative involves the other band members more than other biopics such as the Doors, where they were relegated to bit players whose sole purpose seemed to be providing reaction shots for Jim Morrison's antics. At least two scenes with the band stand out, but it would spoil it for those who have yet to see the movie to describe them in detail.The heart-wrenching scenes provide context for the Live Aid, 20 minute stunner in the movie's final act. Overall, Rami Malek deserved the Oscar for fully embodying Freddie Mercury, but credit should also go to the makeup artists, choreographers , and coaches who helped him.Truly, the movie's final act will have you smiling, cheering, singing and crying at the same time, so if you have yet to see it, SEE IT!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A Letdown for Queen Fans,"I have seen a number of negative reviews of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that primarily take issue with its factual inaccuracies. These reviews are unlikely to aid the average viewer--who goes to the movies to be entertained--in deciding whether to see this film or in considering its merits after having watched it. The carelessness shown by ""Bohemian Rhapsody""'s disregard for facts may serve, however, to underscore the film's deep flaws, chief among which (ironically) is its superficiality. At the center of this film is Freddie Mercury, played by Rami Malek with a sheen of flamboyant glamor constantly being threatened by an aching loneliness that, one gets the feeling, the film often wishes would just go away. In this sense, the filmic Mercury is not human so much as he is a vessel of musical talent that happens to have, accumulated around it, details that for a fully-realized character would represent more than narrative inconveniences. Malek, to his credit, persists in conveying that loneliness, Mercury's starvation for real connection and understanding. The film's creators also appear to understand the character's desperate need for love (the film opens with ""Somebody to Love,"" after all). And the film recognizes, at least in theory, that love can occur in guises romantic, familial, and collegial, and that fanatical love, often depicted as hollow and unsatisfying, can sustain a person as lonely as Malek's Mercury. But rather than depict Mercury's journey through the push and pull of relationships with people pursuing their own needs, the filmmakers settle for surrounding him with emotional wallpaper (see, e.g., his bandmates, essentially playing the role of nagging but devoted spouse) incapable of challenging or fulfilling him. Moreover, any chance Malek has of developing a well-rounded character is thwarted by the film's haste to get through its quiet moments; one wonders if the messy production history required these scenes get short shrift in favor of the money-shot concert segments. Those concert segments, by the way, are (like the rest of the film) neutered by choppiness and an unnatural sleekness--in other words, they feel too much like the BBC TV performance early in the film that the band laments it will have to lip-sync and mime through. But that's show biz, right? I am willing to forgive the artificiality of the concert scenes (they are, after all, lip-synced and mimed) because the music is great, but I cannot help but wish they held some of the raw emotionality of the concert scenes, shot with a lingering, trembling camera, in this year's ""A Star Is Born."" (I recognize that much of Queen's music consists of stadium-rock stompers that do not lend themselves to emotional revelation. But the film doesn't even attempt to convey anything more than, ""Look, it's Queen!"" with most of the musical performances. Surely, a more definite statement about Mercury's off-stage loneliness could have been made by contrast.) I could go on to complain of the dialogue, through which the film manifests its fear of emotional depth, or the cliché-ridden imagery (trucker-hat beard guy slo-mo walks into MEN room; Mercury, on payphone with wife, looks on, licks lips), but I'm starting to feel like a grouch. I will close with a final opinion, which requires no intellectualizing or arguing: ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" is boring. I went in optimistic, a lover of Queen's music. I should have been easy to please. But the film is a struggle to get through. It should feel like an ecstatic, powerful, sweaty, riotous, gay concert--the kind of place where a person could fall in love with a person, with a band--but instead is tour footage, sanitized and stitched together from only the most precious, perfect moments, where all of the mistakes, all of the personality, are erased.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Great performance in a mediocre film.,"Let's get one thing straight: 'walk the line' this movie is not. Sure it was great fun and as someone who didn't really grow up with Queen because my parents are immigrants who wouldn't know them if you smacked them with them, there was a lot of 'THAT'S A QUEEN SONG?'. I was pleasantly surprised there. Rami Malek gave an energized performance of Freddie Mercury. This film however falls short in that in never addresses any struggles. Sure Freddie went through a period of being on his high horse, but even that was just annoying and you wanted to slap him more than anything else. In terms of real struggle or drama, this film is lacking. It's not an emotional experience like 'a star is born'. A fun film to watch I guess, but I came out of it feeling like something was missing and then my best friend wanted to see it so we did and then she said the same thing. It felt incomplete. At first I was against the idea of making a more salacious version of freddie's Life, but now I'm starting to think it would have been more interesting than this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"The Natural, Coming Straight Out of Zanzibar","The inspiring story of rock star Freddy Mercury comes to life on the big screen, but the way it comes to life is fairly predictable. It's less like RAY or WALK THE LINE and more like STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, or even the old Robert Redford baseball classic, THE NATURAL.Freddy is a Natural, just like Roy Hobbs. You see he was born with extra teeth so that he has a superhuman vocal range. He's never shown watching earlier rock stars and learning from them -- he just shows up one day with his bat Wonderboy, (I mean with his magic teeth) and suddenly the last place New York Knights -- I mean, the college band Smile -- are on their way to the World Series!In the Natural Roy Hobbs has two girlfriends. One is kind and good and always dresses in white. The other one is mean and selfish and always wears black. Freddy Mercury has two boyfriends in this movie -- one is mean and the other one is good. And you don't even need color coded outfits to tell them apart! The only question is whether Freddy will choose the right one in time. But most audience members will figure it out without the endless scenes at home. And frankly, watching Freddy feed his cats gets really, really boring.On the plus side, I loved the way the other members of Queen got credit for writing many of the bands greatest hit songs. I loved how they worked together as a band. I loved the subtle message of tolerance, not just for the LGBT community but for middle eastern culture and religion. I loved all the scenes with Freddy's father and Freddy's patience and determination in going his own way in a new culture. (The way he says so quietly, ""it's Freddy now, father."") I loved how the fantastic live performances told the story, and how the ending is just as exciting as the finale of the Natural. Freddy comes through with the bases loaded, hitting a home run in spite of serious health problems -- just like Roy Hobbs at the end of the Natural.I just wish they could have created a new kind of story for a new kind of legend.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

They are the champions!,"Chronicling the band Queen and in particularly frontman Freddy Mercury, from their creation until their Live Aid performance in the 80's, this is a gripping and highly entertaining film. I was dubious going into it as I feared it may be formulaic to other rock band films, I also feared it may tarnish my love of the band too. Fortunately and surprisingly I was not disappointed at all. There were some formulaic events but they were inevitable based on the subject matter, and even then they were done entertainingly. There were definite emotive moments through the film; I only had to look at my girlfriend's tears of sorrow and of joy to know that much. We both came out of the cinema having being entertained and probably like so many other people, instantly put Queen on the car stereo.The cast was absolutely fantastic; I've seen other reviews which suggest that Rami Malek carried this film. I agree that his performance was mammoth, but I wouldn't say he carried it alone. The actors playing other band members were all equally fantastic, adopting mannerisms I've seen in the real band since being a fan.I normally write very elaborate reviews about films but I found myself not looking for plot hole or CGI failures in this, I was just that gripped and blown away that I sat back and enjoyed the ride. This film managed to suspend my disbelief, which is something a lot of films have failed to do over the years. What the Hell have the critics that slated this film being watching?!

Rami could so easily have played Freddie as a 'caricature' but really does embody the soul of Freddie,"Like most kids in the 80's, Freddie was my hero growing up. He seemed to embody all that was bright, colourful and confident. The songs of queen were theatrical, thoughtful and most of all they rocked.He was 'different' like I was, but unlike me he was proud of his individuality, where I was nervous and shy. He seemed to show that you could be different to the rest and celebrate that fact. He lived to sing and his passion for music and connecting with people through his rare gift was such an inspiration. When he died I, like millions of others was heartbroken.To capture the many different sides of the unique and mercurial Freddie seemed like an impossible feat.Rami could so easily have played Freddie as a 'caricature' but really does embody the soul of Freddie (almost eerily so at times!) with all its contradictions and complexities, and I'll be very surprised If he doesn't get an Oscar for his portrayal.As a lifelong Queen fan I realise I'm biased, but the musical scenes throughout the film were also so exciting. I've not felt such unbridled joy from a film in a long time.And although the film has been panned by some as 'inaccurate,' most of the claims are for very minute dates and timings that take nothing away from the overall feel and spirit of the film.And what a film it is.

A wonderful tribute to Queen and Freddie Mercury,"Going in to see ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" I had no idea what to expect. On one hand, critics gave it mixed reviews at best. On the other, it earned $51 million during opening weekend (according to Deadline) and received 8.4 stars on IMDb. Whatever I expected, I most certainly did not anticipate turning up to the theater only to find literally every single seat sold out in the entire theater except one. And I saw it four days after it came out!
There's no denying ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" has nearly become a cultural phenomenon, despite barely being out a month. From giving new life to the classic Queen hits to fueling people's fascination with the enigmatic legend that was Freddie Mercury, this film was a long time coming (and rightly so!) But did it live up to the hype? Sort of. The film was incredibly strong in some parts, weak in others.
The main issues lie with the beginning of the film, the pacing and the film's focus. At the start of the film, rather than a slow start gradually introducing us to Freddie and the rest of the band in kind, we are immediately launched into Freddie joining the band and producing hits with them; they release their smash-hit ""Killer Queen"" less than 15 minutes into the film. This issue ties into the focus of the film: is this a movie about Freddie? Or the origins about Queen? Is it about their journey to the top of the charts? Or is it about the band members' personal struggles? This issue could have been fixed one of two ways: either focusing a lot more on the band as a whole at the beginnings of their career, or cutting the opening entirely, merely introducing us to the band after they have already become famous. This would have clarified the themes a lot more and made it feel less convoluted.
In addition, the pacing is difficult to keep up with. As I mentioned, the movie starts at lightning speed, taking Queen from a college band to an international hit-maker within a matter of minutes. Around the halfway mark however, the movie slows to a near halt, examining Freddie's personal life in great detail and at great length. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated a deeper, more introspective take on Freddie, but this once again made the film confusing and muddied the director's intentions.
There was, however, a great deal the film did right. Most outstanding was Rami Malek's at times charming, at times perplexingly weird, yet altogether captivating performance as the incomparable lead singer of Queen. He gives the character his all, bringing charisma, quirks, and above all a real humanity that every actor aspires to bring to his or her character.
In addition, the look of the film was exquisite: the color, the costumes, the sets, the unique camera techniques all perfectly complimented the mood. Not only did the look excellently capture the 70s/80s nostalgia the film was so clearly aiming for, it also highlighted the confusion, the glory, the frustration and the triumphs so common in the lives of these rockstars. It really put the audience in the minds of Queen; it brought dimension, depth and genuine empathy from the audience.
One of the most notably good aspects of the movie: it's funny. It's so funny. This film has no pretense of being some jaw-dropping, epic, greatest-movie-of-all-time drama; it perfectly balances its more poignant moments with jokes that had the entire theater roaring with laughter.
All in all, ""Bohemian Rhapsody's"" comedy, its music and its endearing portrayals keep the film an entertaining audience pleaser through and through despite its flaws.
The overall best thing about the movie, however: the hair. Absolutely brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

Bohemian Rhapsody (2018),"Another film I'm late to review, I wondered if I should even bother reviewing Bohemian Rhapsody, simply because I have nothing fresh to add the wave of mediocre and decent reviews but nonetheless here we are.The film isn't anything special, there are definitely special aspects such as the subject matter and Rami Malek's committed performance but the overall outcome is a sadly mundane biopic that doesn't have the extra star power to make this viewing nothing more then ordinary.The performances are decently committed with Malek of course being the highlight but one should not forget Gwilym Lee and Lucy Boynton who are arguably the backbone of the entire picture. Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Ace Bhatti and Tom Hollander also are worthy of mention with their solid supporting roles.Technically it's a solid film yet again nothing really special of mentioning. Live Aid and perhaps this is because I was not of the generation wasn't as epic and stunning as previously reported, especially with some dodgy cgi work.The entire picture just fell a bit flat, some scenes were so heavily edited (not the musical sequences which were edited to perfection) but the more intimate moments between characters just couldn't help but cut back and forth for honestly quite pointless reaction shots when they should've just let the camera hold for a little longer without cutting.I also wanted to know more, instead of fleshing out (arguably the more boring aspects of Queen's rise) the film decides to just fall into biopic cliches. Before writing this review I took a look at the many inaccuracies the film provided and it's just a tad shameful.A film about Freddie Mercury needs to be a film that Mercury himself would be rushing to see, yes the performances are decent, the music of course is great but that's thanks to the band., the film arguably doesn't deserve the music provided by the great band.I do need to give credit where it's due, the picture went through a hell of production woes and it's a damn good achievement that a film this cohesive is even on our screens but all in all Mr Mercury wouldn't be rushing to see this anytime soon and I can understand why.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

"Great music, good acting, not-so-good script","Anybody who sees this movie will surely have a good time, but by no means is it a consistently strong film. For the lows of this movie, let's start with the script. The dialogue is a mix of cliche one-liners with some ""heartfelt"" moments that don't have enough impact on the film. This means, it doesn't dive deep into the more romantically dynamic life that Freddie had. Although this was NOT the intention of the movie, clearly the writers struggled to make each aspect of Freddie's chaotic life more meaningful. Also, some of the CGI effects were weak, most notably during live aid. To finish off with the cons, his teeth were cartoonishly large and should not have gotten as much attention as they did. For the pros, Rami Malek completely aced his part as Freddie Mercury! He was able to show his conflicting emotions with still highlighting the frontman's flamboyant and godly persona on stage. The crew did develop the character exceedingly well and Malek convinced the audience that Mercury was a one-off, that is for sure. Lucy Boynton also played her part very well, and was certainly the highlight of Freddie's ""personal life"" scenes. The rest of the band also crushed their roles and gave justice to the uniqueness of Queen and their music. Also, the cinematography deserves attention. I found the creative use of camera angles and effects very impressive. This could've easily been annoying and even distracting at times, but only added to my interest in the film. Of course, the music is phenomenal and despite what others have said, I didn't notice any problem with bringing his Freddie's voice to stage. I think this editing and mixing job was done very well. Lastly, does this movie do Queen justice? Yes, I think it does it's job at celebrating Queen and their achievements. No, it was not made to sweep the awards season, it was made to celebrate Freddie Mercury's life, and I think it does just that.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

I love this movie. The critics who panned it should find new careers.,"Queen has been a part of much of my life.
In the late 70s in elementary school the Stomp Stomp Clap with the chorus We Will Rock You was just something we did at every sporting event.
In 1981, at 13, my father took me to see Queen at the Montreal Forum in 1981. I was mesmerized. I had seen concerts before but this is the one that sticks with me more than most.
Then there was live aid in 1985... wow.I say this to explain that I was very reluctant to watch any film that didn't measure up to those memories.When the film came out some of the reviews I read were not great... those critics either do not know anything about music or do not know anything about movies or more likely both and should find new careers. They were fundamentally wrong.This movie sets a new high mark for a biopic about music. Rami Malek disappears into the role and channels Mercury in a way that is eerie. The rest of the cast is stellar as well.There was admittedly an unavoidable glitch dispite an excellent performance by Aidan Gillen when you can't help but think ""Hey it's Littlefinger"" but it's soon forgotten.But seriously see the movie and apparently don't ever listen to critics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
A fitting movie for the legendary Queen,"I am old enough to remember seeing the music video for Bohemian Rhapsody on its first release, as a young child it both scared and fascinated me. My Mum was a big Queen fan, so the band was always part of my childhood. And so it was great to watch this biographical movie. Most of the focus is on leader singer Freddie Mercury, born Farrokh Bulsara, and is played by Rami Malek. I didn't realise until afterwards that Malek was an American actor, he nails the British accent. Freddie was known for his large teeth, I thought that they were over emphasised to a degree by Malek, at times he looked more Mr Hyde than Mercury! Freddie was hugely talented, arguably the greatest front man of all time, but he also had much sadness in his life. This film manages to capture this, very sad at times, plus there are a few historical inaccuracies but ultimately there is much feel good factor, especially the 1985 Live Aid concert in London. The plot is captivating, the 134 minute running time passes effortlessly. Essential viewing for fans of rock music.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"

However, the second part of the movie that depicts Freddie's mustache phase is something that blew me away. This is where Rami somehow morphs into Freddie.

The Movember Blockbuster of the year!!,"This is probably one of my favourite films of the year and while far from a perfect movie I do have no major problems with it. Yes there are some things which I will get into but all in all It's good and If you like Queen go see it. OK! There! I've done a short outline for you guys; if you are too impatient to read the rest at least you know my thoughts now go away.I like Queen as any sane person does and I found this movie to be a realistic, although a little overdramatic, portrayal of their ups and downs culminating in their Live Aid performance. The film did not focus on Mercury too much and instead looked at the band as a whole. I thought this was a good choice as many other documentaries about Queen usually focus on Mercury and that's it.
This was clearly a choice that Brian May and Roger Taylor, who produced the film, made to show the band as a collaborative effort. You really get the feeling that all the members of the band were great songwriters in their own way. The film does explore Mercury's sexuality problems and touches on his home life as well which I thought was a little rushed and not in depth as it should be. I think the main focus here is the band relationship and not the individuals.For the most part all the scenes do seem genuine and flow very well in the narrative. There are, however, a few moments brought straight out of shlock Hollywood films and that is something I wasn't too impressed with. For instance there's a scene with Bohemian Rhapsody being made that is a bit corny. This is not a major critique however and isn't a spoiling moment.The performance by Rami Malik as Fred is just wonderful and so realistic at times that I felt completely amerced in the movie. I loved Malik in MR. ROBOT and here he does a stella job bringing a beloved icon to life. The other members of the band were played well by their respective actors. Gwilym Lee was great as Brian May and I did also love the guy who played John Deacon as well.The draw of the movie will be the music and getting to know the stories behind some famous songs by Queen like ""Another one bites the dust"" and ""love of my life"". All the songs featured were sung by Malik as well which is very impressive and he himself does a great cover of Mercury.I loved the music in this and thought that It was interesting how some of the time it is integrated into scenes of the bands life whilst other times it is sung onstage by Malik himself. This gives the feeling that the music is the most integral part of the story which, for a film about a band, is essential.As said I have no problems with this film and it is definitely a great watch with an emotional tread of friendship running through the story. I would recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to love Queen to see it......but it helps.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Bohemian Rhapsody is a fun concert movie!,"8.4/10I don't care if some parts were inaccurate or whatever and I don't care if it isn't a masterpiece in filmmaking. I had a blast watching this movie!I don't know how true the story is to what really happened. But I don't mind at all cause let's be honest, we all watched this film for two reasons; to see how this legendary band made the most legendary songs of all time and to experience a glimpse of what it was like to be in a Queen concert.The Queen themselves really gave the producers a big head-start with this film, just the amount of iconic songs that Queen made is historic. And it absolutely carries this movie. Every time you're about to get bored or it kind of slows down, you're immediately jolted into excitement and joy because when you hear the music.Of course, the performances in this film were great too. Casting popped off because everyone in this looks exactly like their real life counterparts. Especially Rami Malek who was brilliant in this, he absolutely embodied Freddie Mercury in a way no one else in all of time will ever be able to. Not just him but all the actors for the band; Brian May, John Dean and Roger Taylor, they all crushed it. The chemistry between them was so much fun to watch, everyone felt real and each had their own personality which all meshed well together. Could watch hours of just interacting with one another.Obviously, the buildup of this film is the live AID performance and it absolutely paid off. Utterly jealous of the people who were born early enough to attend that concert.Overall, a fun movie to watch for everyone cause who doesn't like Queen? With great performances and good cinematography, maybe not a 1 for 1 depiction but still a joy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Very disappointed!,"I don't usually write reviews but I felt like I should write one for this movie watching it 2 years after its initial release. In my opinion this movie doesn't really have a story to tell. The only thing that kept me from leaving the movie all together was all the excitement I was getting from Queen's songs. I really like Rami Malek as an actor but he did NOT do a great Freddie Mercury. His British accent was way off and 70 percent of the time was just American! Among the other British actors, it was really obvious Rami Malek cannot pull off playing a British character. Overall, I was very disappointed watching this movie. The Oscars have really become too political, otherwise Rami Malek simply did not deserve to win an Oscar for this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Hideous tribute,Painfully boring. Overacted puppeteered and dull. Only wanted to stop watching in order to go listen to the original music. Those 2 hours are too long a yawn.,4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Amazing,"Rami Maleks performance was absolutely breathtaking. I have never written a review before. This movie deserved all of the accolades. I have seen this movie many times and didn't realize Rami was not actually singing. A true artist, well deserving of the Oscar! Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Excellent,"The film brought so many emotions - laughter, sadness, joy - very heart warming.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
and the best dentist goes to....,"So artlessly scripted, especially when it tries to be artful, that it seems determined to be as generic as possible-this is rock stardom Disneyfied. To the extent that it's ""for the fans"", it's to try and improve on concert footage by juicing it with Hollywood production values. So if it's just bland hagiography of something everyone already likes, what's the harm? Then again, what's the point?",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"Rami, you've made yourself a huge fan","I am not a fan of Queen, but Rami's outstanding performance is what made the film really great. Even if you aren't sure if you should watch it or not, just do it because of his brilliant acting skill.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
It's a kind of magic!,"Could not give this a better review, brilliant cast and great story.Goes through all major elements of Freddie's life and Rami Malek portrays the character brilliantly - definitely deserves the best actor Oscar 2019. First time watching it since purchasing and won't be long till I watch it again.Great to learn that queen had assisted in the development of this title... adds a touch of historical magic to the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
Exciting movie.,"This movie is great. I loved the way the actors, the costumes and the music made this film fun and exciting.
It's by director Bryan Singer and this story focuses on the life of Freddie Mercury who was the lead singer of the rock band ""Queen"". Rami Malek's performance was brilliant.
I saw Bohemian Rhapsody three months ago with my family and we loved it. I highly recommend it, so try to see it if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
"This is beautiful. The 12-part documentary is over ---> there, somewhere.","I had no intention of seeing this in theatres, until my wife booked it as a 41st birthday date night.How could anyone possibly pretend to be Freddie Mercury? This movie will surely be a sad, cringeworthy, awful disaster, right?Rami Malek quickly set me right about that misconception!I think this movie was intended to be *A* Freddie Mercury & Queen story, not THE DEFINITIVE and encyclopedic Freddie Mercury and Queen documentary that some critics seemed to be expecting.This is a band that brought a message of fun, irreverence, a bit of slightly edgy sexiness, but always an overarching goodness, at a time when homosexuality was still technically a criminal offense in my country, and ""gay"" was a byword for ""stupid"" or ""disgusting"" even among children.Their songs are bangers that you want to sing along to, but there are poignant moments in them too.This film does a beautiful job of recapturing that spirit, while telling a reader's digest condensed version of their story that seems to get the bits that matter right. These guys made our world a bit better than it would have been without them, this movie celebrates that while filling in enough interesting behind-the-scenes gaps that someone like myself with only average knowledge of their off-stage story will walk out feeling like I not only know more about them, but I understand them better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Music"
