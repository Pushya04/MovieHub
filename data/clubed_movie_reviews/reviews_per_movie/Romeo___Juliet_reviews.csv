A Fever Dream of Teenage Intensity,"Like many who saw this as a teenager, this was a movie that felt like the most sophisticated thing I'd ever seen, while also being accessible enough to my immature brain. And that's pretty much how I'm going to judge it today.This is Shakespeare. It's as much Shakespeare as any other adaptation over the centuries. And yet Baz Luhrmann went in with a very specific approach, not only to modernise it while maintaining the poetic dialogue, but to also make it enticing for a teenage audience; the audience most arguably suited to the tale of Romeo and Juliet. It's chock full of the same hallmarks of modern day teen dramas; beautiful teens from wealthy families, sudden and passionate love affairs, with a dash of violence and murder, capped off with an emotional gut-punch or two. It's a tale quite literally as old as time: Star-crossed lovers finding each other against all odds, fighting to keep what they have against the forces around them, and the near-miss of longevity, like every Rom-Com airport scene. It's the type of story that has endured so long precisely because it appeals to us at the most emotional and vulnerable time of our lives, speaking to how we feel about the world around us. It's a hormonal barrage of narrative cues.So Luhrmann takes this timeless classic, and decides to transplant it into a modern day setting to appeal to modern day teenagers. Or at least, the teenagers of the late 90s. You could probably trace a line from all late-90s fashions back to this movie, either creating the stereotypical aesthetic of the time, or merely doubling down and reinforcing it. This movie is garish. It opens with a newscast acting as the narrator, followed by quick-cuts and flybys of a city centre framed by two imposing skyscrapers, each with the name of a respected mafia-like family conglomerate plastered over the roof. Between them is a giant statue of Jesus himself, almost as tall as these skyscrapers. It's almost cartoonish in its aesthetic. We're then introduced to the Montague boys, clad in Hawaiian shirts left open to flap in the wind, riding a bright yellow topless jeep. They pull up to a gas station and encounter the rival Capulet boys, clad in dark blues and leather, with clean-cut facial hair and a menacing glare. If the Montagues gave the instant impression of good guys having fun, the Capulets give the immediate impression of brooding and serious antagonists. After an exchange of insults, they break out in a gun fight. The saturation is turned way up, the camera shakes and zooms uncontrollably, the editing cuts every second or two. It's beautiful and ugly all at the same time, as Tybalt, the Prince of Cats falls on his knees dramatically, pulls out his pistols, attaches an excessive sight, and takes aim at the fleeing Montagues. It's big, it's bombastic, it's completely lacking in subtlety. There's bright colours and shouting, and emphasis put on every footstep and gun cocking. It's so bad. It's so 90s.Fortunately this style isn't maintained throughout the movie's runtime, but it never entirely leaves either. We get another frenetic array to the Capulet party, whereby a sexually-ambiguous Mercutio laces Romeo with Ecstasy creating a fever dream of visuals. And then there's that iconic meet-cute. The meet-cute to end all meet-cutes. And the movie slows to a halt. It remembers this isn't a story about the outlandish gang war between two mafia families, but a story about teenage love. Its garish and frenetic nature gives way to something more brooding and enthralling. Things turn serious, characters start dying, the prospect of marriage and a new life become real entities.Judging this movie literally is a recipe for disaster. Literally it's an over-edited series of scenes full of shouting and bad judgment, about a young boy and girl falling in love immediately, getting married the next day, and then committing suicide over one another a mere four days later. Literally this movie makes no sense. It's ridiculous. But the movie knows that. It's painfully self-aware of how ridiculous this story actually is when you boil it down, so it embraces it. And this is why the prose was kept largely intact: It's poetry. The whole movie is poetry. This isn't a movie about plot points and character development. It's a movie about feelings and moments, about capturing that teenage urgency in a glowing, multi-coloured bottle. I know I had these moments as a teenager, where everything felt like the most important thing ever, where I fell in love with pretty girls without even knowing their names, where anger and joy, love and hate were all so painfully intense. Every scene is bathed in this intensity, including that opening of garish colours and overemphasised sound effects. It's a movie so chock full of hormonal energy it's intoxicating.Leo is still a fairly young and inexperienced actor here, and his ego shines through his performance. He delivers his lines which such ferocity, like he too felt he was participating in the most sophisticated thing he'd ever done. But at this level his line delivery loses all emphasis, causing it all to merge into a mumble of Shakespearian vocabulary. That said, he's just about as perfect for Romeo as you could get. Claire Danes doesn't fare much better, seemingly struggling with the emotions of it all. It's like they were both put on auto-pilot while delivering their lines. Honestly I can't really blame them. Shakespeare's dialogue is in poetic verse, written for a different time with different dialects and slangs. We the audience are encouraged to just feel what's going on rather than follow and dissect every single word spoken. That said there are some genuinely fantastic performances her that prove that dialogue as outdated and wordy as this can be engaging and emotive. Harold Perrineau plays Mercutio with a fire in his eyes, like he poured over the script and accurately pinpointed which words needed more emphasis, and where he could embellish with gestures and intonation. John Leguizamo is also electrifying as Tybalt, grasping the over-the-top antagonism of his character and having fun with it, creating a whole new style of gun-fu to portray Tybalt's apparent fancy fighting style.And of course, I couldn't talk about this movie without talking about the soundtrack, which gave us one of the best Radiohead songs ever written (which is a bold claim, I know). It captures the 90s the same way the rest of the movie does, with OK Computer-era Radiohead, Garbage, Des'ree, Butthole Surfers, and The Cardigans. It's rocky, it's ravey, it's as garish and frenetic as the movie's cinematography, and if you're at all a fan of 90s pop music, this soundtrack is a snapshot of that exact taste. Of course this ages the movie horrendously, but hey, we're approaching the time of 90s nostalgia, so now's the time to embrace it.Romeo + Juliet is an interesting movie to judge, because it's a strictly terrible movie. The modern setting and 16th century dialogue goes together as well you'd imagine, despite some imaginative transpositions (like each gun's brand being a type of blade; Sword 9mm, Dagger .45, Rapier 9mm, or in the case of shotguns; a Longsword). It's so intensely bright and colourful, the editing so frenetic and hard to follow, and the story being somewhat nonsensical by modern standards, but its self-awareness makes up for it, making it all feel deliberate and purposeful. We hold Shakespeare up on a pedestal these days, as some form of high art, but in his time he was basically writing the best soap operas, aimed at entertaining the commoners (the exact same trajectory as actual operas, incidentally, which are nowhere near as sophisticated or intelligent as modern high society would have you believe). With that in mind, and Luhrmann's attempt to make what Shakespeare would've made today (in 1996), I think this movie nails every goal it aims for. It's pure visual poetry, encouraging you to feel the story than follow it intently, blasting you with the intense emotional highs and lows of hormonal teenagedom. I give Romeo + Juliet a bizarrely successful 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leo is stunning,"As a 12 yo girl I don't understand Shakespeare one bit. It's like a different language that u just get bored of trying to translate. But this movie - I understood every bit of it. And I loved it. Why is there all this hate? Especially for Leonardo, his performance was beautiful and I'm not just saying that bcs of his face but it was genuinely moving and Clare Danes was great in it too. It's not the greatest movie I've ever seen no. But in 2021 I don't care if this movie is gonna change my life or not or if it's a masterpiece or a flop, I wanna watch a movie that I'll be entertained by and moved by. And that was this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A mixed bag attempt to a classic story,"It's not often that I've seen a movie three times and I can't give it a rating any higher then a 6.I think I really tried and forced myself to like this since I can appreciate the modernization of this old story and the creativeness that was attempted.Maybe it's unfair to say this movie is hard to follow. The dialogue is obviously a challenge for any inexperienced viewer but the story is familiar and each scene makes sense even if you're struggling to understand what each actor says. That being said, it's nothing special. Each time I finish watching this movie I just feel like it's ok. There is no gut wrenching impact it has left on me and I can probably affirmatively confirm this now after the third viewing. It's an interesting movie, a bold, perhaps unnecessary, punk-like remake that swaps swords with guns and also attempting humour. A part of movie history to say the least.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

overwhelming Baz Luhrmann style,Baz Luhrmann injects his brash style into Shakespeare's famous play. It's the modern world in a place called Verona. The two families of Capulets and Montagues are powerful corporate giants with gun totting thugs. Claire Danes plays Juliet Capulet and Leonardo DiCaprio plays Romeo Montague. There is no doubt that this is one of the more unique interpretations. Luhrmann throws every visual flashiness at the audience. He's pumped up the material with so many bells and whistles that the story feels overwhelmed. The music choice sometimes grades on my nerves. The leads are an adorable pairing. I wish Luhrmann has some more faith in the actors to allow them some peace and quiet to do their work. They do good work in the balconey scene but Luhrmann can't stop moving. The flash and glitz becomes more of a distraction.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Irreconcilable Differences...,"A marriage of old and new that's easily divorced from modern reality and therefore doesn't work when regurgitated verbatim in contemporary times. Great actors doing what it says on the side of their tin, allowing them to revel in their ruffs and blusher, imaginative in other aspects too but ultimately, however, a snake in their tights that cascades them back to square one - some things soak, marinate and mature others decay, corrode and compost, the catalyst of the ye olde moment, cannot always be preserved and translated into thy modernity.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare Worthy,"Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play.  This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue.  All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.).  One of the best shakespeare adaptations in the multitude of which have entered the cinemas in the past few years.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Just as Good as the Original, by which I mean not Very Good","This is one of the corniest films I've ever seen and I can't decide whether that's intentional or not, everything from the editing to the sound design feels like it's some dumb action film and this works brilliantly in the opening scene, a great action set piece. The scene revels in this corniness and it works perfectly to create an atmosphere of care free fun, the film really falls down for me though when it try's to move in a more earnest, heartfelt, direction. The film continues feeling like a dumb action film but has characters spouting long monologues about love and life all in the original old English, this messes up the mood of the film for me and brings it crashing down into what feels like a pretentious mess. The acting is alright though and it is better than some of the versions that stick more diligently to the original story, still it could have been a lot better if they'd strayed further from Shakespeare's original story which I don't think holds up nowadays. 7/10 :)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pointless,"I'll give Baz Luhrman credit for the creative idea for a remake, but it didn't pay off. This is a half-modernisation of Romeo + Juliet - it takes place in the modern era (good idea) but they still speak in Shakespearean English (bad idea). This is so distracting and bizarre that it is hard to watch the film.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful Modernization of Shakespeare's Classic Play,"The amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to re-do Shakespeare's famous tragedy in a modern setting while still retaining its original dialogue. What's even more amazing is it works. I admit that I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie, fearing that Luhrman had either destroyed the play's beauty and power by setting it in modern times, or had butchered Shakespeare's eloquent words by making them sound more modern. I was wrong. Almost everything about this movie is just incredible.Luhrman brilliantly casted Claire Danes as fourteen-year-old Juliet. The actress certainly looks the part, with her youthful features and innocent eyes. More importantly, she acts the part. Ms. Danes almost flawlessly captures Juliet's distressing journey from childhood to womanhood, beautifully showing her dramatic transition which had taken toll on her during her five day relationship with Romeo. When the story begins, Juliet is a naive girl, having not yet experienced true love, and by the end we can clearly see just how much her love for Romeo has deepened in passion, and how dramatically her character has developed.Leanardo DeCaprio's Romeo was almost equally impressive. Some of his recitations of Shakespeare made me cringe, but for the most part he was perfect. One of Romeo's most important characteristics in the play is the intensity of his emotions, and DeCaprio captures this feature incredibly. Romeo is brash and impulsive, with a tendency to act on the heat of the moment rather than to first consider the situation like the more levelheaded Juliet. This unfortunate characteristic, which played a huge role in leading up to the lovers' tragic fate, is wonderfully mastered by DeCaprio and retained throughout the film. But we also, like with Juliet, get a glimpse of his character's development. At the beginning of the play Romeo is a hopeless romantic who fantasizes of love, and seems to dwell more in his daydreamed world than actually on earth. At this point he has no idea what true love really is, he only thinks he does. It is not until he meets Juliet that he can begin to comprehend the true depth and passion of love. DeCaprio triumphs in this area as well.The other actors are superb, and wonderfully portray their characters as Shakespeare intended. But what really impressed me was, as I stated earlier, the keeping of Shakespeare's original dialogue in Luhrman's modern setting. I know some people criticize this film for destroying the romance and beauty of Shakespeare's words by setting the story in modern day Verona, but I feel that it only made the film more romantic. What Luhrman did was both bold and brilliant, and he succeeded wonderfully.I won't speak any more of the brilliance of this film, I just highly recommend you see it as soon as possible. If you're a fan of Shakespeare like me, I think you will enjoy this hip, yet still lovely, modernization of his most famous play ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good movie with some minor flaws,"Well, this is the MTV version of Romeo and Juliet. I honestly really can't stand Claire Daine's acting. I think she really sucks. But over all, her and Leonardo do heat up the scenes. There were some things I questioned about. Like the fight scene between Mercutio and Tybolt. Their fight was supposed to be playful like. Not all over dramatic. Not till the end is it supposed to be dramatic.They didn't really get into the Paris's character. And I didn't really feel the effect of the prince, it seemed like he was a father trying to disapline his children more then protecting the law. The Capulet's party, that's something I could go on and on about.But I have to say, it was an interesting approach to an excellent play done by da man, Shakespeare. I saw this in the theater in 1996, and loved it at first. But then I realized it could of been done better. But it's still worth a watch.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's not for me! I just hated it!,"After only watching a few minutes of this adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, I couldn't take much more of it. It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"I wouldnt change a thing. The acting was beautiful, the scenery, the costumes, the raw emotion. The best version of this tale yet.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Intriguing and clever, but maybe too clever","I like cross-period staging for Shakespeare - like Ian McKellen's Richard III or Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It always gives a good perspective on the strength of the underlying story. It can also be said that it gives the director something to do - like a post-WWI staging of Much Ado About Nothing - other than trot out the same costumes as from the last production.I thought this version was very clever, but maybe more clever than it needed to be. The swimming pool scene (in place of the balcony scene), for example, was an inspired choice. The interaction was much more immediate: standing at a balcony is a scene designed for a stage, not for a movie. But the sense of the scene is also lost. By this time in the movie, the two have already fallen in the deepest love they will ever have (whatever that means - lust is more like it), and the action falls from there. But the play implies much more of a process, instead of proof. The balcony scene is that of two lovers parted by circumstance, both literally and figuratively. The meaning is changed, though subtly, and not necessarily for the better.I didn't like many of the start-stop and fast-forward camera tricks, not because they are a bad idea in themselves, but because the style negates the scenes they were intended to augment. I especially did not like the faux dramatic echoing noises. There's no need for these tricks. I also found the second half of the movie to be rather tame in terms of technique. Most of the shots after the swimming pool scene are rather bland and ordinary. It was as if the director had used up all of his tricks and couldn't think of any others.All I can say is thank God that Shakespeare's language was used. Without the language there is no reason for this movie to even be made - it turns the story from a ludicrous mob war to the intriguing version of RJ it is now.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a movie you have to watch every time it is on and belongs both in your movie and music collection.,"Romeo + Juliet (1996) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline is a modern day take on the Shakespearean story in Los Angeles where two rival gangs face off and the children of the gang's leader fall in love causing a toxic situation to only get worse. This movie is directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed), Claire Danes (Homeland), John Leguizamo (Spawn), Pete Postlethwaite (The Usual Suspects), Paul Rudd (Ant-man), Brian Dennehy (First Blood), Paul Sorvino (Goodfellas) and M. Emmet Walsh (Bladerunner). The style of this film is magical in itself even outside the storyline. The entire presentation and plot of the legendary tale is very well told and unfolds uniquely and unpredictably even if everyone knows the story. The action scenes and shootouts are awesome as is the dialogue and soundtrack. The film just oozes style and fun. This is a movie you have to watch every time it is on and belongs both in your movie and music collection. This is an absolute masterpiece and must see that I would score an easy 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo + Juliet,"This is the movie that established Baz Luhrmann was more than just Strictly Ballroom.His second feature is a dazzling bold pop update. Set in gang infested, decaying Verona Beach.

Moderized Without Losing the Shakespeare,"I'm a sucker for William Shakespeare even though I like it done better in the theatre. This one however, kept my attention and seemed to do a great job with modernizing the whole quarreling families thing. The movie kicks off with a street brawl between the Montegues and Capulets. The Prince forewarns them that if they ever disturb the peace again their ""lives will pay the forfeit of the peace."" We are then introduced to the character Romeo who is played by Leonardo DeCaprio. Leo does a great job as Romeo, but that's because Leo is a good actor in this film. Soon after that we are introduced to Juliet who is played by the beautiful Claire Danes, someone I haven't seen in too many movies. Danes does a great job playing the flirty Juliet. The movie follows the original script very accurately. The symbolism is also used very well throughout the movie. If you look at the guns you'll notice that some say sword, some say rapier, and I believe some say dagger. The Montegues always wear a Hawaiian style shirt. The Capulets dress more like mobsters or thugs even though both sides could be viewed as thugs in some sort or another. In either case each family wears a certain kind of clothing that makes it easy to tell who's who. One great part I absolutely love is the party. Juliet wears angel wings and Romeo wears a knight outfit. Romeo's best friend (and I wish I could spell his name but I'd rather not butcher it) dresses up as a women. So to explain this form of symbolics, for those who aren't getting it, it's Romeo is the ""knight in shinning armor,"" Juliet is the angel of Romeo's dreams, and Romeo's best friend is the comic relief. There's other things you'll notice at the party also, like Tybalt wears devil horns(i.e. he's a villain). Both families you'll also notice are rich, which also follows the script accurately. Overall, if you're a Shakespeare fan, a fan of romantic movies, a fan of tragic movies, or a fan of artistic movies then make sure to look into this one. It'll sweep you off you're feet, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you fall in love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"lavish, but not believable","It is not at all believable as a modern story, as things would have happened quite differently than pretended. It does somehow manage to merge the action-movie style with poetry, but one can still feel it's sort of a compromise, a story that is suspended somewhere, in a legendary realm.Even if accepting this deal as proposed, it was still way too loud and people annoyingly shouted their lines all the time. Also, some of the characters are too sketchy or even cartoonish, but we know this is the danger always lurking in Luhrmann's movies.A couple of beautiful scenes though, some lavish, some atmospheric and heavily impregnated with drama, or effectively suggesting cheap modernism. Also, a memorable Mercutio and a nice Juliet.6 and a half from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nope,"It's obvious from the start that ""Romeo + Juliet"" is Baz Luhrmann's stab at making the story relevant to the '90s, and I can appreciate that. Hell, if it weren't for 10th grade English class, who knows if I'd ever try my luck at Shakespeare? He's not the most accessible author around.But the execution is way off. Warring families are updated to street gangs and swords are branded as guns (literally), but the dialogue is strictly Elizabethan era. Those words and the contemporary setting do not mix. At all. It's especially jarring in the opening scenes with the spazzed-out gangbangers. This is a movie packaged for the MTV crowd; the direction's cartoonish, the style frenetic and any soul this story had is lost in translation.It's bad.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An eye-catching, starkly bold and breathtaking update of Shakespeare's greatest work.","This film is incredible. Yes, the play is modernized, and for those who panned the film, I suppose originality was too much to take. Luhrmann stays with the original dialogue, which I believe adds much to the film and gives it authenticity. Therefore it cannot be dismissed as a masterpiece dumbed down to appeal to us easy to please teenagers. The camera work at the most dark parts of the film is quick and choppy, adding to the already potent and ever present depressing, tragic atmosphere. All of the leads were strong, with Danes and DiCaprio having amazing chemistry. In this film DiCaprio wasn't popular yet, so again critics can't say Leo was the draw for this film. Danes was emotionally pure and driven, and this is her best work to date aside from the critical darling, ""My So-Called Life."" No, the leads were cast with good reason - there couldn't have been any better. Supporting roles were wonderful, with the roles of Mercutio and Tybalt being exceptional, and the friar, who may be the most important character in the story, is brought to life by Postalwaithe  The dreamy underwater shots are fantastic. Luhrmann's version of this classic tragedy plays to both a younger and older audience, adding touches such as the names of the guns being the names of swords; and he yet updates the setting, bringing the fantastic Verona, Italy to Verona Beach, Florida. A timeless story such as this makes any criticism of this film unnecessary and foolish; view it with an open mind and you will see the story as Shakespeare wrote it and as Luhrmann envisioned it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The only thing that made the movie worth watching is the freshness of youth and beauty associated with the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes...In this modern-day version of Shakespeare's play, the setting is Verona Beach. The Capulets and the Montagues, two families that have always hated each other, have constant feuds, but this does not stop Romeo, a Montague, from falling in love with the beautiful Juliet, a Capulet. However, a television presenter announces that this deep love will end up generating tragic consequences, due to this insane family rivalry.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poetry to Visual Affect,"This is not Shakespeare's best play, but it has his best poetry; that's because the play is ABOUT language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. So among the plays, this may be one of the hardest to film. But alas it suffers from another blessing which is also a curse: the story itself is so powerful that one can build any sort of film or play or whatever around it and have it be likely to work. Thus, we often lose the language.Zefrelli made his own choices in the earlier film; these were relatively conventional. While it cut some valuable language, sacrificed to the gods of contemporary patience, it is by far the better version. But here we have some interesting choices.First the setting. Italians to Shakespeare's England were a comical people, and his setting of the play there would have encouraged the audience to bring heavy stereotypes to the drama. Latins in his day were considered: Foppish: Quick to violence (a stereotype that has been inherited by blacks today, but to Londoners, Italians were nearly Africans): Incredibly proud especially as regards slights to masculinity: Obsessed with weapons.Today, we roll those up under the relatively crude notion of stupid Latin macho. In this film, the director has exaggerated the Latin macho ethic to have the same effect 16th century Londoners would get. It works because these stereotypes are powerful memes which attract many hosts which perpetuate their underlying truth. Baz adds the additional dimension of the people being captured by the superstitious underbelly of the Church.He deliberately straddles the border between apparent truth and satire. These Latins are superficial visually and not verbally. So here is the solution to the problem on how to make a film (which is primarily a visual medium) out of a play that leverages poetic language. The solution is to convert all the metaphors from language to vision. Hence the much-noted lack of poetry. I imagine Baz directing the players to not worry so much about the poetry.Both Romeo and Juliet are incapable of performing the poetry anyway: they are children learning on the job. And what acting skill they have from film is all in the face, not the tongue. They are pretty enough though.I like this film for its boldness. Some of the experiment works since we get the message of the difference between what we see and what is true. This is why Juliet has to see a LIVE Romeo at the end. Living under water is used to good effect. But in the real play, there are so many and such subtle explorations of the theme, and these are scoured away here for a few broad effects. The real message, which comes through loud and clear if you know the play (or even Zefrelli's film) is not the distance between the reality of events and the language, but the reality of the richness of the real play and this film. Equally vast. Equally powerful statement. So we have a playhouse with the back part blasted out to the sea.As a separate matter, the play has three anchors: Mercutio, the Friar and the Nurse. These are handled interestingly here.The Friar is an alchemical master hiding under the cloak of the Church. The play equates the magic of language with the magic of potions, equally deadly. The congruence is lost in this film, but Baz definitely gets the magic part as well as the superfluous ritual of the church. This friar is a terrific, memorable performance of someone who believes he can defeat nature. Serves as an anchor as intended.The Nurse is the true domestic, raw nature, full of uncompromised loyalty but ultimately compromised. Her character is lost here. We NEED to know about the dead sister and why the nurse turns on Juliet in order to save her life. Baz fails here, and so provides no center. For Shakespeare, she's the white space on the palette.Mercutio in the play is a emotionally engaged visionary mystic. We understand that Romeo and Mercutio studied magic (`philosophy') abroad together much as Hamlet and Horatio had. The dream they shared the night before is the axis of the whole action: rather like the magic of the witches in Macbeth. Baz gets this as well: Modern magic is what? Drugs. So Hamlet is given a psychotropic by Mercutio before going to the party. Works for me, because it allows everything to be visually blasted and inexorably tragic. The whole thing after the party is a trip, see? It is why they can meet, become entranced and arrange marriage after an hour or two. (Remember that until this point Romeo is hopelessly smitten by Roseline.)Anyone who wrestles with problems of filming the Bard and comes out alive deserves my respect. This is a weird interpretation, but that's the point.",,Anonymous,Romance
Modern Shakespeare,"The most popular love story in history, William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, converted to modern day sets. The director and writer of the movie decided to handle the conflicts between modern day sets and Shakespeare's original texts with the means of comedy. This was not necessarily a bad idea, since Shakespeare may be somewhat boring at times, and small humorous bits make the movie..well, less boring. But the result was, that Luhrmann almost turned the love story of all times into the comedy of the year. The movie is by no means bad, but it does not have the spirit of Shakespeare's texts. This movie is a disgrace to the original play, but if one is able to ignore this fact, one can see this movie as a brilliant love story. Well, of course it is, it's Shakespeare after all, so the story is exceptional. Leonardo DiCaprio shows yet again that he is not just a pretty boy, but he can act, too! His performance is brilliant, and Clare Danes' is amazing, also. So a movie with wonderful acting performances and an exceptional script can't be bad, but there's just a tad too much humor involved, this story does not need that. I can't help myself, I am comparing the movie to the original play, so I think the movie is not that great.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare made sexy for the teen generation.,"Everyone is familiar with William Shakespeare's boy-meets-girl love story, and it has already been interpreted into films, plays, TV adaptations and songs. But Baz Luhrmann gives this world-known love story a modern-day twist, setting it in Verona Beach, and piling on the religious imagery. The result is quite spectacular.Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes play the star-crossed lovers, and, whilst the latter is sadly a little bland, never truly convincing us in her portrayal of Juliet's loss of innocence or torment of feelings towards the foe, DiCaprio completely redeems her performance. He is a revelation. His Romeo is a wonderful mix of sad eloquence, a loving heart and a troubled soul, and all these elements come together beautifully in a performance hotter than a pepper sprout, with more layers than the proverbial onion. He is the very embodiment of sexy in his role. There is an extremely alluring way in which his character is filmed, which only enhances Romeo as a lover. This is epitomized in the opening shot of him, where the Leo is illuminated illustriously against the sunlight, and Radiohead's languid, sexy tune ""Talk Show Host"" plays.The film itself has ""sexy"" written all over it, and, with the Gen X teenagers as his target audience, I don't think Luhrmann would have things any other way. But, unlike with that atrocity Moulin Rouge!, with Romeo + Juliet, the over-stylization is appropriate, making the movie more accessible to teens, for example, through gun warfare rather than swordplay, and the canny symbolisation of Queen Mab as a drug. But perhaps the most ingenious stylistic technique here is the slap-in-face Shakespearean references, which range from a ball called the Merchant of Venice, to 'Such stuff as dreams are made on' from The Tempest, making the film an absolute goldmine for trivia fans.Style aside, there is more than enough substance. Romeo is presented exactly as the play does  at first, the mawkish, gawky, lovesick teenager, then, the fickle boy, and finally, the devoted and caring lover, and much of this loyalty to the play is due to the screenplay from Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, which maintains the original memorable dialogue and descriptions, but also dares to stray from the sidewalk in some of the plot turns, and the film completely benefits from it. The set designs are intricate and beautiful, and suit every frame of the film perfectly, and the icing on the cake is the music. Craig Armstrong's score for the swimming pool scene is as stunning as it is original, and the use of non-original music, from Kym Mazelle to The Cardigans, give the film the added edge of cool, making Romeo + Juliet one of the boldest, sassiest and most unforgettable adaptations to date, and English Lit. GCSE has been made far more digestible for us kids across England. It's what Shakespeare would have wanted. A-.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Baz Luhrmann is the Master of Interpretation,"Prior to watching ""Romeo and Juliet"", I had seen ""Moulin Rouge"" a few times and loved it. Luhrmann took an opera by Puccini (""La Boheme"") and made a great tale of it, with music and visuals that will blow your mind. (""Rent"" is also based on ""La Boheme"", but is trite and caters to an audience I am not a part of.) My expectations for ""Romeo and Juliet"" were fairly high, given my admiration of Luhrmann.As you can guess by my 9 out of 10 rating, I was not disappointed. Luhrmann took the classic Shakespeare and super-imposed it over modern day Verona Beach. Like ""Moulin Rouge"" where he took modern rock songs and placed them in 1900 France, here he takes the language of Shakespeare and places it in the contemporary. Rather than simply changing the dialog to modern usage, he gave the text its due.This works incredibly well, and makes the film so much better than regular language would. The story seems richer, more epic and most importantly timeless. And the story is the story of love, which is just that: rich, epic and timeless.And the visuals were stunning! The colors set a mood (such as the darkness after Mercutio's death) and there was such vibrancy in the clothing. The water theme resonated well, with great effects of seeing a lover for the first time through a fish tank, the rain falling at key moments, and the film focusing on both a beach and near a swimming pool.Luhrmann knows how to direct John Leguizamo, and I would say this is one of his two best roles (the other being ""Moulin Rouge""). Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) shows great range, much more so than in other roles he's had since (""The Matrix"" or TV's ""Lost""). And this is probably the most un-funny Jamie Kennedy you'll ever see, which I mean in the most positive way.Claire Danes is a delightful Juliet, giving a memorable performance (easily the peak of her career). She is physically perfect for the role, young and beautiful without being overly vulnerable or sexed-up. The only other actress I can picture capable of this kind of role is Julia Stiles, but I can't see her being as much of a fit and she would likely over-act... her Shakespeare style and Luhrmann's are not in synchronicity.The role of Romeo, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was perfect. Nobody could have been better. This isn't the young Leo from before or the rough and rugged Leo that appears in films later on. This is the Leo on the verge of adulthood, but still remaining tender enough to have the youthful idealism of a Romeo. As my co-viewer phrased it, he's a ""babe"" (in more ways than she meant). I know of no other actor who has the acting abilities of Leo, at least not in his age range. He has a long career ahead of him if he can keep up the intensity he has here (as well as in ""The Departed"" and ""Gangs of New York""... though not as much in ""The Beach"").A slight note on the music: As much as I love the Cardigans, I almost think ""Lovefool"" was a poor choice for this film... too poppy. But everything else was great: Butthole Surfers, Everclear, and especially One Inch Punch with the inspired ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". And Garbage, a vastly under-appreciated band, with one of their better tunes, ""#1 Crush"". A great album for a great film.If you haven't seen this film, your life is not complete. I went eleven years avoiding Romeo and Juliet, but having now broken my vow, I am glad I did. This film doesn't just impress, it inspires.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Tacky and obnoxious,"The only thing that I can say about Baz Lurhmann as a director is that he is really good at adapting a classic story and making it incredibly tacky.Perhaps my hatred for unnecessary modernizations of classics has overtaken my opinions, but there is no reason to place a Shakespeararean play and put it in a modern setting unless it's going to be put in some use or say something different from other adaptations. Shakespeare Retold did so and that was why that series worked, but the only reason this movie seems to exist is to appeal to a more shallow audience without any intellectual value whatsoever.What I especially hate about this adaptation is not only how it pays more attention to the romance than it should do the feud between the families, but none of the actors look like they know what they were saying. Lurhmann certainly doesn't, which is made clear when he twists Mercutio's Queen Mab speech from a monologue about the challenges and temptations of lovers to a speech about drugs. If a director can't understand Shakespeare, or even has the nerve to twist his poetry that way, then he shouldn't take on that play in the first place.The actors are vapid, the direction is awful, the editing is terrible, the setting is tacky beyond belief, it's unnecessary and it's just plain insulting to Shakespeare's text.My only hope is that Baz Lurhmann pays more attention in English class before he takes on another classic. In fact, he should just avoid classics and save him a shred of dignity.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gets better every time I watch it, which is a lot!","Watching this again (for the umpteenth time). I have to confess I hated it the first time I saw it. Despised it. Thought it was an abomination and an insult to the work of the Bard. As a young man, I appeared as Tybalt in a local production so I'm deeply invested in this play. But then, I read an interview with Baz Luhrmann in which he made the devastating point that this was written by Shakespeare as a MODERN play and intended to be contemporary and suddenly it all became clear. This is an extraordinary piece of cinema, a work of genius and Will himself would wholeheartedly approve. Leo and Claire are magnificent as is the entire supporting cast (special shout-out to Harold Perrineau as Mercutio). I loved the original play set in the time of Shakespeare but this translates very well into 1990s California. I still well up at the final scene and the dam usually bursts at the final line:

Admittedly, I first watched this movie when it came outbecause of Leo; eight years later (and seven years after middle school ended), I realize just how well-done this film actually is. Luhrmann did an excellent job of making the movie believable while using the quaint language. This moviebrings new life into the words of Shakespeare, and even if you know the playalmost by heart it is refreshing to hear the words in an entirely new context, and one which makes sense. This version of Romeo and Juliet actually does addsomething to the extensive history of the play. The soundtrack is excellent, the acting is appropriate (Danes and DiCaprio do a wonderful job of portraying the young lovers), and the scenery is fabulous. This film jump-started the trend of modern-day Shakespeare remakes, and I think it's the best one.",,Anonymous,Romance
Not for Shakespeare beginners... or anyone else for that matter,"It's dangerous to expose someone who has never read Shakespeare to this film - so if you haven't, but you're crazy about Leonardo DiCaprio, try to read the book first before watching this piece of bizarre rendition - or, after you watch it, immediately read the book with open mind.It may not be fair coming from me because I'm not a DiCaprio fan, but I think he's not the right lead actor. He's just *not* Romeo. Danes on the other hand is doing brilliantly as Juliet, and she's the only one close to making her Shakespearean lines believable in this weird MTV-style chaos of 'modern Verona'. The whole combination is just too absurd - I can't imagine how they decided on which parts of the amazing love story to destroy and revamp, and which parts to preserve - but it just doesn't work.Think someone destroying parts of Colosseum and replacing those random parts with steel, glass, and colourful paints. You just don't do such thing!If you love sparkling visuals like this, see Moulin Rouge instead - there, Luhrmann successfully mixed all his eccentric elements into one stunning musical. If you love Shakespeare, try 1968's Romeo and Juliet instead - it makes much more sense and is less of an insult to this great work of Shakespeare. And... if you love DiCaprio, you might as well watch Titanic instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

kitsch updating of the Bard,"This new and lively version takes a bit of getting used to, as the opening few minutes are in the style of a fast-moving, MTV style, news report, on gang warfare in Verona.Against this backdrop are Leonardo di Caprio and Claire Danes, both doing their best with the staring and sloshing around their characters have to do. Neither can speak the verse brilliantly, although both manage to be effective, perhaps because they have youth and beauty on their side.In support are Miriam Margoyles, Pete Postlethwaite, and others.  All adequate.But the best things in this Romeo and Juliet have nothing to do with Shakepeare.  First, there's the music - a lovely theme for when the lovers first meet, a drag performance for Mercutio with the disco classic Young Hearts Run Free, a church choir singing When Doves Cry - and the gorgeous visuals (the final sequences are in a shining gold palace of kitsch, there's a fishtank with lovely coloured fish, there's a large pool which helps move the balcony scene along ...).Don't expect a straightforward classical adaptation.

"Great movie, classic, needs to be seen","Romeo and Juliet, helmed by ""Strictly Ballroom""'s director Baz Luhrmann, is the Gen-X-John-Woo-MTV-school-of-film-making interpretation of the Bard's work. From the opening sequence of a television followed by a kinetic in-yer-face staccato of imagery, to the softer ballet-like camera work of the passion scenes between the two protagonists, R&J is definitely cinema of cool.Instead of being a costume drama set in the 15th century, R&J is transposed to modern-day Verona Beach. However, Luhrmann has also thrown in some anachronistic elements from the original setting of R&J: instead of carrying swords, the members of the houses of Montague and Capulet carry 9mm semi-automatics, emblazoned with brand names such as ""Sword"" or ""Rapier"". Dialogue is faithful to the text in most respects (even the newscasters on the televisions in this anachronistic world speak in Elizabethan tongues). The church plays a prominent role in the modern-day Verona Beach, and the film is replete with religious imagery-- the young Juliet, instead of posters of New Edition on her wall, has a Madonna statue and Victorian images of angels; a large statue of Christ stands overlooking the city of Verona Beach; the guns which the Montagues and the Capulets carry are decorated with images of religious icons. Luhrmann also throws in little references that add some humour to the story: the Romeo 'n the boyz hang out at the Globe Theatre, a church choir breaks out into a hymnlike ""When Doves Cry"", and a Coca Cola ad is distorted to fit the Elizabethan atmosphere.If there is anything to complain about, it would be the opening half hour of the film. Luhrmann throws everything but the kitchen sink in terms of film-making techniques, which can be overwhelming. You have Peckinpah-ish use of slow-motion, MTV-inspired rapid-fire editing with odd zoom-ins and outs, almost-slapstick use of speed-up sequences (a la ""The Gods Must be Crazy""), a retro-seventies look in terms of colourful costume design (not unlike the retro-seventies look of ""Strictly Ballroom"") and subtitling, and a retro-eighties feel in terms of the over-acting by the supporting characters. However, once you pass this odd jumble of imagery and get into the story of Romeo and Juliet, the machine-gun barrage slows down to a more manageable pace.In summary, R&J adds value by putting the play into a different context, and through the use of interesting symbolism and imagery, adds a whole new level of interpretation to this timeless classic. Definitely a must-see (and don't mind the teenyboppers sitting around you-- they just have an essay on R&J due next week for Grade 10 English).Great movie, classic, needs to be seen.

For my ninth grade english class, I am currently studying William Shakespeare's tragic play Romeo + Juliet in both modern and old english versions.  Now I first heard about Romeo + Juliet back in fourth grade when I was 10 years old.I didn't know what it was about at the time, so I asked my cousin (who was in ninth grade, but graduated in 1999) what it was about.  She told me it was about two teenagers from two feuding families who meet and fall in love. They soon enough get married, but all that ends tragically when they commit suicide.  As a result of their deaths, the two feuding families agree to peace.Now I didn't get a chance to see it in the theater, so I patiently waited until it debuted on Cinemax a few months after it was released.  Let me just say it was amazing!  I had never seen a more beautiful film.Baz Luhrmann's updated version of the play is absolutely stunning.  What really surprised me about it was that it was set in present day Verona Beach, California.  They drove around in cars, instead of riding on horses and instead of fighting with swords, they fight with guns.  All of this was good.

Glittering Carbon-Copy...,"Movies like ""Moulin Rouge!"" (or more recently, ""La La Land"") are so lavishly designed and stylishly directed that the simplicity of their stories is no coincidence, they are well-crafted forms of entertainment meant to arouse emotions rather than thoughts.Indeed, while I'm not a professional on editing or filmmaking, what I gathered from years of cinematic dedication is that complex, multi-layered, character-driven stories generally call for straightforward directing, so that the form doesn't distract from the content. In other words, there's a time for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and another for ""Chinatown"", and I can't think of a good movie that is both exceedingly directed and written (with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"").Can we take for granted that people know ""Romeo and Juliet"" so well that a few artistic licenses won't hurt, or are actually needed? Is it such an iconic story that it can sustain every narrative form without undermining the emotional bingo of the end? Well, I'm not sure the story is self-sufficient, while watching Leo as Romeo (talk about predestination in that rhyming) challenging Tybalt (John Leguizamo), shouting Shakespeare's lines with such passion I could hardly understood what he said, I was wondering if the movie wouldn't have worked as well or better had they been swords instead of guns, Verona instead of Verona Beach and good old Renaissance as the time setting.And it's precisely because Leonardo Di Caprio was an excellent Romeo, in his pre-""Titanic"" fame years with the youthful charm, the wide-eyed innocence, the eyebrow-raising enthusiasm and penetrating sadness, he was a baby-faced young man who could easily pass as a teenager. The rest of the casting was competent, honorable mention to Leguizamo who looked as passionately angry as his 1968 counterpart Michael York, and to Paul Sorvino and Pete Postlewhaite. Claire Danes paled in comparison but not to the point of ruining the film. What did spoil the film a little was actually its own reason to be, Baz Lhurmann!"" thought that Shakespeare's romance needed a rejuvenation treatment, as if it wasn't modern enough for younger audiences.The problem is that the story has been modernized already, like Kurosawa made adaptations of ""Macbeth"" and ""King Lear"", ""Romeo and Juliet"" inspired good movies like ""West Side Story"" or ""China Girl"", love stories with a gang war as the backdrop. In fact any interesting romance inevitably revolves around star-crossed lovers, any romance owes a bit to ""Romeo and Juliet"" which owed to all the romantic heritage of the past centuries. So you either remake ""Romeo and Juliet"" or you adapt it, there is rarely an in-between solution. Lurhmann took the challenge and it's laudable, but his ""Romeo + Juliet"" couldn't be a total remake or it would have been a second ""West Side Story"", it was doomed to be half-Shakespeare, half-something else.And the problem is that the text didn't match the setting, no matter how hard it tried like replacing the narrator by a TV announcer. It was so busy reminding you that this is the Shakespeare play in its academic version (same lines) that it became unchained to its premise, while in any of the previous adaptations; the romance was the focal point, not its kinship with the original story. It came to the point that the 'Trainspotting'-like editing, the pop music, the opera, the shootouts, the awkward mix between modern settings and Renaissance-expressions becomes a sort of gimmick that overshadowed the story. The form detracted from the story, and the heart of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the story. If you're not emotionally involved, it's over.And the film could still win the audiences, had it not ruined the very scenes that could create the emotional involvement, through some bizarre experimentation. I didn't care for the 1968 version until the balcony scene; Olivia Hussey's youthful beauty, the purity of Nino Rota's score, the interactions between the young lovers, the film won because of that scene. So, I expected the balcony scene to enhance ""Romeo + Julier"" but Lurhmann had to introduce the novelty of the swimming pool. What was he thinking? If you're going to stick to the play, don't ruin the most iconic part. How can someone be focused on loving while he's also trying to float in the water. Forget what I said, the whole thing just looked awkward and as sincere as the actors were in their intent to play ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's like Lurhmann had another movie in mind.The film was a success but it was out-shined by the Leo's following hit, the one that put him in Hollywood map forever and ever; ""Titanic"" the year after, interestingly, this was a tale of forbidden love that was closer in spirit and in heart to ""Romeo and Juliet"" than ""Lurrhman's jukebox. And Claire Danes, with all due respect, is no Kate Winslet. Leo is a real romantic actor but the real star of Baz Lurhmann's film was Baz Lurhmann. His unique jukebox-styled directing fitted ""Moulin Rouge!"" but as far as ""Romeo + Juliet"" goes, it's still an entertaining little movie, that nostalgic of the 90's will cherish.

Did the movie fail to meet Shakespeare's intentions?,Romeo and Juliet the modern version was quite interesting. Shakespeare wouldn't like Baz Luhrmann version because the setting doesn't fit with his Elizabethan style of writing. He would like it better if the dialogue was more modern to fit the setting. In Romeo and Juliet Shakespeare likes to use a more secretive way of showing love of passion instead of just being intimate unlike Luhrmann's version. In the being of the movie of Luhrmann's version I didn't like it because it was too odd for me and I wish that they would just use modern language to complement each other. Later on in the movie I sort of put that thought to the side because the actions Luhrmann was taking in the movie were very unusual and interesting.

I defy you rating stars,I first saw this movie in highschool while studying Shakespeare in English literature and I was blown away by it's modernised visuals without compromising the original text such as switching swords for guns and having each one inscribed with the name of the blade in the text Tybalts gun is inscribed with Rapier on it Mercutios is inscribed with dagger so when they put up there swords to fight no text or dialogue is changed just the visuals while the movies modern theme's give this classic story a different interpretation while not changing the original text.There are a few scenes that are a bit weird such as Mercutio cross dressing for the party at the Capulet mansion and Romeo dropping acid and having bad trip at the party but honestly they don't take away from the movies seriousness they just add a bit of comedy and weirdness to an otherwise great movie.The story is pretty much the same as in the book word for word only a few minor differences and having visuals to illustrate the scenes and bring it to life like on stage in a play with a much bigger budget and the advantage of movie editing for the best performances and even when you know how the movie is going to play out and how it will end it still surprises you.The cast do an amazing job of bringing the characters to life breathing new life into them Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes have great chemistry on screen and really bring the star crossed lovers story of true love to a modern audience also notably John Leguizamo plays Tybalt and really he does a great job at bringing this classic villain to life with a cunning and evil voice and stylish movements worthy of the name prince of cats.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys this classic story of love and loss or just as a romantic love movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent,"It's a bit late to be reviewing this movie, but I find it an exceptional reboot. Everything about it is on permanent overdrive, as exemplified by the oversaturated setting and terse cinematography. Some people have reviewed this and expressed distaste at Harold Perinneau's portrayal of Mercutio in favour of the 1968 John McEnery. While ""de gustibus non est disputandum"" certainly applies here, I think it's worth pointing out that McEnery's performance brought a certain boorishness and abrasion to the character that Perrineau did not. Romeo, played by DiCaprio, was excellently cast and acted, striking a healthy balance between stunningly handsome and endearingly clumsy and exuberant. And I don't care what all you phonies say, Claire Danes was gorgeous.Others have derided the film for certain choices made in the staging, combat, and/or nonverbal action, remarking ""Where did Shakespeare write that?"" Well. First, we are already working in a modern setting, so the assumption that historical accuracy in staging and direction should be followed to a T is frankly absurd. Second, the plays are public domain, which is a mixed blessing, as it brought us the 2013 R&J Sparknotes movie adaptation. But with that freedom comes a brilliant opportunity of artistic expression from the director, and each choice of omission or interaction in this production was apparently made with great care to maintain the integrity of the story being told.To touch on comparisons between the 68 and 96 movies: don't try to tell me Leonard Whiting acted like he had any idea what he was saying. Have you people seen the movie?This film is definitely worth your time. I find it to be a well-wrought revamping of one of my favourite plays from the Shakespeare Corpus.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare like we've never seen before,"There's been many an adaptation of the Bard's various works, whether it be for screen, stage or other mediums, but it's safe to say there haven't been many adaptations of Shakespeare's works adapted quite like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet.A colour infused ADHD like incarnation of the famed story of doomed lovers, which sees the action transported from ancient England to a modern day Verona Beach (really an LA set piece), Luhrmann's version of this timeless romance is certainly not for everyone and not as refined narratively as one would like but there's no denying there's an energy and verve to this outing that is rarely found in feature films.Not a director renowned for his restraint, Luhrmann holds nothing back as he wastes little time introducing us to the world of teenager's Romeo and Juliet, members of the Montague and Capulet families respectively, two warring families that would rather see death come upon them than somehow see their bloodline merged into one.From the moment we open the film through a series of whirlwind news stories that lead into an eclectic gas stop run-in between the feuding tribes, Luhrmann stops at nothing on his quest to breathe new life into the 100's year old tale, with a collection of OTT costumes, set-pieces, pop music and vibrant cast to keep things moving along at a breakneck pace.Lucking out by snaring a young and ready for action Leonardo DiCaprio and a never more charismatic Claire Danes to portray the films central couple, a solid chemistry between the two cements Romeo + Juliet as a definitive film of the era for a certain demographic and one of Luhrmann's most hip affairs, that stands above Moulin Rouge and Australia for accessibility for a wider range of viewers, even if it's unlikely those of the boomer variety would find much to love here.It's a shame that all of the films energy, hyperactivity and abundance of pizzazz can't be found in its ability to craft an emotive experience, as the story of these two teenage love birds has lasted centuries due to the ability it had connecting with readers emotionally and that's never really found here in this exercise of style over substance, we as viewers are always wowed by the visual and technical but not so much the beating heart at the core of the story.Final Say -A unique beast that is sure to divide Shakespeare scholars right down the line between love and hatred, Romeo + Juliet is a visually stunning show that never quite manages to mold its craftsmanship with a winning adaptation of its source material.3 fish tanks out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
What's That Whirring Sound?,"Updating the plays of Shakespeare has occupied the minds of many filmmakers, but it is a good idea to try to occupy the minds of the audience as well. Baz Luhrmann's loud, brash and irritating adaptation is possibly the most pathetic attempt at updating the Bard I can remember. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...The basic setting doesn't really work beyond the most surface level, although using a newscaster as a narrator is a good idea. The casting is utterly bizarre, with Danes displaying all the talent of a jar of water, Postlethwaite miscast as a priest, and Margolyes overacting horribly. The decision to make Mercutio a drag queen make so little sense that I wonder if I'm still watching a 16th century play, and the whole enterprise is horrendously overdirected. The cross motif gets so out of hand that by the end we have a gross of them in a single shot, the storm is an unoriginal device, and is badly matted, as are the shots of family names on the tops of buildings.I can't begin to imagine why so many people like this film, although at least they are getting more out of it then I am. If you want a good Shakespeare update, try Richard III (1995). As for this, I wasted two hours of my life, which I'm not getting back, on a film that disappears up it's own backside faster than a jet-propelled enema.",,Anonymous,Romance
Better than expected,"Despite the casting of Daines and DeCaprio in the lead roles in this movie, this is not a bad film. Enjoy the performances of the rest of the cast, particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Paul Sorvino.For a fan of Shakespeare, it's interesting to note the way the characters and their voices seamlessly blend into the modern world. The roaming youths of both houses are easily believable as gang bangers, and noble lords easily become wealthy tycoons. The changes in the ages at which we consider marriage does create some dissonance, but so do a number of Shakespeare's plot devices in the modern world. All in all, enjoy the story, and the shiny, and the fluid way that the actors convey the meaning of the archaic dialect.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

MTV meets Shakespeare,"Updating of ""Romeo and Juliet"" for the 1990s. I'm going to skip a synopsis of the plot--everyone knows it.This is basically ""Romeo and Juliet"" in modern day dress full of arresting visuals, gunplay, loud 1990s music, wild dance numbers with all the cast members using Shakespeare's original dialogue! The effect is odd (to say the least). It ALMOST works. The visuals are all incredible (director Buz Luhrmann always knows how to make a film look fantastic) and the movie almost never stops for a breath. That's the problem--at first it's fun, but after 2 hours you're exhausted. Also the actors seem lost. When they're talking Shakespeare they seem to have no idea what they're saying. Most of them just recite the lines with a blank look on their faces. The older actors (Paul Sorvino especially) are much better at it. The casting and acting in this is all over the place.Leonardo DiCaprio (as Romeo) is a good actor, but he's just all wrong for this role. He looks lost and way out of his depth. However, Claire Danes is wonderful as Juliet. Very sweet, likable and seems to have a clear understanding of the dialogue. Also her reactions in her dancing scene with Paris are hilarious. John Leguizamo is way over the top as Tybalt--too much. He quickly becomes annoying. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino are very good as Montague and Capulet but are underused. Even Paul Rudd is very good (and incredibly handsome) as Paris. He seems to be having a whale of a time in his role.Also, there is an incredible party sequence and Romeo's cousin comes in a wig, dress and lipstick and no one bats an eyelash. There's a great musical number on a huge staircase also.Loud, eye-popping, funny and even quite moving. As it stands, I'm giving it an 8. With a better cast I might give it a 10.Best line: ""Check on me tomorrow and you'll find me a grave man.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

what a waste of celluloid,"this film takes the bounds of the unwatchable and stretches them to near-mythic proportions. how a director could start with a play of such stature and end up with such a poorly acted, unintelligibly edited piece of filth is beyond my comprehension. the only thing this flick has going for it is the supporting cast. Pete Postlethwaite is excellent, as always, but putting him on screen with leo's befuddled romeo is a true crime. some modernizations are better left unmade. on the whole, i'd rather sit in the treatment chair in ""A Clockwork Orange"" and be forced to watch ""West Side Story"" for three days straight than be forced to endure a second watching of of this beast.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo + Juliet + Luhrmann = crap,"I watched this for about twenty minutes then I walked out, I made it up to Act 2, the end of the masked ball (for those who have read the play). I know it's probably wrong to review a movie when you've watched less than a quarter of It, but I have to warn viewers, stay away.Baz Luhrmann's film takes Romeo and Juliet out of Verona, Italy four hundred years ago, and into the present day in what is supposed to be Atlanta or one of the southeastern U.S. cities. The film looks impressive, with accomplished set and costume design, but not for a moment does this feel like Shakespeare. You cannot take 16th century dialog and give it to contemporary character types played by talentless actors, it sounds dreadful. Hearing a ruffian American kid, say ""Do you bite your thumb at us sir."" as if it's status quo in modern speech, is an insult to the great playwrite. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes may look cute together but boy do they stink at acting here. I imagine if I had made it to the ending, I would have cried with laughter not sorrow. Next to Franco Zeffirelli's film from 1968, or any other Shakespeare movie for that matter, this one is a a turkey.If you have any respect for Shakespeare, do not see this movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Ah, What Doth the Producers Think They're Doing?","Well, first the good things about this movie. First of all, the acting quality is really good. Unlike, say, the Man in Iron Mask, DiCaprio managed to potray himself as a anguished, sensitive rich guy with a tormented heart. Like most other guys, I despise him, but I do appreciate good acting. The same goes to Claire Danes and the rest of the cast. The special effects, music and sound is also top notch. Kudos on that. I've watched the movie over and over again. Now for the bad things. First of all, I would rather have a revised dialog, instead of taking the lines straight out of the book. I mean, how many average-intelligent teenagers know the meaning of ""wherefore"" (it means ""why"") and other old English words? Of course, some of the memorable lines (""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet"") shouldn't be changed. But otherwise, please, not everyone has a degree in English literature.

Visually fantastic but confused version.,"Baz Lurhman's Romeo + Juliet has both good and bad. the visuals and modernised Verona are spectacular and sumptuous, while DeCaprio and Danes leave some to be desired. The supporting cast is strong and holds together this crazy film though quality Shakespearean acting and a sense of fun that is severely lacking in most Shakespeare films. I personally have a problem with the main portrayals because neither is particularly adept at playing Shakespeare modernly and convincingly. the portrayals of Tybalt, Mercutio, Friar Lawrence and the Prince stand out and are excellent modern interpretations. the use of gun can seem forced at times but is understandable and fits with the visual style. The film is chaotic and is not for everyone ( several of my roommates absolutely despise it) but it can be a refreshing look at Shakespeare. Ultimately, individual taste plays heavily into opinion; while it is definitely worth seeing you may decide never to watch it again after.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"This won't be for everyone, but I LOVED it!","We've seen a fair share of Romeo & Juliet films, but none as brave and bold as Baz Luhrmann's version. From the fantastic soundtrack to the visuals, 'Romeo + Juliet' is in a league of its own. Some will love this fresh new approach, while others - especially die hard fans - will no doubt loathe it.The titular characters are portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, with an awesome performance by Leonardo. If you're familiar with the story, then you'll know from the very beginning how it will end for our young lovers. One thing I always find interesting with love stories, is how easily lust is confused with love. Having just met and knowing nothing about each other, these lovers instantly declare their love for each other and are ready to get married the very next day. I know its meant to be romantic, but I don't see it that way. Surely you only love a person once you get to know them. Romeo's Dad, Father Laurence (Pete Postlethwaite) says it best: ""A young man's love lies in the eyes, not the heart."" Indeed so; well said!Ok, my opinions aside; this is a love story - lets call it a very fast-paced love! In the end I did root for them, and I did find it rather romantic. The problem with our lovers, are the fact they are from the Capulet and the Montagues families, who are enemies. So it is a classic tale of forbidden love. Hoping their marriage could bring peace between the families, Father Laurence agrees to wed them.John Leguizamo stars as the film's antagonist, Tybalt Capulet - Juliet's cousin. The Capulet and Montagues Boys constantly clash, causing mayhem and damage on the streets of Verona. Romeo's best friend is Mercutio (with a fabulous performance by Harold Perrineau, whom I absolutely loved in this role), who has no time for the Capulet Boys.This Shakespearian film is set in modern times, yet they still speak in the famous Shakespearian tongue. I'll be honest, even with subtitles there were moments when I didn't always follow what they were saying! No one speaks that way anymore! Many viewers will criticize the movie for not modernizing the dialogue as well. I admit, it would have been an easier watch. I'm not a big Shakespeare fan.'Romeo + Juliet' is the type of film that just gets better and better as it develops, until you are completely glued to the screen. Made in typical Luhrmann style with his impressive visuals and trademark editing, this was a very entertaining watch. The first few minutes are totally slapstick (again, this is a Luhrmann trademark), but it quickly becomes dramatic. The film also features interesting versions of popular songs. I loved this movie, more so for taking a familiar story and making it feel original.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare would roll in his grave!,"This movie was not only pathetic, but a mockery of theater in general. West Side Story is an adaptation of the original story - and did well in theaters. This however, was nothing more than unoriginal work with special effects and catchy music riffs selling unnecessary bad-taste to suburban white kids with access to mommy and daddy's credit. When this movie came out - the ""teen generation"" ate it up - and Hollywood cashed in on it's success; regardless of the fact that this feature had no depth, class, or innovation. It was simply the same dialogue and setting of Shakespeare's original, with enough polish on it to get everyone to want to buy a piece. Shakespeare had a beautiful vision - this wasn't it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Weird Yet Fantastic Adaptation Of Shakespeare's Classic Play.,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is both an accurate title and a misnomer. It has the language of Shakespeare's play, and yet the setting is moved from 1500s Italy to 1996 Verona Beach. However, that is the delight and uniqueness of Baz Luhrmann's vision.The plot is known to most people. There are 2 feuding families, the Montagues and the Capulets. One day, a child of both families, Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes), fall in love and marry in secret to unite their families.The movie sticks to speaking in Old English, but the setting is modern. The clothes are suburban, people drive fancy cars, carry guns, and places like gas stations are available. (I guess so if there's cars....),The result is weird, but also something special. When Romeo and Juliet meet (and Romeo has been fretting over rejected love), they are at a costume party, him as a knight and her as a fairy. When they must part, Romeo still looks at her from a distance and says: ""Did my heart love 'til now? Forswear it sight. For I never saw true beauty 'til this night.""As a result, those who want to see a faithful rendition of the play from this standpoint will surely not be disappointed.Baz Luhrmann shows his talent as a director here. The cinematography is on point, very glamorous and always a pleasure to look at.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best romantic roles in his career, with Titanic being a film that was released a year later. With R and J simply being a standard in romantic storytelling, I have no shame in my statement. Although, I will say that The Departed remains my favorite role of his.Claire Danes makes for a gorgeous Juliet, and I can imagine no other actress taking her place, not even Kate Winslet, who was doing Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet the same year. This is also my favorite role of hers, despite seeing her in movies like Temple Grandin and Me and Orson Welles.This version of Romeo and Juilet is not for everyone, and Franco Zefferilli's adaptation remains supreme, but as long as you can accept the modernization, Romeo and Juliet is highly recommended for anyone who loves classics, romance or classic literature.William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is one of the most romantic stories ever told, re-invented into one of the strangest yet most powerful adaptations ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Luhrmann creates an overly-elaborate slaughtering of Shakespeare's eloquence,"In Romeo+Juliet, director/producer Baz Luhrmann takes the traditional story of ""two star-crossed lovers,"" puts it in Verona Beach in about 1970, adds his own little motif of water, over-dramatises the whole story, chooses substandard performers, and to top it all, ignores half of Shakespeare's original text.In one of the first few scenes, through the chosen costumes, Luhrmann takes what was to some extent implied in the text, and makes Mercutio a transvestite homosexual, Tybalt a devil, and, using blatant stereotypes, Juliet becomes an angel, and Romeo a knight-in-shining- armour. Some might call this ""rather cute,"" I call it lack of imagination.It seems that, however much he tried, Luhrmann could not succeed by himself, and so tried to find people to be successful for him: Leonardo DiCaprio, for example. DiCaprio was one of the small number of cast members who did a half decent job at their role. DiCaprio quite effectually portrayed the romantic, bashful, teenage Romeo, giving the viewer at least some feeling of verisimilitude. Claire Danes, however, removes this feeling by giving Juliet the image of forced emotion. Also, Luhrmann's casting of Miriam Margoyles, using a somewhat Spanish accent, as the Nurse gives a completely different image of the bawdy Nurse that Shakespeare portrayed. Luhrmann avoids the bawdiness by simply skipping over most of those parts of the original text.The Nurse's suggestive monologues are not the only sections of the text that Luhrmann skips; he also takes out many side plots and events that occur throughout, apparently without realising that some of them do have some import in the story. For example, in the film, Romeo never kills Paris, who, in the text, is yet another one of the innocent victims of the family feud. This may not have a huge effect, but when there are a number of similarly small events taken out, the effects add up, making what is an excellently written story into something much less powerful.One might think that, having not done too great a job in other aspects, Luhrmann might have done better on his choice of music. Then one notices that music varying from artists such as Garbage, to One Inch Punch, to the Butthole Surfers, can be summarised, quite simply, as melodramatic rubbish. Quite fitting, considering Luhrmann's apparent love of melodrama, as shown through his choices of casting, costume, setting, and music. And that more or less summarises the whole movie: an over-done butchering of Shakespeare's beautiful writing.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A complete abortion of a movie that any self-respecting movie maker would disavow,"Now that I'm retired from 30 years of teaching I do a lot of substitute work. At least a couple of times I subbed in English classes in which the lesson was to show the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet. When I learned that today's lesson was also a Romeo and Juliet video I smiled, since that 1968 film is so good that I cannot help but watch it along with the class.Imagine my dismay when, instead of Olivia Hussey, Michael York, etc., I found out that the class was to watch this monstrosity of a film set in 20th Century U.S. gang culture. I don't think I can adequately express how awful this film really is. The acting, with one or two exceptions, does not rise above the level of a ninth grade class skit. Clair Dane is embarrassing as Juliet (she was much better in Terminator 3) and Leonardo DiCaprio is little better.Inadequate acting is not the film's only shortcoming. The sound is awful; it's very hard to make out some of the beautiful lines left us by the Bard. And, most of all, the modern setting just destroys the magic that was so expertly on display in the Zefirelli version.This attempt at presenting Shakespeare is an absolute train wreck in my view. Total pandering to today's youth culture. If one wanted to see a modern version of Romeo and Juliet, watching West Side Story would be a much better bet.

Shakespeare On Acid,"I found this adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" intriguing, though far from spectacular. I've never exactly decided whether or not I think it's good, but I do enjoy it. The love between Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio is quite nice, although it lacks the wild passion (particularly on Claire's part) that distinguishes this tale, and Pete Postlethwaite seems to be the only actor involves who seems as though he can truly handle the Bard. Nevertheless, I think it can only be a compliment to Shakespeare that his work continues to be interpreted in so many diverse ways hundreds of years after he wrote it. On that note, this is a brave experiment that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. It is a study in style, with a unique, acid-art burn.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Once again I wonder does Baz know what FATE is?I won't say something subjective like: DeCaprio was great or DeCaprio stank. I say objectively that his raw emotion that he brought to the screen was excellent, but this emotion does not replace understanding for the lines he's saying (i.e. he had no understanding of the lines he was saying).  The director is the one responsible for this lack of comprehension... if you're going to do shakespeare, you have to know what it is you're talking about.To be blunt this movie was the worst interpretation of shakepeare's play that I have ever witnessed.  Shame on Baz that he botched it so badly.  My advice to him is READ THE PLAY!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Reboot Of A True Love Story!,"This movie was so good, I wasnt expecting myself to be as engaged with it as I was considering there was a lot of negative reviews on here. Let's put it bluntly we must have been watching a completely different movie as this movie was so interesting and emotional at the same time, another classic from Leonardo DiCaproo in his prime, truly phenomenal, I would definitely watch it over and over.A true love story which isn't true, a great play by the one and only William Shakespeare, I love this story it shows you many things loss, love, laughter and chaos, but one thing most of all it shows how love trumps all in the end. Many great aspect to note on this cinematic masterpiece, the angles they shot at in some cases were crazy in a good way, I highly recommend you watch this, even if you dont like love stories, this ones good! Totally worth the watch.I judge too quickly and I shouldn't as I've been ruined wrong with a few of DiCaprio's movies, he is now my all time favourite actor and I cant wait for more!10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Why did Baz call this ""William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet""?","Using this title in it's own right thumbs it's nose at the Bard!! Not that I'm a true member or anything, but pretension is going to have reaction's, most of which are going to be negative!!!! I haven't seen this flick for a while, but I do remember that everybody I associated with at the time absolutely despised it. I can see why, Shakespeare was a poet before a playwrite to my knowledge (don't hold me to it, I prefer his works to his life story!) so any well crafted dialogue of his is butchered for physical and visual effect in this movie, it's just wrong! Not to mention I find the acting to be thrown out for speed,and you can't just do what you please w/ the physical aspects of the original play, so many scenes that made the play a fatalistical tragedy are overwrought!! I have to give this movie it's due, though, it shows a great use of visual ability that should be used w/ these types of stories (even though it seems that Baz is trying to do everything that everybody else didn't with this movie) which does justice to the themes of this play. I'm not familiar with any of Baz Luhrmann's other work's, but after graduating to his sappy ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"", I'll be concise enough to say this is his best work (which definitely ain't saying a lot!) and that I'm afraid to meet him for fear of laughing at him or puking on him!

visually stunning but badly acted.,"This is Shakespeare for Dummies. While visually stunning and full of action, the acting is sub par at best. Whther this is the fault of the actors or the director I cannot say, but the lines are delivered melodramatically. Apparently these people do not know how to put emotion into their lines without shouting. Furthermore, the way the lines are delivered when not shouted are given with bizarre inflections and accents on words and syllables that blur the meaning of the speeches. As a teacher of literature, I would not recommend this movie. While I believe that Shakepeare can be made accessible to today's youth, especially urban youth, in doing so, this movie loses the original vision: to tell the story well.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A major disappointment,"I thought I was going to enjoy this film when I rented it and I realized that I had wasted my $3 in renting this flick.I did not see Romeo and Juliet at all in the film.  I only saw Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.Instead of original costumes, everyone's wearing Hawaiian T-shirts and stuff we wear everyday.The Prince, who is portrayed as a police officer, dismissed a public brawl between the Montagues and the Capulets (beginning scene).  If he was a real police officer, arrests would've been made.Claire Danes' portrayal of Juliet was mediocre.  She didn't have enough feeling, especially in the balcony scene.If you want to see a REAL performance of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" rent the 1968 version directed by Franco Zefferelli and narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A Disappointment When Compared to the Play, But Not Too Bad","Romeo + Juliet is directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the famous star-crossed lovers and title characters, Romeo and Juliet. If you don't know the story, shame on you, but here's a synopsis. Two families, the Montagues and Capulets, are constantly feuding, and Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet, subsequently fall in love. Their love is not allowed, due to their parents' hatred for each other, and so they secretly get married. This entire story is based (literally line by line) off of William Shakespeare's play, The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet.The best thing this film has to offer is, quite obviously, the dialogue. The lines used in this film is the exact lines William Shakespeare wrote in the 16th century. The plot, along with the dialogue, is ingenious. The forbidden love between the two plays off amazingly. The direction in this film also is pretty good. It has a few flaws; some shaky cam, bad close ups, etc. However, it's more good than it is bad. The acting is also really good. This is one of DiCaprio's first roles, besides What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), in which he received his first Oscar nomination. He is super young here, but still does a great job. Claire Danes does great as well. She's not in many movies (thanks to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)), but she really should be. She does fantastic in this film. The first negative in this film is the ""gangster"" vibe of it. The original story takes place in the 14th century in Verona, Italy. This film takes place in 1996 in Verona Beach, California. Nobody uses swords; they all use engraved, golden guns. This movie would've been near perfect if the director kept to the formula that Shakespeare wrote. The nowaday feel of the movie makes for a complete mess, with too much unnecessary drama at the wrong times, and confusing dialogue that makes no sense when a character says the word ""sword"" or especially old English, using words like ""doth"" and ""thou.""Overall, Romeo + Juliet wasn't too bad. I expected better than the utterly stupid theme of the slums, and the occasional bad direction, most abundant during fight scenes. I'm going to give Romeo + Juliet a C+, or a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best version of Romeo & Juliet I've seen - brilliant!,"I think the best thing about this movie is that it brought Shakespeare to millions of people who would never have normally appreciated it. When Baz made this movie he didn't want to make yet another 'boring' drama that would turn people off - more long dresses and men in tights? How many times did we sit through these movies in high school studying for our next English exam? Big yawn!Instead, he took the story and threw it into modern times, cast fresh young actors, gave it a modern soundtrack and directed a masterpiece. The story otherwise remains exactly the same, word for word. Most of the kids who saw this don't even realise they've just had an English lesson by the end of the movie! Hey, knock it if you like but I think anything that might get more people reading or appreciating the written word can't be that bad.Highly entertaining, a heartbreaking romance, and a visual feast, Romeo + Juliet is a movie I've treated myself to at least once a year since I first saw it in '96. After seeing Moulin Rouge this year I watched it twice in a row. A must for any romantics - just keep an open mind and expect the unexpected if you've never seen a Baz Luhrmann film before - you either love or you hate this hopeless romantic but you should at least appreciate what he does.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Neat modern adaptation on Shakespeare's tragedy.,"This is a neat modern adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic and tragic tale, Romeo and Juliet, where the feuding families of the Montagues and the Capulets are foretold in the Italian city of Verona. The lives and affair of star-crossed lovers Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet are complicated by their feuding families.Though set in modern times, this movie still follows Shakespeare's play somewhat to a T, helped by the actors' theatrical delivery of the original dialog, the intense drama and the enchanting story. Director Baz Luhrmann did a great job putting together the movie, placing his own unique style into the play but retaining the original intent of the story. The entire setting and scenery are set in this very wildly multi-colored atmosphere, giving the movie a very hip element. Lastly, the cast of characters were nicely assembled, all pulling off some very bold acting performances.Overall, it's a good combination of classic theater and modern Hollywood cinema.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice try,"It's a nice idea: putting the original text of Romeo and Juliet into a modern, urbanised, setting. It will appeal to a much younger audience (making it instantly suitable for classroom use) and it will show the world that what Shakespeare wrote is still applicable to modern day. Unfortunately, it did not work out the way it should have. One of the fatal flaws was that the text was not followed as closely as I would have liked it. In fact, things were added that were hideously out of place and two important parts that should have been included have been omitted. However, it is virtually impossible to create an exciting film without playing with the text a little, so the writers have been forgiven as far as I'm concerned.The one thing that I really cannot let pass is the combination the setting makes with the text. Keeping the original text with a modern setting has been done successfully in the past. The director here chose to make the setting and its characters over the top. The way the young Montagues and the young Capulets are portrayed may be clear, but it is also annoying to see that the Montagues are shown as surfer/stoners and the Capulets as Latino gangsters. This, combined with the setting, decors and acting makes for a film that is extremely over the top. This simply does not work with a text that is subtle, where most of the humour and entertainment is to be had from small quips and remarks, not from broad-sweeping statements and grandeur. Especially the love between Romeo and Juliet should be quiet, not playful as it is in this film.Of course there are some good things about this film. In keeping with Shakespeare's love of subtle word jokes, this film has quite a few. There are several 'hidden' hints to other Shakespearean plays. Also, I liked the newscaster as opening chorus. This gave the film an air of modernity while still keeping the goal of the prologue, which is introducing the play. These things made for a two hours that were not completely awful.I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare, although I do like it when people take freedoms with the text or the setting. However, Romeo + Juliet strayed too far from the nest.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hated it,"This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I didn't like how it was only partially modernized, and the actors couldn't act for soup. Basically it reeked of stupidity.With Shakespeare, you either have to modernize the whole thing, or not modernize it at all. The combination of a modern setting and the original text didn't work. It was awkward and hard to follow.The actors didn't seem like the poetic sort. Half the time, Benvolio was shirtless and reciting poetry. None of them had any idea how to read Shakespeare. It was hard to appreciate the text when the actors were completely lacking in realistic feeling. I think that two directors made a bet to see who could make the worst movie with the most highly paid actors. Baz Luhrmann most definitely won.The whole thing reeked of stupidity, to the point where it wasn't funny anymore. I was extremely annoyed with the subtitles explaining who the people were, as if we didn't already know. The frequent freezes on the ""swords"" and ""daggers"" were totally pointless and wasted time.In conclusion, I think you would have been better off watching the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet, which was classy and very accurate to the actual text. I would rather have my fingernails torn out with white hot nail clippers than be subjected again in my life to this horrible mess of badly modernized plot lines, butchered text, and shoddy actors.

6.2/10,"Theatricality, when you think about it, is really the heart of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, from the opening credits to the frantic final moments. It's a rollercoaster that doesn't let up. And for all its frenetic energy, the film doesn't hesitate to stay true to Shakespeare's original dialogue, which, let's face it, does its best to stand the test of time, but is, in many ways, an anachronism in today's world. Shakespeare's language, so ornate and intricate, clashes with the modern-day visuals, creating an interesting, yet sometimes uncomfortable, dissonance.In fact, the production here is far more compelling than the dialogue. Visually, Luhrmann knows exactly what he's doing. Every frame feels carefully crafted, from the bright neon hues to the heavy symbolism woven throughout. The mise-en-scène is absolutely intoxicating. But it's hard to ignore how the rapid pace and high energy contrast with the classical text. The result? A story that's often rushed, not because it's inherently bad, but because the constraints of adapting a centuries-old text to a 90-minute film demand it. You can't fault the movie for being fast-paced or cringe-worthy, not when it's tethered to old English classics.However, the big question remains: what's the point of adapting *Romeo and Juliet* this way? In my head this was just adapted to show off Leonardo Di Caprio's face. The film's rhythm, like the dialogue, sometimes gets caught in the past. The passion of youth and love, so essential to the story, is overshadowed by the aggressive visuals. It's bold, for sure, but it doesn't always let the beauty of Shakespeare's words breathe. So, what's left is a stunning production that proves Luhrmann's flair for vibrant visuals, but a film that ultimately leaves us reflecting on the value of both adaptation and fidelity. It's a nice piece of cinema that doesn't always know what it wants to be. But in the end, you're right where you started, appreciating the elegance of the production, even if the dialogue feels like it's from another time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unwatchable trash,"Fans of Shakespeare and good movies stay clear.  This is possibly the worst movie ever made.  First off the camera zooms in and out so much you can't tell what's going on, and it's enough to give one motion sickness. This ruins the movie by itself. Second, they do a freeze frame of each actor to introduce each character ala The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  A Sergio Leone movie this is not. Third, the acting is incredibly awful.  Pete Postlethwaite is basically the only competent actor. The cameo by M. Emmet Walsh is blasphemous.  Everyone else deserves to be in this lemon of a movie.  Fourth, there is a music number that made me want to end it all right then and there.  However, this movie has one thing going for it. The script.  It was basically unadapted from the play, however, the way it was visually handled is enough to make Shakespeare roll over in his grave. And over and over and over...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Romeo + Juliet,"Dare I say, the most audacious retelling of Romeo & Juliet and also, perhaps, the most accessible?Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film is a modern-day retelling featuring pop music, amazing visuals (there is so much to feast the eyes on in pretty much every scene across the film's two hours - but the party scenes were particularly visually spectacular), the occasional scene of stylised violence, and an engaging lead couple in Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes (their chemistry is top shelf in every scene they're together) with the original dialogue intact. It's a little weird, at first, but you get used to it, and it's actually very well done.Maybe Shakespearian aficionados and fans will take umbrage with all of the above, but I'm neither, and I enjoyed this film immensely - both when I watched it in high school for English (1998) and again twenty-five years later, in 2023.P.

A great Shakespeare classic,"Here's a complete thought about Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film ""Romeo + Juliet"":
Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" isn't just a retelling of Shakespeare's classic; it's a vibrant, modern reimagining that explodes onto the screen with a kinetic energy that perfectly captures the impetuous passion of youth. Set in the contemporary city of Verona Beach, Luhrmann translates the timeless tale of star-crossed lovers into a visually stunning spectacle that seamlessly blends Shakespearean language with contemporary pop culture.The film's audacious style is its most striking feature. Luhrmann masterfully utilizes a hyper-stylized aesthetic, employing vibrant colors, MTV-inspired editing, and a pulsating soundtrack that blends classical music with contemporary rock and pop. This dynamic approach not only revitalizes Shakespeare's text but also makes it accessible to a modern audience. The iconic fish tank fight scene, with its underwater choreography and slow-motion bullets, is a testament to Luhrmann's innovative and visually arresting direction.The performances are equally captivating. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes deliver electrifying portrayals of Romeo and Juliet, capturing the intensity of their love with raw emotion and palpable chemistry. John Leguizamo's fiery Mercutio is a scene-stealer, while Paul Sorvino's imposing portrayal of Don Capulet adds gravitas to the tragic story.However, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is more than just a visually dazzling spectacle. Luhrmann's film retains the core themes of Shakespeare's original: the destructive force of family feuds, the power of love to transcend social barriers, and the tragic consequences of impulsive actions. The film poignantly explores the timeless themes of fate, free will, and the fragility of human life.While some purists may criticize Luhrmann's liberties with the original text, his film ultimately serves as a powerful testament to the enduring relevance of Shakespeare's work. By translating the timeless tale into a contemporary language, Luhrmann has introduced a new generation to the beauty and tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, proving that Shakespeare's words continue to resonate with audiences across generations.In conclusion, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is a bold and unforgettable cinematic experience. Luhrmann's visionary direction, coupled with stellar performances and a captivating soundtrack, creates a visually stunning and emotionally resonant reimagining of Shakespeare's classic. This film serves as a powerful reminder that even in a world of constant change, the timeless themes of love, loss, and the destructive nature of hatred remain deeply relevant.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Total Crap,"I have many problems with this movie. One, the dialog. Even though it was supposed to make it unique, having Shakespearian dialog during the more serious scenes completely ruins the feel of it, as I was finding myself laughing when they were trying to be serious, but were failing miserably when you had these supposedly 'hip' people speaking as if they were from the 1500's. The producers should have modernized the dialog, and expanded on it, like in the video game industry, when translating from Japanese to English. Add pop culture references, and try to connect with the audiences, don't make what is one of the masterpieces of English literature turn into this pile of Garbage. Secondly, the cinematography was awful. Usually you can see the differences between movies made in the 1960's and 1990's, but when I saw the 60's version, it came out looking as if it was recently made, not made 40 years ago.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

He obviously means to prove he's a serious actor, but that all goes out the window when you consider the fact that he's been in a movie where Mercutio dresses up like Marilyn Monroe.I won't waste any more time groaning over the terrible acting, because Luhrmann's woeful misplacement of Shakespeare's worst work ever in 1990s California is enough to bemoan this filth.

Shakespeare as Served by Taco Bell,"William Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' has been performed and adapted countless times, and, unfortunately, most of said adaptations have been utterly unable to arouse more than fleeting interest in our current young generation. Consequently, I have to admit that my anticipation for this new interpretation by Baz Luhrman was restrained and, in fact, even somewhat pessimistic. Still, as an antidote to the banal merriment of the Christmas season, during which the film was initially in release, it serves well.The modern setting, though at first glance somewhat unsettling and irritating, anchors the interpretation of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy in a context familiar to the actors and audience. The acting is unexpectedly robust, considering the fact that a majority of the actors are in fact not (or at least weren't at the time) theatrically trained. One cannot but wonder if passion of such intensity was ever known by any of these plucky teens, these tumbleweeds in the desert of drama. The set and costumes are harmoniously combined and very worthwhile, within the context of a modern rendering. And the set design, too, is immensely resourceful, if not immensely successful. The costumes demonstrate a primal polarity of colors to differentiate the opposing forces as they tear asunder the dramatic passion binding Romeo and Juliet.Indeed, just as the spirit of Johann Sebastian Bach gives life to lifeless digital sound canvas, so can the spirit of Shakespeare illuminate any shadowy modern context. 'Romeo and Juliet' is a treasure that benefits the world of the dramatic arts by transforming the detached audience into emotional participants. Yes, 'Romeo and Juliet', like Taco Bell, appeals to those seeking spicy freshness in a context of rapid deployment!In case you haven't noticed, the above paragraphs contained generous portions of sarcasm. In actuality, this adaptation is a dull, botched one, a far cry from say Franco Zeffirelli's stunningly erotic version.Updating the plays of Shakespeare has obviously occupied the minds of many directors before, but it is a good idea to try to occupy the minds of the audience as well. After all, while this is not the Bard's best play, it unarguably contains his best poetry; that is because the play is also about language, about the difference between what something is and the language used to describe it. Hence, this may be one of the hardest Shakespearean plays to adapt to a modern setting. In part this may be due to the dramatic asides, which broadcast private remarks for all to hear, except the target of the remark, but even more importantly the play suffers from another blessing, which is also a curse: the enormous power of the story itself. Any failure to do it justice is likely to be perceived as monumental. Such is the fate of Luhrmans's film, a poppy and incoherent music video mess. The cast's endeavors to render the Bard's language more relaxed and informal are disastrous, as are the countless Mexican standoffs and gunfights that replace the swordfights of the original play. Danes and DiCaprio are utterly lost here, as is any semblance of sense or continuity. Rather than immersing the audience, the MTV style quickly becomes dull and extremely distracting. Ah, but tell that to the teenyboppers, to whom this thing is basically critic proof! To attempt it is to carelessly stroll into a hedonist orgy in Birkenstock sandals, step on every single bare foot, imbibe all half-finished glasses of Maraschino liqueur, smoke a La Gloria Cubana and engage people in tête-à-tête concerning the European Monetary Union - very silly. They'll just look at you all googly-eyed and inform you that `Leo is sooooooooo hot!'Bah!",,Anonymous,Romance
Good as a Hollywood film.,"As a great Hollywood fan, I enjoyed the film 100%. It's the Romeo and Juliet modernised. The structure of the film was good. The contrast between the two families was clear. The fire between the two families are well directed and exciting.In some parts, the editor creates suspense very carefully. The baseline of the story of Romeo & Juliet was told well.As an actor and Shakespeare fan, I disliked the film. It was too different to the original. The love is the there, but not perfectly captured. The part I disliked most of all, is that even a lot of the lines are modernised. The poetry don't seem to be there anymore. The famous balcony scene was far from perfect.If you are a movie fan and u know a bit about Romeo & Juliet, then I strongly recommend you watching this.If you are, as I, an actor/ actress and really enjoy the proper Shakespeare's masterpieces and really want to see how the prose and iambic pentameter is read, then I recommend you to watch the Romeo & Juliet film of 1968 directed by Franco Zeffirelli.I hoped this review has helped.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Set the Trends for the late 1990s and early 2000s,"William Shakespeare's masterpiece definitive romantic tale already had love, passion, tragedy and unbeatable literary genius. What Baz Luhrmann did was to turn up its volume, slap on the sunscreen and yell out (captured essentially through the way Leonardo DiCaprio cried in the murder scene) to the world in the midst of a 1996 drag party at the beach.And what a scream it let out too. Whilst not initially blockbuster fare, it hit the underground and worked itself into the mainstream due to its raw energy- what later became the hallmark of Baz Lurhmann's film signatures when he completed 2001's now celebrated, Moulin Rouge. The film was yelling out to the world way ahead of its time. From the fashion in the film, the stylings of the film all the way to the flair and even hairstyle of the lead characters, this film oozed trend-setter. That it went on to launch Leonardo DiCaprio and his floppy fringe, furrowed brow and a cigarette dressed in a suit without a tie (spanning millions of teenage admirers and copycats the world over), was just the one element of the show's powerful placement as one of the defining pieces of cinema in the 1990s.Till that time, teenage fare (if people even still consider this film to be as such) was considered fluffy - one must remember that the film was launched in 1996 - with only shows like 'My Own Private Idaho', 'Reality Bites' or even 'Clueless' before it, whilst it way ahead of the teenage movie formulaic explosion that took place after 1998/99, and even the better of those never could touch this film's raw energy, angst, stylistics nor emotion. That was how powerfully strong the undertones and reverberations surrounding this teenage culture defining movie of the 1990s was.And yet again, it was not just a teen flick- it had the essence of literary prose still entrenched in within, it had a flair for style unseen in any movie at the time (thereby establishing Baz Lurhmann as a revolutionary), and combined with the editing, musical layout & soundtrack (The Wannadies, etc) and sparklingly romantic scenes like the 'fish tank' wooing sequence, it was pure Shakespeare with a twist, and a delectable shout at the beach to stop the world to take notice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's just that the time was... right!,"For all the Shakespeare's greatness, filming the bard's works presents problems, owing to the static staging, the need for the cast to act unsubtly to convey the meaning of outdated language, and subject matter not obviously attuned to modern life.  The last problem is in fact a mirage, as beneath the surface concerns of his works, Shakespeare addresses universal themes, which is why many have tried to update his plays for modern times: but a straightforward modernisation misses the point that it is the language they contain, rather than their generic and contrived plotting, that makes them great in the first place.  Director Baz Luhrmann therefore tried a different strategy: change the style but keep the words.  So his 'Romeo + Juliet' is set in an apocalyptic hybrid of Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, and filmed as a cross between 'Dynasty' and a pop video, but retains all the original poetry.  The lurid result is surprisingly fresh, and huge amounts of imaginative fun are had in translation (my favourite details: the depiction of the clans' fathers, one as Ted Kennedy and one as a mafioso; the use of the swimming pool in the famous balcony scenes; and Romeo's exile as a hippy in the desert).  Some of this interpretation is over the top, but there's more hit than miss and even Mercutio (played by Harold Pirreneau as a drag queen) brings real passion to his death. As for the stars, Leonardo di Caprio, an actor of limited range, is well suited to this role, while Claire Danes smiles fluourescently and speaks the centuries-old dialgoue with the saucy naturalness of the contemporary American teenager. The tricksiness fades towards the end as Luhrmann concentrates on the intrinsic drama; but never do you feel like you are watching a play.

It's an ok well developed movie.,"I think that the movie was very well designed but not for my audience. I think that this movie is aimed at an older audience because there is a lot of terms new generations wouldn't understand. In my eyes the movie was very boring and the scenes had no backstory. I can tell by the design of the film, that for different audiences it can be shown as strong and powerful in the emotions and is good at keeping older audiences engaged. I think this film would be better if the scenes had more character description. Personally I think the film accurately produced a clash of new and old with the way the Shakespearian language but there are still cars and higher tech. Also, all the characters speak fluently and the costumes are well designed as they show the difference between lower and higher class. I also think that the film was very effective as it has mood dependent music per scene.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a disgrace,"Whoah, this movie just plain stank.  Who does Luhrmann think he is by adapting the brilliant Shakespeare play into a modern context?  The adaptation, infact is abysmal.  By keeping the Shakespearean language, but appropriating everything else makes the film seem very awkward and confusing. By restraining itself to the original language, the screenplay is horridly absurd and must the modern guns in the play are painfully engraved with the name ""SWORD"" to keep with the ""Draw your swords, etc""The acting was also horrible.  Claire Danes seemed very immature and Leo, well... where do I start?This movie was a complete disgrace to Shakespeare and should never have been even attempted.  Horrid.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Genius,"I was forced to read Romeo and Juliet in school over 20 years ago and didn't really ""get it"".I have latterly learnt to appreciate Mr S for his plays etc. etc.My 8 yr old daughter and I watched this tonight.

Romeo + Juliet,"Baz Luhrmann has relocated this classic to modern day Verona Beach and introduced a contemporary sound track to complement much of the original dialogue from the bard's story of true love, revenge and, quite possibly, the greatest tragedy ever written in the English language. The families ""Montague"" and ""Capulet"" have been feuding since God was a boy. The uneasy truce between them is to be severely tested when ""Romeo"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) and ""Juliet"" (Clare Danes) fall in love. Being from each of these warring tribes, they must keep their love clandestine in order to avoid conflict. As their affection grows, that secret proves harder and harder to keep - especially as ""Juliet"" has been betrothed and her father is determined that she shall be in the church on Tuesday next! I'm sure you all know the story of the ""star-crossed lovers"" and I rather enjoyed this adaptation. Unlike ""Carmen Jones"" (1954) which I did not think worked well being relocated, this does. The eclectic contrast between the motor cars, the revolvers and the original old English text is quite effective. The effort from DiCaprio gets better as the film progresses and by the denouement neither he nor Danes are half bad. Harold Perrineau is also competent as the brave ""Mercutio"" and the conniving ""Tybalt"" is well covered by John Leguizamo. Purists may well not admire the abridging of this lengthy story though. It is quite heavily condensed and at times that does rob the film of much of the original nuance - not that Luhrmann ever really concentrates on nuance anyway - but I'd rather look on this as an evolution of the story for modern times rather than a straight retelling. For me it worked, and is watchable still.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""....","I understand the basic motive of the producers of this thing-a-ma-bob, based on the work of Shakespeare, who based his upon other works of the period. It was a grand effort, but it fails miserably. To update this classic story to modern, hip-hop times and still keep the Elizabethan English in the script is a sort of a death warrant in and of itself. It is clumsy, corny, and a bit superfluous. It stumbles over its own two left feet. I suffered through one viewing of it, praying that it would soon be over. After what felt like an eternity, it finally was over. I would never want to sit through this movie again. It lacked character, substance, and credibility. Plus, there is a great deal of otherwise terrific talent wasted along the way. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino would be worth the price of admission alone, were it another, more credible vehicle. But they come off looking like fools in this play in search of an identity for itself. Leonardo does the best he can to make this thing work, but...terrific actor that he is...he simply does not have the depth to pull this one off. The direction was fast paced and intense, and that was one of the problems with it. The actors had no real opportunity to let the characters come to life and to allow the script to breathe. The result...it moves at too quick a pace, it never quite settles in, and the actors sound as if they are reciting their lines, as opposed to allowing the lines to be delivered at a credible, believable pace. The modernization of the story is also a sore point. To bring this story into the age of greed and moral degradation tends to over shadow the point...that this is a story of love and of just plain rivalry between two families that do not see eye to eye. Romeo and Juliet pay the price for the foolish attitudes of their families, a situation that rings as clear to-day as it did way back in the days of old. The producers wanted to take the story a step beyond ""West Side Story"", which was also a variation on the Romeo/Juliet tragedy...but it failed in this modern day translation. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was badly done because it had virtually no budget, and dealt with the death of a principal cast member during filming. This one had the budget, but it was still badly done, badly written, and badly executed. Maybe another production company will undertake the mantle and do a more respectable job.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Great flair and brightness, but not a very good idea.","Yes, I must admit this movie is extraordinarily fast-paced, bright, and attractive. Cinematography and sound track all great a great visual experimente, as in Moulin Rouge.However, the idea of the movie seems weird and a bit outlandish. One thing, you stay absolutely true to the Shakespearan original plot, cenarios, etc. (but obviously it wouldn't appeal to the public it set out to appeal) or you do a modern adaptation and bring the story to a modern context.The idea of reading 16th century baroque dialogues while shootings go on and fast cars roam just seems extremely strange and intriguing. It just feels like an unfortunate mix Shakespeare's undisputed prestige and action movie's undeniable attraction that doesn't really work that well.The two things are simply very different. It's like olive oil and water: they just don't mix no matter what you do or how hard you shake them.Still, worth a good look.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A wild & sometimes flabbergasting ride - but there is real strength here, too","I thought I was prepared for what this movie was going to be. I was wrong.Baz Luhrmann quickly established himself as a terrific filmmaker even with his joyful directorial debut, 1992's 'Strictly ballroom, let alone 2001 sensation 'Moulin Rouge!' - or more recently, 2022's 'Elvis.' But it's not just that his works are well made, compelling, and entertaining; he is known for nothing if not a penchant for heavily stylized spectacle, an approach that even informed his World War II drama 'Australia.' I've been long overdue to watch his modern take on Shakespeare with 1996's 'Romeo + Juliet,' and I fully anticipated the same mind for excess and splendor. What I did not anticipate was the extremes to which Luhrmann and his collaborators would lean into that whimsy, for I this well outpaces everything else in the man's body of work in terms of flair, pizazz, cheek, and bombast. To wit: this is possibly the most 90s film I've seen to date, with the production design, art direction, costume design, hair, makeup, music, and frankly even Luhrmann's direction, the cinematography, the editing, and the acting all reminding of the preposterous cartoonishness and vibrant color (figurative and literal) of not just 'Moulin Rouge!' at its most raucous, but 1997's 'The Pest,' 'Clueless,' 'An American werewolf in Paris, Guy Fieri, 'The Mask,' live-action Looney Tunes fare, 'Zoolander'... Well, you get the idea.With that free-wheeling abandon firmly in mind, any recommendation must be paired with a fair caveat; anyone who is not receptive to all the wide, wacky possibilities of the medium, and to titles that adopt such a nearly hubristic level of bold flippancy, may have a difficult time swallowing these two hours. All involved unreservedly embrace the spirit of the proceedings, and there's certainly something to be said for watching the cast (including some surprising, familiar names and faces) thusly letting loose, just as - whatever one specifically thinks of the most outrageous facets of the visuals - those operating behind the scenes turned in contributions that are solid and admirable in and of themselves. And hey, in fairness, some of Luhrmann's choices here really are fun, and funny, in adapting Bill Shakes; wherever the tale turns to a scene of more quiet, thoughtful drama and character moments, the feature just as ably shifts gears to allow such moments to resonate and hold more power than one might expect given all that surrounds them. The question does remain, though: even as the screenplay keeps The Bard's verses intact, is it possible that the drama is inherently diminished to some degree by the brazenness of the presentation? To the extent that 'Romeo + Juliet' does faithfully adapt the play of four centuries' past, is it possible that said brazenness inherently diminishes the strength of the play? I'm not 100% sure what the answer is, but the fact that these thoughts come to mind at all probably says something.It seems important to speak to the aesthetics and stylization first and foremost, not just because it is genuinely the first aspect to greet us from the very beginning, but also because it's so prominent at pretty much all points. If one can get on board with the flagrant wantonness, however, I can't say that the picture isn't well done, enjoyable, and satisfying just as it is. I deeply appreciate all the hard work that went into the production, and the skill and intelligence to churn out something so committed to its very particular idiom. However much we may scrutinize the treatment of the play, many beats really are tremendously sharp as they are realized here, including the lovers' encounter on the balcony, and the crucial scene where Tybalt and Mercutio have a bad day. Just as much to the point, there comes a time when the fancifulness begins to recede some into the background, allowing the earnest, meaningful drama to take center stage as events escalate. Despite some curious choices in the music - especially versions of popular songs - they're catchy and actually used quite well; the score is fantastic, with some select themes distinctly standing out, and always ably capturing the mood. And though some instances of acting are better than others, and every actor is sometimes subject to the observed immoderation, far more than not the cast is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio shows some moments of weakness, but we know how fine an actor he was even in his youth; Claire Danes gives a marvelously strong performance that arguably outshines all her co-stars. Those co-stars, having a blast and going where Luhrmann asks them to, include John Leguizamo, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Miriam Margolyes, Pete Postlethwaite, and Vondie Curtis-Hall, among many others.From the moment we press ""play"" this movie is a lot to take in and process, and I can't begrudge those who have a harder time engaging with something so far removed from the typical interpretation of Shakespeare, or to be honest, of much of cinema. Still, for all the wild ideas that define vast swaths of the length, there is also real, concrete value in Luhrmann's vision. 'Romeo + Juliet' is a decidedly unique updated rendition of so classic, celebrated, and poetic a play, but ultimately the weight it carries outshines its more stridently playful, garish flourishes. Compared to, say, Franco Zeffirelli's timeless 1968 adaptation, there's no disputing that this film is likely to appeal to and hold the favor of a more niche audience. Nonetheless, the capabilities of Luhrmann and all participants are affirmed once more, and if you're open to the embellishments this indulges, all told it really is commendable, and a good time, and worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A curse on both your houses!,"Wow, this was an awesome movie! and no I did not just see it, i saw it again. If I can only have swords like these boys do.From beginning to end this movie grips you and breathes new modern (and socially understandable) language into this film. Sure the words are the same, but there is so much of a difference from reading the book and watching this movie. In the book, it is dull and just seems to overflow with so much crud that is going on. I wish I was back in time watching these plays. The movie puts it all into perspective. Because the book is not descriptive 100 per cent, it is all language. Yeah yeah use my imagination to envision it, but I rather experience another's vision. Their vision might be totally something I would not expect, and it was. This movie was beautiful in images as it was in words. Hell it was all the director had to do because he had all the words already beautifully crafted for him. The interaction between characters was wonderfully displayed. The movie literally jumped out and grabbed my attention. come one gun wielding wild men from opposing sides screaming at each other death threats. How is this not entertaining. Hell how many American's watched the war in Iraq on CNN. This interests us. Whoever casted Mercutio was bloody brilliant. The whole before the ball scene, and the body language was just amazing. His death was something that always makes me love. Not because he died, but because of how it all played out. It was just sheer raw emotion.The story itself I just pity. Not because it sucks, but the subject matter. Makes me think about love and if it is even worth it. When you see a timeless movie that does not end your way you think about what you would have done. I myself would not change anything, but I am just sad that an honest and true love died. Does it exist in this world? Who knows.. All I know is, I wanted to be Romeo just to be with Juliet! I will safely say this is the best transition from book to big screen I have ever seen..although Sin City was amazing.

An interesting movie,"I usually don't like modern interpretations of Shakespeare. Hamlet, done in 19th Century Ruritania, never sat right with me. However, I really liked this one. I don't know how many of the cast were actually Shakespearean actors, but what interested me is that they didn't try to be. If Leonardo DiCaprio had declaimed and emoted and tried to chew up the scenery, he would have fallen flat. Instead, he just read the lines; and it worked. The same applies to the rest of the cast. They all just read the lines (convincingly, but not Shakespearean-ly) and got on with the play. I especially liked Miriam Margolyes playing The Nurse as a Mexican maid.

Very disappointing...,"I'm a huge fan of the original play and of Leonardo DiCaprio and the concept seemed fascinating: Set the play in modern times but have the original dialogue. Needless to say but the final result was awful. What was wrong with it? Well let me tell you.First, the use of Shakespearean dialogue in a modern setting took me out of the movie. It was very gimmicky and it didn't flow right. Second, the acting is pretty bad. Even Leonardo DiCaprio gives a very bland performance. Third, the direction and editing is really frantic and crazy. The beginning you are just wondering what is going on? This is especially bad because you are supposed to take the story seriously but it's so hard to do so because the way how the film is put together is laughably bad. and finally, the pacing is awful! I don't know how many times I checked my watch during the movie to see if it was going to be over soon or not.The only good thing I can say about this film is the art direction and costume design. It's all very well done but that's nowhere near enough to save this travesty of a film.Please, even if you are a die hard fan of Leonardo DiCaprio like I am and feel the need to see every single one of his movies, avoid this film at all costs.

This version of Romeo and Juliet can be interpreted in different ways.,"I recently watched this version of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". I did like it but there were parts that should have been done differently. I like the actors, I like how it is modernized and I like the original story of ""Romeo and Juliet"". I thought that in the beginning of the movie, there was a lot going on and that the movie would be hard to follow. After a little bit, I started to be able to understand what was going on and the movie got better. I also disliked how everything is modern except for how they are speaking. Some may find it funny but I don't. I would have preferred only certain parts to have the original writing. Although that is my opinion, I understand why it is written the way it is. If William Shakespeare wrote a book instead of a play, the movie would have modern day words, but it was written as a play, so it is spoken the way the play would have been. I would recommend you see this movie. I would also read the play and watch a different version of the movie. I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like. I also feel that if you only read the play and watch one version you have nothing to compare to and some people may prefer another version over the other. I prefer the 1960's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" mainly because that is sort of how I pictured the play to look like.

It's What Shakespeare Would Have Wanted.,"I understand why people might not like this movie, but I must respectfully disagree. The script is very loyal to the original play, and the modernized aesthetics are, in my opinion, very loyal to the ever too often overlooked spirit of so much of Shakespeare's work. Basically, it was pop-culture, and it was not drama but melodrama, every production was filled with innuendo and over the top characters. Because of the language and aesthetics of the time, Shakespeare can often feel somewhat boring or stuffy, so a version where those visual aesthetics have been updated to something we today (and at the time the firm was made) understand as over-the-top is somewhat genius, to be honest, it captures the essence of Shakespeare that is so often lost in modernity.Beyond the (surely annoying) lit analysis, the casting is also great - not even just because of Paul Rudd, this movie also has my absolute favourite version of Mercutio!All in all I think this movie gets a bad rap sometimes because its a bit more fun and indulgent than most adaptations, but that's what makes it so great!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, but not very good","While a much bigger-budget and more ""serious"" work, this isn't really nearly as good as Luhrmann's earlier _Strictly Ballroom_.This wildly experimental movie is, overall, a dismal (albeit instructive) failure. The plot narrative arc runs parallel to _Strictly Ballroom_, beginning in a much wilder, freer, more experimental style early in the picture, shifting gradually over to a more conventional mode of storytelling about a quarter of the way in. As with the earlier picture, I wonder if the real reason for the switch is not that Luhrmann simply ran out of steam and energy for the frenetic editing.The biggest failing is in the casting. While both exceptionally pretty, neither Danes nor diCaprio ever come to grips with the meaning in their lines -- falling victim to the most common failing when doing Shakespeare, they never manage to forget that the lines are supposed to be POETRY. Several supporting players, most notably Harold Perrineau as Mercutio and John Leguizamo as Tybalt, overcome this problem with ease. Perrineau in particular is flatly amazing, easily stealing every scene; that's not hard with material like Mercutio, but as so often happens with this play, a good Mercutio serves no end so much as to show up the weaknesses of the story in general (to wit, these are all a bunch of witless adolescents that most of us wouldn't give a thought to outside of The Theatre).Good eye candy, and some really fine performances (although none from the principles).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting interpretation.,"This is a good film. Be warned, however, that some of the dialogue has been cut. You will notice this from the very first scene (incidentally my personal favourite Shakespeare scene) but I do not think that this distracts from the plot or the quality of the great playwright himself. It has been modernised to best of anyone's ability, and it is to Lurhmann's that this still looks like a Shakespeare, and has most of the dialogue making sense in a modern setting.This is actually one film in which Leonardo DiCaprio acts well, as helped by a great cast, including stellar performances by Harold Perrineau and John Leguizamo. All of the symbols used in he production were effective, if a little obvious, and all in all this film is slick and true to the original, down to even the minutest details. Even though little tributes to the original setting sometimes are a little 'in your face', they are nice, and further add to the sense of respect the film has for the play.I am a great one for conventional, traditional performances of Romeo and Juliet, but I have to say that this is a very good film, and grips to the last, even though everyone knows what happens.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's very good,"Part 2 of Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain Trilogy: 'Romeo + Juliet'.I remember watching a little bit of this years and years back at high school and I seem to recall enjoying it a lot.

It's probably the weakest performance I've seen from DiCaprio so far, though that's just through process of elimination as he's still impressive here as Romeo. Claire Danes (Juliet) merits props, also.John Leguizamo (Tybalt) is the pick of the rest of the cast, which also includes the likes of Paul Sorvino, Miriam Margolyes and Paul Rudd. Speaking of the casting, apparently 14-year-old Natalie Portman was originally cast to star alongside DiCaprio (then 21... dodgy!).I love the modern day set up and how they bring this famous tale to life in it, though I do think the choice to use Shakespearean dialogue was perhaps the wrong call.

Oh My....,"I just finished watching the movie about ten minutes ago, so it's pretty fresh in my mind. Odd. Very, very odd. Perhaps I'm biased due to the fact that I have a strong dislike for DiCaprio, but that was very odd. The costuming was--way out there somewhere. It was put together oddly. The death scene (which to me broke the show)--gosh, why not keep it the way Shakespeare had written it? There was no Paris/Romeo tryst (I suppose that would be a bit abstract with guns--yet another of the movie's downfalls), and Juliet woke up before Romeo was completely dead! I saw a very real TITANIC flash-back right about then--must he do all his death scenes the same? Mercutio was made to be MUCH too annoying in my opinion, so I felt it hard to pity Romeo when his best friend is killed. They murdered the balcony scene completely!Maybe it's just that I'd prefer the Old English swords and parties to modernized adaptations. I wouldn't recommend it, or WEST SIDE STORY, while I'm at it.If you like abstract and weird, go for it. But I prefer traditional Shakespeare, and I found it hard to enjoy it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Weird,"I felt very weird from the very beginning of the movie when they had this character introduction. It was my first movie that showed the character introduction in a movie.

I think it's special, unique and nice try but I feel like it was way too much. Putting Shakespeare's work into modern society made the whole movie so awkward. Also, having the same script as the original wasn't a great idea, because it all seemed so awkward and foolish.Also the actors are kind of very overacting. I feel that their acting should be less overacting because in modern days, overacting isn't something that is normal. Because of the overacting, I feel like the whole movie became so awkward and crazy. I really didn't like it and it is not my type.

Splendid,"Very underrated modernization of the classic Shakespeare play. This movie has been pretty heavily criticized for the directors outlandishness in cinematography, but he understands when to tone down the often frantic pace of the storytelling during the dramatic scenes, and in fact this relationship tends to amplify their potency. Beautifully choreographed and shot, wonderfully acted by both the supporting cast and the main 2 stars, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, and extremely sly modernization techniques to the dialogue. All the elizabethan dialogue remains intact, yet it all seems coherent in the modern atmosphere. Mostly due to good imagery and double meaning in the phrases (ex: their swords being a gun model, or the flash of money while quoting gold.).

In only few points did the dialogue bother me and that was when there wasn't great deal to say.In the end, the movie was really entertaining with a touch of magic in it(especially in the water tank sequence).

Call me old fashioned, but if a director interprets one of the finest theatrical works in the English language, it seems to me that he needs to do a better job than this.Harold Perrineau did a decent job at Mercutio in the context of a film that just doesn't get it done. Too bad that some pretty good acting talent was wasted on this weak project. Rate this a 1.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Underestemated,"I admit it's one that I needed to watch more then once. It's not an easy movie. But each time I appreciate it more. Why?1 It has the absolute best 'a plague on both your houses' scene ever. Harold Perrineau is ...fantastic as Mercutio. Shakespeare himself would be throwing flowers on stage. Forget Leo and Claire. Perineau shines and sparkles in every possible way. His drag performance is simply unforgettable. But his death speech is truly magnificent and will be rewatched long after Leo, Claire and Baz Luhrman have been forgotten. It is a scene that every aspiring actor in the next 200 yrs will be watching.2 Baz Luhrman choice of style.The film is a feast for the eye. Fun, beautiful and highly dramatic. Basically the 3 keywords to describe Shakespeare's work in general and Romeo and Julliet in specific. The score us brilliant. It wouldn't surprise me that the score has sold better then the movie. Pumping beats, romantic violins and a boy's choir performing Prince's 'when doves cry'.The quick movements and flashing neo images give it a restless vibe befitting a story of burning love, high passions and hateful violence.I do admit that it tends to get chaotic, loud and tiring too. If there's an equivalent for musac or easy listening in film. This isn't it. The constant sparkle gets a little overwhelming. Probably one off the reasons lots of people don't like it. But people who actually know Shakespeare should at least understand why Luhrman chose this vibe.3 the extra's. Paul Rudd, Dash Mihok, Diane Venora, Pete Postlehwait and. Miriam Margoyles give it there all and without them the film would've severly suffered. There absence wouldn't have just been noticed. It would've done damage.4. John Lequizamo. His Tybalt is good. Not as good as Perineau's Mercutio but pretty damn good. Despite the combination off Shakespeare's English with modern costumes, weapons and drugs both Perineau and Lequizamo make u forget everything else but their characters.5. Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes. U want to see the young, idealistic stars when they where still madly in love with their craft? Watch Romeo + Juliet.Yes, I get why people might have a hard time getting through this one. It's noisy, fast paced, chaotic and the combo off old English with cowboyboots and dragqueens takes some getting used to. But the brilliant acting, the impressive score and the love for the original, bursting out off every seam, is redemption enough for me.I have no doubt that Shakespeare would've loved it. So who am I to disagree?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrible movie. And if you can't stand Shakespeare? Only worse...,"Out of the millions of amateur screenwriters wanting their works to be filmed, how could anyone, even Hollywood, contemplate the production of a piece of junk like this? It's like making an ad to help the homeless, yet all the money used is wasted on capitalists who add to the destruction of society.If you read a bad review on this movie, I can assure you that all the material has merit to be true. This is what this movie is: A chunk of young Hollywood stars who who prefer good looks over performance,  in a modern day action movie filled with MTV-styled pop music, speaking 16th century English and you let a drunk 14 year old film it all, handheld. Now, that would of had the potential to be at least unintentionally funny. But it wasn't. It was like taking continuous dosages of Caffeine, Alcohol, Ritalin, Laxatives, and Sugar.

"Well, I liked it.","Baz Lurhmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" doesn't even come close to ""Moulin Rouge""(a truly beautiful, artistic film IMO);it is uneven in numerous instances and the editing usually is a bit too wild. Having said this however, I would like to admit that I enjoy this movie. Baz is wonderfully creative, and even if the results aren't entirely successful, there's still more imagination here than in many other mainstream films. And what about the scene at the party, where Romeo and Juliet regard each other through the fish tank? That is a genuinely lovely, tender moment, as is the balcony(or pool)scene. But for those who find this version too iconoclastic, try the Zeffirelli version; I like them both.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love this movie.,I watched this movie when I was 21. It was great. I absolutely love the music and it was so well done. Radiohead knocked it out of the park. I loved the dialect. The way they did the story. All the obviously foreshadowing. The actors are just really perfect for the roles. Claire and Leonardo are beautiful and look amazing together. When I watched this I knew Claire Diane's would do great things and I was right. She is a strong actress. Leo of course brilliant. The shoot outs and the last scenes and exit music are just brilliant. I know this movie got a lot if hate from critics at the time but those who do not watch this with some admiration are just crazy.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Tragic Love in a Dystopian Alternate Universe,"In 1996, I got my first tenure-track position as an English teacher. That spring, I arranged my first field trip to take the entire ninth grade to see Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet in a local theater. It was a huge hit. I'm retiring from the same position after 27 years, and for 27 years I've used this film to support my teaching of the play. It's simply the most exciting, creative, and visually arresting Shakespeare film adaptation I've ever seen. I think American students understand the language better when it's delivered in American accents and cadences, and they understand the conventions of American media and action films, which enhances their comprehension. But the best aspect is the preservation of Shakespeare's original language, which is the most important part of any production. Some of the delivery by DiCaprio, Danes, John Legiizamo as Tybalt, and surprisingly, seasoned actor Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Lawrence, is a bit...off. Leo's breathless delivery of ""They (lips)pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair"" has him getting the meaning of the line wrong, like a precocious student who's sure of his nuanced misinterpretation. He should have studied Leonard Whiting's delivery in Zeffirelli's version. But on the whole, the entire concept works brilliantly. Harold Perrineau's Mercutio was a wonderful, fearless performance. Another standout was Paul Sorvino's mobster Lord Capulet, jovial and dangerous. Paul Rudd's bland, goofy, somewhat clueless Paris was a harbinger of his future career. But the real star is the production design: the creation of a dystopian alternate universe that increasingly seems to resemble the world that has followed in its wake: at once beautiful and ugly, worshipping wealth and violence at the expense of the poor and vulnerable, ""where civil blood makes civil hands unclean."" And the play is bursting with Shakespearean visual allusions, which only add to the pleasure of watching. Overall the conceit has caused the film to age well. Better, I'm afraid, than the society around it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""It was always you and me, always and forever!""","(Baz Luhrmann's) William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (1996) -Although I enjoyed 'Strictly Ballroom' (1992) and the second half of 'Moulin Rouge!' (2001) once they stopped being so silly, this will always be the best of the 'Baz Luhrmann Red Curtain Trilogy' for me. It wasn't as daft as 'Moulin' and was slightly more accessible than 'Strictly' for someone who isn't Australian and can't dance to anything except 'The Time Warp'.I would say that I probably enjoyed it more when I first watched it at the cinema upon its release in 1996, but I think that because the story itself is such a classic it will always carry some weight and some level of entertainment.Although the thumb biting opening was a bit annoying and might have put me off if I hadn't known what was to come and there were in fact a lot more silly bits than I had remembered, it still had an impact that really took affect once the doomed lovers Juliet (Clare Danes) and Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) finally met.I've always thought that Clare Danes actually shone in her role of Juliet and was unappreciated. I felt that she should have gone on to do a lot more as an actor. The Shakespearean language suited her delivery better than it did Leo as Romeo, who, at times, seemed a bit like a high school production of his part, especially early on in the film.That's not to say that Leo did a bad job, he was actually quite appropriate as the goofy lovestruck boy, but Paul Rudd, who played the competition for Juliet's love, could have delivered it with a bit more weight perhaps.Paul Rudd would always have been my first choice as Romeo anyway, he was obviously available to play the part and he's just beautiful.I imagine that Leo was chosen for his youth however.I also couldn't tell if Paul was playing ""Dave"" Paris as a gay character or not, because there was certainly something about him.I did like John Leguizamo in his role. I thought that he was perfect as Tybalt. He was villainous and nasty, a massive difference from his knee-walking, bad accented Toulouse Lautrec from 'Moulin Rouge'.Once the direction and delivery was allowed to be serious it was really enjoyable and the comedy that Will Shakespeare had probably intended was apt, but getting through the sillier bits was tough to start off.What I really enjoyed though, was that it somehow managed to take the extreme passion of the story and make it believable for the more modern setting and I believed that it was still a relevant depiction nearly 30 years later.I also thought that it could be made again today without too much of a change. I recently watched the 'Romeo & Juliet (TV Movie)' (2021) featuring Josh O'Connor and I thought that production achieved what this one was trying to in that same respect. People still want to see accessible versions of this familiar and renowned work.At the time of its release I remember thinking that this one was a great way to make the epic and long living story more available for a younger, newer audience. I still believed that watching this time, but my Niece who watched it at school only 10 years ago disagreed. I'd love to make her watch the version that I saw at school, a film from the 1970's and then see what she thought of this one.The quality of the film couldn't really be disputed. They chose a great location with Rio De Janeiro in Brazil as the backdrop, the Verona of Shakespeare's play and the majority of the props and costume, with the exception of Romeo's wedding suit, seemed very apt.The soundtrack however really stole the whole show. I still listen to it regularly and a number of the songs feature on my iPhone playlist.By the end I was enjoying the film as much as I had the first time I watched it and when the actual tragic moment at the end came I truly thought that it was cleverly done and different to what I'd seen before with other interpretations. I could appreciate the drama and hurt of the loss more for how it was handled.All in all it doesn't rank at the top my films list, but it was definitely a great production of a superb tale.732.88/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Leo does Shakespeare.  Oh, goody.","I was first introduced to Shakespeare freshman year at high school.  Sure, it was a bit tough at first, but I got used to it.  Romeo and Juliet was a terrific play.  Then came the time in class when we would watch the video adaptations of this play.  We spent half the period on the '68 version, then half on this one, which went on for a few days.  The '68 version was very well done, and most of the class liked it.  Then we watched the ""new"" one. I didn't know what to expect, but I thought it might be good.  Then I see the Montagues cruising the expressway in an open top convertable.  OK, so it's in modern times.  It might be good.  Then I heard them speak.  Dear God, what were they thinking?!I see this fight at a gas station where everyone looks like they're on speed and they shout these Shakespearean lines like they're normal for the time. I should've seen it coming when, instead of a narrator, a news caster does the prologue.  Great job.  Tip to the writers: if you're going to put Shakespeare in modern times, don't include the original lines.  ""Draw the sword!""  What ""sword?""  I saw no sword in the movie.  I saw some guns.  Is this what Shakepeare would call guns nowadays?  And do I see news reports and beach parties where people actually speak in blank verse?  And let's not forget Leonardo DeCaprio.  How much more pathetic can his acting get?  I hardly saw any good actors in this movie.  I don't know why people would see this as ""good"" entertainment.  Rarely do I ever give a 1 out of 10 to any movie, but this was just plain garbage.  If you want to see the real Romeo and Juliet, watch the '68 adaptation.  It is much more worthy to be called a work of Shakespeare's.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sex, Violence and bad jokes (every thing that makes Shakespeare good)","Here are some facts to think about,All plays and movies are interpretations. Imagine ""The Matrix"" with Wil Smith as Neo and Val Kilmer as Morpheaus (don't laugh, it nearly happened). Even the Bard was interpreting a place he himself had never been to.Shakespeare was such a great writer his work can be taken and changed and reworked and reinterpreted in so many ways, yet his writing remains good and true. No other play write stands for such treatment and reinterpreting Shakespeare is the greatest honor that can ever be done to his work.Shakespeare is always cut and edited. There are many alternative versions of Shakespeare's plays, but we only see one version because for a long time British scholars refused to publish alternative versions (the bastards) and kept them from the public.This version is loved by so many people, it does everything to try make the characters real to us to our now and true to the Elizabethen theatrical tradition.Sometimes it fails. The first 20 minutes are generally disliked by audiences, but then the point was to make audience know in no uncertain terms this is not classical Shakespeare. But I think they were trying to hard at the start.The interpretation of the balcony scene in interesting but it leaves out some of my favourite lines from Romea and Juliet.The dedication of the actors to the project is fantastic. some reviewers see the the actors as trying to get through their lines as quickly as possible, but when you consider Leonardo Di Caprio when to Australia (flying Coach) to make a video version of the movie to convince studio execs to finance the project.The scene that makes the movie, the scene everyone remember is Romeo dressed as knight, falling in love through a fish tank with Juliet dressed as angel. One of the most beautiful love scenes every filmed, with no dialog (hence no Shakespearean help).One of the most interesting films ever. Not perfect, but captures everything I love about Shakespeare. That is blood, sex, violence, bad jokes and so on.One last point. In Shakespeare's time people filled the time of the play with dialog. The dialog can be cut and many ideas told with language of cinema. If you are a purist you wouldn't like real Shakespeare anyway.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet,"In the nineties films based upon works of literature were commonly given an official title incorporating the name of the author of the work, so this film was at the time often referred to as ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" rather than simply ""Romeo and Juliet"". There was, apparently, a technical reason for this connected with copyright law, but some viewers and reviewers took this form of title as an indication that the film would be more faithful to the original book than previous attempts to film it had been. This might be true of something like the Kenneth Branagh ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"", but it is certainly not true of this film. Derek Jarman's version of ""The Tempest"" probably remains the most eccentric Shakespearean film adaptation I have seen, but Baz Luhrmann's runs it close.Luhrmann transfers the action to a modern American city, ""Verona Beach"", with the Montagues and Capulets represented as rival criminal gangs masquerading as legitimate businesses. The idea of portraying the two families as feuding gangsters is not an original one. It is copied straight from Leonard Bernstein's musical ""West Side Story"" and the film that was made from it. Like the Jets in the musical, Luhrmann's Montagues are white Anglo-Saxons, whereas his Capulets, like the Sharks, are Hispanic. (Mercutio, who belongs to neither side despite his friendship with Romeo, is black). ""White Anglo-Saxon"" does not, however, in this context equate to ""Protestant""; both families are obviously Catholic, and the film is notable for its use of Catholic religious imagery, with rosaries, religious statues, etc., much to the fore.The difference between the two films is that ""West Side Story"" keeps the basic outline of Shakespeare's story, modernising it and transferring it to 1950s New York, but changes the names of the characters and does not use any of Shakespeare's words. Luhrmann, however, retains Shakespeare's original dialogue (in an abridged form), and only makes minor changes to the plot; for example, the Prince becomes Captain Prince, the local police chief, Friar Lawrence becomes Father Lawrence (a priest rather than a friar) and swords are replaced by guns. (This does not, however, necessitate any change in the dialogue; 'Sword' becomes the name of a gun manufacturer).Luhrmann's film suffers from a problem common to a number of cinematic attempts to modernise Shakespeare. There is a jarring contrast between the modern setting and the sixteenth-century language, and an even more jarring contrast between that setting and the sixteenth century attitudes which that language expresses. These contrasts are not normally an issue in the theatre, which is a very different medium and which does not generally aim for the same degree of realism as the cinema. Filmed Shakespeare generally works better when the director either keeps the traditional setting (as Zeffirelli did with his ""Romeo and Juliet"") or transfers it to a fantasy setting (as Branagh did with his ""Much Ado about Nothing"" or Trevor Nunn with his ""Twelfth Night"", to take two other examples from the nineties).To give an example of what I mean by a ""jarring contrast"", it seems odd to see on screen a late twentieth-century American police officer threatening, in antique language, two warring gang bosses with the death penalty if their followers cause any more trouble. Our instincts are to ask ""But what about their constitutional rights? What about due process?"" To reply that the police officer is supposed to represent a absolute Renaissance Italian ruler is no real answer; it merely invites the further question ""Then why not keep a setting in which rulers do have absolute powers of life and death?""The film's other main drawback is that neither of the leads are very good. In 1996 Leonardo DiCaprio was still in the pretty-boy, heartthrob stage of his career; indeed, he must be one of the few Romeos in history to be prettier than his Juliet, the pointy-chinned Claire Danes. Serious acting for DiCaprio was something that would not come until some years later, and here he is bland and uninteresting. Natalie Portman was originally cast as Juliet, but Luhrmann sacked her after production began, apparently because he was unhappy with the age difference between her (15 at the time) and DiCaprio (22). As, however, Danes is only two years older than Portman, and plays the role in a very ""adolescent"" way, with a breathy voice and a perpetual expression of wide-eyed innocence, I am not sure that the change in casting made any real difference.I didn't like Harold Perrineau's camp, lisping Mercutio; he appeared to be trying to imply a gay sub-text into the relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, which struck me as inappropriate. Some of the actors playing the Capulets, notably Paul Sorvino as Old Capulet and Miriam Margolyes as the Nurse, affected odd foreign accents, while others, such as Danes, spoke in standard American accents. There were, however, acting performances I liked, such as John Leguizamo, who brought the necessary arrogance and swagger to Tybalt, Pete Postlethwaite's dignified Father Lawrence and Vondie Curtis-Hall's authoritative Prince.Luhrmann's direction is a bit too flashy for my taste, with excessive use of cross-cutting, but he does bring a good deal of pace and excitement to many scenes, especially the fight scenes. Despite my reservations about the basic concept, and some of the acting performances, I have given the film an above-average mark, largely because it is Shakespeare, and you can't go too far wrong with Shakespeare, at least not with a play as great as ""Romeo and Juliet"". (You could probably go very wrong with something like ""Troilus and Cressida"" or ""Titus Andronicus"", but not too many people try to film those plays). ""Romeo + Juliet"" is always watchable, if only as an interesting experiment. It does not, however, compare to the really great Shakespearean films such as the Zeffirelli version of this story. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"One of the most brilliant and stunning movies, ever.","Having seen this movie when it first came out in 1996, I immediately went out and bought it. I just watched in again today on HBO, a pleasant surprise to see it again. I can't get over how clever and brilliant this movie was done. Everything from the casting to the cinematography blows me away. John Liuguizama as Tybalt was just insane. He played the hell out of that role. No one could have done a better job than he. He prowled on the screen, like the Prince of Cats that he is and all eyes were on him.I also really dug the fact that both set of kinsmen were totally different from each other. The Capulets were dark haired, Spanish looking men-reminded me of gang members in east L.A. and the Montagues were fair-skinned and kinda punk rock looking. Stark contrasts to each other but equally as deadly with words and weapons.My biggest gripe has always been the casting of Claire Danes as Juliet. I always felt that Juliet should be physically stunning-my choice would have been Keira Knightly. But, she did balance both the innocence and impulsiveness of a lovesick teenager with the heartbreaking realism of true love and romance.So, I guess she was OK. DiCaprio really was the star of this movie. His intensity, passion and tenderness shone brightly from beginning to end. The last scenes in the church between Romeo and his wife at her""wake"" are the most beautiful, sweet, loving shots on film. Especially when he puts the ring back on her finger- so raw and pure. There are so many other things I could say about this movie-but it is kind of hard to put it all in words. I'll just keep those to myself. But I do thank all the people who made it possible for the rest of us to enjoy a truly lovely and heartbreaking movie.

"Modernized Shakespeare? Good Intent, Terrible Movie","I have long been a fan of Shakespeare.  It has always amazed me that a person could write an entire play as a series of poems.  The man was a genius.  Modernizing Shakespeare for the teens of today is a good idea - but this movie falls terribly short.After seeing this movie (I can't believe I watched the whole thing - I guess I thought it would get better), I was thoroughly disgusted.  There are several reasons.  First, the acting itself was terrible, except for John Leguizamo as Tybalt, who did a magnificent job. Leo and Claire both seemed as though they were reading most of their lines from cue cards - there was little if any emotion involved.  This movie also destroyed the true relationship between Mercutio and Romeo, it turns Romeo into a druggie and Mercutio into nothing more than his dealer.  What kid of today who uses drugs would seek revenge for the death of his dealer? None. They would simply seek out a different one.  I can understand trying to remain true to Shakespeare's words, however, there were many times in the movie that doing so did not make sense.This movie would probably have been much better if it had not used Shakespeare's dialog.  The cast itself isn't bad, but for the most part they did not seem comfortable with the original dialog.  If they would have modernized the dialog along with the visual aspects, I might have enjoyed it more.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Took a while to used to the original dialogue in this Tarentino-ish retelling,"I'm glad I finally watched this but I'll be honest I struggled to stay with this slick, fast paced update of the Shakespeare tragedy. I wasn't expecting the original dialogue and it took a bit to get used to.Leo steals and captivates every scene that he's in though; so young, so cute and so talented, just amazing and it was through him that I eventually got into the movie. It's a very modern MTV-ish sort of retelling set in the violent, hip netherworld of Verona beach where the gun-toting Montague and the Capulet families battle for power and territory.At times this felt like a Quentin Tarentino movie in its visual style, cool music and random bizarreness. Great performances all-round but especially from Harold Perrineau, Romeo's gender bending friend and John Leguizamo as his arch rival. The big battle between these three is when the movie really took off ""a plague on both your houses"" and the last half an hour is captivating as our star-crossed lovers meet their tragic destiny all because of stupid UPS. 9/20/14",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Epic love story with an amazing soundtrack,"Baz Luhrmann's bold and audacious take on the classic tragedy is a cinematic triumph that breathes new life into the timeless tale of love and tragedy.First off, the casting is pure perfection. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the star-crossed lovers are an absolute dream. Their chemistry is palpable, and they bring a youthful and electric energy to the iconic roles. DiCaprio's Romeo is both passionate and vulnerable, while Danes's Juliet is fiery and determined. They make you believe in the intensity of their love, making the tragedy all the more heartbreaking.But let's talk about the real star of the show - the visual spectacle. Luhrmann's direction is a feast for the eyes, with its vibrant colors, bold aesthetics, and inventive storytelling. The use of modern-day settings mixed with Shakespearean language creates a unique and immersive world that feels both familiar and fresh.The soundtrack is an absolute knockout. The blend of contemporary hits and original compositions adds a layer of excitement and emotional depth to the narrative. It's a soundtrack that perfectly complements the film's visual style, making it a true audiovisual delight.Now, I know some purists might argue that the modern setting and pop music detract from the authenticity of the original play. But honestly, I think Luhrmann's bold vision breathes new life into the story, making it accessible and relatable to a whole new generation.The film's pacing is intense, driving the story forward with a relentless energy that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a roller-coaster ride of emotions, with moments of pure joy and heartbreak intertwined seamlessly.In conclusion, Romeo + Juliet is a cinematic gem that pays homage to Shakespeare while forging its own path. The powerful performances, stunning visuals, and captivating soundtrack make it a must-watch for both fans of the classic play and those new to the story.If you're in the mood for a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film that reimagines a beloved classic, Romeo + Juliet is the one to watch. It's a timeless love story told with a modern twist, leaving you with a rush of emotions and a newfound appreciation for the power of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a wonderful update! I loved it!,"I was only about 9 years old when this movie had first been released and I hadn't been able to see it until now. I am 14 now, and I read Romeo and Juliet, the play, for English as most freshmen like me have. I had to watch both versions of the movie as well (the 1968 Zeffirelli version and this 1996 version). As you could probably predict, I enjoyed the 1996 version better, mainly because it is a version I can relate to more. I had to watch it in class and then the following weekend, I went out and bought it because I enjoyed it so much.I really don't like Shakespeare at all, and I don't know much about ""how good"" actors are speaking in Old English, but I thought overall, Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were good at it. Cut them some slack, they are both 2 very talented young actors and for this being their first time doing a Shakespeare film, they did pretty damn well if you ask me. Their chemistry onscreen was good, but it could've been better. I'd have to say that the parts they performed their best in were when they met across the fishtank (There was no dialogue, but their faces really said it all. I also thought that was very romantic), and the night before Romeo's banishment from Verona, in Juliet's room. The death scene was a surprising twist from the play, and it put me in tears.But, I think they should've spent more time on the wedding scene. It felt like that was only going on for 1 minute. What I also didn't like was the relationship between Romeo and Mercutio. Mercutio... a drug dealer? The two were supposed to play best friends but they only seemed like casual acquaintances and ""drug buddies"" in this movie.The special effects were great, and the music was wonderful. In my opinion, I truly enjoyed this movie a lot. Good acting, and an excellent modern remake on an old classic. This is a movie today's teenagers will enjoy, but if you're older, I would think that you would like the '68 version because it keeps the traditional stuff. (At least my parents liked the 1968 version better). I really think you should go out and rent it. You'll be happy you did.**********/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Baroque drama in a rave party landscape.,"A movie in which this text is faithfully interpreted should be a pretty movie even with eyes closed. We should agree that theoretically there is no better dramatic text than any classic from the pen of Shakespeare. From this I deduce that at least half of the artistic purpose of the film is satisfactorily resolved.
We could discuss its aesthetics although I think that has to do with personal taste.
A wannabe contemporary drama through the post-modern setting of the rave parties landscapes and an aesthetic halfway between cyber-punk and techno of the second half of the 90s that refers to other movies of the decade. In this way it achieves the task of transferring such an important text to those days.
I think that Baz Luhrmann could not have thought of a better way to recreate a paradigmatically baroque play that also containes his so characteristic aesthetic universe.
The simplicity or complexity of the characters can not be discussed either; Only the performances can be questioned, but they develop favorably through the remarkable work of the actors.
Be careful because if you are willing to contemplate the most famous love story in the world in a truly unprecedented environment, this can become one of your favorite dramas.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seriously?,"I guess if you're a high school drama teacher trying to get your 9th graders to take interest in Shakespeare, or help them understand Romeo + Juliet, I could see why someone might give this a high rating....If you like over the top, obvious, corny bits....If you can get past Olde English in a modern day setting....If mediocre or excessively obnoxious acting is your thing....If the idea of guns manufactured by a company named ""Swords"" makes it okay to actually refer to them as ""swords"" doesn't make you roll your eyes at the sheer lack of creativity....If Claire Danes' face wasn't as irritating as her acting.If you can get past how stupid, corny and horrible this adaptation is, it's actually very good.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Innovative,"I think this film is very innovative. The director took a whole new approach to film the Shakespeare's classic. Instead of purely making the words visual, the film reinvents the story. The story is set in modern times, you see cars, guns, helicopters, ambulance, express courier services etc. Apart from the obligatory electronic music, you even get altar boys singing hard rock! Romeo & Juliet experience is taken to new heights. I never noticed the female lead, Claire Danes. She is so adorable! I wonder why is she not in more films. I definitely recommend this film!",,Anonymous,Romance

The movie that made Claire Danes a star,"Romeo + Juliet (1996) was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, ""This is Juliet."" Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, ""A plague on both your houses,"" he makes you understand that he means it.R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it.This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Two households, both alike in stupidity...","Shakespeare for stupid people.  Many people, Americans mostly, are terrified of Shakespeare.  They feel that they aren't smart enough for it.  They panic over the language, not understanding that if they can't hear or ""get"" what is being said, it's time to blame the actors.  Then there are the people who, by wasting their educations, really are that ignorant.  So, the makers of this film, decided to dumb the whole thing down instead of investing the movie with a certain level of intelligence.  Incompetent trash.

Rent or buy Zeffirelli's 1968 version rather than waste your money on this garbage,"Luhrmann's unoriginal reworking of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (the American youth gang scenario had been used many times before, once on film and over a dozen times on the stage) is a shallow experience, devoid of soul, with a feeble performance by Leonardo di Caprio. On every level, it fails. If you want to see a truly great interpretation of this classic, watch Zeffirelli's inspired and stunning 1968 version.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. This one didn't.","Many classic stories and epics have been updated to be set in different time periods than when they were originally intended. Branagh's ""Hamlet"" updated it to the nineteenth century. The 1995 French film ""Les Miserables"" had the classic story set in World War II. Christopher Lambert's ""Beowulf"" was set 2000 years hence in a post-apocalyptic future. Even Frankenheimer's ""Island of Dr. Moreau"" was relocated to present day.This film seemed to start the trend, however. It's been set in present day Miami, and all in all, it's an excellent and absorbing film. The cast is great--especially Danes, DeCRAPio, and Leguizamo-- and the direction is crisp. The camera work is also dazzling, and it gives the familiar story of the Star-crossed lovers new colors.But despite the pluses in this film, there is still just something odd about seeing an African-American male in dred locks carrying a gun (with the word ""Sword"" cleverly written on it) and saying, ""Draw forth thou sword!"" I almost wish that they had relocated this film back to the way Shakespeare had intended it-- in the dawn of the Rennaisance. Everything about this film and its camera work and all the odd things about it work fine for Shakespeare, except for the fact it's been relocated. I had to keep reminding myself that this film was set in modern day, because the language told me otherwise. When I first saw it, I was terribly confused because of the cars and the guns and the skyscrapers.... The way they handled it made me feel like I was watching a film taking place in the far past. There could have been some way that the director could have made it more ""modern"" and still keep the classic language. Instead, all the moderations just feel out of place.This doesn't make it a bad movie, however. It's still mesmerizing. It's definitely a good date film (especially if you're a guy...expect your date to be crying in you shoulder), and it keeps your attention. Give it a try, and just keep in mind that it does take place in present day, even though it makes it really confusing. But that's okay. If you understand half of what they're talking about anyway, you're doing fine.*** out of ****",,Anonymous,Romance

A Flim That's Hard to Take,"I just found this film to be pretentious and at times untentionally funny. What really makes Romeo + Juliet hard to take is scenes which consist of the dialog being delivered via shouting (unintelligibly). Not only can the overacting be able to garner in some laughs, it's certain scenes that almost feels like something out of a sitcom like for example, the balcony scene (which here takes place in a swimming pool).  Also, the camera work is often bungled here.  Certain areas in Romeo + Juliet are either overblown (like a car chase a one point), incredibly cartoonish, or incorporate unnecessary imagery.  A perfect example of scenes consisting of unnecessary imagery, is a scene which consist of a character picking up a gun (pondering weather or not to kill themself).  The problem with that particular scene is that the camera work incorporates blurry, slow moving, imagery which not only is distracting, but also (if you look further into it) makes a sensation out of suicide.  And speaking of areas in the film that can use a deeper examination, I somehow get a feeling that there's some hidden fascinating with the Roadrunner cartoons e.g. the opening montage which consist of everything moving at a fast pace before there's a sudden freeze frame and we're soon introduced to the characters (just like in the cartoons) and a scene in which a character speeds out of a bedroom as if they were the Roadrunner.  I just think that the style in Romeo + Juliet gave the notion that if it wasn't for the camera work, the people behind the film would belive that you would just get bored.",,Anonymous,Romance

Wonderful (and overlooked) Shakespeare Adaptation,"As a teenager who has had a love affair with film all of his life and who is a great admirer of Shakespeare, I must state that Baz Luhrmann's film version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is one of the most important films of both the 1990s and in Shakespearean culture. It is also a great romance film (think of it as a Titanic for literature enthusiasts). The reason I say that is because it made Shakespeare as entertaining to see in a new generation as it was back in the 1600s. One must admit, that to an average teenager (or person, for that matter), Shakespeare is as boring as reading a tax filing instruction book. With the language and ""iambic pentameter"" (a rhythmic way of speaking with five beats for each line of Shakespeare, which is something conservative Shakespeare scholars hold dear) Shakespeare can sound like clapping with one hand. However, with Baz's creativity and style, R+J is one of the most entertaining adaptations of Shakespeare ever put on film. From the dazzling visuals to the working chemistry between Leo and Claire, Shakespeare is made fun again.A lot of people knock this version for its extreme over-the-top style and the changing of the simplest elements (changing swords to guns, use of rock music), but to make a hit, that's what you have to do to get your point across. Sure, most of the text is cut and some plot elements from the original is left out, but that does not change the true story by much (you think a teenager would want to sit through the WHOLE play on film?). You have to admit, Shakespeare's not easy to translate to the screen, so one must give Baz a lot of credit for trying and succeeding. Sure its bawdy, violent and over the top, but that's his style. You can't blame a director for using his own style to make an entertaining film. And the way he updates the details to match the era is fantastic (usage of cars, gun handling, Mercutio as a drag queen, Queen Mab as a drug, Prince as a cop, etc.). A lot of people knock the simplest changes, most often touched upon being the swords-to-guns controversy. Think about it: your living in the 1990s, who's going to carry a sword? And while there are wonderful qualities, the negative ones must be briefly touched upon. The language is sometimes spoken without any sort of rhythm at all (I'm not knocking it for not using iambic pentameter, but since Shakespeare is poetic, treat it like it is poetry) and is sometimes spoken as if it were slang. Some of the actors handle it very nicely, and some just crash and burn. I must say, that I bet there were many teens in the audience scratching their heads at what everybody was talking about, but I think it's good for people to listen to movies and not just watch them. One thing I was personally annoyed by was the use of that song ""Pretty Piece of Flesh"". It's used once in the first scene, then used again ten minutes later in a scene with the same exact people. Is that all they listen to? Other than that, there are not many negative elements to touch upon.*SPOILER WARNING*Some of the scenes are absolutely spectacular. The gas station scene is wonderfully cartoonish as it mimics a spaghetti-Western shootout, the first encounters between Romeo and Juliet are beautifully done (especially the elevator scene and the pool scene), and the rewritten final scene between Romeo and Juliet is convincing and tragic (and convincingly tragic). I was so into that scene that I was sort of yelling at the screen for Juliet to make a move to Romeo faster in order to show that she's alive. It's little things like those that helps you know how convincing the romance is between the two, and overall it was an extremely powerful and moving scene. The performances from the two are great, as well as Mercutio, Tybalt (who is played by an extremely badass Leguizamo), Friar, Nurse and Prince. This is one of my favorite films, both from the 1990s and of all time, and I hope that in the future, many more people will discover it the way I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie collides with you. You will love it,"This movie is dramatic. That's Romeo and Juliet in full. This movie is so clever, as you watch it it makes you wriggle in your boots in admiration. The actors are innocent and young. It's a Red Curtain Movie without a doubt; its drama, love theme, passion, but in some parts its pure quirkyness and 'feel good' moments are all perfected. For instance, it starts off with something similar to an ad for the movie which is entirely unique.When I first saw this movie I was hesitant as it start; you may find that, the Shakespeare language may seem unfitting and unusual, but by seeing this movie you'll get hooked.

Appalling,"I found this film literally unwatchable--I put up with it for perhaps ten minutes and then could take no more. Shakespeare's play is among the greatest ever written in English, but it was utterly ruined by the action. It was Ode to Joy done by a screamo band; it was Swan Lake done by break dancers.Shakespeare's plays tell a story in moving and powerful ways, one of the reasons they can be read with nearly as much pleasure as may be gotten by seeing them performed on stage. The language tells the story, not the props, not the scenery, not even, particularly, the actors. In this version of the play, the language is lost. The props, scenery, and action overwhelm it. The dialogue, in the mouths of these actors, in the situations in which they deliver it, is utterly malapropos.I've no idea why Mr Luhrmann made this film, but, in doing so, he did no service to either Shakespeare nor to his audiences. It might be a bit much to call it a desecration of Shakespeare's work, but it's not far from it. It's a parody. It's La Gioconda done in crayon.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet""? No, Baz's ""Romeo + Juliet"".","I remember when this movie came out, all my classmates were seeing it and talking about it, my school got free book covers with Leonardo and Clare until I could hardly stand their faces any more, and I was greatly surprised to hear my chorus teacher give it rave reviews, it was after all, a teen flick, right? But even though I had a great curiosity regarding such a strange movie, I didn't see it. It wasn't till after I had seen Moulin Rouge that I took the initiative to see this film.I find it fairly amusing that the ""official"" title of this film is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", everyone and their uncle knows who wrote it. Everyone and their uncle knows the story. Quite frankly, when I saw it, I was expecting to be bored. I knew how it went, I had read it twice, I had been hearing the story in every vessel of artistic interpretation all my life, from Zeffirelli to Bernstein (well, I love West Side Story). It had been played out, there's only so much mileage you can get. And to me it wasn't Hamlet or King Lear or Much Ado about Nothing which still could hold you enthralled just by a reading. ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet""? What else is new? Sure it's genius, but now, quite simply, it was boring. But this isn't simply Shakespeare's movie, it's Baz Luhrmann's. It made me weep.Where you might think a hip and slick take on a timeless story has been played out, it has elsewhere, but not here. Luhrmann infuses something into it. The film is at times bizarre and sinister, it's intense, it's rough and awkward, it's colorful and crazy and over the top, it's muted, it's passion frenzy, it's dry, it's slick and sophisticated. It's meticulous and strange and cold and white hot all at once. He shoves it all into Venice Beach and actors and those so very famous beautiful poetic lines and mixed with a complete and total disregard for convention.Like Moulin Rouge, there's an obsession with details. But these are strange details. Guns with names, palaces and servants for these mafialike characters, beaches and highways and gas stations as playgrounds for the characters. It's a deformed and crazy Verona for '96. The background is filled to the brim with every sort of lavish and extravagant window or bookshelf dressing or religious icon, flowers, car wheel caps, clothing styles, the way hedges are trimmed, and billboards. Nothing is left out. Luhrmann immerses you into another world, it's 1996, but it's not where we're living. Thus we can relate to these people yet still accept this insanity. And that's fitting, the world Shakespeare was evoking wasn't his own secular society either, he was trying to strip it down to the human qualities of a story.That's why a modern American plain accented actor speaking this complicated dialogue works. We're allowed to believe that these people would talk like this. And the actors give it life and a palpability. It's excellently casted. They give every line with emotion, they act it out, using themselves, but realistically. Danes and Dicaprio are excellent. The various supports do great justice to their roles. It was a joy and a wonder to watch, to see what Shakespeare had intended, with good actors performing well on such a colorful and wacky stage.Above all the emotional power of the story, which can be beaten out during mandatory reading periods or a repeated session with a bland and average version again and again, remains firm. Especially during the last part of the film. There are no superfluous motions or gestures on the actors' part. They act it to a tee. Baz leaves no emotion or possibility unturned. The blocking and directing gets the best out of the story. For example: Romeo walks through a dazzling and dark candlelit and flower and statue strewn chapel to find Juliet, and he weeps and weeps while saying his lines. This is the imagery and interpretation that flows throughout the movie.This is a movie that had a lot of effort and thought and heart and honesty put into it. It has a character and a charisma that I think is lacking in many films today. No one has ever seen the version Shakespeare envisioned, he doesn't give staging or actor's notes, he didn't provide a cliffsnotes version. No one alive can pass down the directions to a performance Shakespeare was present at. Taking this into consideration, Luhrmann created a respectful yet completely unique and enlightening spin on a story that no matter how brilliant, can still get botched by poor translation. I think he extracted the essence of a timeless and beautiful story, and made something incredible. At least he finally made me appreciate it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favorite movie of all time :-),"""Romeo + Juliet"" holds a special place in my heart-I first saw it film as a teenager, on my first date. It left an indelible mark on me then, and revisiting it now only reinforces its impact. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes bring such raw emotion to their roles as Romeo and Juliet, redefining what it means to be star-crossed lovers in a modern setting. But for me, what truly steals the show is Harold Perrineau as Mercutio. His portrayal of this iconic character is nothing short of legendary, adding depth and complexity to the role in a way I've never seen before or since. He's the definitive Mercutio, capturing the essence of Shakespeare's tragic hero with a magnetic energy that leaps off the screen.Baz Luhrmann's direction is visionary, seamlessly blending the classic tale with a modern twist that feels both fresh and familiar. The cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack is iconic, and the overall aesthetic is simply breathtaking.

As someone who was deeply impacted by it as a teenager, I can confidently say that it's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A failure,"This modern version of Romeo and Juliet was actually the most foolish one I have ever seen. The director depended on choosing popular actors and forgot about everything else. I think that his fatal mistake was choosing the setting of the movie to be in modern times. If he had decided that the script would go unchanged and retain the same events as the original play, then he might as well have preserved the setting. Yet he didn't and at the end everything was messed up. It is quite apparent that the problems that faced Romeo and Juliet cease to exist in modern times. First of all Romeo and Juliet come from extremely rich families, when they realized they were in love, couldn't just go to another Italian city or even buy two two hundred dollars plane tickets to Spain and forget about their families.	The film just doesn't present anything contra that solution. Maybe in the older days, some five hundred years ago, girls in Europe couldn't walk out easily out of their family's house, but I presume that his is not the case nowadays. Even if we made the hypothesis that Romeo and Juliet weren't ""that smart"", or if Juliet's family was the only traditional family in Europe  and the events went on in the same sequence, when Romeo was banished couldn't she just go visit him like his church friend did and tell him about her plan?With all those up to date communication devices was the DHL the only choice to report such vital news? Also this banishment in a desert thing seems so stupid. Europe no longer applies this punishment and if it did, it wouldn't be free from security. They prevent people to walk out from cinemas at the middle of films, don't they have the ability to prevent people form walking out of their exiles. And this herbal 24 hour poison that Juliet had taken to make her seem dead, can it actually fool modern day medicine. Would they just take a person who seems breathless and bury him without carefully examining him. What makes matters worse is that she is presented as the daughter of one of the most powerful families, I mean; she should have been examined properly. As stupid as well was the loud monologue Juliet used to make to herself. Mad people are the only ones who talk to themselves. The director could have just transformed such loud quotations into thoughts. Maybe at the time of Shakespeare they didn't have that option, but now they certainly do. As I formerly mentioned mainly I am against the time setting of the film, because the world has changed a lot. But there are other things that were inappropriate for example the people who screamed at each other while holding guns. All I can say is that it is badly done movie. Too little effort was exerted to make it. It took away two sixteenth century family and put them in the inappropriate time and the result was devastating. Everything seemed freaky. The concept behind the Romeo and Juliet tragedy was not conveyed to me through that movie because everything seemed illogical. It certainly was a failure.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

John Leguizamo (Tybalt) and Harold Perrineau (Mercutio) also deliver unforgettable performances.The soundtrack, featuring songs like Lovefool by The Cardigans and Talk Show Host by Radiohead, plays a key role in the film's mood and emotional impact.Visually, Luhrmann's flamboyant and colorful style, blending modern urban settings with meticulous staging, breathes new life into this timeless story.In summary, Romeo + Juliet is more than just an adaptation-it's an essential masterpiece that combines visual beauty, dramatic intensity, and an unforgettable soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is not to like?,"It's pompous, it's dramatic. I love almost everything about this movie and especially its many flaws. There might be some confusion at first as to why they're calling a gun a sword and so on, but you'll get the hang of it. Mostly because you'll learn that good actors talk as much with their body and expressions as with their voices. I love the aesthetic, maybe best described as 90's pop-punk with a lot of neon, crosses, icons and Hawaii shirts. The impressive music that fits so well to this amazing and one of a kind cinematic experience. Quinton Tarvers performance as a young boy of 'When doves cry' and and 'Everybody's free' really moves me. Don't even get me started on the captivating performances by Leo, Claire and Harold. I want to be there, I want to be them- young and full of life and inspiration. Just watch Harold show up in lipstick and a skirt and dance and speak with such an amazing power and playfulness. And at the same time the agony and confusion of young(or all) life that's so classically depicted in Shakespeares play. Without it the film probably would have faded away in memory, but with it, it all makes sense. It's a different universe, both familiar and absolutely unique.Not to mention that Leo is absolutely gorgeous and that the chemistry between him and Claire is breathtaking. If you've ever experience young love full of obsession and hope and dreams that could never last you will see yourself in this naive and intoxicating relationship.There are scenes and emotional experiences from this film that will never leave my memory and that's one of the reasons why I watch it over and over again. And I always find something new to marvel at.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare debased,"I have no problem with updated versions of Shakespeare.  When I was in college, I was in a production of Merchant of Venice set in the 19th century; and I liked what Kenneth Branaugh did with his 19th century Hamlet. I once saw Coriolanus set in the Confederacy during the US Civil war -- which added quite a bit to the political dimensions of the play.However, this one is over the top.  When we see ""Sword"" brand handguns -- obviously so the line ""put up your sword"" would make sense -- and having Mercutio be a drug dealer is simply too much.Nevertheless, I could have lived with it, except for two things: Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes.  Neither one of these two has a clue about how to speak Shakespearian English.  See DiCaprio with Peter Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence) or Danes with Miriam Margolyes (Nurse).  Both Postlethwaite and Margolyes know the music of Shakespeare, and it is almost painful to see DiCaprio and Danes stumbling.  And putting the balcony scene in a swimming pool is simply stupid.Also, some of the secondary characters are badly done.  John Leguizamo is a terrible Tybalt, and the limp-wristed Mercutio is ludicrous.  Bryan Dennehy is simply wasted as Montague.And I would like to inform the script-writer that Juliet wakes up AFTER Romeo dies, not before. If this were my introduction to Shakespeare, I would avoid him like the proverbial plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is really interesting,"My English class was discussing this movie after having read the play. I love the movie because of the way Baz Lurhman uses modern imagery and contrasts it with the original lines of the play. Though he does use modern imagery like guns, if you look at the guns it says ""9 mm Sword..."" (Lurhman). I found that very ironic and humorous. There was one thing in the movie I didn't like and that was that Baz Lurhman made Mercutio Gay and totally threw off the actual basis of the play. Shakespeare makes it evident in the play that there is something ""more"" between Romeo and Mercutio but I think Lurhman emphasized it just a little to much. Another idea of the movie that I find intriguing about the movie is how at the beginning Lurhman switches the lines of the Capulets and the Montagues. This I believe that Lurhman was trying to manipulate the lines of Act1:Sc1 to direct the audiences into his interpretation of the families. As I said before the movie was awesome, To Lurhman "" try to do another of Shakespeare's play the way you did Romeo and Juliet I would go and see it."" If another one is made like this I go and see it (last few words directed towards Baz Lurhman).Geni12591",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"classic turned absurd, 2/10","i finished watching the movie on the 4th attempt. during the first three times i found it unwatchable and shut the machine down. now after i finished it , i must say that there are a few moments in this movie that is worth watching but overall it is a failure.to begin with, the borrowed plot no longs stands well. there are two things that could not happen in the 1990s. first, juliet's fake death shouldn't have fooled people around. with death a clearly defined in medical terms, juliet is in a coma , not death. second, the priest could have informed romeo by a variety of means other than a letter about the trick. he could use mobile phone, a pager, a computer or even a person. it is interesting to see that in the whole movie, there is no scene involving using cell phones, maybe to cover up the unconvincing plot? but there is a scene in which a postal service female clerk is using a computer. so the plot is inconsistent with modern times.another issue which crippled the movie is that the romance between romeo and juliet is squeezed into very little time of the movie. there relationship is not seen developed in the movie, but forced forward in huge leaps. the net result is it feels that the thing between those two is nothing but youthful lust, not romantic love. in the other hand, the movie devoted major effort towards  other things. all those things worked as an anti-climax to the story. some commentators say  it is pathetic and i can't agree more. the only two scenes that are aesthetically pleasing are the moment when romeo first meet juliet and the moment when juliet is waking up but romeo has swallowed the real poison.last i want to say something about the cast. the best delivering person in this movie is the priest, who actually feels like shakespears' character. then comes juliet. it is because of her that a fews moments of this movie shine. the maiden and juliet's fiance are also decent but the rest of characters ( including romeo, who smoke and do drugs ) are really annoying, to say the least.i think that is about it, a failed attempt to exploit on shakespears' play. it is interesting to see that females under age of 18 are among the users that give the highest rating to this movie. so, i think i can finish off my comment with a sly smile on my face knowing that even movie as absurd as this one worked for teenagers. lol2 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
not as creative is it would like to be,"When it is announced, the idea of this adaptation sounds smart. But, it was an idea that would have been left better as the punch line to the phrase ""Wouldn't it be great if..."". But, you can't knock the idea of changing up a classic story. The idea of a modernized Romeo and Juliet wouldn't have been anything exciting, so they had to come up with something. From that aspect, I can respect the creators. But, unfortunately it wasn't what it was suppose to be. The one good point of the film was the appeal to young teenagers who got a little taste of classic literature in a pop culture background. That was well needed. Plus a great small performance by the unknown Jamie Kennedy and a wonderful performance for The Pest himself, John Leguizamo.

Baz Luhrmann's colorful 90's interpretation of Shakespeare's famous play,"Romeo + Juliet (1996)3/4Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet"" is, of course, an adaptation of the famed Shakespere play of the same name. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes star and Romeo and Juliet respectively, and this time, it's been updated to 1996, with a gang war instead of rivaling houses, loud, abrasive metal, rock and punk played over it, and a vibrant, off the wall color palette. It is also set during modern day 1996, if you couldn't already guess, and is complete with a dialogue mixture of present day and Shakesperian language, making for some fun conversations and exchanges. Basically, the situations are contemporary, but the dialogue is like it's taken exactly from the play.I get it. I totally do. I can see why one would think that this is the recipe for a disastrous film. Not only does it star Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet, but it's a punk, modern and electro reimagined version of the classic Shakespere play. But the twist: I like this movie, and I like it a lot. It's a uniquely enjoyable, one of a kind, distinctive experience. It's actually really good. The direction, as usual from Baz Luhrmann, is frenetic and fast, and leaves no room for the audience to breathe, as he takes us from one moment to another.A lot of the film is actually really thought out. The modern touches work especially, too, like putting the story into a modern day gang war, and adding some 90's touches. Admittedly, sometimes the film is hard to follow because of its dialogue, which is sometimes confusing. The film is also a bit long in spots. But the ending is uniquely done, with imagery, metaphorical meaning and true feeling. As with a lot of Luhrmann's work, never once do you know that you're not watching a movie, making for quite an experience.While it may sound like this is a misconceived movie, I assure you - the emotion, acting and direction are very much still present, and with a lot of style and vibrance.

So is Luhrmann trying to say that in modern day Verona, people can just carry guns around and start shooting and the law isn't charged upon them? And the citizens don't care that their local gas station is on fire? Another thing: Hello Romeo and Juliet OPEN your eyes and look around. Oh my gosh, your NOT in Renaissance Italy! Your in modernized-and-updated Verona! There's money! There's cars! There's passports! And airplanes were invented nearly a century ago!Consider those facts.

"Romeo + Juliet (1996): Even the ""Gnomeo"" version was Better than This Absolute Garbage!","Romeo + Juliet is a romantic drama film from 1996 starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the titular characters. The film was directed, co-written, and co-produced by Baz Luhrmann.The plot of the movie follows the original play released in 1597 by William Shakespeare. Nothing really else to say about the plot. If you've read the play, you know what the movie will be about.There are so many bad things about this movie. First off, the Montagues and Capulets use guns instead of swords as they did in the original play which is absolutely stupid. Why couldn't the cast during filming just get swords and make this movie more like the play they were basing it on? Also, my main problem with the movie is that the whole movie is exact quotations from the book, not normal talking like any normal movie that you've ever seen. I hate this as the movie gets so boring especially with its 2 hour runtime. The acting is terrible, with the exception of Leonardo DiCaprio. He makes an excellent performance as Romeo Montague.Overall, I hate this movie. I give it one star because I loved Leonardo DiCaprio's performance. Only watch this movie if you are a die-hard Romeo and Juliet fan or if you love romance movies. Otherwise, skip this one. Many may like, but not for me. A huge dissapointment and I'll probably never watch this movie again.1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly accessible and exuberant Shakespeare adaptation,"Wildly fun adaptation of William Shakespeare's play by writer/director Baz Luhrmann. Changing the setting of Shakespeare's plays for film adaptations isn't a new thing. It had previously been done as musicals, westerns, samurai films, gangster pictures, indie dramas about street hustlers, teen comedies, teen dramas, and so on and so forth, but none of those films brought the exuberance and audacity as this film. Set in a Venice Beach-like setting between two feuding wealthy business family empires, Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague and Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, with their star cross lover children, Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes, in roles that really put their stars on the Hollywood map, at the center of the drama. The film faithfully follows the source material's story and all of the dialogue is taken straight from the play, but the dialogue is amazingly accessible and understandable from the actors speaking the lines in a very naturalistic manner. Laurence Olivier was actually criticized in his day for delivering lines in too naturalistic of a manner and not in the traditional more sing-song of manner, which Kenneth Branagh took even further, but this film puts that on a whole new level. Actors here are gangsters, street punks, and thugs and deliver their lines as such, but their words are accessible in a way I'd never seen before that retained Shakespeare's original words. In some ways, it's kind of like Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" where most all of the characters spoke as if they were off the mean streets of Brooklyn. In both cases it served to connect the characters and stories to modern audiences and crate less of a distance between the two. The film also drips of 1990s cool, with a very hip soundtrack and many fashions of the day (with a hint of Elizabethan). The film features a strong cast that also includes Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis- Hall, M. Emmet Walsh, Jamie Kennedy, and a memorable Vincent Laresca. But the real start is Bad Luhrmann, who's combination of visuals, sound, and editing created a film so full of energy and audacity that it stands apart from any other Shakespearian film adaptation and is something truly unique. My only complaint about the film is that the modernization of the story also makes Romeo and Juliet's drama and romance seem overly trite and self important in a way that I found annoying. To the teens and teen audiences, I'm sure their love and feelings are very real and serious and worthy of live & death, but at the same time these are kids and they really shouldn't be taking themselves all that seriously. Leo and Clair might as well be the self important teens from ""13 Reasons Why"" for how overly serious they take themselves. Still, I don't think middle age men were Luhrmann's target audience here (i.e. me), so my criticism is probably not valid (i.e. I'm just being a cranky old man). Still, this is a wonderfully original film that demands multiple viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Positively, the worst film ever made","As a film critic, I expand my interest into other arts.  Theater is merely one of my interests.  Shakespeare is a God, too.

Take all of the bad movie experiences you've ever had, and put them together. Ready?  Okay, now you still don't have how bad this movie is.  Baz Luhrmann has destroyed Shakespeare in ridiculous form.  Despite the entertaining two minute opening sequence, this film is completely unimportant.  It's a waste of celluloid as we know it.  True pain.  It's the only film I've actually walked out of the theater on.  Those theaters should provide courtesy buckets so you can heave and spew all you want.  Good Shakespeare?  Watch Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet.  Nothing compares.  DiCaprio and Danes are great actors... this just proves how great actors can be very, very bad.  Never see this film.

"Loved it, but why Claire Danes?","After reading the first page of the IMDb readers' ""Comments"" filtered in order of ""Best"" Comments, I found myself agreeing with most, and even learning historical tidbits and artistic insights to enhance future viewings. Since other readers said it so well, I have only one question: With all the potential actresses who could have played Juliet, why Claire Danes?Though appropriately young and innocent contrasting against the debauched culture backdrop, throughout the entire movie her northern homeliness seemed improbable to have diverted Romeo's romantic spark from Rosline, ab alluring siren by his friend Mercutio's description, guaranteed to keep an impressionable and romantic young man ensnared.Claire's hair poorly dyed at the roots in a color conflicting with her natural pallor and lacking life and shine was fine for her death scene, but not captivating prior. (Picture Greek actress Jennifer Anniston's shining, moving tresses mutely but eloquently attesting to a pampered upbringing and great south-of-the-equator genetic heritage.) Likewise Claire's pasty skin tone and lack of feature definition requiring makeup she was denied except way too late some too-dark and earthbound brick lipstick clashing not only with her coloring but her angelic costume for the big party.Italian girls' beauty is in curving black eyebrows arching like flying swallows above thickly fringed lashes lowering modestly over shy but alluringly smoldering dark eyes while thick glossy ringlets toss and curve around plump skin warmed by cloudless sunny Mediterranean skies. (Think Latin lovers and salsa dancers.) Does this describe Claire Danes? Not at all!Instead we're served up a pasty pale girl from north of the Equator who looks like the Dane she is named from chilly overcast Denmark, with crudely common peasant features. My neighbors are prettier than this flat-chested, dull-colored, severely-in-need-of-makeup girl who should be cast as a Puritan maid to a rich scion of the estate who falls in love with her because prolonged proximity teaches him maturely to appreciate her grateful sweetness and trustworthy salt-of-the earth soul. A far cry from the instantly captivating, imagination-firing, arrestingly demure but hotly passionate Capulet little rich girl.Claire's best visual trait is easily and quickly identified since she was gifted with so little aesthetically; but she wastes that lively smile prematurely in her scenes so that it feels coyly contrived, like a cute little masked clown instead of the ingenuously spontaneous eruption out of a girlish soul trembling on the threshold of new womanly feelings...shakily unfamiliar but at the same time deliciously tempting to be explored with this suddenly appearing object for her adoration--intense, beautiful, and ardorous young Romeo.I longed for a prior Juliet--innocently sultry and husky-voice Olivia Hussey, a petite little hussy of a princess--opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. Or even Marisa Tomei, who always seems young, hot-headed and vulnerable. Or even the youngest ""Gilmore Girl"" (though not typically Italian), with her big eyes, shiny hair, and lovely young body delicately yielding to new sensuality. We want a girl on her first date and prom, a Snow White awakened by her youthful Prince charming, not a tomboy.This artistic production was such an original piece and so vividly delivered that the colorless Claire was an even bigger disappointment to me here than she would have been in a more pedestrian production of the classic Romeo & Juliet. I'm sure I'll enjoy this actress in future movies better suited, since IMDb readers' comment enthusiastically about her; but she stops me from wanting to own this otherwise artistic and moving rendition of the poetry of Romeo & Juliet.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I got the feeling that it was just an attempt to draw interest from the media and public, rather than to bring something new to the story. Acting is rather nice, but it was hard to see diCaprio as Romeo - again, a rising, if not famous, boy-actor was used just to draw attention to the flick.

Post-modern tripe.,"All set for the new century Baz Luhrmann updated one of the best loved stories of all time. Unfortunately it didn?t work. There is an uncomfortable clash between the modern setting and the original Shakespearean dialogue. The dialogue is delivered as though it were written by a contemporary writer-as is the point. However as a result the tone of the actors is wrong- for much of the film the cast sound as though they are about to break into laughter. 1990's teenagers reading 15th century literature in this tone simply doesn't work. It is in this that the adaptation loses its power, by diminishing the power of the original story Luhrmann's film has nothing but lots of fancy, overly stylised camera work?oh and Leo, which speaks volumes for the success of the film. Aimed at the teenage (female) audience much of it?s success was surely down to the young heart-throb?s presence.I realise I've gone on about the dialogue quite a bit but considering this is an adaptation of a play i think it is fair criticism.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sometimes the dialogue falls like bricks from the mouths of the two main characters, but more often, the two actors convince us by the sheer reality of their emotions. The rest of the cast is also convincing.See this film for its sheer novelty, but allow yourself to get swept away by the power of the performances as well as by the music and the settings.Shakespeare was in show-biz.

a retarded reinterpretation,"Sigh.  I generally dislike movies that attempt to set classics in modern times, and this is no exception.  Not only is this version of the play difficult to take seriously, it's paced badly, and most of the acting is terrible.  What Luhrmann has attempted to do is splice hyperactivity together with intellect - and the two don't mix well.  Furthermore, setting Romeo and Juliet in modern times necessarily takes the play entirely out of context, especially when using the original dialogue.  Romeo and Mercutio are particularly misrepresented here.There are only two things that keep this ""film"" from getting a one or a two from me.  First, the soundtrack is cool (I'm a huge Radiohead fan).  Second, Shakespeare's writing is still genius, even in a misrepresentation like this.  But otherwise, there's little to like about this movie.  It's a blatant and gross exploitation of art for the sake of trendiness. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh Dear.,"As someone who enjoyed the original film and thoroughly enjoyed reading the book, my honest opinion is that this version fails miserably no matter how you look at it. If it was meant to appeal to those who know and love the story (myself included) then in my opinion it fails because of the attempt to bring it into the present day.If on the other hand it was meant to appeal to a younger generation and to perhaps introduce Shakespeare to a whole new audience then it surely fails on the grounds that the original script is kept despite the modern day setting.

Hip and intense modernization,"I hadn't heard all of this story before watching this film, so please forgive me any misunderstandings that may come as a result of that ignorance. When I heard that this was done by Baz Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, who later went on to create Moulin Rouge together, which is one of my favorite love stories(granted, at the time I first saw it, that was a pretty short list) of all time, as well as just about the only true musical that I've found myself enjoying, naturally I was going to watch it. Plus, it's difficult to challenge the quality of William Shakespeare's writings, and this is said to be one of his best works. The idea is magnificent; take the original story and retell it in modern day suburbia, with the original dialog(though, obviously, unfortunately, not all the dialog could be retained; I was disappointed to find that the brief exchange regarding ""how deep was the cut"" was not in the film). The result works out very well, by changing the setting to one that today's youth can easier relate to, whilst still making the points that the original play did. The plot is very good, and evolves nicely throughout. The pace is *intense*. This thing moves non-stop. Blink and you'll miss something. At times, this speed was almost overwhelming. The running time is two (exactly!) hours, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost all of it. The editing seems to bear traces of this... more often than not, it seems like the scene or certain cuts of it had been trimmed by a few seconds, to ensure the run-time length, and it can be a little confusing(for the quite few times it happens). I will say that Luhrmann kept the pace at an appropriate rate for the dramatic scenes. In fact, they may become even stronger, from the otherwise extreme pace. The line-delivery is fast, but exceptional. The acting is excellent. I can't name a single performance that I found even slightly flawed. The casting is marvelous, as well... the two leads and the supporting players are spot-on(heck, even Jamie Kennedy worked, here). The music is a good mix of hip, new music and a beautiful score. Production values are high. The cinematography causes a confusing moment or two, but it mostly simply serves to keep the intensity up. A well-done modernization of the famous play. I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it, and/or William Shakespeare. Do keep in mind that there are various creative decisions made, changing the original tale... including one regarding the famous ending. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite probably the worst movie ever made.,"I saw this in the theater back when it was first released.I've never before or since felt such a virulent hatred for a movie. It's awful in so many ways. Awful writing, awful acting, awful directing - did I mention awful writing? A true low point for everyone involved.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's not really too linked to the original. It's a fun version of the original,"A lot of people are slating it for inaccuracies and the off the wall theming. But for me if you want to see the original story from Shakespeare see a more sober version. I feel both films can exist independant of one another. This is not the play as Shakespeare intended but it is fun and the actors exagerated style and movement means it transcends the old English language barrier. Such that a younger audience can get a better idea of what is going on. I am English and did English at college so I can understand a fair bit of olde English. But so many cannot. Not one for the purists, but certainly entertaining and fascinating.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hate It!!!,"This movie was horrible. I may have to punish myself by watching it again because so many people say it was good. When I saw this movie, I hadn't read the text. Everything that happened in this crap called a movie was a blur. Frank Z. did a much better job in 1968. Go see it. This movie doesn't hold a candle to it. I mean think about it. Guns with this language? No!!! Don't spend your time, money, or effort watching this movie. READ IT WITH NO NOTES IF THAT'S THE CASE!!! West Side Story is good if you like the story of Romeo and Juliet. It is a musical. I loved every minute of it. GO SEE THAT! If anyone disagrees, please comment on why I should go see it. It's way too long (or so it seemed for me to like)",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly Artificial","Romeo+Juliet (1996)Some Music, but otherwise, Uncommonly ArtificialIt is rarely that one comes across this kind of joke, and that is a patronizing statement. This film should be branded as a transmogrification of a gem. Now one would be compelled to compare this movie with Moulin Rouge, the director's more recent, much acclaimed, over rated, effort. In that case, too, he brought the 1950's classic tragedy down to a messy soup. I was inclined to put the technique to the surrealist genre, and now I think that I was being too generous.But Romeo+Juliet really hits the rock bottom. The drama, transported some five centuries forward, and the whole drama played out of context (the characters, including the TV newsreader, speaking in the archaic language) was funny, to say the least. And, in the maze of modern gadgetry, Juliet's mansion (or any other mansion or shop for that matter) not to have a simple telephone was definitely going too much. This kind of love that cannot spare a few dollars for a cellular phone (and paying for such miserly conduct with death) is unimaginable. I do not think that anyone who is not mesmerised by DiCaprio could in any manner relate to any of the characters or sympathise with them; they are so artificial.Leaving aside Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968) that was an orthodox version (and quite memorable too), one remembers with much affection The Westside Story, a musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. There the modern social elements were interwoven into the setting so that the result was a recreation of the spirit of the original Romeo and Juliet. I believe even Shakespeare would not have found fault with that.The only remarkable aspect of this Romeo+Juliet was music. However, a bad concept has never been resurrected by good music.I only hope that the director would stop desecrating milestones of the past.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
But Benvolio was good,"I think we can see by Benvolio how the language was supposed to sound.  Dash Mihok speaks it fluently, clearly, and un-selfconsciously as if it were the latest surfer slang.  Well, maybe he was just lucky that he had none of the really hard lines.I don't know who made the rule, but it seems to be compulsory for several years now that a movie has to end promptly as soon as the last person who's going to die has died.  Zeffirelli omitted the reconciliation of the families, and Luhrmann seems to have had no patience for it either. But to Shakespeare it was important, the teachers always told us:  there's always someone at the end of Shakespearean tragedy who picks up the pieces and reminds us that the nightmare is over and the world will go on.On the other hand, the world of R+J will not.  If I may state the obvious, Luhrmann did not move the play into the present.  He moved it into an alternative present, and that's what allows various anachronisms (such as the peremptory banishment of Romeo) to pass without further explanation.",,Anonymous,Romance

Great version of Shakespearian play,"I thought this was a fantastic version of the original Shakespearian play. While, in my opinion, the lead actor Leonardo Di Caprio was good without being brilliant, the others perform magnificently. The soundtrack is possibly the best I've heard. Another credit is that it might actually get kids vaguely interested in Shakespeare (or may not), as at least I have found I can recite some parts of it word for word. Probably the only problems were the title (Romeo and Juliet would have been cool, ""Romeo + Juliet"" sounds really tacky) and some of the slightly strange editing at times. The whole thing of people speaking Shakespearian in a 21st century world seems a bit strange, but in my opinion it works. This film is certainly in my top 10 all time films.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Best film version for Generation X, Y and Z","When I was in 9th grade, my English class was studying Romeo and Juliet and as luck would have it, this version was in theatres! Unfortunately, my English teacher felt the modern setting and teen dream stars were an affront to Shakespeare's classic play and while the other class got to go see it, we were stuck watching the version from the 70s in a dimly lit library on a 20"" set. She even fast-forwarded through the love scenes. Its that type of person that will likely hate this movie, and while they don't really deserve it, lets all take a moment to pity their lack of adventure and youthful exuberance that this story clearly embodies.OK... now on to the review.Most teenagers when they first learn about Shakespeare will likely begin with Romeo & Juliet. Its a popular and easily digestible tale. And most students will probably have a slightly difficult time with the language, but the meaning of the lines will not be lost on them with this modernized version by celebrated director Baz Luhrman. Carefully chosen images intermingle with the lines and soon you forget about the strangeness of the language and are engrossed in the story, as Shakespeare himself would've intended.Starring in the lead roles are talented stars and character actors, even some super stars like DiCaprio, and with music courtesy of Radiohead, how can you go wrong? While the contemporary setting may turn some people off, they are missing the point.The point is, the time and place are essentially unimportant. Young love can happen anywhere and at anytime, and often does. So what does it matter if you have guns instead of swords? Or a mardi-gras style party instead of a stuffy costumed affair? What is important is that the audience feel connected to the original material, and despite its archaic language, truly FEEL the emotions the way Shakespeare intended.Thats what I love about this version. Even the uninitiated will lose any predisposition about the language, maybe even come to appreciate it! through a cleverly updated depiction they can more easily relate to.I give it a 10/10 because its awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
my personal favorite,"Romeo and Juliet might be the greatest love story of all times and I do not want to get into detail too much about what it is about in this review - which is my first on IMDb. I would rather like to somewhat share with you the way I experienced it.Back in my teenage years I saw Romeo + Juliet in cinema twice within a week. It is the only movie I went twice to cinema for. Although I knew roughly what the play was about the story kept me in suspense so much I still had a lump in my throat the day after I watched this movie the first time. To that day I had never been as fascinated by anything and really had to think about this tale for days to come. So it was the first time I got to witness the ""whole"" story and in retrospect it probably was the best version for me. It was magic.I could identify myself with Romeo - he was like who i wanted to be - exceptionally played by DiCaprio and I fell in Love with Julia - stunningly beautiful, just everything - brilliantly played by Claire Danes. DiCaprio had already been one of my favorite actors before (and after) what I can not say about Claire Danes in general but in that role she was near perfect to me. Other stand-out performances I would like to mention are the strong characterization of Mercutio played by the best Harold Perrineau I have seen while in the part of Tybalt John Leguizamo excels himself either.The settings and direction of this movie are plain fantastic from my point of view. Along with the contemporary interpretation of Shakespeare's genuine play Baz Luhrmann managed to create a pretty special atmosphere that feels surreal, menacing but at the same time highly appealing. Without the original lyrics used in this adaption I could imagine Romeo + Juliet to be an absolutely intoxicating flick but the dreamlike poetry propel it's atmosphere to another level.I like movies to tell me an interesting story in the first place and showcase it the way it feels right. To this day no other movie could outreach the impact Romeo + Juliet had on me. The first Love usually is the deepest and there is nothing perfect in this world except for true Love..",,Anonymous,Romance
GR8 Movie!,"I love the way Baz Luhrmann directed this movie. The interesting style that Baz has produced in this film made the film very amusing, especially with the guns instead of swords and daggers. The way this film was made showed a very interesting style that really caught my attention. Although Shakespeare's language is still used in this modernised play, the way the film is directed helps people understand it through the acting and not only the words from the script. Each and every character was a good choice especially John Leguizamo. John is so great at being evil in this movie as Tybalt. I love him!! The way he takes off his jacket, points the gun and smokes his cigar in the beginning of the film is one of the best scenes in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modernized Shakespeare or Baz Luhrmann's Insanely Beautiful Extravaganza,"Melodrama, tragedy. A screen version of the eponymous and immortal tragedy of the great English playwright William Shakespeare (no plus in the title, naturally), directed by the excellent Australian director Baz Luhrmann, who directed my favorite musical ""Moulin Rouge"". In general, this film adaptation is included in the ""Trilogy of the Red Curtain"" created by the director himself, where, in addition to ""Moulin Rouge"", another picture ""Dancing without Rules"" (in another translation - Strictly by the rules) has also been added, perhaps in the future I will write a review on this picture in order to complete the entire trilogy, but today I want to talk about this enchanting adaptation of Shakespeare. I saw this picture many times - and it brings pleasure again and again, and here is my brief opinion - modernized Shakespeare. It should be stated right away that there are no downsides to this picture, for me personally, but there are controversial and annoying moments, which I will talk about in a separate paragraph. In the meantime, let me focus your attention on the expressive and vivid advantages of this picture.
So, here they are:
1. Immortal love story - a picture in crazy colors and new, modern decorations tells the classic and immortal love story of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet - children of two warring houses, ready to kill each other at any meeting. Little is known about the history of their enmity, but the consequences of the current confrontation are felt by the inhabitants of the entire city. I think it won't be a surprise to anyone
That their story ends sadly
In order to teach a lesson to the living,
And standing at the graves memorial
Whisper their names unconscious!
This is the lot of the warring houses, but we all know this story perfectly well from school. Beautiful, immensely sensual, passionate love that will live forever. All the heroes of the picture speak in imperishable verses from the original source, which was treated as carefully as they could, only in some places they allowed an outright gag (in terms of the script, naturally). We all know this story, but we are simply unable not to empathize with Romeo and Juliet, because it clings to the most precious thing - to our heart, which is loved as our immortal couple.
2. Scenery, costumes, entourage - the action of the tragedy, director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann brought from Renaissance Italy to America at the end of the twentieth century. Swords have been replaced by pistols, Montagues and Capulets have turned from nobles to mafia clans, and references to other works of the immortal Shakespeare are visible from everywhere on posters and signs. A lot of symbolism, such as the image of the Mother of God on weapons and other things and not only. It is necessary to transfer the action of Shakespeare's tragedies to modern times very carefully, otherwise you can ""get it on the hat"" from fans and admirers of the genius. In my lifetime, I have seen only two examples when the transfer turned out to be successful, this is this picture and ""Coriolanus"" of 2011. Baz Luhrmann used large theatrical sets, which is noticeable that in combination with the verses of the original only enhances the immersion in this story and this entourage. Boldly, brightly, defiantly!
3. Music - frank ""pop"" of the eighties and mid-nineties of the last century, combined with church chants, created an amazing mixture, which is not clear how, but works, especially in conjunction with a brightly colorful and theatrical picture. And the transitions between ""pop"" and church chants are made quite smoothly, so that the viewer has time to switch, because the obvious and symbolic turns of the story are known in advance, but this does not make them less emotional.
4. Finale - the famous sad end of lovers. There is no music, we only hear the words of madly in love hearts, the picture is almost static, the viewer's heart hurts. Silence, interrupted only by a shot, which put an end to this performance. Emotions are overwhelming, even after many views. It is physically impossible to hold back. A dark ending for lovers and a lesson to all the inhabitants of Verona, and to all of humanity. Here, look! What hate leads to! What does anger lead to?
A little about the main characters:
1. Romeo Montecchi performed by Leonardo DiCaprio - a son from an influential family, a handsome young man who fell in love with Juliet - the daughter of Capulet's sworn enemy, which caused joyful moments and bitter disappointments with the most famous and sad ending. Young Leo is so suitable for this role that it is difficult to imagine another candidate. Youthful enthusiasm and a loving heart are available. Bravo Leo!
2. Juliet Capulet performed by Claire Day is the daughter of an influential clan who fell in love with Romeo. A young beauty with famous dreams that she gave herself up to her love without a trace. Young Claire has successfully embodied the classic image of Juliet on the big screen. Bravo!
3. Tybalt performed by John Leguizamo - Juliet's brother and the most rabid in the Capulet clan, ready to destroy all representatives of the hostile clan. Impeccably dressed, mannered, the killer played brilliantly by John Leguizamo. I know him from the excellent incarnation of Henri Toulouse-Latrec-Montf from ""Moulin Rouge"", and here he played the impudent and mad Tybalt, for which he gets my applause! Bravo John!
I can not fail to mention Harold Perrino, the Negrito, who played Mercutio, and so played that with his charisma he pushed the most handsome Leo off the pedestal!
When viewing, many viewers will have a slight bewilderment, maybe even hatred, regarding this picture. Modern surroundings and Shakespeare's lines from the lips of the heroes, the difference between the picture and the dialogues, logic in some places, the Negritos Mercutio, Other moments and even whole pieces of the picture. As I said, the picture here is very challenging. The actors overact, even unnecessarily. Inappropriate antics, attempts at pathos - this is all there, and there is no getting away from it. All this does not interfere with my viewing, because this film adaptation is not a film adaptation in the usual sense of the word - this is an experiment of the director, where Shakespeare, modernity for the year the picture was released, and theatricality were mixed, and all this gave what is called the picture ""Romeo + Juliet "".
As a result, we have an excellent adaptation of the immortal tragedy of William Shakespeare with a classic story, excellent dialogues, music, entourage, emotions and simply amazing acting work.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare's Views,"Many of you have probably read the original version of Romeo and Juliet, or maybe have even seen the play. How much different was this modern version from the original version? How would Shakespeare react after watching this movie? He wouldn't like it at all. The setting was completely different, and several important scenes from the play were missing. Some of the characters weren't even portrayed correctly. For example, Tybalt never beat up Romeo as it showed in the movie. Also, what is up with the policeman prince? He wasn't really a prince. The characters' overall personalities in this movie were just way too silly. This movie would not meet up to Shakespeare's expectation. He would be highly disappointed in how this movie was made. The fact that the setting was modern but the language was not, just made the movie more awkward. The language should have also been modern to match the overall theme. I do admit though that the romance was very interesting and kept my attention being a girl. Overall, I rate this movie a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great modernization,"Romeo and Juliet was a great play written by William Shakespeare. Many of you could think that modernize a classic is that kind of thing which makes you say: ""oh, no!"". But this isn't the case. The tragedy is perfectly modernized, with a great street spirit which represents perfectly the duel spirit of Shakespeare's time: everyone has a gun, just like a sword in the ancient times; clothing is exaggerate, exactly like in Shakespeare time; and many other things. For the screenplay we can see great images like at the beginning, the duel between Montague and Capulet's men is thrilling also thanks to the screenplay; then we see Romeo in front of the sunset: a very beautiful effect. The soundtrack is full of big names like Cardigans, Radiohead: in particular I appreciated Radiohead's one, perfect for its usage. There are also more ""epic"" songs, in old style, used perfectly in their original form and also remixed to create more suspense. There is no doubt, Romeo+Juliet is an excellent movie, a great modernization, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Radical, but perhaps not radical enough?","WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO & JULIETAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSWith its contemporary setting and rough, insistent visuals, Baz Luhrmann's reinterpretation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" adds a very 90s spin to the Bard's tale, targeting the youth market (notoriously disenchanted with the works of Shakespeare) with an aggressive, in-yer-face style. As such, the film is hip and sexy, and Old Bill's yarn has much to offer, but while Claire Danes' Juliet is the very picture of grace and innocence, Leonardo di Caprio - undoubtedly a fine young actor - seems out of place as Romeo, and he's upstaged in the good looks department by Paul Rudd as Paris. There's a show-stopping dance number (part of a drug-induced hallucination) at the masked ball where the two lovers first meet, and the second half of the film is powered by a raw emotional intensity, but a truly radical revision of the play might have involved the scrapping of Shakespeare's text altogether and the substitution of 90s dialogue to match the visuals.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amazing Actors BUT..,I've seen and done this play so many times and they ruined it for me. Their(Leo and Claire's) wording and pauses were all messed up. It sounded and looked as if they didn't even know what they were saying(most of the time). Very little times did it seem convincing. I think they are both amazing actors but this just wasn't their best.. BY FAR.. I think the supporting roles upstaged the two main actors.. Why out of the whole cast the 2 Main Characters seem the most out of place..

Baz Luhrmann is incredible,"I greatly enjoyed the way Baz Luhrmann brought Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into a more modern setting. I loved Moulin Rouge, and you can distinctly see Luhrmann's same style coming through in Romeo + Juliet in the filming, the sound effects, and the settings.The classic tale of the two star-cross'd lovers is set in a present-day Verona, with the Montague/Capulet war spanning the entire city. While the setting is modern, the dialogue is straight from the play, which I think was done wonderfully.

"Visually stunning, but this could have been better","Now I like Baz Luhrmann, I loved Moulin Rouge! and Australia was a much better film than people give credit for. However, I was disappointed with this version of Romeo and Juliet. I really liked the 1968 film with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey though that did have one or two problems.Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film does look amazing. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is gorgeous. I also liked how the Capulet party was staged, all grand and lavish and Claire Danes's white swan dress was stunning. Harold Perrineau was perfect as Mercutio yes the singing wasn't great but it was for comedy, and Pete Postlethwaite was a noble and sympathetic Friar Lawrence. Miriam Margoyles is a fine actress and brought a real sense of maternal instinct to the role of Juliet's nurse. Regarding the character though, she could have been developed more, seeing as she was the main source of motherly affection in the play I would have liked to have seen that come across more. Also I would have liked to have seen more of Paris, a smaller role but a significant one. And Leonardo Di Caprio does have a boyish charm that compensates for any thoughts of whether he was too young. I liked how fast it moved too, it was almost exhilarating in pace, and I think the film makers did that purposefully to empathise how rushed Romeo and Juliet's relationship was. Plus the ending is very tragic as it should be.However, there are other aspects that didn't quite work. I have no problem with a film that is updated, it worked in West Side Story, it worked in Carmen Jones, but it does feel jarring when the script is not modernised, with a poetic and archaic sounding script mixed by exhilarating non-stop action merging on screen it doesn't quite work. Plus when Benvolio says ""Put up your swords"" I personally felt ""put down your guns""(as they were guns not swords here) would have been better. Baz Luhrmann's direction was also a disappointment, sometimes in the early scenes it was so over the top that I forgot I was watching a version of Romeo and Juliet and thought I was watching a flash cartoon. (I love animation don't get me wrong but that feel to this film doesn't bode well with me). The soundtrack I had mixed feelings about. I liked the music at the beginning and in the balcony scene, I liked the use of Mozart's Symphony Number 25 and I liked the use of Liebestod from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde sung brilliantly by Leontyne Price, however some of the more contemporary songs felt somewhat intrusive. Claire Danes looked gorgeous, but her acting was rather unconvincing in places, her crying for instance felt very melodramatic and (please don't take this the wrong way) reminded me of a spoilt rich girl who cried when she didn't get her way. Finally, I have nothing personal against John Leguizamo though I am not fond of him either, but I thought he badly overdid the character of Tybalt, too much of the tough guy attitude and not enough of the grace and coolness of the Tybalt of the play and the 1968 version.Overall, watchable but disappointing. It could be worse though, you could be watching that animated film with seals taking the roles of the Shakespearean characters, that did a much worse job at respecting(more like disrespecting) the material. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
experiment,"one of experiments with real surprising result. because it gives one of the most seductive versions of Shakespeare's play. and it creates a precise target. eccentric, extravagant, memorable. one of Baz Luhrmann's ambitious projects who use new ingredients for recreate old recipes. and, behind the Hawaian shirts, contemporary set, lights, guns, teen spirit, MTV atmosphere, the choice of the most inspired cast is the axis of a film who gives again a well known universe, same in its structure and words and emotions, original in form and in the force of message.

An incredible journey of love till death,"In the day this one premiered I as in vacation and had nothing to do. I thought it might be cool so I gave it a try. And the way I felt when I came out was something spectacular. I was still mesmerized by the whole experience, the incredible sets of Verona Beach striking me the most. I got stunned by the power of the actors, the music (one of the best soundtracks of the year), the editing and the direction. I left the theatre with my mouth open and went home thinking a lot about it. I saw it again. And again. I went three times to the cinema to see it. And three years ago, I had a wish of experiencing everything the world of Verona Beach and its two star-crossed lovers had to give: fireworks, lights, coreographed gun fights that look more like ballet dances. This movie influenced me like few movies have. Since then, I remember wishing that someday I took part on the creation of such a world. Now, I have good memories of this movie, and still feel the influence it made on me. But the effect was lost on video. And the really good memory comes from the time I saw it on the theatre. But all isn't lost. The day the DVD arrives to our shores, I know I will experience all the same again... Romeo + Juliet is one of the best movies of the decade, and director Luhrmann is a good hope to the future of sharp movies. I gave it a 8 out of 10, just because of a few flaws in the end, but not to like this movie at all is definitely a crime. Bravo!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Horrendous!!,"Firstly, the story of Romeo and Juliet has been done too many times, and contains no real substance. Second, this modern angle makes it worse than ever before. DiCaprio is a terrible actor, they should have cast someone who can show emotion and speak properly. Danes annoys me because she is always emotionless and appears to be high. The soundtrack had nothing to do with the movie, and was irritating. The only amusing part was when Mercutio dressed up as a transvestite. Bad movie, poorly made, overrated, and painful to watch.

Somebody finally did ROMEO AND JULIET right!,"The problem with most productions of this play is that they concentrate so much on one aspect---the love-talk between the two principals---that they seriously distort what the tragedy is really about. The play's not just about hearts and flowers, it's also about the senselessness of wars and feuds for the sake of wars and feuds, pride, power-hunger, and the self-perpetuating nature of these evil forces and how they destroy everything good and beautiful that comes in the way. Now THAT'S a tragedy which the 20th and 21st centuries should be able to relate to, and it gives ROMEO AND JULIET a contemporary relevance which this film brought out beautifully.Far too much is made of the fact that the director gave the play a modern setting. Shakespeare modernized his settings, and there's no reason we can't do the same: Shakespeare gives HAMLET, for example, an Elizabethan setting even though the original Hamlet is supposed to have lived in pre-Viking and pagan times. Modern settings are entirely appropriate to Shakespeare.I think Danes and DiCaprio are perfectly cast, and I think the Bard would approve. Romeo is suitably impulsive, unintellectual but very plain and honest about his love, just the right combination of punky and sensitive, while Juliet is---well, Juliet. This film has by far the best Tybalt I've ever seen, while Father Laurence all but steals the show. The cast is uniformly fine (except Romeo's sidekick Mercutio wasn't there at all; Zeferelli did much better to make him into an aging stud).Nothing's perfect. I must admit I don't see the point of moving Juliet's famous balcony scene into a swimming pool, especially since Luhrman's device of the night watchman with his searchlight could have been exploited to great effect. (At the same time, the way Romeo breathes down Juliet's neck as he says ""Wilt thou then leave me so unsatisfied?"", and her wary, just-a-minute,-what's-going-on-here response, ""What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?"", a.k.a. ""Is this for real or are you just horny?"", and the way in which her riposte seems to make him stumble mentally and revise his approach,was one of the film's best moments; I don't think this rather thoughtful touch could have executed by way of the traditional staging). Also, I wish the film hadn't cut the reconciliation between the Hatfield and McCoy patriarchs, with its attendant ""What a lousy waste!"" mood. Oddly, Zefirelli cut those few lines also. Go figure.No one film can do justice to a Shakespearean tragedy, of course. Buffs should see Zefirelli's film in tandem with this one, just as they should compare and contrast Branagh's and Olivier's HENRY V.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Very good, but could have been better","I am still young, and still love the story of Romeo and Juliet. This might change, as some people have said on the message boards, as I grow older, but that is not the case right now.I think that this presentation was very good. They adapted it well to a more modern setting. However, there were two major things that irked me.The fights, to me, were far too stylized. This kind of thing just annoys me. I felt it should have been more violent, less ... cartoonish.And the biggest thing that I have a problem with is Juliet's death. I love how the director has Romeo dying just as Juliet waking, I feel that was a good choice and a very dramatic one. However, there is significance in Juliet bringing a dagger to her heart. It is not the same when she blows her brains out. The story loses a lot with the way it is in this movie. This should have not been changed, it is far too big symbolically.I also want to mention the music. The music is excellent! It fits the scenes, and is a nice mix of popular music and classical style. One of the reasons why I can forgive some of the annoyances.It is one my favorite movies, even with my complaints.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Romeo and Juliet, a classic in every form","I find it incredible how people today cannot appreciate the beauty of speech. In Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet, using Spakespeare's original text help the EDUCATED viewer understand the deep sub-text. Perhaps a person who has not studied Shakespeare will not understand that using a modern day situation, with Shakespeare's text, teaches the audience on cruel fate and how it can affect anyone.Allowing stereotypes to fill the persona of Montague and Capulet helps conceive the viewing of one true love and destiny. Two groups, so different can still hold and give forth love for each other. Seeing this in a mainstream movie may be able to help this new generation that holds true to a split society.To people who have reviewer this movie with negative comments: When writing a piece that that public may view, be sure to use a polite and professional tone.Sincerely, Jade",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
an awful film,"far superior to any other adaptation of shakespeare's extremely boring tragic love story, but the movie still sucked, i was moved at the end a little until the totally unrealistic gunshot(no blood).  The acting was pretty good, but not great, they couldn't really flow with the old english language of shakespeare with the exception of Father Lawrence.  It had it's moments but for the most part the movie was just terrible, don't waste your time.  My rating - 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Story Ever,"The chemistry of Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes, is one of the best for years. They seem made to act together, I hope they will do something more. I have to say if it had not all been in Shakespearian, it would have made it make more sense, half the time you had trouble understanding what there saying, except for Dicaprio, he has a knack for Shakespeare, his performance also shows what he feels and you almost don't have to get his dialogue strait, you can just look at his bodie language. Its Claire Danes best performance since The Rainmaker with Matt Damon. The rest of the actings not so great, but because of Dicaprio and Danes, its definitely worth your two hours of time. So rent it, even if your a Leo hater. I have always thought it annoying that some people will not like an actor, like, Leonardo Dicaprio, or Orlando Bloom, just because there the ones all the girls have a crush on. It's no reason to hate them just because there better looking then you. Great Movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good concept in part, bad execution","I love Shakespeare made relevant through modern dress, etc., but the attempt to make Shakespeare's poetry sound ""conversational"" just didn't work for me. Nobody I know speaks conversationally in iambic pentameter. The language begs for a more stylized delivery. I did like many of the sets and the ""rival gang"" flavor however. The helicoptors and car chases were dramatic and something that I could easily accept as something Shakespeare might have included if he had written the play in the current era. I can see why many people enjoyed this film. I just couldn't accept Shakespeare's language in modern conversational tones. It made the acting seem abysmal in places and totally unbelievable throughtout. It often seemed as if the actors had no idea of the meaning of the words they spoke. I'm sure this was not true, but the delivery made it seem so.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wildly cool...,"This is probably one of the most controversial films of all time. Some people loved this movie. And I mean 'loved'. Other people really, really hated it.

This movie is wholly imaginative and inventive. You cannot honestly say that you've seen anything like this before. And then there are the people that need to realize that this film is really nothing special. It is average. Wildly cool...but average nonetheless.Pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio (TITANIC), Claire Danes (BROKEDOWN PALACE), John Leguizamo (WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN?), Dash Mihok (THE PERFECT STORM), and Jamie Kennedy (SCREAM) star in this somewhat modernized version of William Shakespeare's ROMEO + JULIET.Towards the middle of the film, I got a little bored, but otherwise, this is a movie to see.

"A beautiful, unconventional adaptation full of raw emotion","This is an incredible adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. It's wild and unconventional and ridiculous, and that's what makes it so good. The director, Baz Luhrmann, knows that he's going out of the realm of what most people would consider to be a great screen adaptation of this play, and he uses that to its full advantage. This isn't just Shakespeare for a Shakespeare-reading audience, it's easily accessible and enjoyable whether or not you've read the play or can understand the full meaning behind each line. The direction and scenery is raw and unpretentious; the modern setting means it doesn't distract you with elaborate costumes or historical accuracies, just lets the pure emotion of the story come through. It really brings across the point that this type of story resonates through every time period and every generation, and can mean just as much to a modern audience as it did in Shakespeare's time.The performances in this movie are incredible, much more so than in any other version of this play, stage or screen, that I've ever seen. Harold Perrineau plays infamous entertainer Mercutio with both dramatic flair and emotional intensity, and brings the character to life in a way that I believe Shakespeare himself would have appreciated (whether or not he would agree with the fact that he was dressed as a drag queen at a point in the movie), and John Leguizamo's Tybalt is appropriately fiery and sneering while bringing an interesting humanity to this typically villainous character.The leads also turn out stunning performances. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes were perfectly casted as these star-crossed lovers, and they embody their youth and naiveté in a way that, for the teenage audience watching this film, makes it feel fresh and personal. They speak Shakespearan dialogue with a raw, unpracticed ease, bringing to mind the way that these young lovers would have really spoken. Leo's Romeo is every bit as perfectly over-the- top and romantic as one might expect, and he handles both sweet, intense and tragic scenes with a realness that tears at your heart. Claire's Juliet has that same quality, and she lends even iconic lines (""Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"") a new twist.All in all, don't judge this movie by its cover. A modern version of Romeo + Juliet featuring gunfights and costume parties might not be for everyone, but it stays so true to the genuine, relatable themes of the play that the backdrop can't possibly impair your enjoyment.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Chemistry Between Principals Makes This Watchable,"Back in ninth grade English class, our teacher showed us this movie after we read William Shakespeare's famous play. The film made an impression on me back then, and I wanted to see what would happen 15 years later. It isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, but ""Romeo + Juliet"" does manage to render the tale in a bit more of a user-friendly format.For a basic plot summary, this movie uses the exact language of Shakespeare's play...but sets it in a modern, urban environment. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) are the principles, of course, while Harold Perrineau & John Leguizamo have important roles as Mercutio and Tybalt, respectively.What makes this film hold up at least somewhat are the performances by DiCaprio & Danes. They are perfect for their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. Both ended up being fine thespians, so in hindsight this should not have been surprising. Many fans of the Romeo & Juliet story laud the 1968 version as ""top dog"", but IMHO the two principles here, at least, put up performances every bit as good as from the earlier effort.The reason this one isn't an all-time classic? The direction from Baz Luhrmann is just too weird. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the urban, modern feel without making things so bizarre. The duels between the houses are terribly over-the-top, while I've never once understood why viewers need to see Mercutio prance around in drag for so long. Even the camera work and cinematography is odd/bizarre. Had they toned down that craziness a bit, this could have rocketed higher for me. As it was, like I mentioned earlier, I really only enjoyed the Romeo/Juliet interactions.Overall, ""Romeo + Juliet"" is good for showing reluctant Shakespearean ""scholars"" (e.g. high- schoolers), but other than that it is decidedly average. DiCaprio and Danes give it their all, but all the weird stuff going on around them really detracts from the passion of the story. If only they had played it just slightly more serious...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Luhrmann,"I've touched upon this subject before on IMDb: when Baz Luhrmann adapts a work, the resulting creation, regardless of how faithfully it adheres to the source material, ultimately becomes a Baz Luhrmann piece. This, I believe, is a testament to his cinematic genius.This very phenomenon can explain the distinction of this film adaptation of William Shakespeare's oft-adapted masterpiece.We witness the journey of a protagonist, not as Shakespeare envisioned him, but as Luhrmann reimagines him. Yet, Shakespeare's signature remains etched in every detail.The music, the sets... The film's art and sound teams have outdone themselves. As in ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001), songs and lyrics are woven seamlessly into the narrative, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.We are introduced to Romeo's character through the melancholic strains of Radiohead. His first encounter with Juliet, despite its undeniable beauty, is juxtaposed with the image of clownfish trapped in a fishbowl, accompanied by Des'ree's haunting vocals. Mercutio (Harold Perrineau) and Tybalt (John Leguizamo) retain their pivotal roles in shaping the narrative, just as they do in the original play. And in a bold move, Mercutio, one of the most masculine characters in the play, is presented as transgender. These are but a few of the countless details that make this film so unique.I saw this film in every cinema hall in Istanbul when it was released. Later, I acquired the VHS and now own the Blu-ray edition, which boasts one of the most impressive (not necessarily the most beautiful, but certainly the most impactful) Blu-ray menus in my collection.I urge you to watch this film (and, if possible, all of Baz Luhrmann's films) with a high-quality sound system. The music and sound design are integral to the cinematic experience, adding layers of depth and emotion to the narrative.""Romeo + Juliet"" (1996) is a bold and visually stunning reimagining of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy. Luhrmann's signature style, with its rapid-fire editing, anachronistic soundtrack, and vibrant visuals, breathes new life into the familiar tale. The performances are electric, the emotions are raw, and the overall experience is one of cinematic exhilaration. It's a film that challenges our preconceptions, pushes boundaries, and ultimately celebrates the enduring power of love and the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo + Juliet is a very awful and annoying movie that is a pain to sit through.,"The main problems with this movie is the directors style, which is generally a cringe worthy mix of something you would expect to find on MTV combined with a YouTube video where the editor had just discovered all of the effects. Just in the beginning scene alone, there's a scary number of consistent annoying zooms into close ups and the scene consistently interchanging between normal and slow motion. Instead of helping to progress the story, as any good film should, it instead gets in the way of the story, feeling as if the director was more worried about showing of his previously mentioned style and trying to be noticed instead of creating a good film adaptation of Shakespeare's work.The film then plummets to an even more more intolerable level as it reaches its first talking scene. Not only does the pacing of the film majorly slow but you realise that all the dialogue is written in old English. This makes some of the performances seem very flat because it is as if the actors don't actually know what they are talking about.Overall, this film isn't worried about its story but instead, it is constantly distracting you from it with the director trying to say ""Look at me and my style"". This makes the film very hard to sit through due to its cringe worthy style, weak performances and uneven pacing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Baz is so *cool*,"The only drawback to this ""entertainment vehicle"" of a movie - I don't know how anyone could've hated something so original- was Claire Danes. Other than the fact that, at the time, she probably was cast to attract a young (more female, which would also explain Dicap.) audience, I don't know how she was chosen over countless MUCH BETTER actresses of her agegroup.I don't understand what the deal is with people saying the dialogue was blurted out without comprehension or understanding from the speakers. I thought it was perfect in this aspectMany of those who ""hate"" this movie are probably reminded of the more conventional romantic R&J of 1969. I believe though, that there are a few scenes that are actually more romantic in the new version, like the wedding, and in a twisted sort of way, the suicides.All in all, a GREAT movie to watch: extremely creative, eccentric, great acting (except for Danes), KILLER soundtrack, and on top of that, just happens to derive its screenplay from Mr. William Shakespeare's most tragic love story of all time.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best films ever.,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? It is one of the best films ever and an absolute must-watch for Shakespeare-on-film aficionados. I marvel at how clever this is every time I watch it. Baz Luhrmann understands the source material like the back of his hand. The film is full of Shakespearean touches, is true to the spirit of the play even if things are cut for the sake of time, and is - as well as all that - just a cracking watch.This is what Shakespeare is: Shakespeare's plays were popular art in their day. And Baz's direction is perfect for this particular play: the frenetic, all-moving, shaky-camera energy of his usual style, whilst not to everybody's tastes, ties in with R&J's symbolism perfectly, because the whole tragedy is about a love that moves too fast. Everything happens too quickly. Rather like those blink-and-you'll-miss-them camera shots.And, as every adaptation of R&J should be, it is sweepingly romantic. Yes, the play advises caution and moderation; yes, you can make a case that the love goes wrong almost because it is too intense - but we are still meant to get swept up in the aesthetic. We are still meant to root for the lovers and feel what they feel. Danes and DiCaprio get that down to a T.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"amazing idea, big mess","This movie is a great concept with a messy execution.The idea of translating Shakespeare into modern times is a very fun idea. Swords are now guns, horses are now cars and the dialogue has to come out of moddern gangster stand offs. It just sounds fun. The first couple of scenes oozes charm.Sadly the dialogue is very heavy since it's Shakespeare and few of the actors can carry the dialogue. This is sadly true for both Romeo and Juliet who doesn't sell me the epicnes of Shakespeareian dialogue.The charm quickly subsides though, as the story simply didn't grip me. The movie simply isn't making itself interesting with it's concept and it becomes more of a chore to follow along.The edeting in this movie is not good.

However, I heard nice things about it, and decided to rent it.Well. I was pleasantly surprised.

I think it takes a lot to make Shakespeare feel relevant to a modern teen, but Baz Luhrman managed to do this.The acting is superb. I love Claire Danes, and it was nice to see what she is capable of. Of course, I already know that Leo can act. And the twist on the ending was brilliant. Throughout the last twenty minutes or so, I found myself hoping against hope that maybe this could have a happy ending.

From Shakespeare to Punk Rock to MTV,"William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the classic love story about two youths who fall in love. The setting is a city called Verona, where two households families fight each other off. One family is called the Capulets and the other is called Montagues. In this modern day adaption of the classic play, it turns out that wasn't fresh enough. The movie starts out pretty fast, with the camera making fast movements when we are introduce by new characters.

Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo, and Claire Danes does a very good job as Juliet. The interpretation of the nurse is very different then what I first imagined it would be when I started reading the play, but it works.

"Garish eye-candy, revamps classic love story with style","Shakespeare was first and foremost, an entertainer. His job was to hold the interest and attention of the violent, uneducated rabble his all-male cast performed to, and if that meant introducing copious amounts of under-age sex, blood and vengeance, well then, so be it. Sword-fights, murder, betrayal, romance, black magic, secrecy, incest and insanity all frequently featured in his productions, some of which were performed right in front of our very own Virgin Queen Elizabeth I. They were there to grab the spectators attention, and then intoxicate them into the story, dialogue, characters and their lives to create a fantasy atmosphere that would prove to be so gripping, that they could not possibly wish to escape back to ye olde tavern for a pint of warm ale. And so today, Australian director Bazmark Luhrmann, most revered for his humorous and innovative spoof on Ozzie dancers in the independent film Strictly Ballroom' - and most hated for his annoying record, Sunscreen', has taken Shakespeare's sixteenth century storyline and spiked its coke with acid, to inject a clearer message to our Tarantino-worshipping Generation X - whoever they are. This is Shakespeare for the masses.The setting of the film, Verona Beach is presented as a big, dusty, putrid city, filled with big dreams and small salaries. An amazing kitsch, Catholic statue of the Virgin Mary towers above the city alongside the Diet Coke ads, supported by a crude barrage of scaffolding. The ocean breeze whips the sand up to create an outstanding host of gritty effects during some of the latter fight scene, and with its soundtrack containing the Butthole Surfers and Everclear, one cannot escape this imaginary world of garish colours, excessive noise pollution and fairgrounds on the beach. It's like West Side Story for the common people - which is probably why I like it. Just joking.The blur of brash and exciting colour fuels the film, dizzying the audience, enveloping us in its passion, displayed through the star performances of all the members of the cast, as each actor lives their part with true and devout conviction and dedication. The script has been cut drastically, but because of Luhrmann's clever use of imagery, symbolism and innovative direction, the core of the story is never lost or even left to incorrect interpretation. The transformation of the play, from a cliched stage of cod-pieces and tin-foil swords, into a powerful piece of cinema pushes both boundaries and emotions. Mercutio appears as a drug-pushing, African-American drag-queen, with more than a slight crush on Romeo yet despite the stilettos and faux-fur pink bra, still delivers a hugely accurate and captivating portrayal of the hero's best friend. The famous siloquoy where Mercutio describes the dangerous powers of love is intimately linked with the ingestion of some white dove e, and amazingly the two merge seamlessly. The masked ball is announced by the devilishly wicked Lady Capulet via cable television, and the extravagant event itself is a brash and dazzling trip. The two fathers are presented as archetypal Sicilian dons, with a tattooed Tybalt literally stealing every single scene he appears in. There is also a helicopter chase, plenty of shoot-outs, a stall called The Merchant of Venice', a mailing service known as Post. Post Haste', and Romeo's chill-out spot for introspection and smoking, the Sycamore Grove, turns out to be a derelict playhouse. This film is truly imagination working at its finest. The traditional balcony scene is transported beautifully to the Capulet's swimming pool, where Romeo, hiding in the shadows, surprises his crush, and together they hurtle into the water. This scene is fresh and witty, a continuous kiss-or-not-to-kiss. Claire Danes gives a passionate and sweet performance as Juliet, spicing up our heroine with a slice of 90s girl power, while DiCaprio is a strong and determined leading male, romantic with an element of vulnerability and adolescent awkwardness. Both are correctly portrayed as young innocents without voices, only finding themselves in eachother. Infact, Luhrmann fully exploits the sensuality and dramatic effect of water throughout the film. We first met our heroine staring face down in a basin of water, gazing languidly into the camera, stoned and angelic, her incredibly long red hair floating around and framing her pale and placcid face. Romeo is seen plunging his head into a sink of H2O following his dose of drugs, emerging with dripping wet hair, presently spying Juliet through the home of some tropical fish. The best scene provides the forum for Tybalt's murder, shot in a thunder storm, infront of the great Virgin Mary statue, where our victim hurtles back into the fountain, saturated in a heady mixture of water and his own blood. Symbolism litters this film like gold-dust at the bottom of a rainbow. Waking up beside Juliet following their illicit wedding night, scars coating his body, Romeo kisses Juliet and then prepares to leave. As she begs him to stay he grabs the bedsheets which billow over them, creating a protective white tent, before finally whipping the sheets up around them, sheltering them from the harsh daylight and the reality it inevitably brings. In fancy-dress, Romeo appears as a knight in shining armour, Tybalt as Satan, the Capulets as decadent classical characters, and Juliet as a vision-like angel. Needless to say this film is breathtaking to watch, providing a full two hours of unstoppable eye-candy. It has a fail-safe script, obviously, and an amazing soundtrack. Everyone can act in it, which is pretty rare these days, and everything fits together like lycra on an aerobics queen. A resounding full marks for the revamped Romeo and Juliet. Better than the simpering Shakespeare in Love' anyday.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A different point of view,"This movie is different from other interpretations of the long known drama, and perhaps this is why its review is so mixed. First of all, if you are a purist, don't bother. Go rent something else. But if you are not, this is a wonderful play very well done, with a very good cast (I particularly don't like di Caprio but here the guy is good). From my point of view, this movie keeps the essence of the drama and puts it on something close to L.A. Hey there are still some people who don't like West Side Story either!

"I really wanted to hate this movie, but it turned out to be the Bard meets John Woo.","I saw this movie after I was familiarized with both Titanic and My So-Called Life, both of which I hated powerfully. So naturally I wrote this film off as another horrible modern day translation of a great story. I admit to the world that I was wrong. The movie remained true to the original material and yet packed in enough action to keep me and I'm sure most of the rest of my generation enthralled. You know that this isn't your parent's Romeo when Tybalt goes wild, two gun style with his 9mm Swords. However the acting and story are there also, making it a well rounded movie and not just a bastardization meant to entertain Gen-Xer's whose attention span never exceeds 3 minutes. All in all this one goes down on my list of great films of my generation, so don't be scared away by Leo, this isn't necesarily a ""chick"" or ""date"" movie (though it would be fine to view with your significant other.)

Romeo + Juliet (1996),"Directed by Baz Luhrmann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, John Leguizamo, Dash Mihok, Miriam Margolyes, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Paul Rudd, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Jesse Bradford. (PG-13)Shakespeare's tale of doomed star-crossed lovers is updated to the modern age, transported to the Miami-esque city of Verona Beach, and given a gaudy MTV-style makeover so it can vulgarly pander to the youth market (coming up just short of giving the couple a crass gossip-rag nickname like ""Rom-liet""). A misguided conceit resulting in a headache-inducing mess that encapsulates the words of the Bard but produces none of the poetry; it may not desecrate the text, but the dialogue rarely comes to life coming out of the mouths of this cast (Postlethwaite being the chief exception, playing Father Laurence instead of Friar Laurence...even though he's still called a friar at one point because, well, that's the sort of care that was put into this ""adaptation""). DiCaprio's star qualities can't be denied and Perrineau's flamboyance is well-suited for Mercutio, but it's all drowned in hyperactive editing, lurid camera filters, sledgehammer symbolism, and tonal whiplash. Does feature a surprisingly effective soundtrack considering the eclectic mishmash of genres--buy the CD, skip the movie. Full title is ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" which is equal parts laughable and depressing, and less suitable than it would have been to release ""Jane Austen's Clueless"" the previous year. M. Emmett Walsh cameos as the Apothecary; Brian Dennehy also appears briefly as Romeo's father, but he has nothing to do (most of his scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor).36/100",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
surreal but with faults,"While this modern version of Romeo and Juliet does have problems, it succeeds enough to win my recommendation. Set in a world that seems modern but even somewhat out of this world, this visualization is like a Salvador Dali painting, fascinating, new, strange. Some faults include excess modernization or costuming like Pete Posthlewaite's tattoo, Tybalt's ""gangsta"" like slickness and definitely Mercutio's drag outfit! That last scene and also the first are very weak and the film can occasionally be a bit awkward. However, Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent. Both have done much of their previous and future work in depressing or tragic roles and both are very convincing with their agony and emotions here. Some of the cinematography is beautifully shot, notably the kiss in the elevator and the aquarium scene. This film should also be commended for exposing teenagers or other modern movie watchers to Shakespeare and how his work is completely relevant today.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't work,"Had to post this. I've kept reading (since MOULIN ROUGE was released) what a genius Baz Luhrmann is, but I have to say I was disappointed with this. Maybe it's possible to set Shakespeare in the present day, but on this evidence, it just doesn't work. I watched the film on a rented DVD. I don't know the play well, and on occasions lost track of what was happening, so I tried to follow the text in my Complete Works of Shakespeare. It seemed to me that there were lots of passages of INVENTED Shakespearean verse - or did I just imagine this? Apart from the failure to convey the emotion that's vital to this story, there were examples throughout where the modern setting made nonsense of the story. At the crux of it all, I couldn't help asking myself why Pete Postlethwaite didn't tell Claire Danes ""Now shallst thou to thy mobile phone ... Go and inform thy Romeo of our deed""! thus averting the tragedy and saving us from a truly feeble rendition of the climax. To me, the Zeffirelli version was better on every level.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
So disappointing,"When this version of R&J was in the cinema here in the Netherlands, I went to see it. Now only two days ago, April 27, 2005, I went to the store and bought the DVD because I enjoyed Shakespeare in Love (with Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Colin Firth) and wanted to see the original (text) of R&J again. I didn't quite remember what this specific movie was like, but when I started to see it, it was a huge disappointment for me.Although it might be a good idea to set the play in modern time, it is the way it was translated in todays world which quite offended me. I quit looking when Mercutio arrived to the Bal Masque of the Capulets.In my humble opinion, this version of the tragic and lamentable story of Romeo and Juliet, makes it vulgar and dirty. Perhaps I only saw the baddest part (licking the nipple of Benvolio (I think) and the outfit and acting of Mercutio) but it was enough for me to simply shut of the computer and return the DVD to the store.",,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent look at Shakespeare...,"If Shakespeare were alive today, he would probably be a Hollywood writer/director, and would most likely approve of this updated version! One has to remember that in his day, Shakespearean theater was not ""high society"" entertainment, but was rather looked down upon as ""vulgar"" and as the popular entertainment of the day! Director Baz Luhrmann keeps the original text of Shakespeare intact, but updates the setting to modern-day. While at first strange, the juxtaposition of modern setting and Elizabethan dialogue DO work, and give the audience (especially those of the younger generation) a truer and better appreciation and understanding of this classic play.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"a ""modern"" version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet","This movie was atrocious. The only reason it received a 3 was because of Leonardo Dicaprio. Honestly, what is the point of putting in original dialect? It completely clashes with the modern setting and dress. If my guess is correct, the modernization of the play was to appeal to those of a younger generation, yet, when coupled with the original Shakespearean dialect, the viewers have no way of understanding what the actors were saying. This is the entire reason schoolbook versions have definitions of each different phrase or word that might be misleading or confusing. Claire Danes isn't actually THAT great of an actress, nor pretty enough to put beside Leo as the leads. This movie is a complete disappointment and you should never ever watch it if you know what's good for you.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think I'll throw up now!,"No, they didn't do it right. I've got no problem transporting old stories into a modern setting...sometimes it really works well. Baz didn't make it here. Not once did I ever get the feeling that his cast even understood the old English much less hold a passion for the story or the characters. Even the more mature actors like Sorvino and Dennehy, both of whom I respect deeply, seemed a bit stilted in the delivery of most of their few lines. Anyone who truly knows the meaning of 'wherefore', will absolutely dislike most of the individual performances in this enactment. If you really want to enjoy this story, give up on DiCaprio and Danes and go with Whiting and Hussey in the 1968 Franco Zefferelli version. If you've already tried to give this one a fair shake, watch the other one and really feel the passion!I'd just like to add, Romeo and Juliet was brought into the 20th century in 1961. It didn't use ""olde englishe"" but it did use music. It was directed by Robert Wise (yes he has also directed Star Trek stuff) and Jerome Robbins. This version won 10 Oscars, including Best Picture. It was called, ""West Side Story"". The Wise/Robbins execution was excellent.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost Watchable,"Romeo+Juliet is what happens when MTV tries to liven up one of Shakespeare's works.  It is better than the toxic waste that Franco Zeffirelli made in 1968, but still suffers in casting and other departments.  I am happy that Kenneth Branagh didn't get involved with this as he is destroying the basis of the plays.Unfortunately, the camera style (and music) are all too reminiscent of a music video and this winds up looking (and sounding) like Michael Bay made this movie.  Ohmigosh, I just hurled the ultimate insult!  I still would really love to see someone like Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg make an adaptation since they are certainly more intelligent directors.Leonardo DiCaprio was a poor choice for Romeo, I was unable to sympathize with him or the idiots that casted him.  Claire Danes isn't any better with her delivery.  I will say that Pete Postlethwaite (probably the smartest actor on the production) captures my defining image of Father Laurence.  He gets my kudos for the movie.Overall, a Shakespeare movie that is almost worth your time if you are too braindead to read the plays yourself.  A more thinking person should do the latter.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Romance
A 6.8 score is unrepresentative.,"I'll admit to have been shocked when I saw this movie scored 6.8. It led me to read many of the reviews, good and bad, and the film seems to have polarised its audience, they either loved it or hated it. I'm most surprised by those who profess to be Shakespeare fans.Shakespeare was not a period dramatist, he was thoroughly modern in his day. His plays tackled (amongst others) the military, comedy, drama and love and romance and he was well feted for his works in his lifetime.If I were a fan, I should be delighted that his original (and now ancient) dialogue could be so well blended with the modern visual. Rather than spinning is his grave, I'd say Shakespeare would celebrate the fact that his play (screenplay here) still holds merit in a sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll twentieth century setting.If you prefer, or can only accept, your Shakespeare with tights, green velvet costumes and feathers in the cap along with cut glass English accents and endless pauses to stare into empty space then don't watch this. If, however, you feel you can overcome the modern visual blended with its ancient dialogue, then this is a must because if you like it then I promise you'll love it and, if you love it, you will be well rewarded.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Where for art thou, entertainment?","Romeo + Juliet is a failed attempt to modernize Shakespeare's classic play written all the way back in 1591. Its glossy production, awkward mix of old and new, and newer technology added to give it the ""present"" feel completely destroys the love aspect of the film and turns it into a goofy and lame adaptation of one of literature's many classics.Obviously, this was meant for kids who don't like reading, but like action films. The scenes are loaded with primary colors and the action rarely ceases. The acting is beyond over-dramatic, and turns the characters into buffoons who barely represent their respected characters in the play.The nail that seals the coffin is the film's mix of the old and the new style. It can't decide if it wants to fully change Shakespeare's work, or keep some in and some out. We get a messy result. The film hybrids over using pistols instead of swords and car chases to entertain ones who believe the play is ""boring."" To cover up the madness and chaos exploding on screen we get annoying and volume enhanced rock tunes that are out of place and just a complete and total waste of time. I would have never thought Radiohead would've made it in a film titled Romeo + Juliet.The storyline is kept pretty much the same; Romeo and Juliet are star-crossed lovers who desperately want to be together. Romeo coming from the Montague household and Juliet from the Capulets, have known that their parents have had an ongoing rivalry forever but can't help but find solace in each other.Despite its age and overall outdated language, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet has managed to leach itself into the school curriculum year after year. The book is in no way a bad read. I found some parts hard to understand, but I was caught up within a few minutes. It does involve re-reading and your full attention.The book is very outdated in terms of dialog. Obviously, no body says ""Where for art thou, mother"" in 2011. The most important aspect of a book is being able to read it and comprehend what it is telling you. Sometimes, that can be a task for current readers of the play. But with internet and technology at its peak I'm sure understanding it will be no problem.I'm in no way bashing the book. I found it to be quite enjoyable and quite sad, but sometimes I kind of wish I knew what was happening instead of assuming. Still, the play is the grand-daddy of literature. I can except that, and I'm glad I read it.With actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and John Leguizamo I can only imagine how this film would've played out if it was made with some level of seriousness. It has been so long since we saw a new R&J adaptation, you'd think one would be remade again to fill the void.What really kills this film, is the dialog. It keeps in place lots of Shakespeare speak. It is not only laughable, but questionable. First you want to completely modernize the film, then you want to keep the dialog. Maybe in someone's head it sounds pretty amusing, on film, it is atrocious and unable to take seriously. Especially when the film pans shots of some unnamed fat guy sitting on a lawnchair with no shirt on. Seriously? Romeo + Juliet is definitely a unique adaptation, but it is absolutely a horrendous turnout. Anyone in school watching this will likely be amused by its quirky take on the play and find it way more entertaining than the play itself because of its more blatant style. Shakespeare fans will be greatly letdown by the film's mockery of the play's tragedy. It is definitely a stain on Leo's filmography, and the rest of the cast's.Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, John Leguizamo, Harold Perrineau, Pete Postlethwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Rudd, Christina Pickles, and Jesse Bradford.

Excellent film.,"I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Romeo was particularly outstanding. Along with the amazing performances by Claire Danes, and the awesome dude who played Mercutio.I was also very impressed that the Director stayed committed to the original language used by Shakespeare - I think if the language had been edited it would have lowered the standard of the film considerably.Along with works like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' and 'The Basketball Diarys', I really have to give props to DiCaprio, and rate him as a truly excellent young actor. And if I was a chick, I'd totally hit that :PAlso brilliant was the sets, costumes, and pretty much everything! The last thing that made it awesome for me was the soundtrack. Anything with Radiohead is going to be good, but the other music was great to. 'Talkshow Host' by Radiohead takes the cake though! It fit in PERFECTLY with the feeling of this movie.I thought this was outstanding, and I definitely recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"it's not a terrible movie, it's just..... huh?","I remember seeing Romeo + Juliet in a high school English class... or at least I'd like to pretend I did. If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all: casting.And I don't mean that in the sense of ""oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess"", that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that ""oh, I'll cast them for this look and that"", but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Creative interpretation of Shakespeare's Great Love story,"I will be the first to admit bias because I am a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. However, much credit must also be given to the creative team for their modern remake of R&J. The movie, like Moulin Rouge as one example, has put a great deal of time into costume, settings and music. As a side note, the soundtrack for R&J is phenomenal and I still listen to it nearly 10 years later. The story stays very true to the play with Elizabethan English instead of modern English. One big surprise is the portrayal of Mercutio. All I can say is that this definitely was not Shakespeare's intention, but it's quite amusing. The use of Elizabethan English in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare has one evident drawback; seeing people in the modern age speaking in such a fashion can make the movie seem a bit silly at times. Other than that, I loved it and the romantic aspect in the movie was so well done. I simply wish that the DiCaprio and Danes had a better cast working with them. Particularly for the parents. No excuses for not finding older actors who can handle Shakespeare, especially since they found the aforementioned stars who handled it quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent,"Baz Luhrmann is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen.  He goes past what everyone will think and does his own thing.  An example would be his spectacular musical, ""Moulin Rouge!""  He did everything his way and it turned out to be something I truly enjoy.  That's why it's up for the second most amount of Oscars tied with, ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Now with Romeo and Juliet, Baz Luhrmann does an interesting twist.  He exchanges the older setting for a modernized one.  Many, I have heard did not appreciate this and probably did not believe that it should ever be done.  However, Baz kept the language and proved a fact I have recently learned.  My English teacher told my class that, ""Times change, but people don't.""  That is demonstrated here in this film, the time changed, but the people did not.  They shared the same hate, the same love, the same tragedy.  Baz Luhrmann connected with a younger audience because I first saw this when I was 10 years old and somehow followed the story.  I hadn't ever read Romeo and Juliet, but that movie gave me this craving to learn about it.  So I waited to read it in school so I could learn what it meant and now I am.  The movie was different, but it still showed me how Shakespeare's plays have stayed alive through all these years, and it also showed me that times do change, but people do not.  It should not matter what way this was filmed or wasn't. Shakespeare borrowed a story told over time and made it his own.  He made it the way he wanted it, and everyone does the same when they borrow something. They make it their own, just as Baz Luhrmann did.   And people can personally hate it, but they should at least respect it.  I personally believe that this was a great retelling of the classic play and now that I am reading Shakespeare's version, I am understanding more and more of the movie.  To me, this was one in a million, and no one else could have pulled it off as great as he did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good concept ruined by talentless leads,"This film has the makings of greatness, but falls so short after the first scene. The vibrant visual style and art direction is brilliant and the director handles the updating of the classic 16th century love story almost seamlessly. On top of that, the supporting cast, especially Postlethwaite, Sorvino and Leguizamo are well suited to the roles.It all falls apart, however, when we are introduced to our leads. Leonardo Dicaprio has proved himself to be a talented actor in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and ""This Boy's Life,"" but his just isn't him at his best. He tries hard, but he's inexperienced with Shakespeare and can't get himself around the unnatural language and rhythm. Those lines he doesn't mangle he shouts unintelligibly.Clare Danes gave us a good performance in ""The Rainmaker,"" but is totally uninspired in this role. Her style is flat, and she delivers the lines with as much talent as the average highschooler would in a school production.The director had what could have been a very powerful and entertaining movie, but undermines it with the casting of two singularly unsuited actors in the title roles for the sake of drawing more of the MTV teenage crowd to the box office.For a better rendition of Juliet, I suggest Olivia Hussey in the 1968 Zeffirelli version.  For a better Romeo, try Gwyneth Paltrow's transgender performance in ""Shakespeare in Love.""",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Watch out for Mercutio and Tybalt, they are the best performances I have ever seen of those characters.

A fantastic-looking film which reinvents Shakespeare for a new generation,"Even if you're dubious about modern-day settings for Shakespeare, you should see this film. Like Moulin Rouge (also directed by Baz Luhrmann), it looks great, with vivid colours and great cinematography. Most of the cast are excellent, and even though Leonardo di Caprio can be a bit irritating, his melodramatic acting style really works for the character of Romeo, who after all is a melodramatic and overemotional teenage boy! The California gangland setting works brilliantly and the soundtrack is inspired.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
forbidden love revisited,"'Romeo + Juliet' stars Leonardo DiCaprio in an early role as Romeo, before Titanic. This film is an updated version of Shakespeare's play. The good thing about this film is that it brings a classic play into an easy way for our generation to understand the basic theme and story behind it while being as true to the play as it can, giving it a modern face-lift and having it take place in Verona Beach, Florida instead of Italy. Despite using the classic scenario about a forbidden and romantic love in modern times, the original play still appealed to me more, and I also preferred the 1969 film based on the original story. Still, it's not bad, but it is not good either.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

I loved it.,"I absolutely loved this movie!! It was just so well done!! It was so sad that i cried though. And i love Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes! They're both so young and cute! If it had been different actors i don't think i would have cried so much, especially if it hadn't been Leonardo DiCaprio. I don't understand why it only has a rating of 6.7! It was just so brilliantly made. I loved how they made it modern. It was really clever. And all the actors were really good and suited their parts so well. It is a really magical love story. If anyone hasn't seen it, I would completely recommend it, but be aware that it is very likely that you will cry! I just can't write how much I loved it. I really hope you all go and see it, cos if you're afraid they have ruined the classic, they really haven't. They use the same lines, and you'll recognise quotes.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beach boys speaking Shakespeare... how weird is that?,"William Shakespeare's classic play is updated to a modern context, but still using the original, Old English text. It's a bold move on the part of director Baz Luhrmann, who brings a hyperkinetic, choppy editing style to the film, as if to never let the viewers catch their breaths. And for the most part, using the modern day context works, helping to clarify what some of the more tricky lines actually mean by showing it in familiar circumstances which audiences can identify with.Despite the fact that the relationship of the two lovers, who were doomed not to last together is the focus of the movie, neither lover gives a very strong or charismatic performance. DiCaprio makes a good enough Romeo, although he seems to be content to coast along on his looks and fame, and doesn't invest much energy into creating a well developed character. Claire Danes is miscast, and out of place. She makes a dull, uninteresting Juliet, putting next to no energy into the role, as if she would rather not be there at all. She seems to struggle delivering her Shakespearian lines, not to mention giving little sense that she has any idea what she's saying at all. It's sad that the lovers, the center of the film, couldn't find a way to act more enthusiastic and involving. Because so much of the movie focuses on their drab relationship, the film drags in many parts. (although Luhrmann seems determined to throw in a gunfight after every intimate scene just to stop audiences from nodding off in their seats)The supporting characters are where performances improve, letting the scenes with characters other than the two lovers present much more interesting. John Leguizamo makes a wonderfully vicious Tybalt, yet has the insight to occasionally give an uncertain look in the midst of cheap fighting and evil deeds, as if he is unsure what he is doing is morally right. Pete Posthlewaite is a high point of casting; his gruff but kind Friar Lawrence is wonderfully acted, and he manages to make clear what he is saying, even to those who might not understand Shakespearian dialect. Harold Perrineau makes a flamboyant Mercutio, unafraid of dressing in women's clothing to attract attention, or go on a twenty minute long tirade (that's an exaggeration, but only slightly, Mercutio goes on forever!) without actually saying anything of importance.It was an interesting idea, and the modern day context for the most part works, helping audiences to identify with the circumstances, even if it does seem a little odd to see beach boys with pink hair and Hawaiian shirts spouting Shakespearian dialog. But Luhrmann's jumpy, incredibly energetic film style, combined with his seeming determination to turn the classic romance into an action movie, with numerous gunfights, gets tiring, and eventually deters more than complements the film. And with two dull, uninteresting performances from the lovers, the focus of the film, it's no surprise that despite Luhrmann's unquenchable energy, the film drags on and fails to retain interest.-5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Campy and nostalgic!,"If youre watching this for the first time in 2022, you wont like it. However if like me and you're watching this for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc time...well the nostalgia will be a feel like a good punch to the gut!I was 6-7 years old when this movie first came out, ...admittedly i understood absolutely nothing! The dialogue was too hard for my underdeveloped brain to comprehend why they were speaking in this weird dialect/manner. (I of course hadnt learnt about shakespeare , yet, at this point in my life) but i remember being completely CAPTIVATED by Leo Dicaprio and Clare Danes, i found the images striking, colourful, and super cool! And like any little girl madly had fallen madly in love with Leo!I absolutely love watching it as an adult because not only do i finally understand the dialogue (well more than I used to atleast) and the history as well of Romeo and Juliet, but once again the nostalgia just hits differently this time around. The swimming pool scene always gives me all the feels. Its a good one for all the romance lovers.Like any Baz Luhrmann movies, this was OF COURSE extravagant and cheesy. But also... so well directed!I also feel a more recent version wouldnt do this movie justice the way Baz did. It does feel like a campy play but made for the big screen and modern the late 90s.Three words : Simply a CLASSIC.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
marvins review,i did not really like the movie because romeo and Juliet was suppose to be a romance type thing and in the movie there was shooting and fighting.when i hear romeo and Juliet i don't think it was an action movie i thought it was suppose to be love and other things but it made no sense.i don't no about other people but i think it was stupid because romeo and juliet are no action its love and last time i new love was not shooting and killing it was suppose to be special forever and not dying and things like that.many people may not have tought about what i am saying but i thought about that during the movie and after the frist day i thought that i did not even want to watch it any more.,3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Baz nailed this movie, combining modern flair and not losing one bit of the Bard's voice. Leo and Claire had all the trappings of the intensity and pain of love won and lost, (which Claire nailed again in Stardust, utterly) and at 44 it's still my 2nd rainy day movie of choice.

"Not terrible, but not good either","If you want to watch an updated Romeo and Juliet, watch the original West Side Story. This version is just, well, not that great. I rate movies on how many times I get up to do something else, then subtract that from ten (to fit IMDB's rating system). A good film will be a ten down to maybe 8 depending on how many times I have to go to the bathroom. Less means there's a problem. The fact that I kept wanting to do something else rather than watch this film, tells all. Oh, the acting is good. Of course. I mean, I can't tell great actors from 'just good' ones. Bad is Chuck Norris. Leo and Clare do a great a job as possible with this material. But it just doesn't work (I've seen the play with actors doing the whole old English thing, for comparison).

Truly great movie,"This is a terrific adaptation of the classic love story. I love the that the director was willing to face the wrath of all the people that take themselves too seriously to 'go wild' and really make something unusual and unique. This was an *adaptation*. It was meant to be different than the original. It has been modernized. I can't think of a better way to modernize this classic and at the same time keep it's Elizabethan heritage intact. The symbolism was meant to be a little satirical, but I don't think most people got the jokes. All in all, the acting was superb and the cinematography was phenomenal. I recommend this movie highly.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shakespeare would roll in his grave....,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I began to watch this movie. Perhaps I still had in mind the 3 other Shakespearean films that I loved - and understood. That love ended here. While I appreciate what they were going for in this - probably to make high school kids enjoy it more (I'm a Much Ado about Nothing fan myself). However, the attempted mixing of modern day Verona and Shakeespearean language just don't seem to mix. While in any other setting (almost) the language might seem deep, perhaps difficult to follow,yet in this movie it just seemed insincere, and very stiff. I would recommend getting a different version of the classic tale if you are looking for true Shakespeare.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fascinating Modernization of Romeo and Juliet,"Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most common plays. The story discusses themes like love, hatred, and society. In Baz Luhrmann's movie of Romeo + Juliet, he was able to completely capture Shakespeare's themes by expressing the story through preserving the play's original language but also adding modern aspects. Some people may believe that the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli 's Romeo and Juliet is a superior story to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, and that Luhrmann's story was just some cheap modern repeat of the same story. But this new take on Romeo and Juliet made was able to make the story more easily understandable by removing the seriousness from the play. It was also able to offer the younger generation an opportunity to comprehend the significance of this story. This movie is definitely recommendable to anyone who can appreciate Shakespeare's stories no matter what artistic form the story is produced in.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Modernization of an old Classic,"""Romeo + Juliet"" was virtually perfect in it's transition between time periods while adding some humor and Hollywood fun into it. It exceeded my expectations for a modernization of an old play just by the fact it uses the original text of the play almost the entire way through with very little variation. However, it could have stood using real swords. Real swords would not have fit the time period, but it would have made it slightly more believable as a whole to the audience. Having guns labeled ""Dagger"" or ""Longsword"" made it still fit what was being said, but at the same time distracts from the fact that death by sword was often very bloody and there were often more than just one wound. That aside it was over all the best remake of any Shakespeare play that I have seen in my life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"excellent job by cast, very good movie","I actually saw this movie in the theater and wasn't much interested going into it (read: my girlfriend, now wife, chose the movie that night).  As I watched, the movie was lacking very much until the scene where DiCaprio and Danes meet with ""Kissing You"" being sung in the background.  That part changed the whole movie for me because of the easily recognized chemistry between the two of them - all without saying a word.  Since then I have come to appreciate this movie even more, and watch anytime it's on TV.The acting is excellent.  So good in fact, that the ending everyone knows will happen seems illogical - you believe they deserve so much better, that it will work out.  Leo showed why he was one of the best actors in Hollywood, pre-Titanic.  And I don't mean ""best under 25 or 30 years old,"" I mean overall.  Before the Titanic backlash, he was as solid as anyone. Also, Perrineau was unbelievable, stealing every seen he was in.  And Leguizamo again shows why is such a highly underrated actor.  I believe Danes was perfect casting for Juliet, nailing the role.The style may turn a lot of people off, but Baz Luhrmann made it worked very well as he always does.  Overall, this is a very good movie carried by the exceptional performances of the mentioned actors and even Pete Postlethwaite in a small role being his usual solid self.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perhaps it is a me problem?,"To be clear, I'm pretty young, and I know that people will be annoyed by this review because I may be young and arrogant and I understand that, as my old folks called me when i told them my thoughts on it. But I did not like this movie at all, the editing and shots feel like I'm overdosing on ketamine, and same with the writing. I know that they kept the original Shakespeare script in the movie but I don't know why, its outdated, confusing and serves not much purpose unless you have an interest in Shakespeare and English history.I liked some shots in the movie a whole lot, but generally the cuts and editing are so jarring that you can't even appreciate many of the shots. The characters are as boring as can be, I'm sure they were interesting at the original writing of Romeo and Juliet but nowadays they just aren't as good. And there were many parts that just had me yelling at the stupidity of the characters. It just feels a bit like a mess with the old script, weird almost South American setting, weird and confusing editing and shots, subpar sound, and just not much to love from a perspective of a normal moviegoer. I am happy for those who have an interest in it but I can personally not see it as anything very meaningful.

A stunning look at a classic story,"Film makers adapting Shakespeare for the screen usually run into two initial problems. Do they stay close to the original, more or less putting a play on film? Or do they update either dialogue or setting, or both? Baz Luhrmann has chosen the latter course, updating the setting while leaving the dialogue pretty much faithful to the original. The look of the picture is stunning. Modern day Verona seems both familiar and yet somehow strange. Ornate weapons and customized cars give it an otherworldly feel, while sweeping visuals and fast cut editing combine with a strong soundtrack that at times breaks into the action on screen, Mercutio's performance at the Capulet party is a prime example of this. The use of the original dialogue could have been more problematic, particularly when combined with a modern setting. Many people find it an effort to follow this type of language but they should make that effort, it can be very worthwhile. Just picking up the rhythm of the words can make you realize why Shakespeare's work has lasted so long. It is not just the stories, but also the way they are told. These two elements, sublime language plus a stunning visual design are well served by an excellent cast. Claire Danes is very good as Juliet, a little shrill at times, but she is playing a fourteen year old. As Romeo Leonardo DiCaprio is also good, but it is the strong performances of the cast as a whole that help make the picture what it is. Inventive, innovative and exciting",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
To perfection from tragedy,"Romeo + Juliet by Baz Luhrmann a perfect modern transposition of Shakespeare's timeless tragic romance.The good. It's perfect, I could list everything, but I'll concentrate on what makes it special. Superb designs, very colorful, for all the sets and costumes that are the result of great ideas demonstrating a lot of imagination. That alone is worth the watch. Imagination was also present in large amount in the translation to modern time. Luhrmann used all kind of artifice to enact the scenario for our delight, but also to make us understand that piece of dramatic literature. Excellent music and score, entrancing, irresistible.The actors. I feel like I have to name them all... even the boys from each family performed exceedingly well. I'll try to be brief and go for the gold. The young Leonardo DiCaprio and the young Claire Danes are the dream protagonist, simple, eager, sincere, emotional... Of the others, I'd say the most striking play came from Harold Perrineau as the energetic Mercutio, and John Leguizamo as the vengeful Tybalt. Of the lesser roles, I have to mention Pete Postlethwaite as Father Laurence, Paul Rudd as the suave Dave Paris, Dash Mihok as Romeo's cousin, and M. Emmet Walsh as the apothecary. Of course all four parents were also excellent.The bad. I would only remove the flashbacks just after the final death scene. It's very minor.The ugly. Nothing.The result. A must for all.

Hope you've made Shakespeare proud,"Romeo and Juliett's wild ride in the land of misplaced thee's and thou's! It's a film that brings us back to a time when English was so fancy that even commoners spoke like poets, and it has all the ingredients for a tragically hilarious disaster. Prepare for a comedy of the Shakespearean kind!Let's start with the language. Did Baz Luhrmann really think that by throwing in some ""thou"" and ""wherefore"" he could fool us into believing we were watching a genuine Shakespearean play? Bless his heart! It's like watching modern teenagers trapped in a time machine, shouting old-timey words without fully understanding them. We might as well have called it ""Shakespurr-ian,"" because it made me want to curl up into a ball and laugh like a cat chasing a laser pointer.But hey, let's give credit where credit is due. The fashion and design in this film are positively bonkers, in the best possible way. Who knew that Verona could be transformed into a vibrant neon-infused playground for star-crossed lovers? Luhrmann's penchant for extravagant costumes and over-the-top sets reaches new heights here. I mean, Romeo's Hawaiian shirt in the iconic balcony scene? Pure genius! It's like he stepped out of a time-traveling surfboard and crash-landed into the Renaissance. Talk about making a statement!And let's not forget the editing. The frenetic pace and MTV-style cuts gave me whiplash, but hey, at least it kept me awake during the slower moments. I swear, if I blinked, I would have missed half the plot. It's like watching a highlight reel of a Shakespearean soap opera on fast-forward. You want drama? This film delivers it in spades, throwing everything at you at once and leaving you wondering if you accidentally wandered into a Shakespearean-themed nightclub.Now, dear reader, you may be wondering why I gave this cinematic spectacle a mere 3/10. Well, despite the film's fashion-forward madness and editing acrobatics, there's just no hiding the fact that the Shakespurr-ian language feels forced and out of place. It's like serving a beautifully plated dessert with a side of pickles. Some may appreciate the combination, but for most of us, it's just plain confusing.So, if you're in the mood for a fashion show masquerading as a Shakespearean tragedy, Romeo and Juliett might just be the film for you. But be prepared to scratch your head in bewilderment and possibly sprain your eyeballs from the visual overload. I'm giving it a solid 3/10 because, well, it's like trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole. Hilarious at times, but ultimately a misfit.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Emotional rollercoaster,"Shakespeare is one of the most prolific and talented playwrite's in all history.  His work has been translated into countless languages, has been endlessly analyzed and discussed.  There are so many adaptations of his work that it's impossible to name or even remember them all.  So it must take an extraordinary cast, a visionary director and plenty of hard work to achieve a modern adaptation worthy of having Shakespere's name in the title.  Buz Luhrmann and company more than meet the challenge of re-telling this classic story of star-crossed lovers into a modern rendition. I was priveledged enough to see this wonderful movie on the big screen in 1996, and now 6 years 1 VHS cassette, 2 DVD's (original and special edition),  1 book, 2 cassette and 1 CD soundtracks later I find myself just as moved by the movie today as I was 6 years ago.  Buz Luhrmann and the cast take you on an incredible emotional ride.  From the beginning you feel overwhelmed as you try to embrace the visual and audible power of the film, but as the movie progresses you discover that you become intune with the pace of the movie and the characters.  Suddenly you hardly notice that the movie is actually utilizing old english language and that the play is actually 400 years old and you discover that you're relating to the characters and the story as though it was written for our generation.  It is as though Romeo and Juliet were frozen in time until now and are re-living their lives in the modern times for us onscreen. I could go on and on about the movie and how it manages to captivate you for the entire 2 hours.  I could discuss how the film takes you on the emotional rollercoaster from the hate driven rivalry in the opening, to the frolicing atmosphere of the Capulet bash, from the passionalte kisses in the pool, to the tragic and powerful ending that leaves you sobbing.  I could, but I won't because that would take ages.  Instead I'm going to say that this movie is definitely worth your time.  The cast is spectacular and Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes just shine as Romeo and Juliet.  Buz Luhrmann is a true visionary combining a rich character driven classic play with the lavish visionary feast for the eyes.  All that combined with the incredible soundtrack from many talented artists and you have a bonafide winner. Watch it for yourself and you be the judge.  My rating is 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sure, he edited it where he felt he needed to, and changed the ending (which I disagreed with) but every word you hear was written by the Bard himself - hence the title W.S.'s R&J.Enough people enjoyed this movie to warrant its worthy place in the canon of Shakespeare on Film - and those (purists) that didn't should have know beforehand that it would not be their cup of tea. That's why we have the wonderful, definitive Zefferelli R&J - which this movie sure didn't attempt to compete with.Personally, I thought this movie was a blast. That newscast opening scene (prologue) was wonderful. I rubbed my hands in imaginary glee when I saw it, because I knew I was in for a treat - and sure was. Let's not all take Shakespeare so seriously, just because he has this lofty place in our culture.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A powerful idea exploits the dark mind of Shakespeare,"When Romeo Montague (Di Caprio) falls in love with Juliet Capulet (Danes) their families' rivalries escalate in the fair city of Verona.William Shakespeare's tragic love play gets a dramatic current world make over in this vigorous and boisterous film that at 14 years old is still relevant, still powerful and will continue to be used in education to get the points of powerful politics and freestyle love across.At the time of its release we were in a state of film where violence was everything. Pulp Fiction had dazzled and outraged people all over the world a few years previously, True Romance in comparison to this 1996 picture had a brave love at first sight plot with bloody violence that Baz Luhrmann capitalized on to make a brutally fine adaptation.The film opens tremendously, capturing the whole film in essence with a fast montage of shots and an anticipation of what is to come. The TV fading away with a news report is the last thing you would expect from a Shakespeare work but what is more unusual is what is to follow.Pulling up at a gas station members of the Capulet family have a violent confrontation in a shoot out with members from the Montague household. Guns, gas and gross misconduct may be as violent and as the famous playwright intended and to implement his words into this modern telling is a startling contrast and personally, I believe this is such an important technique to making this film so exciting and universally unique.What the director has done is comprehend modern trends. He followed the trend of current cinema so that we could all appreciate the context and by taking the words of Shakespeare has made it easier to comprehend, a startling technique that has been such a beneficiary to school exams and also for pure viewing pleasure. Whilst it has been many years since I have read the play and studied it for my G.C.S.E's I recall watching and being baffled and now more years on I can still appreciate how powerful and how spoken this picture is.The work that has been achieved here is spoken through its various stars with Leonardo Di Caprio made a sex symbol and Claire Danes going on with more romantic roles. Their first meeting in the film through a fish tank is beautifully choreographed, a section that doesn't feel too cheesy thanks to the calm playing of the song 'Kissing You'.The love at first sight ideology has been worked to death in modern cinema in romantic comedy dramas and here it is tackled as in Shakespeare's mind, as pure and as lust that is crossed with startling rivalry.The film boasts a courageous soundtrack revelling in gorgeous settings that do justice to a story so strong, and yet so dark. This is a great film, taking a tragic story and turning into a modern telling of love repression and violence.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The way Shakespeare should be viewed,"When Baz Lurman decided to make a Shakespeare movie, he wanted to recreate the experience as it was in it's day, or in other words make it fun again. And that's just what he achieved with this well conceived drama.Set in Venice beach instead of the original Venice, Italy, all of the dialog is kept with some clever referencing used to help thread some of the problems into the story.Using a great sense of style, the film generally moves at a thrilling pace, with sometimes bizarre use of the camera making for an exceptional visual experience. All of the acting is well above standard, with kudos to Leonardo Decaprio and Clare Danes, though everyone does a top class job.The score is also top notch, taking some of the best bands and using them effectively to help create the right mood. If your a purist, you may dislike this quirky film, but if you want to see Shakespeare in an exciting portrayal, then this is well worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silly and campily gaudy on top of bizarrely unfitting Shakespearean dialogue,"The movie starts out extremely terrible, felt as if it was a student film. A bunch of punks, dressed very fancy, who are supposed to be Montagues and Capulets, are involved in a bombastic and flamboyant shootout outside a petrol station. They act like juvenile goons and yet they exchange lines with the prestigious Shakespearean dialogue, whilst yelling like fratboys, which just adds insult to the injury. I cringed so hard at this, but I swallowed the opening scene, as dreadful as it was.Maybe because I was so used to him as Jack, but I did not find Leonardo DiCaprio appropriate for Romeo. Claire Danes, a decent actress, was rather wooden and absent as Juliet. The two had no chemistry and it's no wonder they did not get along during the shooting of the film. Mercutio was, yet again, unjustifiably flamboyant and camp. The guy who played him was a good actor, but I blame Baz Luhrmann for this, really. He does not know how to tutor his cast.What was up with the police helicopter shots and the fast cuts during aerial cinematography? Some of the modern scenes just didn't complement the play's middle ages setting. So now Prince Escalus is an FBI agent of some sort here? The action scenes were really unnecessary. Romeo was not chased by the authorities in the play as he was heading to see Juliet's ""body"". But here, we get to see him being chased and shot at for the action's sake. He also did not murder Tybalt in cold blood. He kills him accidentally during a sword duel.The music (not the score) was bland and very early 90s disco. Mr Luhrmann, this is not Strictly Ballroom. He tried hard making this film like his typical, flashy music films. I just did not enjoy this style. Since he modernised it so much, why not just have the dialogue updated as well, to suit the film's setting? Romeo and Juliet (1968) beautifully welded the historical setting and the dialogue, and it succeeded. So why produce another film with the Shakespearean dialogue? It was utterly pointless and it didn't feel ""different"", just absurd and amusing. Speaking of amusing, I was chuckling when DiCaprio was speaking Shakespearean English in his Californian surfer accent and 1990s curtained haircut. Just no. Lol.Whilst this was a terrible film, I gave it a 4 because I still enjoyed Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, even if he was somewhat miscast. He carried this film. Mercutio's death scene was well acted and profound with touching background music. The ending with Romeo and Juliet exchanging sentimental words was nice too. But that's it, really.

They also did not match with their respective characters. It is a shame.

One of the worst movies ever,"I like most of Leo's work and Claire Danes is a halfway decent actress, but this movie is just complete garbage. Not sure who's bright idea it was to do this pseudo modern day interpretation of Romeo and Juliet, but it was a horrible idea, or at least a horrible implementation. 2 teenagers running around Southern California beaches in the late 1990's while reciting Romeo and Juliet in The King's English, just does NOT work. No surprise that it got decent treatment by movie critics, it has plenty of men singing and dancing around in drag in the party scene, which looked more like your typical San Francisco party than anything else. The movie critics just eat that up with a spoon, all the while calling it avant-garde. Do yourself a favor and just re-read the book, or watch the 1968 adaptation if you want to see a movie. Or if you're a Leo fan, you could always just re-watch James Cameron's adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, if you actually want to ENJOY a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Those things were in to please the upper-class and the ""critics"". But the Globe had a pit. Where the poor filed in for a good show. While Zeffirelli's version is how the events would have played out in real life, Luhrmann's adaptation is true to how the drama would have been played out on the stage.

It was not the best experiences because the movie was not really entertaining. And i didn't care for Shakespeare. His work did not reflect me in any way. His work was so meh at best.

Shakespeare for toady,"I would say that this film is made for the MTV generation except for the fact that any generation can easily sit through a couple of hours to watch this triumphant film. The story is old and well known to most. The actors seem like hotties with experienced actors, and on paper this would have been hard to argue against, but solid acting all around with great innovation (guns for swords, set in modern day) it holds up well and creates reputations for actors otherwise considered 'eye candy'. Two people come off very well in my opinion, Leonardo Dicaprio (as Romeo) and John Leguizamo (as Tybalt). With Leo playing the part of someone who thinks he's is in love to actually falling in love and Leguizamo as the relative with hatred and anger which is channeled greatly towards his foe.

I've seen the much-acclaimed 1960s version, and honestly, I was bored.  I think the choice of which parts of Shakespeare's work to use was MUCH better in the 1996 version.  It seemed to me that the older one left out some of the most beautiful and poetic lines.

If you loved this movie, please hear me out before accusing me of being a hater or anything like that. 1. The action scenes were overdone. Luhrmann tries much too hard to make the action scenes that of a blockbuster, using over the top acting and unnecessary high angle shots. 2. I am the first to say that Shakespeare was a genius, but I thought that the inclusion of the original text did not go hand in hand with the modern day style of the film very well. 3. Claire Danes is far from impressive in the role of Juliet. 4. I found the almost incestuous relationship between Tybalt and Juliet's mother a little weird and stupid, really. However, there were some redeeming factors to this otherwise poor film 1. Leonardo DiCaprio acts well. 2. The costume design is done tastefully 3. Radiohead is in the soundtrack.

I have to say they are both good films in their own right, but this one really has brought Shakespeare into the 21st Centuary. I love the way the film is shot and the choice of actors is interesting. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing Romeo and Harold Perrineau is astonishing as Mercutio (the best character in the film).I have to say, if you see one version of Romeo and Juliet (bar theatre) you simply must see this, it has a few loop holes but is generally all round good with one or two excellent scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo Juliet the movie directed by Baz Luhrman,"I had to come back to this movie and this director and give an airing to my opinion on this movie, somehow, from my recollection of it years ago and just seeing a snippet of it again on a TV rerun today.The fist time I saw it, I could not contain myself it was and is a work of genius. A transformation of archaic English phraseology into such a contemporary setting that manifest its power and grace of the human voice across the centuries. The potent content and import of every sentence and action portrayed and powerfully, passionately conveyed and clearly understood even to the uninitiated to Shakespearean voice.The modern settings and beyond clever, really inspired analogs to the Elizabethan moments and characters were absolutely brilliant.I could not believe when I heard it was initially reviewed with criticism at its original debuts. Then I thought so was Disney's Fantasia ... clearly the work was ahead of the critics in both cases.Let me just add a fact or two to buttress the credibility of my review here and my abilities to know a great talent when I see or hear it.Fact 1.) I was a teenager (~17-18) sitting in my family's living room and a movie came on that I started watching ... after a few moments time I was engrossed ... I was sure I was seeing something I had never seen before it was the most exciting, engaging show TV or otherwise I had ever seen ... I began trying to grab siblings passing by pleading with them you have to see this movie, I am telling you I have never seen anything like it before ... though it fell on deaf ears I nonetheless noted that movie and it wasn't till years later in a talk show interview that I found out who the director of that movie was. None other then Steven Spielberg and his master work that he says himself he goes back to review when he wants to remember how to make a movie, titled ""Deul"".Fact 2.) Years later a Texas Cowgirl band was playing at an IBM company outing that I was attending... they were I thought beyond good ... I had to have one of their CDs and went up to purchase one and with complete earnestness said, ""I really think you all will make it big."" The lead singer and bass fiddle player looked at me askance and sarcastically said, ""Oh you do, do ya!"". The other members graciously thanked me and signed the CD for me. They ended up being non-other than the Dixie Chicks ... and Oh by the way the lead singer was replaced before they went big time.Just two examples but I have had many similar occurrences over the years. And Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet is another one of them.Regards, GTC",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The part where Romeo poisons himself and when Juliet kills herself is sad. It's also sad because Romeo and Juliet never got to run away and enjoy life as husband and wife, and be free from their relatives who hated each other so much.

Review of Romeo and Juliet,"The 1997 version of Romeo and Juliet is a modern take on Shakespeare's original play. Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Romeo. The film did a good job of recreating the original play, but to a fault. The acting sometimes goes overboard and makes you laugh when the scene is supposed to be sad. In the original play, the focus is more towards Juliet, as she is the one who struggles with her family, Paris, and Romeo. But in the modern film, the focus is mostly centered around Romeo. This might because the director needed the star power of DiCarprio to carry the film. The film also copies the text word for word, which will often leave you wondering what the actors are saying.

Really thrusthworthy adoption of a classic play,"Some of my fellow commentators are irritated about this movie because it ""looks like MTV"". You have to remember that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, when he wrote these timeless plays, and knew that in 400 years they could fit in to whatever society. I believe that he is rotating in his grave, because of the fear many actors had had adopting and brushing the dust of Shakespeare's works. Branagh's Henry V is brilliant theater, but I do not think it works as a movie.In this film they have kept the respect for the old master in adopting the dialogue to modern american. And I think that Shakespeare in his heaven, is very pleased with that, because I do not think that Shakespeare expected people in 1996 to talk like they did at ""old Lizzys"" court",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

But just watching this movie, I felt no emotional connection to the characters. Since there's no real insight on Romeo's dream, their love at first sight (followed by an annoying amount of kissing) just seems so random and meaningless. When they find out about the other's family, they are only bothered for a moment.

Many people think that the movie is just a gangbanning play off of the classic 15th century play but it isn't and it especially speaks to the new generation. The sound track is amazing.  I used to have it but my brother broke it in half but if you have a chance to hear it listen to it.  Especially the theme song by Des'rea.  This movie is just so touching.  So many opportunity to stop them from killing them selves but it just went by.  You'll be asking yourself why didn't the deliverer ask for romeo.  Why didn't the Priest stop romeo's friend.  Why did juliet have to touch his face and not his leg. so many questions one fatal answer.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Odd one out,"I am convinced I'm one of the only people who hate this movie. People call it ""innovative"" and ""a work of art"", but i personally don't see how they can. This is a terribly overrated movie that certainly doesn't deserve the praise it's getting. The movie feels like a huge jumbled mess with horrible editing, and some pretty dreadful performances. It seemed more like a satire of Shakespeare then a modernization.First comes the performances. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is very bland at best. Even in the love scenes with Juliet, he had about as much personality as a piece of wood. Claire Danes was fine as Juliet. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either. John Leguizamo was dreadful as Tybalt. He had a terrible case of overacting that made me cringe at his performance. Harold Perrineau's performance as Mercutio was (much like Leguizamo's) plagued with another case of overacting. The only actor who seemed to do very well in his role was Pete Postlethwaite as Friar Laurence. He had the calm, mellow attitude that was accurate for a modern version of the character. As for the supporting cast, none of them really stood out and even if they did it wasn't for anything good at all.As for the production elements, it was very lack luster. The editing closely resembled that of Luhrmann's future film, Moulin Rouge. This means the editing was sloppy and quick, not allowing us to see some of the visuals created for the film. Everything else about the movie was just so forgettable: the music, the costumes, EVERYTHING.So overall, this movie really didn't do it for me. I still can't believe so many people love it when i (as a Shakespeare fan) couldn't find anything to like about it. I can only imagine the poor Bard is rolling around in his grave at this very moment, knowing that his brilliant work has been adapted into this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great acting, cinematography, soundtrack and story- who could ask for more!","You would be forgiven for expecting this film to be just a love story best suited to the more feminine viewer. Of course the star crossed lovers story is here but there is enough pace and testosterone to entertain those who want action too.Set in the modern day the swords are guns and the horses, cars but this only adds to an appreciation of the drama of this timeless story. The adaptations of the original play are both creative and witty. Shakespearian language is still used but don't let that put you off, you quickly get used to it.The acting is without fault, particularly for the lead roles. At times it even feels a little uncomfortable to be witnessing such powerful emotions.The cinematography is stylish and dazzling; many scenes are truly unforgettable just for the photography. I think that Donald M. McAlpine adopts a similar vivid approach he did later for Moulin Rouge but I found this to be less flamboyant.The sound track complements the visual feast. The music is varied and powerful- adding to the pace and texture of the storyline.Baz Luhrmann is worthy of huge acclaim in that he directed and produced this great film and also wrote the screenplay with Craig Pearce.I write this comment in 2007 and my appreciation of this classic is no less now then as when I saw it first 9 years ago. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nice update on a classic tale,This was a interesting film to watch a mix of new visuals and old English and the use of updating things that allowed to keep the same language like the Swords to the Sword as the name brand of the guns were genius. This telling of a old story with new elements as the fight between the two houses was updated to be a fight between to family companies and the wonderful prince being the police captain. Over all this is one of the most creative movies I have seen in a while a nice retell of a old story that everyone knows to a seemly different story that had lots of little differences that created a wonderfully updated and whimsical story but still had the classic feel of Romeo and Juliet which of course means it's incredibly sad and even though we know the ending it's still a fun ride to the end.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romeo + Juliet = Entertainment,"In this wildly artistic adaptation of the Bards classic, words stays true while more visually expressed, to underscore the incredible production. When the seasoned actors speak, you feel their words, but when the younger cast speak, it's the visuals that carry the feel of the plot. The music is clearly placating the MTV-ish audience and goes too far taking all too well known songs and giving them too important of placement. Torn over to include this review, I give the nod for Baz's vision and his guts in carrying it out. The infamous story is clearly laid out for a new generation and those caught in the middle of old school and Gen-X can appreciate the entertainment for what it is: a sassy, explosive, unstable and romantic tale of two star crossed lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly good.,"The fact that I loved Moulin Rouge convinced me to see Romeo + Juliet, Baz Luhrmann's previous movie but I was a bit worried. First of all, Romeo and Juliet has never been my favorite Shakespeare tragedy. And the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio had the role of Romeo did not convince me either. He is not a terrible actor, but he is certainly not a great one. Well, luckily Luhrmann's name convinced me to see this very good version of the classic play. His directing is impressive. The actors also do a great job. Danes and Dicaprio are a great couple, and John Leguizamo is perfect as Tybalt. His performance convinced me, along with his role in the incredible Summer of Sam, that Leguizamo is an excellent actor, someone with the potential to be remembered as one of the great actors of his generation. The rest of the cast is also very good. Sure, there might be a bit too much screaming from time to time but the energy with which Luhrmann films everything makes it seem normal. As for the story, it is told with enough passion to make me forget about everything I dont like about it. All in all, this movie is worth your time, although if you are in the mood for Shakespeare at his best, watch Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version of Hamlet. But if you dont have time for this wonderful 4 hour epic, Romeo + Juliet is a dynamic version of a classic story.78%",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not what you expect to see after reading the play.,"After reading the play by Shakespeare, seeing the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey, I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. From the moment the movie started you knew it wasn't your typical tale of the two star-crossed lovers. This was action packed and romantic. It showed that Romeo + Juliet were stupid teenager who thought they only had one way out. I felt there was a more human and realistic quality to the acting as well as the setting. It helped teenagers of today relate  to the story and learn from it. Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of my favorite actors. They were even before I saw this film. I have seen it many times since its 1996 release. It is still one of my favorite versions of Romeo + Juliet. I really recommend it ; not just for the acting, but as a thrilling visual as well. The use of color and lighting was amazing too. Props to the director . Good job.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It doesn't work for me,"So this review will probably get a lot of downvotes but hear me out. This is my personal opinion on the movie. I have watched it about five times since 2011. The first time I saw it I was kinda disappointed. The main reason being they kept the original Shakespearean word as dialogue. Back then my movie repertoire was small and limited so my teenage judgement had little value compared to now. Therefore, over the years I have rewatched it multiple times and each time is just as difficult and disappointing. It's just hard to sit through. It's not one of the worst movies ever. It's not utter trash. It's just not as good as it could have been unfortunately. The story isn't bad, the costumes and scenery are solid. That typical Baz visual style (later seen in Moulin Rouge) is really ugly and distracting and it doesn't work for me. The second hour/half of this movie is way better than the first. Mostly because that distinctive visual style is not included. Sometimes when the actors are doing their lines it's not believable. Danes is not the problem here. It's not just her doing it awkwardly, it's almost everyone with few exceptions. The main problem for me is the original dialogue being used. I have always been wanted to like and enjoy this movie but I just can't. I'm sorry.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A visual masterpiece,"This film cannot fail!  It has the timeless story of love, romance, comedy and tragedy, which has been beautifully placed in a modern setting. The dialogue hasn't been altered but the style has been updated incredibly well, making it a stunning film, so pleasing to the eye.Even if you do not like Di Caprio, its hard to deny that he plays the part beautifully and is believable as this starry-eyed young man, so different from his peers.  Danes is also great as Juliet and plays the part with understated strength.  The one thing which I didn't like was the chemistry between them - it could have been more intense.My favourite things about this film were the little details, like the guns belonging to the Montagues and Capulets which bore inscriptions, like 'long sword' on the shot gun.Finally I loved Pete P. as the vicar - especially that wonderful tattoo, just another aspect which feeds the eyes!!See this film, it will restore your faith in romance!*********/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bill Clinton's Shakespeare,"Though it's based on a 400 year old play, this movie is more 90s than Bill Clinton in a pair of Zubaz pants singing Hootie and the Blowfish songs. That's not really a knock so much as an observation.It's certainly visually impressive, and an intriguing and fresh spin on one of Shakespeare's most widely adapted works, but the actors deliver the admittedly tricky dialog with all the eloquence of someone speaking Klingon with a mouthful of mashed potatoes.Like the president himself, I don't know that this Clinton-era adaptation still holds up as something ""cool"", but if it has worked as a gateway to Shakespeare for Gen X then I suppose that's not a bad legacy.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rome's and Jule's,"Luhrmann is without a doubt a genius of a man. One of the most tricky things in bring relics into our current reality is keeping it as authentic as the first day it rolled out onto stage. Shakespeare is no easy man to copy and even more difficult to imitate.DiCaprio wasn't the best choice for Romeo as far as the dialog and acting bits are concerned. Don't get me wrong, he's a great actor, but lacks the ability to play tough when the time comes for it. From what I understand, Romeo was a decent swordsman as the play recalls. However, little action came from the guns portrayed as the weapon of choice to match the time period.Harold Perrineau, who played Mercutio, had a crucial role in this film as the best friend of the dear Romeo and more than anything else, protector of Romeo's dreams. It was an outstanding performance because I truly believed that Mr. Perrineau new the emotions and dialog well enough to portray them realistically.Claire Danes is just an outstanding actress with beauty all around and a more honest approach to the Juliet in this film. It's not easy playing a love interest, but in this movie, it's clear that both DiCaprio and Danes played love interest to each other instead of one or the other.John Leguizamo is an accomplished comedian, so portraying the ever serious and straight forward Tybalt just didn't seem the role for him. I think that Leguizamo is trying to approach all angles of his acting career which takes much talent, but once you're a comedian that stands out, it's difficult to get out of that genre.I'd have given this movie better than an 8 if not for the fact that it was relatively uneventful.

"Stylish and Confusing, But still Beautiful","Alright. This film is something. When I popped it in last week I knew what I was expecting and it surprised even me. This modern, bizarre, beautiful, crazy adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most beloved plays is something of a spectacle. It's a classic romance for MTV's generation X from one of the most electric directors of the last 20 years. And since I'm assuming up you passed a middle school literature/English class ill give slight spoilers.There's a lot for me to talk about in this film. Lets start off with the art style and dialogue. To use Shakespearean English in a modern setting is at 1st kinda off putting. But I grew use to it as the film went on and became immersed in the story. The cinematography is brilliant and gritty like a gang film while having richness and fulfillment of something from renaissance Europe. The acting is pretty good across the board. Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes were pretty great. The said their lines well for young actors and besides a few scenes of over acting were good. ( Romeo pursuing Tybalt to kill him.) Their final scene is powerful and well done. The supporting cast was good to especially,Harold Perrinau (Mercutio), John Leguizamo (Tybalt), and Pete Postlethwaite (""Father Lawrence""). The music was good too and I love Talk Show Host by Radiohead( One of my favorite early songs by them).However film has flaws. Because they use Shakespearean English they are awkward moments in the movie like Romeo's Banishment and the use of guns called swords. The film use of helicopter in the final scene pursuing Romeo proved a tad excessive too. Also the use of News Casters in the beginning and end is also weird.Sometimes u can't take this seriously. And I didn't take this film to seriously. It's one of the most stylized and unique films I've seen. However it kinda fails in comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations, ( See Akira Kurosamwa's Ran) but its a fine film and worthy of being watched.

Colourful neo-modern adaptation,"Much better than the standard retrofit of classic stories. Instead of following the Hollywood norm and creating a new story around Romeo and Juliet, Baz has taken the original and restaged it. The result is an edgy and sometimes powerful movie.Whilst some references (such as weapons) were skilfully modernised, it was sometimes over the top and verged on cheesy. For example, the longsword was somewhat blatant.My main criticism is that the movie still managed to feel slightly Hollywood sanitised. Gore and violence was deliberately toned down to nearly the level of James Bond movies. The inclusion of the graphic display of violence would have made the tragedy much more powerful.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Uneven film, with notable performances","""R+J"", when it works, works very well.  When it doesn't, it's ludicrous.

He hasn't changed; the material he's been offered lately is simply not up to his earlier films), Harold Perrineau Jr., Miriam Margolyes, Pete Postelthwaite, Brian Dennehy, Paul Sorvino (okay, I'm biased in favor of those last two).  Claire Danes, for some reason, doesn't work here; like DiCaprio, she's better than she's usually given credit for, but the usual fire is absent here.  Don't even get me started about John Leguizamo, because he is just plain ludicrous.  Tybalt is supposed to be a badass, and Leguizamo cannot even remotely carry that off.  I kept wondering why Perrineau didn't just stuff him into a locker and be done with it.The movie works best when it underplays and gives the audience a chance to enjoy finely nuanced performances.

Not worth the praise,"While this Baz Luhrmann version of Romeo and Juliet is considered an innovative masterpiece, that changed the medium of film forever, I believe it never should have gotten this much praise, due to the terrible acting, camerawork, editing, and worst of all: plot.The original Shakespeare play did not leave much room for improvement, as the whole premise was entirely frustrating to begin with. The irrationality of the characters - especially the Friar, mixed with the terrible handling of abuse, made an entirely uninteresting and frustrating story to begin with. What would have been nice, is if this movie made the scenario more realistic and compelling. I like what they did, in that they modernised the story, but I think they could have done more, for example, by them questioning the ""love at first sight"" trope, going to school, or doing normal teenager things during that time.What I also found very frustrating about this movie, was that I couldn't understand what the characters where saying. It's hard enough deciphering Shakespearean language, without the music and sound effects being far louder than the voices of the characters. Even when I was following along with the script of the play, I wasn't able to follow what was happening with the fast paced cuts, and loud music overwhelming all my senses.There were some moments, however, with long and tedious scenes, where the acting really got to shine - or rather not shine. This leads me to my next point: the acting was terrible. The actor for Juliet, Claire Dunes, wasn't too bad. She portrayed the innocence of Juliet fairly well, however sometimes it came off as dry and forced. Not, however, as dry and forced as Leonardo DiCaprio's acting. While the actor for Romeo's acting has improved a lot over the years, it really wasn't very good in this movie. His emotions were unrealistic, jumping very quickly, and facial expressions being very exaggerated, and him and Dunes didn't have a lot of chemistry.Overall, the movie was very unique in its take on the original Shakespeare play, and the modernising of the story was a good choice. However, the acting, editing and source material, made it something that I did not enjoy very much.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Teenagers being teenagers,"I was 13 years old when this movie came out, and I had a lot of reasons for swearing it off. One, Shakespeare is what school assigns for homework. Two, when you're 13 years old in 1996, every girl you know or care about is deeply in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, ergo, he is your natural enemy. Three, when you're 13, you're still right on that edge where romance seems a little icky. So ""Romeo & Juliet"" is not exactly a topic of interest.And that's the way it was for... jeeze, 29 years.Turns out this movie kind of rules. Sure, it's so hyper-stylish that it borderlines on campy, but that's why it's so good.

A modern movie with archaic dialogues does not work.,"Changing or using material from Shakespeare always requires courage and maturity. He's just the greatest British playwright of all time. Baz Luhrmann had this courage and much more, in a film that updates the most famous love story ever, bringing it to our time, to a great seaside town. This may displease the purists but its not original. This has happened to other stories by other authors. However, this film has the characteristic of keeping, almost in full, the original dialogues of Shakespeare. I confess that I really enjoyed listening to them, but there is a natural nasty discrepancy between the Renaissance text and the modern environment, they disagree with each other for the most obvious reasons and this damages the film. If the idea was to bring the story to modern times the most natural solution would have been to adapt the dialogues, but if the option were to keep Shakespeare's text untouched, the best would be a period film. Mixing both concepts did not work out.The film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the lead roles. DiCaprio was still enjoying his stage as a ""handsome movie boy"", while Danes was just a beautiful unknown face to a Juliet who wanted to be naive and young. In fact, this actress employed very little in this film beyond her physical beauty, for she always sounded unconvincingly and never really seemed to be in love. The scenarios are quite curious and full of exaggerations. The Capulet house could be the mansion of any new-wealthy businessman, with its tacky décor and kitsch furnishings. These elements are also visible in the family mausoleum, with all the candles and neon crosses. In the middle of all, Danes and DiCaprio stand out for the sobriety of their costumes. Harold Perrineau probably gives us the most controversial performance, turning Mercutio into an African-American transvestite, full of glitter. Pete Postlethwaite did quite well as Father Laurence, as Miriam Margoyles in the maid role. The soundtrack wisely uses some pieces of classical music, but this doesn't harmonize with the modern pieces that were used as well.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
